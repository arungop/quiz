Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:42:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday celebrated the establishment of the country’s 58th and Madhya Pradesh’s ninth Tiger Reserve, reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to wildlife protection and environmental conservation.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “Amazing news for wildlife lovers! India is blessed with wildlife diversity and a culture that celebrates wildlife. We will always be at the forefront of protecting animals and contributing to a sustainable planet.”
He also shared a post by Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who hailed the creation of the new Tiger Reserve.
“58th roar and counting! With historic emphasis laid on restoring the ecological diversity on planet Earth by PM Shri Narendra Modi ji, India continues to make great strides in environmental protection and wildlife conservation,” Yadav wrote.
“Thrilled to announce that the country has added the 58th Tiger Reserve to its tally with the latest entrant being Madhya Pradesh’s Madhav Tiger Reserve. This is MP’s 9th Tiger Reserve,” he added.
Yadav praised forest officials for their dedicated efforts, stating, “I congratulate all wildlife lovers and conservationists. The development is a testament to the relentless efforts of our forest officials who are selflessly working towards the cause.”
The newly designated Madhav Tiger Reserve is located in Shivpuri district in the Gwalior-Chambal region. It covers 1,751 square kilometres, with a core area of 375 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 1,276 square kilometres.
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, while speaking on Wednesday, emphasised the state’s continued commitment to wildlife conservation.
“Madhya Pradesh has not only retained the title of ‘Tiger State’ for having the highest number of tigers but is also taking progressive steps in the wildlife and tourism sector. With the addition of Madhav National Park, we now have nine Tiger Reserves in the state,” CM Yadav said.
He also congratulated the people of Madhya Pradesh for this achievement, calling it a proud moment for the state.
The newly added Madhav Tiger Reserve follows the recent designation of Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary, located between Bhopal and Raisen districts, as the state’s eighth Tiger Reserve.

Title: India, EU to hold next round of trade talks on March 10
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:39:09 +0000
Content: India and the European Union are scheduled to begin the next round of talks for a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) from Monday in Brussels with the aim of concluding the talks by the end of this year, a senior official said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had agreed to expedite the conclusion of the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of the year at their meeting in Delhi last month.
“A free trade agreement between the EU and India would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world. I am well aware it will not be easy. But I also know that timing and determination count and that this partnership comes at the right moment for both of us,” Von der Leyen, said during her two-day visit to India.
Her statement came in the backdrop of massive tariff hikes proposed against all countries by US President Donald Trump under his ‘America First’ policy which is threatening to disrupt global trade and heighten uncertainty in the global economy.
PM Modi and the European Commission President committed to task their respective negotiating teams to pursue negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, and mutually beneficial FTA. Officials were asked to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers. They were also tasked to advance negotiations on an Agreement on Investment Protection and an Agreement on Geographical Indications.
Reaching a deal will be complex, however, with significant concessions wanted on both sides in areas ranging from cars and whisky to pharmaceuticals and textiles.
The EU wants India to lower tariffs on cars, wine, and whisky as well as some agricultural products. India, on the other hand, wants greater market access and lower tariffs for key exports, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, and apparel.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for 124 billion euros of trade in goods in 2023, or 12.2 per cent of total Indian trade. Trade in services between the EU and India reached nearly 60 billion euros in 2023, almost double the level in 2020. A third of that were digital services, according to figures compiled by the World Economic Forum.
The US and China account for 10.8 per cent and 10.5 per cent of total Indian trade, respectively. India, meanwhile, is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.2 per cent of the bloc’s trade, WEF figures show.
Trade between India and the EU has grown by around 90 per cent in the past decade, but talks over a free trade pact have stalled over the years due to sharp differences between India and the 27-nation bloc on agriculture, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Title: Iran will not negotiate under US ‘bullying’, Supreme Leader says
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:50:48 +0000
Content: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Iran will not be bullied into negotiations, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the country’s top authority urging Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal.
In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal” to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
At a meeting with senior Iranian officials, Khamenei said Washington’s aim was to “impose their own expectations,” Iranian state media reported.
“The insistence of some bullying governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues. … Talks for them is a pathway to have new demands, it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. … Iran will definitely not accept their expectations,” Khamenei was quoted as saying, without directly mentioning Trump.
In response to Khamenei’s comments, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated almost word for word the choice of negotiations or military action that Trump said he had presented to Iran.
“We hope the Iran Regime puts its people and best interests ahead of terror,” Hughes said in a statement.
While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” campaign that was applied during his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero.
During his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that had placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits.
U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said that time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade.
Tehran says its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes.
Khamenei, who has the last say on Iran’s key policies, said there was “no other way to stand against coercion and bullying”.
“They are bringing up new demands that certainly will not be accepted by Iran, like our defence capabilities, missile range and international influence,” he was quoted as saying.
Although Tehran says its ballistic missile programme is purely defensive, it is seen in the West as a destabilising factor in a volatile, conflict-ridden Middle East.
Tehran has in recent months announced new additions to its conventional weaponry, such as its first drone carrier and an underground naval base amid rising tensions with the U.S. and Israel.

Title: The Future of Healthcare: CIMR’s Research on Yoga as a Medical Therapy
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:40:16 +0000
Content: The Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research (CIMR) at AIIMS, New Delhi, is hosting its first international conference on ‘Advances in Integrative Medicine.’ This two-day event has convened experts from around the world to examine the synergy between traditional healing practices and modern medical science for improved healthcare outcomes. Since its establishment in 2016, CIMR has been a leading institution in integrative medicine research, particularly in validating the efficacy of yoga as a therapeutic intervention for neurological and cardiac conditions.
The conference focuses on the increasing acceptance of yoga as a credible and cost-effective therapy for neurological and cardiac conditions. Over the past eight years, CIMR has collaborated with 20 departments at AIIMS, conducting extensive research on the medical benefits of yoga. Their studies have been published in leading scientific journals, drawing interest from global medical communities.
During the conference, Dr. Gautam Sharma, Founder Professor in-charge of CIMR, shared significant findings on yoga’s health benefits. According to CIMR’s research, yoga has been scientifically proven to ease migraines, reduce episodes of syncope (temporary loss of consciousness due to a drop in blood pressure), and support heart health.
Dr. Sharma stated that their studies show yoga’s effectiveness as an add-on therapy, improving patients’ quality of life. Speaking with DD News, he explained, “We found that yoga reduced the severity of migraines in patients and significantly decreased syncope episodes in individuals who practiced yoga regularly.”
CIMR’s research has received recognition from prestigious global scientific organisations. Dr. Sharma was invited by the European Society of Cardiology to present CIMR’s findings on yoga’s role as a therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the American Heart Rhythm Society and the European Society of Cardiology have expressed keen interest in exploring yoga-based treatments further.
One of CIMR’s studies focused on the economic burden of vaso-vagal syncope, a condition where a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leads to fainting. A past study from the United States estimated that approximately 740,000 emergency visits and 460,000 hospital admissions occur annually due to vaso-vagal syncope, resulting in high financial costs.
CIMR’s research found that integrating yoga into treatment plans significantly reduced the occurrence of syncopal and pre-syncopal events. When combined with medical treatment, yoga proved to be more effective than medication alone. This suggests that yoga could serve as a cost-effective and safe alternative for managing syncope, potentially lowering the financial burden on healthcare systems.
CIMR’s research underscores the potential of yoga as a valuable addition to conventional medical treatments, particularly in managing syncope and other neurological and cardiac conditions. By integrating yoga into treatment plans, healthcare providers can offer a cost-effective, safe, and scientifically supported therapy that enhances patient outcomes. The first international conference on integrative medicine at AIIMS represents a pivotal moment in advancing holistic healthcare, fostering collaboration between traditional and modern medical sciences. With increasing global recognition and scientific validation, yoga is steadily emerging as a key component of contemporary healthcare, paving the way for a more integrative and patient-centered approach to medicine.

Title: Ensure adequate security to places of worship: India on Hindu temple vandalism in US
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:26:06 +0000
Content: India has condemned the vandalism at a Hindu temple in California, US, and called upon law enforcement authorities to take strict action against those responsible.
Terming such acts “despicable”, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday that the local authorities should ensure adequate security to places of worship.
Responding to media queries regarding vandalism at a Hindu Temple in California, Jaiswal said in a statement, “We have seen reports regarding the vandalism at a Hindu temple in Chino Hills, California. We condemn such despicable acts in the strongest terms. We call upon the local law enforcement authorities to take stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and also ensure adequate security to places of worship.”
A BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, one of the largest Hindu temples, located in Chino Hills, California, was vandalised with “anti-India” messages.
The official page of BAPS for the US shared the details of the incident on the social media platform X, saying that they will “never let hate take root” and that peace and compassion shall prevail.
In the X post, BAPS Public Affairs wrote, “In the face of another Mandir desecration, this time in Chino Hills, CA, the Hindu community stand steadfast against hate. Together with the community in Chino Hills and Southern California, we will never let hate take root. Our common humanity and faith will ensure that peace and compassion prevail.”
The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) also shared details of the incident on X and said the desecration of the iconic BAPS Temple in California comes ahead of the “so called Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles.
The ‘anti-Hindu’ messages included phrases such as ‘Hindus go back,’ alarming the local Hindu community.
In response, the community expressed its commitment to stand united. “Another Hindu Temple vandalised – this time the iconic BAPS temple in Chino Hills, CA. It’s just another day in a world where media and academics will insist there is no anti-Hindu hate and that #Hinduphobia is just a construct of our imagination. Not surprising this happens as the day for a so called “Khalistan referendum” in LA draws close.”
The post listed other recent cases of vandalism of temples from 2022 onward and gave a call for investigation into the matter.
The latest incident occurred less than 10 days after a similar incident at the BAPS Mandir in New York.

Title: Why Canada is jailing more Indigenous people despite Trudeau’s promises
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:01:25 +0000
Content: Like a growing number of formerly incarcerated Indigenous people, Marvin Starblanket’s life is still governed by Correctional Service Canada rules.
They determine where he sleeps (a halfway house instead of at home with his partner and children), when he clocks in for the night (10 p.m.), whether he drinks alcohol (he is prohibited), and the job he pursues.
The rules did not stop Starblanket, who is 42, from getting a pair of gray-scale tattoos on the backs of his hands: “Good” on the right, in curly script set against bars of heavenly light; and “Evil,” against a smokily stylized skull, on the left.
“Who wins?” he muses. “Depends which one you feed.”
Starblanket, a member of the Mistawasis First Nation, has led a life shaped by crime and substance use. He’s nearing the halfway point of a five-year supervisory order imposed after his most recent prison stint – just under six years for the hold-up of a convenience store with a Taser.
When Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office a decade ago, he pledged “a total renewal of the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples.” His Liberal Party committed to implementing recommendations from a government commission, which included eliminating within 10 years the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody.
With Trudeau due to step down as Liberal leader on Sunday, that overrepresentation has worsened. Indigenous people, who comprise 5% of Canada’s population, account for about one-third of federal inmates – compared to just over one-fifth in 2015.

High rates of Indigenous imprisonment are a problem in several Western nations. In the United States, Indigenous people are incarcerated at double the rate of Americans overall, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit think tank. In Australia, incarceration rates are 15 times higher for aboriginal peoples.
In Canada, the problem has defied attempts by the Liberal government to address it.
For this story, Reuters spoke to 50 people involved in Canada’s criminal justice system – lawyers, advocates, prison staff and former prisoners. They pointed to the imposition of post-release conditions on Indigenous people, a higher rate of parole denials and the use of mandatory minimum sentences, as playing an important part in their rising rates of incarceration.
The sharply higher supervision orders that Reuters is reporting for the first time were four times the rate of increase for white people.
Previously unreported Correctional Service data, obtained by Reuters through a freedom-of-information request, showed the number of Indigenous people in Canada subject to these strict conditions once they have completed prison sentences rose 53% during the decade ending in 2023-2024.
Trudeau’s office and Canada’s justice ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In 2022, Trudeau’s government repealed mandatory minimum sentences for some drug and weapons offenses, though they remain for other crimes.
Long-term supervision orders in Canada are meant to address rare cases of people who pose a risk to the public. Similar measures are used in the United States and United Kingdom, where they are generally used for sex offenders.
Some experts and former prisoners, including Starblanket, recognize there are benefits to such oversight.
“The longer periods of supervision bring with them more resources” such as drug treatment and psychological counselling, said Shabehram Lohrasbe, a doctor who assesses people in the criminal justice system, including those being considered for dangerous or long-term offender designations. But if they breach any of their conditions, or are seen as a risk, “he’s back in the can,” Lohrasbe said.
‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’
Lawyers and advocates told Reuters that Indigenous people may be seen as riskier because of higher rates of poverty, instability and untreated mental illness and disabilities; they may also be more prone, because of these factors, to build up lengthy rap sheets of less-serious violent offenses.
Indigenous people account for over a third of Canadian prisoners under such supervision orders, 328 out of 959 people, the data showed – slightly above their share of the prison population.

Once released under supervision orders, Indigenous people may struggle to stick to conditions because of “socioeconomic gaps,” such as high rates of unemployment in their communities, homelessness, substance use and past trauma, according to Leonard Marchand, Chief Justice of British Columbia and a member of the Okanagan Indian Band.
The Correctional Service data showed Indigenous people are overrepresented among those breaching the conditions of long-term supervision orders, putting them at greater risk of returning to jail. The bar for reincarceration is low: a former offender under a supervision order may be sent back to prison for 90 days if their parole officer believes they pose an “unmanageable risk” to the community.
“It kind of sets up an opportunity where you served your time but you’re still not free,” said lawyer Rob Dhanu, who has dealt with many such cases.
Advocates say better risk assessments that consider social circumstances could help steer Indigenous people away from supervision, and easier access to psychological treatment and Indigenous cultural programs might keep them from falling back into crime or substance use.
“We need to look at what works and what doesn’t work,” said Jonathan Rudin, program director of Aboriginal Legal Services, a service provider. “And jail, generally, has not worked for Indigenous people.”
Indigenous people are more likely to be incarcerated at every stage of their encounter with the criminal justice system, the data show. Before trial, they are more likely to be denied bail; and on conviction, they are more likely to be held in maximum security units – where there is limited access to rehabilitative programs that are often a prerequisite to gaining parole.
Indigenous people are more likely than white people to be denied full parole – even when their parole officer recommends it, according to Parole Board of Canada data obtained through a freedom-of-information request and analyzed by Reuters with the help of University of Toronto criminologist Anthony Doob.

Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Gary Anandasangaree acknowledged Canada has an Indigenous incarceration problem.
“There’s more than sufficient evidence to suggest that there is systemic racism within the correctional institutions, as well as the criminal justice system, that have often led to over-incarceration of Indigenous people,” he told Reuters. He cited the government’s work to eliminate some mandatory minimum sentences and said the justice system needed to give more weight to Indigenous offenders’ health needs and social history.
The opposition Conservative party, in a tightening race with Liberals ahead of a federal election this year, has adopted a hard line on crime. It has pledged to keep “violent criminals where they belong – behind bars,” Larry Brock, Shadow Minister for Justice and Attorney General, said in a statement to Reuters.
Brock did not comment on the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in prison. But he noted that Indigenous people themselves are often the victims of crime.
HISTORY OF TRAUMA
More than 30 lawyers, advocates and judges said that poverty and inter-generational trauma – when damaging events visited on one person transfer to their descendants and then snowball – stack the deck against Indigenous people.
Starblanket was five when his father died by suicide in police custody. Around the same time, according to court documents, Starblanket was abused by a male relative.
He was seven when he and his four siblings were taken into foster care after his mother, who was doing sex work at the time, was jailed for the manslaughter of a violent client, according to court transcripts. She was eventually pardoned.
Starblanket shuttled between his mother’s place and 15 foster homes in the Saskatoon and Regina areas, according to testimony in the court record.
Starblanket’s mother Beverley Johnston said she apologized to her children for what they went through.
“I felt bad for them that they ended up in foster,” she told Reuters.
A Statistics Canada study published last month found higher rates of physical and mental illness, economic hardship and homelessness among Indigenous people who spent time in government care as children. Indigenous children comprise more than half of all children in foster care in Canada.
At 16, Starblanket was criminally charged for the first time with robbery and assault after following his victim off a bus and heading-butting him twice, according to court documents. “I committed a senseless crime,” he says.
He was sentenced in 1999 to 13 months in custody.
Four days before Starblanket was sentenced, Canada’s Supreme Court issued a decision declaring the mass incarceration of Indigenous people “a crisis.” It urged the judicial system to take Indigenous people’s circumstances into account, including substance use or family breakdown.
Starblanket’s sentence was the first of 23 violent convictions, mostly for robberies and assault, many when he was drunk or using meth or cocaine, according to court records. He was convicted of punching his mother; biting and attempting to strangle a former partner; cutting a woman’s chin with a broken beer bottle; punching a hotel clerk; robbing two teens of $16.50.
In 2014, he and a woman were convicted of robbing a convenience store and threatening the clerk with a Taser, according to court records.
Three years later, Starblanket, then in prison, was designated a dangerous offender – someone who could be imprisoned indefinitely. The ruling cited a pattern of violent behavior and “a likelihood of causing injury or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons.”
Marchand, the Chief Justice of British Columbia, said the standardized risk assessments used in dangerous offender decisions factor in prior convictions and substance use, but do not account for the circumstances of Indigenous people. He did not comment on Starblanket’s case.
RELEASE
Starblanket’s lawyer, Mike Nolin, appealed the dangerous offender designation and in 2019 the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled the sentencing judge did not adequately consider the possibility of treating Starblanket for substance use and antisocial personality disorder. The dangerous offender designation was overturned.
Starblanket was released from prison in 2022 – but placed under a five-year supervision order.
After his release, Starblanket moved in with his partner under orders not to drink or do drugs, to attend treatment, and not to travel. The couple’s child, Anastasia, turns two on April 1.
Fourteen months into his long-term supervision order came what Starblanket calls “the slip”: He did meth.
He told his parole officer, knowing he would fail a drug test. His parole officer ordered him to move to the halfway house – a facility providing housing, meals and some services for people on day parole or supervision orders. Starblanket is required to check in three times a day.
For Starblanket, the restrictions grate – especially not being able to live at home with his family. But he also says he sees the support they can provide. He worries about how he will adjust when his long-term supervision order is up in November 2027. Above all, he wants to rebuild his life and avoid a return to prison.
“I don’t want to be asking for permission forever,” Starblanket said. “And I won’t be.”
Once free, he wants to go to university to study psychology, he said. He says he wants to be a voice for other Indigenous people caught up in the justice system. Maybe run a halfway house himself someday.

Title: US drops bid to make Google sell AI investments in antitrust case
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 05:39:23 +0000
Content: The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday dropped a proposal to force Alphabet’s Google GOOGL.O to sell its investments in artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI competitor Anthropic, to boost competition in online search.
The DOJ and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general still seek a court order requiring Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures aimed at addressing what a judge said was Google’s illegal search monopoly, according to court papers filed in Washington.
“The American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and ‘free’ online services. These values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist,” prosecutors wrote.
A spokesperson for Google said the “sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security.”
A spokesperson for Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Donald Trump has said he would continue a crackdown on Big Tech, which began during his first term and continued into former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump has tapped veteran antitrust attorney Gail Slater to lead the DOJ’s efforts.
Google holds a minority stake worth billions of dollars in Anthropic. Losing the investment would hand a competitive advantage to OpenAI and its partner Microsoft MSFT.O, Anthropic wrote to the court in February.
Evidence prosecutors obtained since making their draft recommendation in November showed a risk that banning Google from AI investments “could cause unintended consequences in the evolving AI space,” they said in the final proposal on Friday. They asked that Google be required to give prior notice to the government about future investments in generative AI.
Google, which has said it will appeal, has made its own proposal that would loosen agreements with Apple AAPL.O and others to set Google as the default search engine on new devices. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April.
The blockbuster case is one of several U.S. antitrust cases against Big Tech companies. Apple, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O also face allegations of maintaining illegal monopolies in their respective markets.
Since Trump’s reelection, Google has sought to make the case that the DOJ’s approach in the case would hobble the company’s ability to compete in AI and “jeopardize America’s global economic and technological leadership.”
Many of the measures prosecutors proposed in November remain intact with a few tweaks.
For example, a requirement that Google share search query data with competitors now says that Google can charge a marginal fee for access and that the competitors must not pose a national security risk.
The proposal drew statements of support from Democratic and Republican attorneys general as well as the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.

Title: Making up for many things we could & should have done earlier says EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:40:33 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Saturday inaugurated a new Consulate General of India in Manchester, the United Kingdom, and said that “India was making up for many things that perhaps the country could and should have done earlier”.
He also said that the opening of Consulate General in Manchester was symbolic of the importance of the growing diaspora in the region and a sign of things to come, including an India-UK Free Trade Agreement.
The EAM said it was apt that Vishakha Yaduvanshi takes over her role as India’s newest Consul General on International Women’s Day, reflective of the strides the government has made in putting women’s issues at the centre of policy.
Speaking to IANS at the occasion, EAM Jaishankar said, “I completely agree that nothing could be more fitting than for a Consul General to inaugurate her consulate on this day. So it wasn’t just in time; we actually got the day right. Let me reflect for a moment on what this occasion really means to us. In some ways, it’s about the past—we are making up for many things that perhaps we could and should have done earlier…”
He also said, “Now, already, I can see, you know, Manchester is hugely invested in India and the other way around. I’m told that the trade with this region is about 700 million pounds, that there are 300, more than perhaps 300 Indian firms here…”
The EAM said, “Today, when we look at where that approach has taken us, a few years ago or two years ago, to be precise, we held the G20 presidency. We undertook a number of initiatives, and it was a particularly challenging presidency at that time. The world was highly polarised, and people were unwilling to sit together. However, among our achievements, aside from securing the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20, one of our proudest was the adoption of the concept of women-led development by the G20…”
In a post on social media platform X, the EAM wrote: “Very pleased to inaugurate our 4th Consulate in the UK, in Manchester. Thanks Deputy PM@AngelaRayner, Minister @CatherineWest1, Deputy Mayor Paul Dennett and MP @NavPMishra for joining us.”
In another X post, EAM Jaishankar said: “Good to meet Deputy PM @AngelaRayner today in Manchester. Her encouragement has been a contribution to setting up of our Consulate. Also discussed India-UK bilateral ties and our efforts on increasing trade and people-to-people exchanges. This step delivers on the longstanding desire of our community and friends of India in Manchester. Confident that this latest addition to our presence in the UK will strengthen people to people, cultural, trade and, of course, cricket ties.”
The EAM followed up the official opening of the consulate building in Stockport, Greater Manchester, with a celebratory diaspora reception at the Old Trafford stadium, where he interacted with members of the Lancashire Cricket Club’s women’s team members before they leave for Bengaluru for a pre-season tour next week.
“My first visit to Manchester here today, in a formal way, is an acknowledgement of how much this relationship has matured in the last four decades,” said EAM Jaishankar.
“But and I want to say this with great emphasis, it is equally a preparation for what is to come – a much deeper, closer partnership between India and the United Kingdom. Clearly, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is very much at the heart of that in the near term.”
“But we look at a Free Trade Agreement not simply as a trade or even investment understanding between us, but as something much bigger, really a game changer, symbolic shift to a higher orbit of relationship,” he said.
The Union Minister said he wanted to “applaud” the contribution of the Indian community in building the relationship be…

Title: Gill Confident as India Prepare for Champions Trophy Final
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:32:20 +0000
Content: Indian Cricket team’s vice-captain Shubman Gill expressed optimism about his team’s chances in the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, scheduled for tomorrow at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Saturday, Gill emphasized that India’s T20 World Cup victory in 2024 has removed some pressure from the squad as they approach another major final.
“Winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry, but I think it kind of makes us more balanced,” Gill told reporters. “Yes, we have won an ICC title, and we’ll try to do our best to win this one.”
The 25-year-old batter, who is in his second ICC tournament final with India after the 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia, highlighted the importance of managing pressure in crucial matches.
“The pressure of big matches is definitely there,” Gill acknowledged. “In such matches, the team that handles the pressure well, that takes out the occasion and doesn’t think that we’re playing the final, their chances of winning are better.”
Gill praised the current Indian batting lineup as the best he has been part of, featuring cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli at the top of the order.
“Rohit and Virat are all-time one-day greats in the world,” he said. “Rohit is one of the best openers in white ball cricket. And Virat is one of the best ODI batsmen ever.”
The vice-captain also emphasized the crucial role experienced players like Kohli played in India’s victory in the semifinal. “We saw Virat in the last match because he has played so many important matches for India, played so many finals, so many semi-finals,” Gill noted. “The more you are in that situation and the more you have handled the pressure, you know that you have already done this.”
Gill dismissed concerns about captain Rohit Sharma’s recent streak of losing tosses, stating that the team is always prepared regardless of whether they bat or bowl first. He also rejected speculation about Sharma’s retirement after the tournament, saying, “He has not spoken to me or to the team about this decision. I don’t think Rohit is thinking about it.”
When asked about pitch conditions for the final, Gill expressed confidence in the team’s adaptability. “We haven’t really seen a 300 score here as yet,” he said. “I think we as a team have got a good idea of how to play on those kind of wickets and how to bowl on those kinds of wickets.”
India will face New Zealand in the final on Sunday, having already defeated them earlier in the tournament. A victory would give India their second consecutive ICC trophy following last year’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies.
