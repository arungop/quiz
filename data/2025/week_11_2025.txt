Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:42:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday celebrated the establishment of the country’s 58th and Madhya Pradesh’s ninth Tiger Reserve, reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to wildlife protection and environmental conservation.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “Amazing news for wildlife lovers! India is blessed with wildlife diversity and a culture that celebrates wildlife. We will always be at the forefront of protecting animals and contributing to a sustainable planet.”
He also shared a post by Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who hailed the creation of the new Tiger Reserve.
“58th roar and counting! With historic emphasis laid on restoring the ecological diversity on planet Earth by PM Shri Narendra Modi ji, India continues to make great strides in environmental protection and wildlife conservation,” Yadav wrote.
“Thrilled to announce that the country has added the 58th Tiger Reserve to its tally with the latest entrant being Madhya Pradesh’s Madhav Tiger Reserve. This is MP’s 9th Tiger Reserve,” he added.
Yadav praised forest officials for their dedicated efforts, stating, “I congratulate all wildlife lovers and conservationists. The development is a testament to the relentless efforts of our forest officials who are selflessly working towards the cause.”
The newly designated Madhav Tiger Reserve is located in Shivpuri district in the Gwalior-Chambal region. It covers 1,751 square kilometres, with a core area of 375 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 1,276 square kilometres.
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, while speaking on Wednesday, emphasised the state’s continued commitment to wildlife conservation.
“Madhya Pradesh has not only retained the title of ‘Tiger State’ for having the highest number of tigers but is also taking progressive steps in the wildlife and tourism sector. With the addition of Madhav National Park, we now have nine Tiger Reserves in the state,” CM Yadav said.
He also congratulated the people of Madhya Pradesh for this achievement, calling it a proud moment for the state.
The newly added Madhav Tiger Reserve follows the recent designation of Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary, located between Bhopal and Raisen districts, as the state’s eighth Tiger Reserve.

Title: India, EU to hold next round of trade talks on March 10
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:39:09 +0000
Content: India and the European Union are scheduled to begin the next round of talks for a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) from Monday in Brussels with the aim of concluding the talks by the end of this year, a senior official said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had agreed to expedite the conclusion of the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of the year at their meeting in Delhi last month.
“A free trade agreement between the EU and India would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world. I am well aware it will not be easy. But I also know that timing and determination count and that this partnership comes at the right moment for both of us,” Von der Leyen, said during her two-day visit to India.
Her statement came in the backdrop of massive tariff hikes proposed against all countries by US President Donald Trump under his ‘America First’ policy which is threatening to disrupt global trade and heighten uncertainty in the global economy.
PM Modi and the European Commission President committed to task their respective negotiating teams to pursue negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, and mutually beneficial FTA. Officials were asked to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers. They were also tasked to advance negotiations on an Agreement on Investment Protection and an Agreement on Geographical Indications.
Reaching a deal will be complex, however, with significant concessions wanted on both sides in areas ranging from cars and whisky to pharmaceuticals and textiles.
The EU wants India to lower tariffs on cars, wine, and whisky as well as some agricultural products. India, on the other hand, wants greater market access and lower tariffs for key exports, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, and apparel.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for 124 billion euros of trade in goods in 2023, or 12.2 per cent of total Indian trade. Trade in services between the EU and India reached nearly 60 billion euros in 2023, almost double the level in 2020. A third of that were digital services, according to figures compiled by the World Economic Forum.
The US and China account for 10.8 per cent and 10.5 per cent of total Indian trade, respectively. India, meanwhile, is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.2 per cent of the bloc’s trade, WEF figures show.
Trade between India and the EU has grown by around 90 per cent in the past decade, but talks over a free trade pact have stalled over the years due to sharp differences between India and the 27-nation bloc on agriculture, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Title: Iran will not negotiate under US ‘bullying’, Supreme Leader says
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:50:48 +0000
Content: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Iran will not be bullied into negotiations, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the country’s top authority urging Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal.
In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal” to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
At a meeting with senior Iranian officials, Khamenei said Washington’s aim was to “impose their own expectations,” Iranian state media reported.
“The insistence of some bullying governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues. … Talks for them is a pathway to have new demands, it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. … Iran will definitely not accept their expectations,” Khamenei was quoted as saying, without directly mentioning Trump.
In response to Khamenei’s comments, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated almost word for word the choice of negotiations or military action that Trump said he had presented to Iran.
“We hope the Iran Regime puts its people and best interests ahead of terror,” Hughes said in a statement.
While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” campaign that was applied during his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero.
During his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that had placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits.
U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said that time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade.
Tehran says its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes.
Khamenei, who has the last say on Iran’s key policies, said there was “no other way to stand against coercion and bullying”.
“They are bringing up new demands that certainly will not be accepted by Iran, like our defence capabilities, missile range and international influence,” he was quoted as saying.
Although Tehran says its ballistic missile programme is purely defensive, it is seen in the West as a destabilising factor in a volatile, conflict-ridden Middle East.
Tehran has in recent months announced new additions to its conventional weaponry, such as its first drone carrier and an underground naval base amid rising tensions with the U.S. and Israel.

Title: The Future of Healthcare: CIMR’s Research on Yoga as a Medical Therapy
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:40:16 +0000
Content: The Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research (CIMR) at AIIMS, New Delhi, is hosting its first international conference on ‘Advances in Integrative Medicine.’ This two-day event has convened experts from around the world to examine the synergy between traditional healing practices and modern medical science for improved healthcare outcomes. Since its establishment in 2016, CIMR has been a leading institution in integrative medicine research, particularly in validating the efficacy of yoga as a therapeutic intervention for neurological and cardiac conditions.
The conference focuses on the increasing acceptance of yoga as a credible and cost-effective therapy for neurological and cardiac conditions. Over the past eight years, CIMR has collaborated with 20 departments at AIIMS, conducting extensive research on the medical benefits of yoga. Their studies have been published in leading scientific journals, drawing interest from global medical communities.
During the conference, Dr. Gautam Sharma, Founder Professor in-charge of CIMR, shared significant findings on yoga’s health benefits. According to CIMR’s research, yoga has been scientifically proven to ease migraines, reduce episodes of syncope (temporary loss of consciousness due to a drop in blood pressure), and support heart health.
Dr. Sharma stated that their studies show yoga’s effectiveness as an add-on therapy, improving patients’ quality of life. Speaking with DD News, he explained, “We found that yoga reduced the severity of migraines in patients and significantly decreased syncope episodes in individuals who practiced yoga regularly.”
CIMR’s research has received recognition from prestigious global scientific organisations. Dr. Sharma was invited by the European Society of Cardiology to present CIMR’s findings on yoga’s role as a therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the American Heart Rhythm Society and the European Society of Cardiology have expressed keen interest in exploring yoga-based treatments further.
One of CIMR’s studies focused on the economic burden of vaso-vagal syncope, a condition where a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leads to fainting. A past study from the United States estimated that approximately 740,000 emergency visits and 460,000 hospital admissions occur annually due to vaso-vagal syncope, resulting in high financial costs.
CIMR’s research found that integrating yoga into treatment plans significantly reduced the occurrence of syncopal and pre-syncopal events. When combined with medical treatment, yoga proved to be more effective than medication alone. This suggests that yoga could serve as a cost-effective and safe alternative for managing syncope, potentially lowering the financial burden on healthcare systems.
CIMR’s research underscores the potential of yoga as a valuable addition to conventional medical treatments, particularly in managing syncope and other neurological and cardiac conditions. By integrating yoga into treatment plans, healthcare providers can offer a cost-effective, safe, and scientifically supported therapy that enhances patient outcomes. The first international conference on integrative medicine at AIIMS represents a pivotal moment in advancing holistic healthcare, fostering collaboration between traditional and modern medical sciences. With increasing global recognition and scientific validation, yoga is steadily emerging as a key component of contemporary healthcare, paving the way for a more integrative and patient-centered approach to medicine.

Title: Ensure adequate security to places of worship: India on Hindu temple vandalism in US
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:26:06 +0000
Content: India has condemned the vandalism at a Hindu temple in California, US, and called upon law enforcement authorities to take strict action against those responsible.
Terming such acts “despicable”, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday that the local authorities should ensure adequate security to places of worship.
Responding to media queries regarding vandalism at a Hindu Temple in California, Jaiswal said in a statement, “We have seen reports regarding the vandalism at a Hindu temple in Chino Hills, California. We condemn such despicable acts in the strongest terms. We call upon the local law enforcement authorities to take stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and also ensure adequate security to places of worship.”
A BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, one of the largest Hindu temples, located in Chino Hills, California, was vandalised with “anti-India” messages.
The official page of BAPS for the US shared the details of the incident on the social media platform X, saying that they will “never let hate take root” and that peace and compassion shall prevail.
In the X post, BAPS Public Affairs wrote, “In the face of another Mandir desecration, this time in Chino Hills, CA, the Hindu community stand steadfast against hate. Together with the community in Chino Hills and Southern California, we will never let hate take root. Our common humanity and faith will ensure that peace and compassion prevail.”
The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) also shared details of the incident on X and said the desecration of the iconic BAPS Temple in California comes ahead of the “so called Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles.
The ‘anti-Hindu’ messages included phrases such as ‘Hindus go back,’ alarming the local Hindu community.
In response, the community expressed its commitment to stand united. “Another Hindu Temple vandalised – this time the iconic BAPS temple in Chino Hills, CA. It’s just another day in a world where media and academics will insist there is no anti-Hindu hate and that #Hinduphobia is just a construct of our imagination. Not surprising this happens as the day for a so called “Khalistan referendum” in LA draws close.”
The post listed other recent cases of vandalism of temples from 2022 onward and gave a call for investigation into the matter.
The latest incident occurred less than 10 days after a similar incident at the BAPS Mandir in New York.

Title: Why Canada is jailing more Indigenous people despite Trudeau’s promises
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:01:25 +0000
Content: Like a growing number of formerly incarcerated Indigenous people, Marvin Starblanket’s life is still governed by Correctional Service Canada rules.
They determine where he sleeps (a halfway house instead of at home with his partner and children), when he clocks in for the night (10 p.m.), whether he drinks alcohol (he is prohibited), and the job he pursues.
The rules did not stop Starblanket, who is 42, from getting a pair of gray-scale tattoos on the backs of his hands: “Good” on the right, in curly script set against bars of heavenly light; and “Evil,” against a smokily stylized skull, on the left.
“Who wins?” he muses. “Depends which one you feed.”
Starblanket, a member of the Mistawasis First Nation, has led a life shaped by crime and substance use. He’s nearing the halfway point of a five-year supervisory order imposed after his most recent prison stint – just under six years for the hold-up of a convenience store with a Taser.
When Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office a decade ago, he pledged “a total renewal of the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples.” His Liberal Party committed to implementing recommendations from a government commission, which included eliminating within 10 years the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody.
With Trudeau due to step down as Liberal leader on Sunday, that overrepresentation has worsened. Indigenous people, who comprise 5% of Canada’s population, account for about one-third of federal inmates – compared to just over one-fifth in 2015.

High rates of Indigenous imprisonment are a problem in several Western nations. In the United States, Indigenous people are incarcerated at double the rate of Americans overall, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit think tank. In Australia, incarceration rates are 15 times higher for aboriginal peoples.
In Canada, the problem has defied attempts by the Liberal government to address it.
For this story, Reuters spoke to 50 people involved in Canada’s criminal justice system – lawyers, advocates, prison staff and former prisoners. They pointed to the imposition of post-release conditions on Indigenous people, a higher rate of parole denials and the use of mandatory minimum sentences, as playing an important part in their rising rates of incarceration.
The sharply higher supervision orders that Reuters is reporting for the first time were four times the rate of increase for white people.
Previously unreported Correctional Service data, obtained by Reuters through a freedom-of-information request, showed the number of Indigenous people in Canada subject to these strict conditions once they have completed prison sentences rose 53% during the decade ending in 2023-2024.
Trudeau’s office and Canada’s justice ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In 2022, Trudeau’s government repealed mandatory minimum sentences for some drug and weapons offenses, though they remain for other crimes.
Long-term supervision orders in Canada are meant to address rare cases of people who pose a risk to the public. Similar measures are used in the United States and United Kingdom, where they are generally used for sex offenders.
Some experts and former prisoners, including Starblanket, recognize there are benefits to such oversight.
“The longer periods of supervision bring with them more resources” such as drug treatment and psychological counselling, said Shabehram Lohrasbe, a doctor who assesses people in the criminal justice system, including those being considered for dangerous or long-term offender designations. But if they breach any of their conditions, or are seen as a risk, “he’s back in the can,” Lohrasbe said.
‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’
Lawyers and advocates told Reuters that Indigenous people may be seen as riskier because of higher rates of poverty, instability and untreated mental illness and disabilities; they may also be more prone, because of these factors, to build up lengthy rap sheets of less-serious violent offenses.
Indigenous people account for over a third of Canadian prisoners under such supervision orders, 328 out of 959 people, the data showed – slightly above their share of the prison population.

Once released under supervision orders, Indigenous people may struggle to stick to conditions because of “socioeconomic gaps,” such as high rates of unemployment in their communities, homelessness, substance use and past trauma, according to Leonard Marchand, Chief Justice of British Columbia and a member of the Okanagan Indian Band.
The Correctional Service data showed Indigenous people are overrepresented among those breaching the conditions of long-term supervision orders, putting them at greater risk of returning to jail. The bar for reincarceration is low: a former offender under a supervision order may be sent back to prison for 90 days if their parole officer believes they pose an “unmanageable risk” to the community.
“It kind of sets up an opportunity where you served your time but you’re still not free,” said lawyer Rob Dhanu, who has dealt with many such cases.
Advocates say better risk assessments that consider social circumstances could help steer Indigenous people away from supervision, and easier access to psychological treatment and Indigenous cultural programs might keep them from falling back into crime or substance use.
“We need to look at what works and what doesn’t work,” said Jonathan Rudin, program director of Aboriginal Legal Services, a service provider. “And jail, generally, has not worked for Indigenous people.”
Indigenous people are more likely to be incarcerated at every stage of their encounter with the criminal justice system, the data show. Before trial, they are more likely to be denied bail; and on conviction, they are more likely to be held in maximum security units – where there is limited access to rehabilitative programs that are often a prerequisite to gaining parole.
Indigenous people are more likely than white people to be denied full parole – even when their parole officer recommends it, according to Parole Board of Canada data obtained through a freedom-of-information request and analyzed by Reuters with the help of University of Toronto criminologist Anthony Doob.

Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Gary Anandasangaree acknowledged Canada has an Indigenous incarceration problem.
“There’s more than sufficient evidence to suggest that there is systemic racism within the correctional institutions, as well as the criminal justice system, that have often led to over-incarceration of Indigenous people,” he told Reuters. He cited the government’s work to eliminate some mandatory minimum sentences and said the justice system needed to give more weight to Indigenous offenders’ health needs and social history.
The opposition Conservative party, in a tightening race with Liberals ahead of a federal election this year, has adopted a hard line on crime. It has pledged to keep “violent criminals where they belong – behind bars,” Larry Brock, Shadow Minister for Justice and Attorney General, said in a statement to Reuters.
Brock did not comment on the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in prison. But he noted that Indigenous people themselves are often the victims of crime.
HISTORY OF TRAUMA
More than 30 lawyers, advocates and judges said that poverty and inter-generational trauma – when damaging events visited on one person transfer to their descendants and then snowball – stack the deck against Indigenous people.
Starblanket was five when his father died by suicide in police custody. Around the same time, according to court documents, Starblanket was abused by a male relative.
He was seven when he and his four siblings were taken into foster care after his mother, who was doing sex work at the time, was jailed for the manslaughter of a violent client, according to court transcripts. She was eventually pardoned.
Starblanket shuttled between his mother’s place and 15 foster homes in the Saskatoon and Regina areas, according to testimony in the court record.
Starblanket’s mother Beverley Johnston said she apologized to her children for what they went through.
“I felt bad for them that they ended up in foster,” she told Reuters.
A Statistics Canada study published last month found higher rates of physical and mental illness, economic hardship and homelessness among Indigenous people who spent time in government care as children. Indigenous children comprise more than half of all children in foster care in Canada.
At 16, Starblanket was criminally charged for the first time with robbery and assault after following his victim off a bus and heading-butting him twice, according to court documents. “I committed a senseless crime,” he says.
He was sentenced in 1999 to 13 months in custody.
Four days before Starblanket was sentenced, Canada’s Supreme Court issued a decision declaring the mass incarceration of Indigenous people “a crisis.” It urged the judicial system to take Indigenous people’s circumstances into account, including substance use or family breakdown.
Starblanket’s sentence was the first of 23 violent convictions, mostly for robberies and assault, many when he was drunk or using meth or cocaine, according to court records. He was convicted of punching his mother; biting and attempting to strangle a former partner; cutting a woman’s chin with a broken beer bottle; punching a hotel clerk; robbing two teens of $16.50.
In 2014, he and a woman were convicted of robbing a convenience store and threatening the clerk with a Taser, according to court records.
Three years later, Starblanket, then in prison, was designated a dangerous offender – someone who could be imprisoned indefinitely. The ruling cited a pattern of violent behavior and “a likelihood of causing injury or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons.”
Marchand, the Chief Justice of British Columbia, said the standardized risk assessments used in dangerous offender decisions factor in prior convictions and substance use, but do not account for the circumstances of Indigenous people. He did not comment on Starblanket’s case.
RELEASE
Starblanket’s lawyer, Mike Nolin, appealed the dangerous offender designation and in 2019 the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled the sentencing judge did not adequately consider the possibility of treating Starblanket for substance use and antisocial personality disorder. The dangerous offender designation was overturned.
Starblanket was released from prison in 2022 – but placed under a five-year supervision order.
After his release, Starblanket moved in with his partner under orders not to drink or do drugs, to attend treatment, and not to travel. The couple’s child, Anastasia, turns two on April 1.
Fourteen months into his long-term supervision order came what Starblanket calls “the slip”: He did meth.
He told his parole officer, knowing he would fail a drug test. His parole officer ordered him to move to the halfway house – a facility providing housing, meals and some services for people on day parole or supervision orders. Starblanket is required to check in three times a day.
For Starblanket, the restrictions grate – especially not being able to live at home with his family. But he also says he sees the support they can provide. He worries about how he will adjust when his long-term supervision order is up in November 2027. Above all, he wants to rebuild his life and avoid a return to prison.
“I don’t want to be asking for permission forever,” Starblanket said. “And I won’t be.”
Once free, he wants to go to university to study psychology, he said. He says he wants to be a voice for other Indigenous people caught up in the justice system. Maybe run a halfway house himself someday.

Title: US drops bid to make Google sell AI investments in antitrust case
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 05:39:23 +0000
Content: The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday dropped a proposal to force Alphabet’s Google GOOGL.O to sell its investments in artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI competitor Anthropic, to boost competition in online search.
The DOJ and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general still seek a court order requiring Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures aimed at addressing what a judge said was Google’s illegal search monopoly, according to court papers filed in Washington.
“The American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and ‘free’ online services. These values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist,” prosecutors wrote.
A spokesperson for Google said the “sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security.”
A spokesperson for Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Donald Trump has said he would continue a crackdown on Big Tech, which began during his first term and continued into former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump has tapped veteran antitrust attorney Gail Slater to lead the DOJ’s efforts.
Google holds a minority stake worth billions of dollars in Anthropic. Losing the investment would hand a competitive advantage to OpenAI and its partner Microsoft MSFT.O, Anthropic wrote to the court in February.
Evidence prosecutors obtained since making their draft recommendation in November showed a risk that banning Google from AI investments “could cause unintended consequences in the evolving AI space,” they said in the final proposal on Friday. They asked that Google be required to give prior notice to the government about future investments in generative AI.
Google, which has said it will appeal, has made its own proposal that would loosen agreements with Apple AAPL.O and others to set Google as the default search engine on new devices. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April.
The blockbuster case is one of several U.S. antitrust cases against Big Tech companies. Apple, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O also face allegations of maintaining illegal monopolies in their respective markets.
Since Trump’s reelection, Google has sought to make the case that the DOJ’s approach in the case would hobble the company’s ability to compete in AI and “jeopardize America’s global economic and technological leadership.”
Many of the measures prosecutors proposed in November remain intact with a few tweaks.
For example, a requirement that Google share search query data with competitors now says that Google can charge a marginal fee for access and that the competitors must not pose a national security risk.
The proposal drew statements of support from Democratic and Republican attorneys general as well as the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.

Title: Making up for many things we could & should have done earlier says EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:40:33 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Saturday inaugurated a new Consulate General of India in Manchester, the United Kingdom, and said that “India was making up for many things that perhaps the country could and should have done earlier”.
He also said that the opening of Consulate General in Manchester was symbolic of the importance of the growing diaspora in the region and a sign of things to come, including an India-UK Free Trade Agreement.
The EAM said it was apt that Vishakha Yaduvanshi takes over her role as India’s newest Consul General on International Women’s Day, reflective of the strides the government has made in putting women’s issues at the centre of policy.
Speaking to IANS at the occasion, EAM Jaishankar said, “I completely agree that nothing could be more fitting than for a Consul General to inaugurate her consulate on this day. So it wasn’t just in time; we actually got the day right. Let me reflect for a moment on what this occasion really means to us. In some ways, it’s about the past—we are making up for many things that perhaps we could and should have done earlier…”
He also said, “Now, already, I can see, you know, Manchester is hugely invested in India and the other way around. I’m told that the trade with this region is about 700 million pounds, that there are 300, more than perhaps 300 Indian firms here…”
The EAM said, “Today, when we look at where that approach has taken us, a few years ago or two years ago, to be precise, we held the G20 presidency. We undertook a number of initiatives, and it was a particularly challenging presidency at that time. The world was highly polarised, and people were unwilling to sit together. However, among our achievements, aside from securing the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20, one of our proudest was the adoption of the concept of women-led development by the G20…”
In a post on social media platform X, the EAM wrote: “Very pleased to inaugurate our 4th Consulate in the UK, in Manchester. Thanks Deputy PM@AngelaRayner, Minister @CatherineWest1, Deputy Mayor Paul Dennett and MP @NavPMishra for joining us.”
In another X post, EAM Jaishankar said: “Good to meet Deputy PM @AngelaRayner today in Manchester. Her encouragement has been a contribution to setting up of our Consulate. Also discussed India-UK bilateral ties and our efforts on increasing trade and people-to-people exchanges. This step delivers on the longstanding desire of our community and friends of India in Manchester. Confident that this latest addition to our presence in the UK will strengthen people to people, cultural, trade and, of course, cricket ties.”
The EAM followed up the official opening of the consulate building in Stockport, Greater Manchester, with a celebratory diaspora reception at the Old Trafford stadium, where he interacted with members of the Lancashire Cricket Club’s women’s team members before they leave for Bengaluru for a pre-season tour next week.
“My first visit to Manchester here today, in a formal way, is an acknowledgement of how much this relationship has matured in the last four decades,” said EAM Jaishankar.
“But and I want to say this with great emphasis, it is equally a preparation for what is to come – a much deeper, closer partnership between India and the United Kingdom. Clearly, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is very much at the heart of that in the near term.”
“But we look at a Free Trade Agreement not simply as a trade or even investment understanding between us, but as something much bigger, really a game changer, symbolic shift to a higher orbit of relationship,” he said.
The Union Minister said he wanted to “applaud” the contribution of the Indian community in building the relationship be…

Title: Gill Confident as India Prepare for Champions Trophy Final
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:32:20 +0000
Content: Indian Cricket team’s vice-captain Shubman Gill expressed optimism about his team’s chances in the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, scheduled for tomorrow at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Saturday, Gill emphasized that India’s T20 World Cup victory in 2024 has removed some pressure from the squad as they approach another major final.
“Winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry, but I think it kind of makes us more balanced,” Gill told reporters. “Yes, we have won an ICC title, and we’ll try to do our best to win this one.”
The 25-year-old batter, who is in his second ICC tournament final with India after the 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia, highlighted the importance of managing pressure in crucial matches.
“The pressure of big matches is definitely there,” Gill acknowledged. “In such matches, the team that handles the pressure well, that takes out the occasion and doesn’t think that we’re playing the final, their chances of winning are better.”
Gill praised the current Indian batting lineup as the best he has been part of, featuring cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli at the top of the order.
“Rohit and Virat are all-time one-day greats in the world,” he said. “Rohit is one of the best openers in white ball cricket. And Virat is one of the best ODI batsmen ever.”
The vice-captain also emphasized the crucial role experienced players like Kohli played in India’s victory in the semifinal. “We saw Virat in the last match because he has played so many important matches for India, played so many finals, so many semi-finals,” Gill noted. “The more you are in that situation and the more you have handled the pressure, you know that you have already done this.”
Gill dismissed concerns about captain Rohit Sharma’s recent streak of losing tosses, stating that the team is always prepared regardless of whether they bat or bowl first. He also rejected speculation about Sharma’s retirement after the tournament, saying, “He has not spoken to me or to the team about this decision. I don’t think Rohit is thinking about it.”
When asked about pitch conditions for the final, Gill expressed confidence in the team’s adaptability. “We haven’t really seen a 300 score here as yet,” he said. “I think we as a team have got a good idea of how to play on those kind of wickets and how to bowl on those kinds of wickets.”
India will face New Zealand in the final on Sunday, having already defeated them earlier in the tournament. A victory would give India their second consecutive ICC trophy following last year’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies.

Title: UAE leaders laud women’s contributions on International Women’s Day
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:24:42 +0000
Content: The United Arab Emirates commemorated International Women’s Day with a wave of tributes from its highest leadership, recognizing the pivotal role women play in shaping both national and global progress.
President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a message shared on social media platform X, expressed profound gratitude. “On International Women’s Day, we celebrate the contributions of all women in fostering lasting progress and development to uplift society,” he stated. “To women in the UAE and around the world, we express our sincere gratitude as you continue to inspire future generations through your pivotal impact and achievements in all fields.”
Echoing these sentiments, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, also took to X, highlighting women’s enduring strength and contributions. “On International Women’s Day, we celebrate women’s giving, strength, sacrifices, and contributions to building societies and countries. Women are the secret of life, its story, and its soul. They are the educators of generations and the creators of heroes.”
The nation’s celebration aligned with the 2025 United Nations theme, “For all women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,” reinforcing the UAE’s steadfast commitment to advancing women’s empowerment. Officials emphasized the nation’s “full speed” progress in this area, citing significant strides in sustainable development.
The UAE government has consistently prioritized women’s issues, recognizing their crucial role as partners in achieving comprehensive development. This year, Emirati women’s contributions across various sectors have been instrumental in significant national achievements.The UAE’s progress was further underscored by its rise to seventh position globally and its continued regional leadership in the 2024 Gender Inequality Index, published by the United Nations Development Programme.
Recent milestones include the expansion of women’s representation in government with the appointment of Sana bint Mohammed Suhail as Minister of Family, following the ministry’s establishment. The launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Women’s Health marked another significant step, ensuring comprehensive healthcare services for women throughout their lives.Economic empowerment remained a key focus, with the Ministry of Economy mandating that private joint-stock companies allocate at least one board seat to women upon the conclusion of current board terms.
The UAE also solidified its international commitment to gender equality through a strategic partnership with UN Women, formalized in March 2024. This collaboration includes a $15 million investment over three-and-a-half years, aimed at bolstering women’s status worldwide and supporting the UN Women Liaison Office for the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Title: India’s enduring legacy in UN peacekeeping
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 07:00:23 +0000
Content: India has been a consistent participant in United Nations peacekeeping operations, contributing personnel and resources to support global security efforts. External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar has said that India’s foreign policy prioritizes peacekeeping through dialogue, diplomacy, and cooperation. He emphasized that India remains committed to contributing meaningfully to UN peacekeeping in line with the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which underscores the belief that the world is one family.
UN peacekeeping serves as a vital mechanism for maintaining global security, encompassing efforts such as facilitating political processes, protecting civilians, disarmament, and ensuring human rights. Modern peacekeeping has evolved into a multidimensional endeavor, integrating military, political, and humanitarian efforts.
Since its first deployment in 1953 during the Korean Peninsula mission, India has been one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping. Over 290,000 Indian personnel have served in more than 50 missions, and currently, over 5,000 Indian peacekeepers are deployed in nine active operations. These include missions in Lebanon, South Sudan, Congo, Cyprus, and the Golan Heights.
These deployments include infantry battalions, medical units, engineering contingents, military observers, and police units. The commitment of Indian peacekeepers has been recognized time and again, with many having made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In 2023, the UN posthumously awarded the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal to Indian peacekeepers who lost their lives while serving in the Congo, a testament to their dedication and courage.
Beyond deployment, India has also played a vital role in training and capacity-building initiatives for peacekeepers. The Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in India trains over 12,000 troops annually and provides specialized courses for both Indian and international personnel.
India has also emerged as a global leader in promoting gender equality within peacekeeping operations. Despite women comprising less than 10 percent of the UN’s 70,000 uniformed peacekeepers, India has been at the forefront of increasing female participation. In 2007, it became the first country to deploy an all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU) in Liberia, setting a precedent for gender inclusion in peacekeeping missions.
Today, over 150 Indian women peacekeepers serve in key missions across Congo, South Sudan, Lebanon, and other conflict zones, playing a crucial role in fostering peace and security. Their presence has significantly enhanced engagement with local communities, particularly in protecting vulnerable populations and advancing peacebuilding efforts.
Recognition for India’s female peacekeepers has also been growing on the global stage. Major Radhika Sen was honored as the UN’s Military Gender Advocate of the Year 2023 for her contributions to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in peacekeeping. India continues to advocate for greater gender parity in military and police deployments, with its women peacekeepers playing an instrumental role in preventing sexual violence, building trust, and empowering women and girls in conflict-ridden areas.
India’s commitment to peacekeeping extends beyond personnel contributions. The country has provided state-of-the-art, indigenously manufactured equipment and technology to UN missions, enhancing operational efficiency in challenging environments. This technological support has been instrumental in improving logistics, surveillance, and strategic deployment in conflict zones.
As a leader in global peacekeeping, India’s approach is deeply rooted in its principles of non-violence, cooperation, and collective security. Through its extensive contributions, India has set international benchmarks in peacekeeping operations, from training future peacekeepers to championing gender inclusivity. With its continued presence in missions worldwide, India remains steadfast in its commitment to global peace and stability, reinforcing its role as a key player in international conflict resolution.

Title: Swiatek and Rybakina serve up bagels en route to victories at Indian Wells
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:53:13 +0000
Content: Defending champion Iga Swiatek crushed Dayana Yastremska 6-0 6-2 and 2023 champion Elena Rybakina powered past Britain’s Katie Boulter 6-0 7-5 to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells on Sunday with displays of dominance.
Swiatek, seeded second, is aiming to become the first woman to win the tournament three times and the Polish player looked eager to do so in as little time on court as possible, reeling off 10 games in a row and needing just 65 minutes to see off her Ukrainian opponent.
“At the end I got a bit tired, it’s always hard to finish a match like that but I’m happy that I kept my intensity up in the last game to close it,” she said.
“I had control from the beginning so I’m happy with the performance for sure.”
It was Swiatek’s second bagel set of the tournament after she overwhelmed Caroline Garcia 6-2 6-0 in her first match.
The five-times major champion has not won a title since her triumph at Roland Garros in 2024, her longest drought since winning her first major title in 2020.
She served a one-month suspension in October for a failed drug test and has seen Aryna Sabalenka take her world number one ranking but said the California desert is an ideal setting to get back to winning ways.
“It’s amazing, I love coming here,” she said.
“I already have my routine so it feels like home. It’s for sure the place to be and a great place to play tennis.”
Swiatek will face 15th seed Karolina Muchova in the round of 16 after the Czech player beat her compatriot Katerina Siniakova in the afternoon.
After cruising through the first set, Rybakina fell behind 5-3 in the second before regrouping.
She stretched to hit a sensational defensive shot in a game where she broke back for 5-5 and broke again on match point to seal the win.
Rybakina, who missed last year’s tournament due to an illness, will play ninth-seeded teenager Mirra Andreeva in a rematch of their Dubai semi-final, which the Russian won in three sets en route to becoming the youngest player to win a WTA 1000 title.
Andreeva is coached by former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, who the 17-year-old said was keeping her focused.
“She already told me that she booked a court at 12 p.m.,” she told reporters after her night match. “I see not much time passed from the match… she’s just like this, but it’s not bad.”
Ukrainian Elina Svitolina upset 14th seed Danielle Collins 6-2 6-4 and will face another American, fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the next round after she breezed past China’s Wang Xinyu 6-2 6-1.

Title: Cricket fraternity celebrates India’s Champions Trophy win as Rohit’s side relishes new found glory
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:46:55 +0000
Content: The cricket fraternity extended its congratulations to India for its exemplary performance under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy and head coach Gautam Gambhir’s guidance, which led to their third Champions Trophy title on Sunday.
In front of a sold-out crowd and a pulsating atmosphere, India effortlessly chased down a competitive 252-run total against New Zealand. The ‘Men in Blue’ stamped its authority and sealed a four-wicket triumph with an over to spare, adding another ICC title to its cabinet.
As the Indian camp experienced euphoria and wrote another chapter of success in its rich history, social media was flooded with reactions from former cricketers celebrating the famous triumph.
“It was a privilege, in my role as @ICC Chair, to award Rohit Sharma the 2025 #ChampionsTrophy. His inspiring leadership and game-high 76 were critical in India’s win over a gallant New Zealand in the Final,” ICC Chairman Jay Shah said in a post on X.
Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who missed the tournament due to a lower back injury, was ecstatic after India got its hands on the title with a “deserved” victory.
“Played like true champions! Congratulations to the entire team on a wonderful tournament and a well-deserved win!” Bumrah wrote on Instagram.
India’s head coach, Gautam Gambhir, extended wishes to the entire nation and wrote on Instagram, “Congratulations to 1.4 billion Indians! Jai Hind.”
India’s legendary opener Virender Sehwag extended wishes to the title-winning, saying, “After 11 years, a multi-year break out in June 2024 with the T20 WC win, and within 8 months, another ICC title for us—a third Champions Trophy win. Congratulations, Team.”
Former spinner Harbhajan Singh said, “HINDUSTAN ZINDABAD! WELL DONE, TEAM INDIA #ChampionsTrophy2025.”
“Rohit Sharma is a true leader—always bringing the team together and looking out for his players. He pushes everyone to be their best and truly deserves all the success and more!”, former all-rounder Irfan Pathan said in a post on X.
Ex-batter Wasim Jaffer said, “Champions! Congratulations Rohit and Team India, no praise high enough for the best in the business #ChampionsTrophy.”
Legendary India batter Sachin Tendulkar extended his wishes and wrote on X, “Champions Trophy CHAMPION…. Yeeeeehhhh.”
Former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh penned a heartfelt note for India and its star-studded players and wrote on X, “What a game and what a final! The Champions Trophy comes home. Outstanding captaincy by hitman @ImRo45, who led from the front all through the tournament—he is blessed with the Midas touch when it comes to ICC white-ball tournaments! Successful games for @ShreyasIyer15, @ShubmanGill, @klrahul, @hardikpandya7, who stepped up when needed and showed nerves of steel under pressure.”
“@imjadeja, @imkuldeep18, @akshar2026, #VarunChakaravarthy spun magic all through the tournament, and @MdShami11 was relentless with the ball! Tough luck @BLACKCAPS, you had us on the edge till the very end. But this was our tournament! #ChampionsTrophy2025 #INDvNZ,” he added.
The wishes poured in from across the globe, as former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson clearly said India “thoroughly” deserved to win the title.
“Thoroughly deserved win from India. Your quartet of spinners were outstanding today to squeeze NZ to a below-par score. NZ fought hard as expected, and after a fine campaign, they were beaten by a better team on the day… that’s sport,” Hesson wrote on X.
Former England cricketer Michael Vaughan labeled India as the best white-ball team in the world and wrote on X, “Let’s be honest, India are the best team in the world in white-ball cricket by a decent margin… Thoroughly deserved to win… T20 holders/Champions Trophy holders… Now, down to the rest to try and catch up… #India.”
The ‘Rawalpindi Express,’ Shoaib Akhtar, showered praise on the Champions Trophy winners, saying, “The best team of the tournament has won the Champions Trophy. That too without dropping a single match!!”

Title: Trump says US talking to four different groups on sale of TikTok
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:28:20 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that his administration was in touch with four different groups about the sale of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, and that all options were good.
TikTok’s fate has been up in the air since a law requiring its owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on January 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.
Asked if there was going to soon be a deal on TikTok, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One, “it could.”
“We’re dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it … all four are good,” he added.
TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment outside of normal business hours.
The turmoil at TikTok has attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion.

Title: Zelenskiy heads to Saudi Arabia ahead of crunch US talks
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:55:47 +0000
Content: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travels to Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, ahead of talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials on ending the war with Russia at an increasingly precarious moment for Kyiv.
The United States, once Ukraine’s main ally, has upended its wartime policies in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while cutting off military assistance and intelligence sharing for Kyiv.
Zelenskiy is expected to meet Mohammed bin Salman, whose Saudi Arabia has played various mediating roles since Russia’s 2022 invasion, including brokering prisoner exchanges and hosting talks between Russia and the United States last month.
Tuesday’s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials – the first official meeting since a disastrous Oval Office encounter between Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump – are expected to focus on a bilateral minerals deal and how to end the war.
Under huge pressure from Trump, who wants the war ended at lightning speed, Zelenskiy has been at pains to show they are on the same page, despite failing to win promises of U.S. security guarantees that Kyiv sees as vital for any peace deal.
Zelenskiy has said he will not attend the talks with U.S. officials and that the Ukrainian delegation will include his chief of staff, his foreign and defence ministers and a top military official in the presidential administration.
“On our side, we are fully committed to constructive dialogue, and we hope to discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X.
“Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively.”
FRAMEWORK FOR AN AGREEMENT
Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been arranging the talks, has said the idea was to “get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well”.
Zelenskiy has called for a truce in the air and at sea, as well as a prisoner exchange, in what he says could be a test of Russia’s commitment to ending the war.
Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France, saying it was a bid to buy time for Kyiv and prevent its military collapse.
The Ukrainian leader has also said Kyiv was ready to sign the minerals deal with the U.S. that would create a joint fund from the sale of Ukrainian minerals, and which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing.
With U.S. support in question, Zelenskiy has been urging his European allies to ramp up their support as Kyiv’s battlefield position deteriorates and it faces mounting pressure to retreat from Russia’s Kursk region.
Ukrainian troops that stormed into the Kursk region last summer are nearly surrounded by Russian forces, open source maps show.
Russia holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, and its troops are also pressing in the eastern Donetsk region, having ramped up drone and missile strikes on cities and towns far from the front.
Russia has launched 1,200 aerial guided bombs, nearly 870 attack drones and more than 80 missiles at Ukraine in the past week alone, Zelenskiy has said.

Title: Mark Carney, crisis-fighting central banker, to lead Canada through US trade war
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:48:02 +0000
Content: Mark Carney, soon to become Canada’s new prime minister, is a two-time central banker and crisis fighter about to face his biggest challenge of all: steering Canada through Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Liberals announced Carney as Justin Trudeau’s successor on Sunday after party members voted in a nominating contest. Trudeau resigned in January, facing low approval ratings after nearly a decade in office.
The 59-year-old Carney is a political outsider who has never held office, which would in normal times have killed his candidacy in Canada. But distance from Trudeau and a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, and Carney argues he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.
“I know how to manage crises … in a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,” Carney said during a leadership debate late last month.
Carney was born in Fort Smith in the remote Northwest Territories. He attended Harvard where he played college level ice hockey, starring as a goalkeeper.
Carney, who garnered the most party endorsements and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates, will soon be the first person to become Canadian prime minister without being a legislator and without having had any cabinet experience.
He argues Canada must fight Trump’s tariffs with dollar for dollar retaliation and diversify trading relations in the medium term.
In the next election, which must be held by October 20, the Liberals will face off against the official opposition Conservatives, whose leader Pierre Poilievre is a career politician with little international exposure.
By contrast, Carney is a globetrotter who spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top finance ministry job and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of just 42.
Carney won praise for his handling of the financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record low levels for a specific period of time.
Even at that stage, rumors swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.
“Why don’t I become a circus clown?” he told a reporter in 2012 when asked about possible political ambitions.
The Bank of England was impressed enough though to poach him in 2013, making him the first non-British governor in the central bank’s three-century history, and the first person to ever head two G7 central banks. Britain’s finance minister at the time, George Osborne, called Carney the “outstanding central bank governor of his generation”.
Carney, though, had a challenging time, forced to face zero inflation and the political chaos of Brexit.
He struggled to deploy his trademark policy of signaling the likely path of interest rates. The bank said its guidance came with caveats but media often interpreted it as more of a guarantee, with Labour legislator Pat McFadden dubbing the bank under Carney as an “unreliable boyfriend.”
When sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.
“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” said Ana Botin, Santander’s executive chairman, in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.
‘HIGH PRIEST OF PROJECT FEAR’
But he infuriated Brexit supporters by talking about the economic damage that he said was likely to be caused by leaving the European Union. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear” but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.
Carney also showed irritation with his predecessor in the job, Mervyn King, whom he said had not spotted the risks building in the financial sector before the 2007-08 financial crisis.
From 2011 to 2018 Carney also headed the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies.
After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, Carney served as a United Nations envoy on finance and climate change.
After launching the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021 to act as an umbrella group for financial sector efforts to get to net-zero emissions, Carney oversaw a surge in membership as boards rushed to signal a willingness to act.
As the implications of moving to renewable energy began to filter down to the real economy, though, a political backlash from some Republican states accusing companies of breaching anti-trust rules ultimately led a number of large U.S. companies to drop their membership.
He also served on the board of Brookfield Asset Management and was chair of the Bloomberg board but resigned as the U.N. special envoy and left all commercial posts after he launched his bid for the Liberal leadership on January 16.
Carney’s lack of political experience showed when the Conservatives pressed him over a decision by Brookfield to move its headquarters from Canada to the United States. Carney said the move took place after he resigned in January but the Conservatives found a letter he wrote to shareholders in December 2024 recommending the move.
“Sometimes I answer questions that go into details when I should keep it at a higher level. That’s part of the problem with not being a politician,” he told reporters when asked about Conservative allegations he had lied.

Title: India-Japan joint military exercise “Dharma Guardian” concludes successfully in Japan
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:36:16 +0000
Content: The 6th edition of the India-Japan joint military exercise, Dharma Guardian, concluded successfully at the East Fuji Training Area in Japan on March 9. Held from February 24 to March 9, the exercise marked a significant milestone in the bilateral defense cooperation between the two nations. The exercise was conducted at an enhanced scale with participation from troops at the company-strength level, further strengthening the defense relationship between India and Japan.
The closing ceremony was attended by Lieutenant General Toriumi Seiji, the Commanding General of the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force (JGSDF) 1st Division. He conveyed his appreciation to the participating troops for successfully meeting the objectives of the exercise. Expressing satisfaction with the joint training, General Toriumi emphasized the exercise’s role in improving the operational readiness of both armed forces, enhancing mutual understanding, and fostering greater cooperation between India and Japan’s defense forces.
The primary focus of Exercise Dharma Guardian was on counter-terrorism operations in urban terrain, a key area of collaboration between the two nations. The exercise also included activities related to **United Nations peacekeeping operations**, such as **Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR)**. Throughout the course of the training, the troops engaged in tactical drills, exchanged knowledge on operational conduct, and forged lasting ties of friendship and trust.
In addition to the military training, cultural exchange activities were also held, showcasing the bonds between the two countries. The Indian contingent conducted a special Yoga session for the Japanese side, while the Indian troops demonstrated Kalari Pattu, a traditional martial art, and the Japanese troops showcased their own martial arts.
The exercise culminated in a 72-hour validation phase, during which both sides conducted a simulated joint counter-terrorism operation in an urban setting. The operation involved specialized techniques, including heli-borne insertion, slithering, and storming, and was a successful demonstration of the troops’ operational capabilities. Both nations met the desired operational standards, marking the final phase of the exercise as a significant achievement.
Dharma Guardian provided a unique opportunity for both India and Japan to learn from each other’s best practices in joint operations. The exercise reaffirmed the shared commitment of both countries to regional peace, security, and stability, further solidifying their longstanding defense partnership.

Title: Syria’s Sharaa scrambles to contain deadliest violence in years
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 04:45:13 +0000
Content: Syria’s leader vowed on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of violent clashes pitting loyalists of deposed President Bashar al-Assad against the country’s new Islamist rulers and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped their authority.
The clashes, which a war monitoring group said had already killed over 1,000 people, mostly civilians, continued for a fourth day in Assad’s coastal heartland.
In a speech broadcast on national television and posted on social media, Ahmed Sharaa, whose rebel movement toppled Assad in December, accused Assad loyalists and foreign powers that he did not name of trying to foment unrest.
“Today, as we stand at this critical moment, we find ourselves facing a new danger – attempts by remnants of the former regime and their foreign backers to incite new strife and drag our country into a civil war, aiming to divide it and destroy its unity and stability,” he said.
The top commander of a Syrian Kurdish armed group, whose forces are in a separate battle with Turkey, had earlier blamed Turkish-backed Islamist factions for some of the most disturbing violence: the reported executions of civilians belonging to Assad’s Alawite sect. Turkey did not immediately respond to the allegation.
At the United Nations in New York, diplomats said the United States and Russia have asked the Security Council to meet behind closed doors on Monday over the escalating violence in Syria.
Interim President Sharaa’s office said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides. Syrians have circulated graphic videos of executions by fighters. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.
“We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” Sharaa added in the video speech after earlier calling for national unity.

Title: CWG Federation rebranded as Commonwealth Sport
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:14:02 +0000
Content: The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has changed its name to Commonwealth Sports under the ‘More in Common’ brand campaign. The announcement was made on the occasion of Commonwealth Day, an annual celebration of the Commonwealth of Nations held on the second Monday in March.
“Commonwealth Day also marks the date we transition from a Sports Federation to a Sport Movement, Commonwealth Sport becoming our public name,” the governing body said in a statement.
Katie Sadleir, CEO, Commonwealth Sport said, “The evolution to a Movement that is Commonwealth Sport allows us to demonstrate a stronger, more unified purpose that resonates with our audience on a deeper level.”
“It will help us more clearly communicate our role of not only delivering the powerful platform of the Commonwealth Games – which allows us to share success and transform inspiration into impact – but also championing the exceptional work that goes on across our 74 nations and territories every day.
“This transformation enables greater collaboration, more impactful messaging, and an amplified sense of belonging for those who align with our cause,” she added. “The Commonwealth Sport logo with its celebration mark has been in use for some time. The three coloured V shapes represent our three values, Humanity, Equality, and Destiny, rising to the six points representing our six Regions of Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, and Oceania, reflecting the rich diversity of our cultures, coming together through the power of sport,” she added.
The Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games is the first edition of the Games to incorporate this logo into the event mark.
The Commonwealth Day also marks the launch of the Commonwealth Sport King’s Baton Relay at Buckingham Place, starting the relay with 500 days to go to the Opening Ceremony of Glasgow 2026.
King Charles will place a sealed message into the baton, which will remain inside until the opening ceremony when it will be read out to mark the start of the Games and will hand the baton to champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy – the first bearer on its journey around the world.

Title: Capex boom ahead in India, infra projects to accelerate at state level: Jefferies
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:32:10 +0000
Content: There has been a significant increase in capital expenditure in India, with growth expected to continue in the coming months as several sectors witness strong investments, according to a new report by global brokerage Jefferies.
Mahesh Nandurkar, Head of Research and Managing Director at Jefferies, expects capital expenditure growth to remain robust in February and March.
This aligns with the government’s revised budget estimates, indicating a continued push for infrastructure and industrial development.
“These are on expected lines, but the fact that it’s happening gives confidence,” said Nandurkar.
The central government’s capital expenditure rose by 51 percent year-on-year in January 2025, reflecting its commitment to strengthening the country’s infrastructure.
The government’s focus on railways and road projects has helped achieve significant progress, with around 83-87 percent of the financial year 2025 revised estimates already completed for these sectors.
Nandurkar said that one needs to take a more of a calibrated approach. The market is cautious on private capex.
“I believe that private capex is already happening in sectors like cement, steel, hospital and real estate,” he added.
The government’s commitment to capital expenditure remains strong, with transfers to states rising by approximately 60 percent.
This financial support is expected to further accelerate infrastructure projects at the state level, boosting overall economic growth.
Jefferies also highlighted strong growth potential in key sectors. One of them was metal stocks, highlighting strong momentum in the sector.
The brokerage also pointed out that the Asian steel spread remains 20 percent below its long-term average, leaving room for potential expansion.
Additionally, Indian steel prices have risen by 5 percent from their December lows, signalling a recovery in the sector.
Jefferies further stated that any potential safeguard duty on steel could provide additional support to prices, improving margins and boosting valuations for metal companies.
With improving fundamentals and favourable market conditions, the metal sector is expected to continue its strong performance in the coming months, the brokerage firm stated.

Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:31:57 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar concluded his official visit to the United Kingdom from March 4-9, at the invitation of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. During this period, he also visited Ireland from March 6-7, reinforcing India’s growing international engagements.
The foreign minister held a series of high-level meetings with key UK leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, among others. He engaged with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government officials, businesses, academia, and the Indian diaspora.
Strengthening Diplomatic and Trade Ties
Jaishankar conveyed warm greetings from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to UK PM Starmer. The two leaders recognised the growing momentum in India-UK relations, particularly highlighting the resumption of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. They also noted the significant strengthening of cooperation in technology and people-to-people exchanges. Additionally, their discussions touched on key global issues including the ongoing Ukraine conflict, underscoring a shared commitment to addressing major geopolitical challenges together.
The foreign minister also held extensive talks with Foreign Secretary Lammy at Chevening House, where the two leaders reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations.

Title: Indian pharma market to grow 8-9 per cent in FY26: report
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:23:39 +0000
Content: The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow 8-9 per cent year-on-year in FY26, according to a report on Monday.
The report by India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said the growth in the sector will be at 7.5-8.0 per cent year-on-year for FY25.
This is “against 6.5 per cent year-on-year in FY24 and 9.9 per cent YoY growth in FY23,” said Krishnanath Munde, associate director at India Ratings and Research.
In February, the pharma market delivered revenue growth of 7.5 per cent year-on-year. This growth was driven by price growth (5.2 per cent YoY) and new launches (2.4 per cent YoY), while volume growth remained muted at negative 0.2 per cent YoY, the report said.
The sector reported growth at an average of 7.3 per cent year-to-date (YTD) in FY25. This was led by price growth (5.5 per cent), new launches growth (2.7 per cent), and volume growth.
Further, the moving annual total (MAT) — or the 12-month rolling sales of overall pharma products — saw an 8.1 per cent surge in February, the report said. Cardiac therapies outperformed growth in the pharma market with 10.8 per cent growth in MAT and a 13.7 per cent increase in monthly market share. This was followed by gastroenterology, neurology/Central Nervous System, and dermatology.
On the other hand, anti-infectives, respiratory, and gynaecology therapies saw weaker growth in February, the report said.
Meanwhile, another recent report showed that the pharma sector in the country is witnessing rapid production growth. The Indian pharma sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR and has also seen a 9 per cent increase in export rates in 2024, according to the report by McKinsey & Company.
Expanding its capabilities in APIs and biotechnology, the sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR, twice the global average. The country also emerged as the world’s largest supplier of generic medicines, with a 9 per cent pharma export growth rate, nearly double the global average, the report said.

Title: Over 50% women among 30.68 crore workers registered on e-Shram potal
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:21:33 +0000
Content: More than 30.68 crore unorganised workers have registered for social welfare benefits on the government’s e-Shram portal, with women accounting for 53.68% of the total registrants as of March 3. This information was shared by Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The government launched the e-Shram portal on August 26, 2021, with the objective of creating a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW), seeded with Aadhaar. The portal provides registered workers with a Universal Account Number (UAN) on a self-declaration basis, enabling them to access various social security schemes. Expanding on this initiative, the Ministry of Labour and Employment launched the e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution on October 21, 2024, aligning with the budgetary vision of integrating multiple welfare schemes into a single digital platform.
The e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution integrates 13 central government schemes, allowing unorganised workers to access benefits through a unified platform. These schemes include Pradhan Mantri Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM-SVANidhi), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), and Ayushman Bharat, among others. The integration allows registered workers to track the benefits availed through the portal, streamlining access to social security provisions.
To enhance accessibility, the e-Shram portal introduced multilingual functionality on January 7, incorporating the Bhashini platform to support 22 Indian languages. This initiative aims to make the portal more inclusive, enabling workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to engage with the platform seamlessly.
Additionally, on February 24, the Ministry launched the e-Shram mobile application, which provides real-time access to welfare schemes integrated with the portal. The application is designed to improve convenience for workers, allowing them to stay informed about available benefits and access them directly from their mobile devices.
Efforts to promote awareness about e-Shram and its associated services include periodic review meetings with state governments and regular interactions with Common Services Centres (CSCs). The government has also integrated e-Shram with the National Career Service (NCS) and Skill India Digital Portal to provide employment and skill development opportunities. Furthermore, to facilitate enrolment in pension schemes, the portal is linked to the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandan (PMSYM) scheme.
In a bid to enhance discovery and accessibility of government schemes, e-Shram is also integrated with the myScheme portal, ensuring workers can find relevant welfare programs with ease. An SMS campaign has been initiated to create further awareness among unorganised workers regarding the benefits available to them through the platform.

Title: North Korea fires missiles after slamming US-South Korea drills
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:18:55 +0000
Content: North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles on Monday, hours after condemning the South Korean and U.S. militaries for launching drills that Pyongyang called a “dangerous provocative act” that risked accidentally sparking a confrontation.
South Korea’s military said the missiles were fired from North Korea’s western region toward the Yellow Sea. The launch was the first reported ballistic missile test since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.
The missiles were believed to be close range ballistic missiles, a South Korean defence ministry official said, referring to a type of weapon with a range of under 300 km (186 miles).
The allies’ annual Freedom Shield drills are scheduled to run until March 20, although live-fire exercises remain suspended after South Korean jets mistakenly dropped bombs on a civilian town near the border last week, injuring 29.
North Korea has typically demanded U.S.-South Korea joint exercises to be halted, branding them a prelude to an invasion.
The South Korean military has said the joint drills aim to strengthen the readiness of the alliance to face threats such as North Korea.
“This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot, to the extreme point,” North Korea’s foreign ministry said, according to state media outlet KCNA.
The drills would harm U.S. security, the ministry added.
Lee Young-su, chief of South Korea’s Air Force, bowed in apology on Monday over the “unprecedented” accident last week in which two jets mistakenly bombed the South Korean village.
“It was an accident that should never have happened and it should never happen again,” Lee told reporters.
A pilot in one jet was pressed for time and did not double-check the target coordinates, while another pilot in the other jet followed and dropped bombs without noticing the incorrect coordinates, a South Korean military official said, citing the interim results of the military’s investigation.
The area hit by the accidental bombing in Pocheon, which is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of Seoul, was outside a training area near the border with North Korea.
Residents in the area have long complained about the disturbance and risks coming from the exercises.

Title: Dharmendra Pradhan defends NEP, questions Tamil Nadu’s opposition to language policy
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:09:36 +0000
Content: Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday questioned the Tamil Nadu government’s staunch opposition to the National Education Policy (NEP), defending the Centre’s position on the policy and the PM Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme.
Speaking outside Parliament, Pradhan said, “The Government of India recently held discussions with the Tamil Nadu government, and a compromise was found. If Tamil Nadu agrees, we have no objection to providing them PM SHRI allocations. In Tamil Nadu, only the Tamil language will be the medium of instruction in PM SHRI schools. What is their opposition? I don’t understand this.”
Pradhan reiterated that the central government was not imposing any language policy, pointing out that states like Punjab, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are successfully implementing both the PM SHRI scheme and NEP without any language-related concerns.
In a separate statement in the Lok Sabha, Pradhan accused the ruling DMK of being “dishonest” and prioritizing political gains over the future of Tamil Nadu’s students. “The DMK is not committed to the students of Tamil Nadu. Their only job is to raise language barriers. They are doing politics,” he said.
DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran refuted Pradhan’s claims, asserting that the Tamil Nadu government had never agreed to implement the NEP. Maran clarified that while Tamil Nadu is not opposed to Hindi as an optional language, it rejects the compulsory imposition of a third language.
“We are not against Hindi. If students want to learn it, they are free to do so. But it should not be compulsory,” Maran said.

Title: Bangladesh Army had no direct communication with UN during July Uprising: ISPR
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:04:24 +0000
Content: The Bangladesh Army has said that it did not have any direct communication or request from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the comments made by UN High Commissioner Volker Turk in his interview with BBC HARDtalk, according to the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR).
In a press release issued on Monday, ISPR said Bangladesh Army finds it necessary to clarify certain aspects of Turk’s statement to ensure accuracy and transparency.
In an interview with the BBC programme HardTalk on Wednesday, Volker Türk said the Bangladesh army was warned about possible removal from peacekeeping operations for engaging in any repression during the July-August Uprising.
“The remark by Volker Turk taken out of context by certain quarters, appears to misrepresent the role of the Bangladesh Army and potentially undermines its reputation, sacrifice and professionalism,” said the ISPR release.
“If any such concerns were raised, they were conveyed to the then government of Bangladesh and not directly to the Army leadership,” it said.
The Bangladesh Army operates within the framework of national security directives and adheres strictly to the rule of law and human rights principles, it added.
It said Bangladesh Army remains committed to the people, upholding its legacy of neutrality and integrity.
“Historical events such as the democratic transition of 1991 reaffirm this dedication. During the July-August 2024 protests, the Army once again stood by people, ensuring public safety without bias or external influence.”
As the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, Bangladesh is globally recognised for its professionalism and dedication, it added.
ISPR said peacekeepers receive a tiny portion of foreign earnings, the majority-around Tk 27,000 crore over 23 years-has significantly contributed to national economic growth.
The Bangladesh Army deeply values its partnership with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and remains steadfast in its commitment to serving both the people of Bangladesh and the global community, it said.

Title: There are fewer than 100 ocelots in the US – these scientists are trying to save them
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:58:24 +0000
Content: In the race to save the endangered ocelot, scientists are trekking the United States, pursuing fertility treatments and striving to kickstart a new generation of the wild cat.
Ocelots roamed the southwestern U.S. in the 1800s, but have since dwindled to fewer than 100 in two small breeding populations in South Texas.
While the feline species is found in Mexico, Central America and South America, the Texas cats with striking spotted coats are believed to be the last wild population in the United States.
“Just look at the cat – why would you not want that animal to survive in nature?” said Bill Swanson, the Cincinnati Zoo’s director of animal research, who has traveled the country trying to breed captive ocelots in animal institutions with sperm from wild ocelots from South Texas ranch land.
“It’s not just saving the ocelot, it’s saving the habitat and the ecosystem where it lives, which supports so many other animals that provide those services that let people survive on this planet,” he said,
The nonprofit East Foundation, based in San Antonio, manages one of those breeding populations on more than 200,000 acres (810 sq km) of South Texas ranch land containing thorn scrub habitat, a dense covering of short, spiky shrubs that the elusive and nocturnal ocelots adore.
Ashley Reeves, a research veterinarian at the East Foundation, said humans played a major role in the decline of the ocelot, listed in 1982 as an endangered species in the U.S.
“Back when the fur trade became very popular, they were hunted down for their beautiful fur,” Reeves said. “And then also loss of habitat, human encroachment, large cities being built and roadways, so roadways are one of their No. 1 killers today.”
Reeves and Swanson have been working on their ocelot project since 2021. The team has tried – unsuccessfully so far – to breed ocelots two ways.
The first is via artificial insemination, in which semen collected from a cat is deposited directly into a female cat’s reproductive tract.
The second is in vitro fertilization, in which oocytes, or eggs, are collected from the female cat’s body and fertilized with semen in a petri dish before developing into an embryo in an incubator. The viable embryo is then surgically transferred into a cat or frozen to be transferred later.
Of the 13 artificial inseminations and four in vitro fertilization procedures performed in recent years, none have produced a viable pregnancy.
Swanson points to decreased quality in wild ocelot sperm due to signs of inbreeding, environmental stresses like dehydration from drought and decreased motility – the ability of sperm to move – from freezing specimens.
“An ocelot usually has one kitten. That’s the normal litter size,” Swanson said. “And in the wild, the mother will raise that kitten for a full year until it’s old enough to go out on its own. So ocelots are very slowly reproducing animals naturally.”
At the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi, Texas, in December, the team extracted two eggs from a five-year-old ocelot named Milla and patiently waited to see if an embryo would form after combining the eggs with wild sperm in a petri dish. After two days of waiting for a fertilized egg to cleave, or rapidly divide and develop into an embryo, the researchers were disappointed to find neither cell cleaved.
“It’s disappointing,” Reeves said. “But at the same time, science doesn’t always go the way you expect it to.”
Researchers will spend the next few months trapping wild male ocelots to collect their sperm before resuming fertility procedures in the fall.
By the end of the year, a facility in Kingsville, Texas, will be constructed to house ocelots, provide medical and reproductive care as well as a setting for young ocelots to learn how to hunt in the wild.

Title: Employees’ Pension Scheme sees steady growth in beneficiaries, reaching nearly 7.84 million in 2023-24
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:23:57 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS-95) continues to provide extensive social security benefits, offering protection to members and their families during old age and in case of various contingencies. The scheme offers a wide range of pension categories, ensuring financial support for those facing challenging life events.
In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment, Sushri Shobha Karandlaje, shared year-wise data revealing a steady rise in the number of pensioners benefiting from the scheme. The total number of pensioners under EPS-95 was recorded as 6,682,717 in 2019-20, increasing to 6,919,823 in 2020-21. The following year, the figure rose to 7,273,898 in 2021-22, and continued to climb to 7,558,913 in 2022-23. For the current year, the total number of pensioners under the scheme stands at 7,849,338 as of 2023-24.
EPS 95, also called the Employee Pension Scheme 1995, is a type of social security scheme launched by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on 19th November 1995.
Under EPS-95, members are entitled to receive a Member Pension upon reaching the age of 58, or an Early Member Pension starting from the age of 50. In cases of permanent and total disablement during service, a Disability Pension is provided. The scheme also supports families after the death of a member, offering Widow/Widower Pensions to surviving spouses and Children Pensions for up to two children until the age of 25.
Additionally, the scheme provides an Orphan Pension for up to two orphans at a time until they reach 25 years, if the member passes away and there is no spouse or upon the death of both the member and spouse. For those with special needs, the Disabled Children/Orphan Pension is available for the lifetime of the disabled child or orphan. The Nominee Pension ensures that a nominated person receives the pension for life, in cases where there is no family defined under EPS-95. Furthermore, a Pension to Dependent Father/Mother is available if the member dies and there is no family or nominee.
Members who exit service or reach superannuation but have not rendered the necessary service for a pension are eligible for a Withdrawal Benefit.
