Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:42:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday celebrated the establishment of the country’s 58th and Madhya Pradesh’s ninth Tiger Reserve, reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to wildlife protection and environmental conservation.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “Amazing news for wildlife lovers! India is blessed with wildlife diversity and a culture that celebrates wildlife. We will always be at the forefront of protecting animals and contributing to a sustainable planet.”
He also shared a post by Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who hailed the creation of the new Tiger Reserve.
“58th roar and counting! With historic emphasis laid on restoring the ecological diversity on planet Earth by PM Shri Narendra Modi ji, India continues to make great strides in environmental protection and wildlife conservation,” Yadav wrote.
“Thrilled to announce that the country has added the 58th Tiger Reserve to its tally with the latest entrant being Madhya Pradesh’s Madhav Tiger Reserve. This is MP’s 9th Tiger Reserve,” he added.
Yadav praised forest officials for their dedicated efforts, stating, “I congratulate all wildlife lovers and conservationists. The development is a testament to the relentless efforts of our forest officials who are selflessly working towards the cause.”
The newly designated Madhav Tiger Reserve is located in Shivpuri district in the Gwalior-Chambal region. It covers 1,751 square kilometres, with a core area of 375 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 1,276 square kilometres.
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, while speaking on Wednesday, emphasised the state’s continued commitment to wildlife conservation.
“Madhya Pradesh has not only retained the title of ‘Tiger State’ for having the highest number of tigers but is also taking progressive steps in the wildlife and tourism sector. With the addition of Madhav National Park, we now have nine Tiger Reserves in the state,” CM Yadav said.
He also congratulated the people of Madhya Pradesh for this achievement, calling it a proud moment for the state.
The newly added Madhav Tiger Reserve follows the recent designation of Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary, located between Bhopal and Raisen districts, as the state’s eighth Tiger Reserve.

Title: India, EU to hold next round of trade talks on March 10
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:39:09 +0000
Content: India and the European Union are scheduled to begin the next round of talks for a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) from Monday in Brussels with the aim of concluding the talks by the end of this year, a senior official said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had agreed to expedite the conclusion of the India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of the year at their meeting in Delhi last month.
“A free trade agreement between the EU and India would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world. I am well aware it will not be easy. But I also know that timing and determination count and that this partnership comes at the right moment for both of us,” Von der Leyen, said during her two-day visit to India.
Her statement came in the backdrop of massive tariff hikes proposed against all countries by US President Donald Trump under his ‘America First’ policy which is threatening to disrupt global trade and heighten uncertainty in the global economy.
PM Modi and the European Commission President committed to task their respective negotiating teams to pursue negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, and mutually beneficial FTA. Officials were asked to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers. They were also tasked to advance negotiations on an Agreement on Investment Protection and an Agreement on Geographical Indications.
Reaching a deal will be complex, however, with significant concessions wanted on both sides in areas ranging from cars and whisky to pharmaceuticals and textiles.
The EU wants India to lower tariffs on cars, wine, and whisky as well as some agricultural products. India, on the other hand, wants greater market access and lower tariffs for key exports, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, and apparel.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for 124 billion euros of trade in goods in 2023, or 12.2 per cent of total Indian trade. Trade in services between the EU and India reached nearly 60 billion euros in 2023, almost double the level in 2020. A third of that were digital services, according to figures compiled by the World Economic Forum.
The US and China account for 10.8 per cent and 10.5 per cent of total Indian trade, respectively. India, meanwhile, is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.2 per cent of the bloc’s trade, WEF figures show.
Trade between India and the EU has grown by around 90 per cent in the past decade, but talks over a free trade pact have stalled over the years due to sharp differences between India and the 27-nation bloc on agriculture, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Title: Iran will not negotiate under US ‘bullying’, Supreme Leader says
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:50:48 +0000
Content: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Iran will not be bullied into negotiations, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the country’s top authority urging Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal.
In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal” to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
At a meeting with senior Iranian officials, Khamenei said Washington’s aim was to “impose their own expectations,” Iranian state media reported.
“The insistence of some bullying governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues. … Talks for them is a pathway to have new demands, it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. … Iran will definitely not accept their expectations,” Khamenei was quoted as saying, without directly mentioning Trump.
In response to Khamenei’s comments, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated almost word for word the choice of negotiations or military action that Trump said he had presented to Iran.
“We hope the Iran Regime puts its people and best interests ahead of terror,” Hughes said in a statement.
While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” campaign that was applied during his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero.
During his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that had placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits.
U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said that time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade.
Tehran says its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes.
Khamenei, who has the last say on Iran’s key policies, said there was “no other way to stand against coercion and bullying”.
“They are bringing up new demands that certainly will not be accepted by Iran, like our defence capabilities, missile range and international influence,” he was quoted as saying.
Although Tehran says its ballistic missile programme is purely defensive, it is seen in the West as a destabilising factor in a volatile, conflict-ridden Middle East.
Tehran has in recent months announced new additions to its conventional weaponry, such as its first drone carrier and an underground naval base amid rising tensions with the U.S. and Israel.

Title: The Future of Healthcare: CIMR’s Research on Yoga as a Medical Therapy
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:40:16 +0000
Content: The Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research (CIMR) at AIIMS, New Delhi, is hosting its first international conference on ‘Advances in Integrative Medicine.’ This two-day event has convened experts from around the world to examine the synergy between traditional healing practices and modern medical science for improved healthcare outcomes. Since its establishment in 2016, CIMR has been a leading institution in integrative medicine research, particularly in validating the efficacy of yoga as a therapeutic intervention for neurological and cardiac conditions.
The conference focuses on the increasing acceptance of yoga as a credible and cost-effective therapy for neurological and cardiac conditions. Over the past eight years, CIMR has collaborated with 20 departments at AIIMS, conducting extensive research on the medical benefits of yoga. Their studies have been published in leading scientific journals, drawing interest from global medical communities.
During the conference, Dr. Gautam Sharma, Founder Professor in-charge of CIMR, shared significant findings on yoga’s health benefits. According to CIMR’s research, yoga has been scientifically proven to ease migraines, reduce episodes of syncope (temporary loss of consciousness due to a drop in blood pressure), and support heart health.
Dr. Sharma stated that their studies show yoga’s effectiveness as an add-on therapy, improving patients’ quality of life. Speaking with DD News, he explained, “We found that yoga reduced the severity of migraines in patients and significantly decreased syncope episodes in individuals who practiced yoga regularly.”
CIMR’s research has received recognition from prestigious global scientific organisations. Dr. Sharma was invited by the European Society of Cardiology to present CIMR’s findings on yoga’s role as a therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the American Heart Rhythm Society and the European Society of Cardiology have expressed keen interest in exploring yoga-based treatments further.
One of CIMR’s studies focused on the economic burden of vaso-vagal syncope, a condition where a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leads to fainting. A past study from the United States estimated that approximately 740,000 emergency visits and 460,000 hospital admissions occur annually due to vaso-vagal syncope, resulting in high financial costs.
CIMR’s research found that integrating yoga into treatment plans significantly reduced the occurrence of syncopal and pre-syncopal events. When combined with medical treatment, yoga proved to be more effective than medication alone. This suggests that yoga could serve as a cost-effective and safe alternative for managing syncope, potentially lowering the financial burden on healthcare systems.
CIMR’s research underscores the potential of yoga as a valuable addition to conventional medical treatments, particularly in managing syncope and other neurological and cardiac conditions. By integrating yoga into treatment plans, healthcare providers can offer a cost-effective, safe, and scientifically supported therapy that enhances patient outcomes. The first international conference on integrative medicine at AIIMS represents a pivotal moment in advancing holistic healthcare, fostering collaboration between traditional and modern medical sciences. With increasing global recognition and scientific validation, yoga is steadily emerging as a key component of contemporary healthcare, paving the way for a more integrative and patient-centered approach to medicine.

Title: Ensure adequate security to places of worship: India on Hindu temple vandalism in US
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:26:06 +0000
Content: India has condemned the vandalism at a Hindu temple in California, US, and called upon law enforcement authorities to take strict action against those responsible.
Terming such acts “despicable”, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday that the local authorities should ensure adequate security to places of worship.
Responding to media queries regarding vandalism at a Hindu Temple in California, Jaiswal said in a statement, “We have seen reports regarding the vandalism at a Hindu temple in Chino Hills, California. We condemn such despicable acts in the strongest terms. We call upon the local law enforcement authorities to take stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and also ensure adequate security to places of worship.”
A BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, one of the largest Hindu temples, located in Chino Hills, California, was vandalised with “anti-India” messages.
The official page of BAPS for the US shared the details of the incident on the social media platform X, saying that they will “never let hate take root” and that peace and compassion shall prevail.
In the X post, BAPS Public Affairs wrote, “In the face of another Mandir desecration, this time in Chino Hills, CA, the Hindu community stand steadfast against hate. Together with the community in Chino Hills and Southern California, we will never let hate take root. Our common humanity and faith will ensure that peace and compassion prevail.”
The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) also shared details of the incident on X and said the desecration of the iconic BAPS Temple in California comes ahead of the “so called Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles.
The ‘anti-Hindu’ messages included phrases such as ‘Hindus go back,’ alarming the local Hindu community.
In response, the community expressed its commitment to stand united. “Another Hindu Temple vandalised – this time the iconic BAPS temple in Chino Hills, CA. It’s just another day in a world where media and academics will insist there is no anti-Hindu hate and that #Hinduphobia is just a construct of our imagination. Not surprising this happens as the day for a so called “Khalistan referendum” in LA draws close.”
The post listed other recent cases of vandalism of temples from 2022 onward and gave a call for investigation into the matter.
The latest incident occurred less than 10 days after a similar incident at the BAPS Mandir in New York.

Title: Why Canada is jailing more Indigenous people despite Trudeau’s promises
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:01:25 +0000
Content: Like a growing number of formerly incarcerated Indigenous people, Marvin Starblanket’s life is still governed by Correctional Service Canada rules.
They determine where he sleeps (a halfway house instead of at home with his partner and children), when he clocks in for the night (10 p.m.), whether he drinks alcohol (he is prohibited), and the job he pursues.
The rules did not stop Starblanket, who is 42, from getting a pair of gray-scale tattoos on the backs of his hands: “Good” on the right, in curly script set against bars of heavenly light; and “Evil,” against a smokily stylized skull, on the left.
“Who wins?” he muses. “Depends which one you feed.”
Starblanket, a member of the Mistawasis First Nation, has led a life shaped by crime and substance use. He’s nearing the halfway point of a five-year supervisory order imposed after his most recent prison stint – just under six years for the hold-up of a convenience store with a Taser.
When Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office a decade ago, he pledged “a total renewal of the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples.” His Liberal Party committed to implementing recommendations from a government commission, which included eliminating within 10 years the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody.
With Trudeau due to step down as Liberal leader on Sunday, that overrepresentation has worsened. Indigenous people, who comprise 5% of Canada’s population, account for about one-third of federal inmates – compared to just over one-fifth in 2015.

High rates of Indigenous imprisonment are a problem in several Western nations. In the United States, Indigenous people are incarcerated at double the rate of Americans overall, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit think tank. In Australia, incarceration rates are 15 times higher for aboriginal peoples.
In Canada, the problem has defied attempts by the Liberal government to address it.
For this story, Reuters spoke to 50 people involved in Canada’s criminal justice system – lawyers, advocates, prison staff and former prisoners. They pointed to the imposition of post-release conditions on Indigenous people, a higher rate of parole denials and the use of mandatory minimum sentences, as playing an important part in their rising rates of incarceration.
The sharply higher supervision orders that Reuters is reporting for the first time were four times the rate of increase for white people.
Previously unreported Correctional Service data, obtained by Reuters through a freedom-of-information request, showed the number of Indigenous people in Canada subject to these strict conditions once they have completed prison sentences rose 53% during the decade ending in 2023-2024.
Trudeau’s office and Canada’s justice ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In 2022, Trudeau’s government repealed mandatory minimum sentences for some drug and weapons offenses, though they remain for other crimes.
Long-term supervision orders in Canada are meant to address rare cases of people who pose a risk to the public. Similar measures are used in the United States and United Kingdom, where they are generally used for sex offenders.
Some experts and former prisoners, including Starblanket, recognize there are benefits to such oversight.
“The longer periods of supervision bring with them more resources” such as drug treatment and psychological counselling, said Shabehram Lohrasbe, a doctor who assesses people in the criminal justice system, including those being considered for dangerous or long-term offender designations. But if they breach any of their conditions, or are seen as a risk, “he’s back in the can,” Lohrasbe said.
‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’
Lawyers and advocates told Reuters that Indigenous people may be seen as riskier because of higher rates of poverty, instability and untreated mental illness and disabilities; they may also be more prone, because of these factors, to build up lengthy rap sheets of less-serious violent offenses.
Indigenous people account for over a third of Canadian prisoners under such supervision orders, 328 out of 959 people, the data showed – slightly above their share of the prison population.

Once released under supervision orders, Indigenous people may struggle to stick to conditions because of “socioeconomic gaps,” such as high rates of unemployment in their communities, homelessness, substance use and past trauma, according to Leonard Marchand, Chief Justice of British Columbia and a member of the Okanagan Indian Band.
The Correctional Service data showed Indigenous people are overrepresented among those breaching the conditions of long-term supervision orders, putting them at greater risk of returning to jail. The bar for reincarceration is low: a former offender under a supervision order may be sent back to prison for 90 days if their parole officer believes they pose an “unmanageable risk” to the community.
“It kind of sets up an opportunity where you served your time but you’re still not free,” said lawyer Rob Dhanu, who has dealt with many such cases.
Advocates say better risk assessments that consider social circumstances could help steer Indigenous people away from supervision, and easier access to psychological treatment and Indigenous cultural programs might keep them from falling back into crime or substance use.
“We need to look at what works and what doesn’t work,” said Jonathan Rudin, program director of Aboriginal Legal Services, a service provider. “And jail, generally, has not worked for Indigenous people.”
Indigenous people are more likely to be incarcerated at every stage of their encounter with the criminal justice system, the data show. Before trial, they are more likely to be denied bail; and on conviction, they are more likely to be held in maximum security units – where there is limited access to rehabilitative programs that are often a prerequisite to gaining parole.
Indigenous people are more likely than white people to be denied full parole – even when their parole officer recommends it, according to Parole Board of Canada data obtained through a freedom-of-information request and analyzed by Reuters with the help of University of Toronto criminologist Anthony Doob.

Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Gary Anandasangaree acknowledged Canada has an Indigenous incarceration problem.
“There’s more than sufficient evidence to suggest that there is systemic racism within the correctional institutions, as well as the criminal justice system, that have often led to over-incarceration of Indigenous people,” he told Reuters. He cited the government’s work to eliminate some mandatory minimum sentences and said the justice system needed to give more weight to Indigenous offenders’ health needs and social history.
The opposition Conservative party, in a tightening race with Liberals ahead of a federal election this year, has adopted a hard line on crime. It has pledged to keep “violent criminals where they belong – behind bars,” Larry Brock, Shadow Minister for Justice and Attorney General, said in a statement to Reuters.
Brock did not comment on the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in prison. But he noted that Indigenous people themselves are often the victims of crime.
HISTORY OF TRAUMA
More than 30 lawyers, advocates and judges said that poverty and inter-generational trauma – when damaging events visited on one person transfer to their descendants and then snowball – stack the deck against Indigenous people.
Starblanket was five when his father died by suicide in police custody. Around the same time, according to court documents, Starblanket was abused by a male relative.
He was seven when he and his four siblings were taken into foster care after his mother, who was doing sex work at the time, was jailed for the manslaughter of a violent client, according to court transcripts. She was eventually pardoned.
Starblanket shuttled between his mother’s place and 15 foster homes in the Saskatoon and Regina areas, according to testimony in the court record.
Starblanket’s mother Beverley Johnston said she apologized to her children for what they went through.
“I felt bad for them that they ended up in foster,” she told Reuters.
A Statistics Canada study published last month found higher rates of physical and mental illness, economic hardship and homelessness among Indigenous people who spent time in government care as children. Indigenous children comprise more than half of all children in foster care in Canada.
At 16, Starblanket was criminally charged for the first time with robbery and assault after following his victim off a bus and heading-butting him twice, according to court documents. “I committed a senseless crime,” he says.
He was sentenced in 1999 to 13 months in custody.
Four days before Starblanket was sentenced, Canada’s Supreme Court issued a decision declaring the mass incarceration of Indigenous people “a crisis.” It urged the judicial system to take Indigenous people’s circumstances into account, including substance use or family breakdown.
Starblanket’s sentence was the first of 23 violent convictions, mostly for robberies and assault, many when he was drunk or using meth or cocaine, according to court records. He was convicted of punching his mother; biting and attempting to strangle a former partner; cutting a woman’s chin with a broken beer bottle; punching a hotel clerk; robbing two teens of $16.50.
In 2014, he and a woman were convicted of robbing a convenience store and threatening the clerk with a Taser, according to court records.
Three years later, Starblanket, then in prison, was designated a dangerous offender – someone who could be imprisoned indefinitely. The ruling cited a pattern of violent behavior and “a likelihood of causing injury or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons.”
Marchand, the Chief Justice of British Columbia, said the standardized risk assessments used in dangerous offender decisions factor in prior convictions and substance use, but do not account for the circumstances of Indigenous people. He did not comment on Starblanket’s case.
RELEASE
Starblanket’s lawyer, Mike Nolin, appealed the dangerous offender designation and in 2019 the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled the sentencing judge did not adequately consider the possibility of treating Starblanket for substance use and antisocial personality disorder. The dangerous offender designation was overturned.
Starblanket was released from prison in 2022 – but placed under a five-year supervision order.
After his release, Starblanket moved in with his partner under orders not to drink or do drugs, to attend treatment, and not to travel. The couple’s child, Anastasia, turns two on April 1.
Fourteen months into his long-term supervision order came what Starblanket calls “the slip”: He did meth.
He told his parole officer, knowing he would fail a drug test. His parole officer ordered him to move to the halfway house – a facility providing housing, meals and some services for people on day parole or supervision orders. Starblanket is required to check in three times a day.
For Starblanket, the restrictions grate – especially not being able to live at home with his family. But he also says he sees the support they can provide. He worries about how he will adjust when his long-term supervision order is up in November 2027. Above all, he wants to rebuild his life and avoid a return to prison.
“I don’t want to be asking for permission forever,” Starblanket said. “And I won’t be.”
Once free, he wants to go to university to study psychology, he said. He says he wants to be a voice for other Indigenous people caught up in the justice system. Maybe run a halfway house himself someday.

Title: US drops bid to make Google sell AI investments in antitrust case
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 05:39:23 +0000
Content: The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday dropped a proposal to force Alphabet’s Google GOOGL.O to sell its investments in artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI competitor Anthropic, to boost competition in online search.
The DOJ and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general still seek a court order requiring Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures aimed at addressing what a judge said was Google’s illegal search monopoly, according to court papers filed in Washington.
“The American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and ‘free’ online services. These values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist,” prosecutors wrote.
A spokesperson for Google said the “sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security.”
A spokesperson for Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Donald Trump has said he would continue a crackdown on Big Tech, which began during his first term and continued into former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump has tapped veteran antitrust attorney Gail Slater to lead the DOJ’s efforts.
Google holds a minority stake worth billions of dollars in Anthropic. Losing the investment would hand a competitive advantage to OpenAI and its partner Microsoft MSFT.O, Anthropic wrote to the court in February.
Evidence prosecutors obtained since making their draft recommendation in November showed a risk that banning Google from AI investments “could cause unintended consequences in the evolving AI space,” they said in the final proposal on Friday. They asked that Google be required to give prior notice to the government about future investments in generative AI.
Google, which has said it will appeal, has made its own proposal that would loosen agreements with Apple AAPL.O and others to set Google as the default search engine on new devices. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April.
The blockbuster case is one of several U.S. antitrust cases against Big Tech companies. Apple, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O also face allegations of maintaining illegal monopolies in their respective markets.
Since Trump’s reelection, Google has sought to make the case that the DOJ’s approach in the case would hobble the company’s ability to compete in AI and “jeopardize America’s global economic and technological leadership.”
Many of the measures prosecutors proposed in November remain intact with a few tweaks.
For example, a requirement that Google share search query data with competitors now says that Google can charge a marginal fee for access and that the competitors must not pose a national security risk.
The proposal drew statements of support from Democratic and Republican attorneys general as well as the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.

Title: Making up for many things we could & should have done earlier says EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:40:33 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Saturday inaugurated a new Consulate General of India in Manchester, the United Kingdom, and said that “India was making up for many things that perhaps the country could and should have done earlier”.
He also said that the opening of Consulate General in Manchester was symbolic of the importance of the growing diaspora in the region and a sign of things to come, including an India-UK Free Trade Agreement.
The EAM said it was apt that Vishakha Yaduvanshi takes over her role as India’s newest Consul General on International Women’s Day, reflective of the strides the government has made in putting women’s issues at the centre of policy.
Speaking to IANS at the occasion, EAM Jaishankar said, “I completely agree that nothing could be more fitting than for a Consul General to inaugurate her consulate on this day. So it wasn’t just in time; we actually got the day right. Let me reflect for a moment on what this occasion really means to us. In some ways, it’s about the past—we are making up for many things that perhaps we could and should have done earlier…”
He also said, “Now, already, I can see, you know, Manchester is hugely invested in India and the other way around. I’m told that the trade with this region is about 700 million pounds, that there are 300, more than perhaps 300 Indian firms here…”
The EAM said, “Today, when we look at where that approach has taken us, a few years ago or two years ago, to be precise, we held the G20 presidency. We undertook a number of initiatives, and it was a particularly challenging presidency at that time. The world was highly polarised, and people were unwilling to sit together. However, among our achievements, aside from securing the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20, one of our proudest was the adoption of the concept of women-led development by the G20…”
In a post on social media platform X, the EAM wrote: “Very pleased to inaugurate our 4th Consulate in the UK, in Manchester. Thanks Deputy PM@AngelaRayner, Minister @CatherineWest1, Deputy Mayor Paul Dennett and MP @NavPMishra for joining us.”
In another X post, EAM Jaishankar said: “Good to meet Deputy PM @AngelaRayner today in Manchester. Her encouragement has been a contribution to setting up of our Consulate. Also discussed India-UK bilateral ties and our efforts on increasing trade and people-to-people exchanges. This step delivers on the longstanding desire of our community and friends of India in Manchester. Confident that this latest addition to our presence in the UK will strengthen people to people, cultural, trade and, of course, cricket ties.”
The EAM followed up the official opening of the consulate building in Stockport, Greater Manchester, with a celebratory diaspora reception at the Old Trafford stadium, where he interacted with members of the Lancashire Cricket Club’s women’s team members before they leave for Bengaluru for a pre-season tour next week.
“My first visit to Manchester here today, in a formal way, is an acknowledgement of how much this relationship has matured in the last four decades,” said EAM Jaishankar.
“But and I want to say this with great emphasis, it is equally a preparation for what is to come – a much deeper, closer partnership between India and the United Kingdom. Clearly, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is very much at the heart of that in the near term.”
“But we look at a Free Trade Agreement not simply as a trade or even investment understanding between us, but as something much bigger, really a game changer, symbolic shift to a higher orbit of relationship,” he said.
The Union Minister said he wanted to “applaud” the contribution of the Indian community in building the relationship be…

Title: Gill Confident as India Prepare for Champions Trophy Final
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:32:20 +0000
Content: Indian Cricket team’s vice-captain Shubman Gill expressed optimism about his team’s chances in the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, scheduled for tomorrow at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Saturday, Gill emphasized that India’s T20 World Cup victory in 2024 has removed some pressure from the squad as they approach another major final.
“Winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry, but I think it kind of makes us more balanced,” Gill told reporters. “Yes, we have won an ICC title, and we’ll try to do our best to win this one.”
The 25-year-old batter, who is in his second ICC tournament final with India after the 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia, highlighted the importance of managing pressure in crucial matches.
“The pressure of big matches is definitely there,” Gill acknowledged. “In such matches, the team that handles the pressure well, that takes out the occasion and doesn’t think that we’re playing the final, their chances of winning are better.”
Gill praised the current Indian batting lineup as the best he has been part of, featuring cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli at the top of the order.
“Rohit and Virat are all-time one-day greats in the world,” he said. “Rohit is one of the best openers in white ball cricket. And Virat is one of the best ODI batsmen ever.”
The vice-captain also emphasized the crucial role experienced players like Kohli played in India’s victory in the semifinal. “We saw Virat in the last match because he has played so many important matches for India, played so many finals, so many semi-finals,” Gill noted. “The more you are in that situation and the more you have handled the pressure, you know that you have already done this.”
Gill dismissed concerns about captain Rohit Sharma’s recent streak of losing tosses, stating that the team is always prepared regardless of whether they bat or bowl first. He also rejected speculation about Sharma’s retirement after the tournament, saying, “He has not spoken to me or to the team about this decision. I don’t think Rohit is thinking about it.”
When asked about pitch conditions for the final, Gill expressed confidence in the team’s adaptability. “We haven’t really seen a 300 score here as yet,” he said. “I think we as a team have got a good idea of how to play on those kind of wickets and how to bowl on those kinds of wickets.”
India will face New Zealand in the final on Sunday, having already defeated them earlier in the tournament. A victory would give India their second consecutive ICC trophy following last year’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies.

Title: UAE leaders laud women’s contributions on International Women’s Day
Publication Date: Sun, 09 Mar 2025 04:24:42 +0000
Content: The United Arab Emirates commemorated International Women’s Day with a wave of tributes from its highest leadership, recognizing the pivotal role women play in shaping both national and global progress.
President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a message shared on social media platform X, expressed profound gratitude. “On International Women’s Day, we celebrate the contributions of all women in fostering lasting progress and development to uplift society,” he stated. “To women in the UAE and around the world, we express our sincere gratitude as you continue to inspire future generations through your pivotal impact and achievements in all fields.”
Echoing these sentiments, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, also took to X, highlighting women’s enduring strength and contributions. “On International Women’s Day, we celebrate women’s giving, strength, sacrifices, and contributions to building societies and countries. Women are the secret of life, its story, and its soul. They are the educators of generations and the creators of heroes.”
The nation’s celebration aligned with the 2025 United Nations theme, “For all women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,” reinforcing the UAE’s steadfast commitment to advancing women’s empowerment. Officials emphasized the nation’s “full speed” progress in this area, citing significant strides in sustainable development.
The UAE government has consistently prioritized women’s issues, recognizing their crucial role as partners in achieving comprehensive development. This year, Emirati women’s contributions across various sectors have been instrumental in significant national achievements.The UAE’s progress was further underscored by its rise to seventh position globally and its continued regional leadership in the 2024 Gender Inequality Index, published by the United Nations Development Programme.
Recent milestones include the expansion of women’s representation in government with the appointment of Sana bint Mohammed Suhail as Minister of Family, following the ministry’s establishment. The launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Women’s Health marked another significant step, ensuring comprehensive healthcare services for women throughout their lives.Economic empowerment remained a key focus, with the Ministry of Economy mandating that private joint-stock companies allocate at least one board seat to women upon the conclusion of current board terms.
The UAE also solidified its international commitment to gender equality through a strategic partnership with UN Women, formalized in March 2024. This collaboration includes a $15 million investment over three-and-a-half years, aimed at bolstering women’s status worldwide and supporting the UN Women Liaison Office for the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Title: India’s enduring legacy in UN peacekeeping
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 07:00:23 +0000
Content: India has been a consistent participant in United Nations peacekeeping operations, contributing personnel and resources to support global security efforts. External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar has said that India’s foreign policy prioritizes peacekeeping through dialogue, diplomacy, and cooperation. He emphasized that India remains committed to contributing meaningfully to UN peacekeeping in line with the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which underscores the belief that the world is one family.
UN peacekeeping serves as a vital mechanism for maintaining global security, encompassing efforts such as facilitating political processes, protecting civilians, disarmament, and ensuring human rights. Modern peacekeeping has evolved into a multidimensional endeavor, integrating military, political, and humanitarian efforts.
Since its first deployment in 1953 during the Korean Peninsula mission, India has been one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping. Over 290,000 Indian personnel have served in more than 50 missions, and currently, over 5,000 Indian peacekeepers are deployed in nine active operations. These include missions in Lebanon, South Sudan, Congo, Cyprus, and the Golan Heights.
These deployments include infantry battalions, medical units, engineering contingents, military observers, and police units. The commitment of Indian peacekeepers has been recognized time and again, with many having made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In 2023, the UN posthumously awarded the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal to Indian peacekeepers who lost their lives while serving in the Congo, a testament to their dedication and courage.
Beyond deployment, India has also played a vital role in training and capacity-building initiatives for peacekeepers. The Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in India trains over 12,000 troops annually and provides specialized courses for both Indian and international personnel.
India has also emerged as a global leader in promoting gender equality within peacekeeping operations. Despite women comprising less than 10 percent of the UN’s 70,000 uniformed peacekeepers, India has been at the forefront of increasing female participation. In 2007, it became the first country to deploy an all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU) in Liberia, setting a precedent for gender inclusion in peacekeeping missions.
Today, over 150 Indian women peacekeepers serve in key missions across Congo, South Sudan, Lebanon, and other conflict zones, playing a crucial role in fostering peace and security. Their presence has significantly enhanced engagement with local communities, particularly in protecting vulnerable populations and advancing peacebuilding efforts.
Recognition for India’s female peacekeepers has also been growing on the global stage. Major Radhika Sen was honored as the UN’s Military Gender Advocate of the Year 2023 for her contributions to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in peacekeeping. India continues to advocate for greater gender parity in military and police deployments, with its women peacekeepers playing an instrumental role in preventing sexual violence, building trust, and empowering women and girls in conflict-ridden areas.
India’s commitment to peacekeeping extends beyond personnel contributions. The country has provided state-of-the-art, indigenously manufactured equipment and technology to UN missions, enhancing operational efficiency in challenging environments. This technological support has been instrumental in improving logistics, surveillance, and strategic deployment in conflict zones.
As a leader in global peacekeeping, India’s approach is deeply rooted in its principles of non-violence, cooperation, and collective security. Through its extensive contributions, India has set international benchmarks in peacekeeping operations, from training future peacekeepers to championing gender inclusivity. With its continued presence in missions worldwide, India remains steadfast in its commitment to global peace and stability, reinforcing its role as a key player in international conflict resolution.

Title: Swiatek and Rybakina serve up bagels en route to victories at Indian Wells
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:53:13 +0000
Content: Defending champion Iga Swiatek crushed Dayana Yastremska 6-0 6-2 and 2023 champion Elena Rybakina powered past Britain’s Katie Boulter 6-0 7-5 to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells on Sunday with displays of dominance.
Swiatek, seeded second, is aiming to become the first woman to win the tournament three times and the Polish player looked eager to do so in as little time on court as possible, reeling off 10 games in a row and needing just 65 minutes to see off her Ukrainian opponent.
“At the end I got a bit tired, it’s always hard to finish a match like that but I’m happy that I kept my intensity up in the last game to close it,” she said.
“I had control from the beginning so I’m happy with the performance for sure.”
It was Swiatek’s second bagel set of the tournament after she overwhelmed Caroline Garcia 6-2 6-0 in her first match.
The five-times major champion has not won a title since her triumph at Roland Garros in 2024, her longest drought since winning her first major title in 2020.
She served a one-month suspension in October for a failed drug test and has seen Aryna Sabalenka take her world number one ranking but said the California desert is an ideal setting to get back to winning ways.
“It’s amazing, I love coming here,” she said.
“I already have my routine so it feels like home. It’s for sure the place to be and a great place to play tennis.”
Swiatek will face 15th seed Karolina Muchova in the round of 16 after the Czech player beat her compatriot Katerina Siniakova in the afternoon.
After cruising through the first set, Rybakina fell behind 5-3 in the second before regrouping.
She stretched to hit a sensational defensive shot in a game where she broke back for 5-5 and broke again on match point to seal the win.
Rybakina, who missed last year’s tournament due to an illness, will play ninth-seeded teenager Mirra Andreeva in a rematch of their Dubai semi-final, which the Russian won in three sets en route to becoming the youngest player to win a WTA 1000 title.
Andreeva is coached by former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, who the 17-year-old said was keeping her focused.
“She already told me that she booked a court at 12 p.m.,” she told reporters after her night match. “I see not much time passed from the match… she’s just like this, but it’s not bad.”
Ukrainian Elina Svitolina upset 14th seed Danielle Collins 6-2 6-4 and will face another American, fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the next round after she breezed past China’s Wang Xinyu 6-2 6-1.

Title: Cricket fraternity celebrates India’s Champions Trophy win as Rohit’s side relishes new found glory
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:46:55 +0000
Content: The cricket fraternity extended its congratulations to India for its exemplary performance under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy and head coach Gautam Gambhir’s guidance, which led to their third Champions Trophy title on Sunday.
In front of a sold-out crowd and a pulsating atmosphere, India effortlessly chased down a competitive 252-run total against New Zealand. The ‘Men in Blue’ stamped its authority and sealed a four-wicket triumph with an over to spare, adding another ICC title to its cabinet.
As the Indian camp experienced euphoria and wrote another chapter of success in its rich history, social media was flooded with reactions from former cricketers celebrating the famous triumph.
“It was a privilege, in my role as @ICC Chair, to award Rohit Sharma the 2025 #ChampionsTrophy. His inspiring leadership and game-high 76 were critical in India’s win over a gallant New Zealand in the Final,” ICC Chairman Jay Shah said in a post on X.
Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who missed the tournament due to a lower back injury, was ecstatic after India got its hands on the title with a “deserved” victory.
“Played like true champions! Congratulations to the entire team on a wonderful tournament and a well-deserved win!” Bumrah wrote on Instagram.
India’s head coach, Gautam Gambhir, extended wishes to the entire nation and wrote on Instagram, “Congratulations to 1.4 billion Indians! Jai Hind.”
India’s legendary opener Virender Sehwag extended wishes to the title-winning, saying, “After 11 years, a multi-year break out in June 2024 with the T20 WC win, and within 8 months, another ICC title for us—a third Champions Trophy win. Congratulations, Team.”
Former spinner Harbhajan Singh said, “HINDUSTAN ZINDABAD! WELL DONE, TEAM INDIA #ChampionsTrophy2025.”
“Rohit Sharma is a true leader—always bringing the team together and looking out for his players. He pushes everyone to be their best and truly deserves all the success and more!”, former all-rounder Irfan Pathan said in a post on X.
Ex-batter Wasim Jaffer said, “Champions! Congratulations Rohit and Team India, no praise high enough for the best in the business #ChampionsTrophy.”
Legendary India batter Sachin Tendulkar extended his wishes and wrote on X, “Champions Trophy CHAMPION…. Yeeeeehhhh.”
Former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh penned a heartfelt note for India and its star-studded players and wrote on X, “What a game and what a final! The Champions Trophy comes home. Outstanding captaincy by hitman @ImRo45, who led from the front all through the tournament—he is blessed with the Midas touch when it comes to ICC white-ball tournaments! Successful games for @ShreyasIyer15, @ShubmanGill, @klrahul, @hardikpandya7, who stepped up when needed and showed nerves of steel under pressure.”
“@imjadeja, @imkuldeep18, @akshar2026, #VarunChakaravarthy spun magic all through the tournament, and @MdShami11 was relentless with the ball! Tough luck @BLACKCAPS, you had us on the edge till the very end. But this was our tournament! #ChampionsTrophy2025 #INDvNZ,” he added.
The wishes poured in from across the globe, as former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson clearly said India “thoroughly” deserved to win the title.
“Thoroughly deserved win from India. Your quartet of spinners were outstanding today to squeeze NZ to a below-par score. NZ fought hard as expected, and after a fine campaign, they were beaten by a better team on the day… that’s sport,” Hesson wrote on X.
Former England cricketer Michael Vaughan labeled India as the best white-ball team in the world and wrote on X, “Let’s be honest, India are the best team in the world in white-ball cricket by a decent margin… Thoroughly deserved to win… T20 holders/Champions Trophy holders… Now, down to the rest to try and catch up… #India.”
The ‘Rawalpindi Express,’ Shoaib Akhtar, showered praise on the Champions Trophy winners, saying, “The best team of the tournament has won the Champions Trophy. That too without dropping a single match!!”

Title: Trump says US talking to four different groups on sale of TikTok
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:28:20 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that his administration was in touch with four different groups about the sale of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, and that all options were good.
TikTok’s fate has been up in the air since a law requiring its owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on January 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.
Asked if there was going to soon be a deal on TikTok, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One, “it could.”
“We’re dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it … all four are good,” he added.
TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment outside of normal business hours.
The turmoil at TikTok has attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion.

Title: Zelenskiy heads to Saudi Arabia ahead of crunch US talks
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:55:47 +0000
Content: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travels to Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, ahead of talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials on ending the war with Russia at an increasingly precarious moment for Kyiv.
The United States, once Ukraine’s main ally, has upended its wartime policies in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while cutting off military assistance and intelligence sharing for Kyiv.
Zelenskiy is expected to meet Mohammed bin Salman, whose Saudi Arabia has played various mediating roles since Russia’s 2022 invasion, including brokering prisoner exchanges and hosting talks between Russia and the United States last month.
Tuesday’s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials – the first official meeting since a disastrous Oval Office encounter between Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump – are expected to focus on a bilateral minerals deal and how to end the war.
Under huge pressure from Trump, who wants the war ended at lightning speed, Zelenskiy has been at pains to show they are on the same page, despite failing to win promises of U.S. security guarantees that Kyiv sees as vital for any peace deal.
Zelenskiy has said he will not attend the talks with U.S. officials and that the Ukrainian delegation will include his chief of staff, his foreign and defence ministers and a top military official in the presidential administration.
“On our side, we are fully committed to constructive dialogue, and we hope to discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X.
“Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively.”
FRAMEWORK FOR AN AGREEMENT
Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been arranging the talks, has said the idea was to “get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well”.
Zelenskiy has called for a truce in the air and at sea, as well as a prisoner exchange, in what he says could be a test of Russia’s commitment to ending the war.
Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France, saying it was a bid to buy time for Kyiv and prevent its military collapse.
The Ukrainian leader has also said Kyiv was ready to sign the minerals deal with the U.S. that would create a joint fund from the sale of Ukrainian minerals, and which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing.
With U.S. support in question, Zelenskiy has been urging his European allies to ramp up their support as Kyiv’s battlefield position deteriorates and it faces mounting pressure to retreat from Russia’s Kursk region.
Ukrainian troops that stormed into the Kursk region last summer are nearly surrounded by Russian forces, open source maps show.
Russia holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, and its troops are also pressing in the eastern Donetsk region, having ramped up drone and missile strikes on cities and towns far from the front.
Russia has launched 1,200 aerial guided bombs, nearly 870 attack drones and more than 80 missiles at Ukraine in the past week alone, Zelenskiy has said.

Title: Mark Carney, crisis-fighting central banker, to lead Canada through US trade war
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:48:02 +0000
Content: Mark Carney, soon to become Canada’s new prime minister, is a two-time central banker and crisis fighter about to face his biggest challenge of all: steering Canada through Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The Liberals announced Carney as Justin Trudeau’s successor on Sunday after party members voted in a nominating contest. Trudeau resigned in January, facing low approval ratings after nearly a decade in office.
The 59-year-old Carney is a political outsider who has never held office, which would in normal times have killed his candidacy in Canada. But distance from Trudeau and a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, and Carney argues he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.
“I know how to manage crises … in a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,” Carney said during a leadership debate late last month.
Carney was born in Fort Smith in the remote Northwest Territories. He attended Harvard where he played college level ice hockey, starring as a goalkeeper.
Carney, who garnered the most party endorsements and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates, will soon be the first person to become Canadian prime minister without being a legislator and without having had any cabinet experience.
He argues Canada must fight Trump’s tariffs with dollar for dollar retaliation and diversify trading relations in the medium term.
In the next election, which must be held by October 20, the Liberals will face off against the official opposition Conservatives, whose leader Pierre Poilievre is a career politician with little international exposure.
By contrast, Carney is a globetrotter who spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top finance ministry job and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of just 42.
Carney won praise for his handling of the financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record low levels for a specific period of time.
Even at that stage, rumors swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.
“Why don’t I become a circus clown?” he told a reporter in 2012 when asked about possible political ambitions.
The Bank of England was impressed enough though to poach him in 2013, making him the first non-British governor in the central bank’s three-century history, and the first person to ever head two G7 central banks. Britain’s finance minister at the time, George Osborne, called Carney the “outstanding central bank governor of his generation”.
Carney, though, had a challenging time, forced to face zero inflation and the political chaos of Brexit.
He struggled to deploy his trademark policy of signaling the likely path of interest rates. The bank said its guidance came with caveats but media often interpreted it as more of a guarantee, with Labour legislator Pat McFadden dubbing the bank under Carney as an “unreliable boyfriend.”
When sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.
“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” said Ana Botin, Santander’s executive chairman, in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.
‘HIGH PRIEST OF PROJECT FEAR’
But he infuriated Brexit supporters by talking about the economic damage that he said was likely to be caused by leaving the European Union. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear” but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.
Carney also showed irritation with his predecessor in the job, Mervyn King, whom he said had not spotted the risks building in the financial sector before the 2007-08 financial crisis.
From 2011 to 2018 Carney also headed the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies.
After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, Carney served as a United Nations envoy on finance and climate change.
After launching the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021 to act as an umbrella group for financial sector efforts to get to net-zero emissions, Carney oversaw a surge in membership as boards rushed to signal a willingness to act.
As the implications of moving to renewable energy began to filter down to the real economy, though, a political backlash from some Republican states accusing companies of breaching anti-trust rules ultimately led a number of large U.S. companies to drop their membership.
He also served on the board of Brookfield Asset Management and was chair of the Bloomberg board but resigned as the U.N. special envoy and left all commercial posts after he launched his bid for the Liberal leadership on January 16.
Carney’s lack of political experience showed when the Conservatives pressed him over a decision by Brookfield to move its headquarters from Canada to the United States. Carney said the move took place after he resigned in January but the Conservatives found a letter he wrote to shareholders in December 2024 recommending the move.
“Sometimes I answer questions that go into details when I should keep it at a higher level. That’s part of the problem with not being a politician,” he told reporters when asked about Conservative allegations he had lied.

Title: India-Japan joint military exercise “Dharma Guardian” concludes successfully in Japan
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 05:36:16 +0000
Content: The 6th edition of the India-Japan joint military exercise, Dharma Guardian, concluded successfully at the East Fuji Training Area in Japan on March 9. Held from February 24 to March 9, the exercise marked a significant milestone in the bilateral defense cooperation between the two nations. The exercise was conducted at an enhanced scale with participation from troops at the company-strength level, further strengthening the defense relationship between India and Japan.
The closing ceremony was attended by Lieutenant General Toriumi Seiji, the Commanding General of the Japan Ground Self-Defence Force (JGSDF) 1st Division. He conveyed his appreciation to the participating troops for successfully meeting the objectives of the exercise. Expressing satisfaction with the joint training, General Toriumi emphasized the exercise’s role in improving the operational readiness of both armed forces, enhancing mutual understanding, and fostering greater cooperation between India and Japan’s defense forces.
The primary focus of Exercise Dharma Guardian was on counter-terrorism operations in urban terrain, a key area of collaboration between the two nations. The exercise also included activities related to **United Nations peacekeeping operations**, such as **Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR)**. Throughout the course of the training, the troops engaged in tactical drills, exchanged knowledge on operational conduct, and forged lasting ties of friendship and trust.
In addition to the military training, cultural exchange activities were also held, showcasing the bonds between the two countries. The Indian contingent conducted a special Yoga session for the Japanese side, while the Indian troops demonstrated Kalari Pattu, a traditional martial art, and the Japanese troops showcased their own martial arts.
The exercise culminated in a 72-hour validation phase, during which both sides conducted a simulated joint counter-terrorism operation in an urban setting. The operation involved specialized techniques, including heli-borne insertion, slithering, and storming, and was a successful demonstration of the troops’ operational capabilities. Both nations met the desired operational standards, marking the final phase of the exercise as a significant achievement.
Dharma Guardian provided a unique opportunity for both India and Japan to learn from each other’s best practices in joint operations. The exercise reaffirmed the shared commitment of both countries to regional peace, security, and stability, further solidifying their longstanding defense partnership.

Title: Syria’s Sharaa scrambles to contain deadliest violence in years
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 04:45:13 +0000
Content: Syria’s leader vowed on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of violent clashes pitting loyalists of deposed President Bashar al-Assad against the country’s new Islamist rulers and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped their authority.
The clashes, which a war monitoring group said had already killed over 1,000 people, mostly civilians, continued for a fourth day in Assad’s coastal heartland.
In a speech broadcast on national television and posted on social media, Ahmed Sharaa, whose rebel movement toppled Assad in December, accused Assad loyalists and foreign powers that he did not name of trying to foment unrest.
“Today, as we stand at this critical moment, we find ourselves facing a new danger – attempts by remnants of the former regime and their foreign backers to incite new strife and drag our country into a civil war, aiming to divide it and destroy its unity and stability,” he said.
The top commander of a Syrian Kurdish armed group, whose forces are in a separate battle with Turkey, had earlier blamed Turkish-backed Islamist factions for some of the most disturbing violence: the reported executions of civilians belonging to Assad’s Alawite sect. Turkey did not immediately respond to the allegation.
At the United Nations in New York, diplomats said the United States and Russia have asked the Security Council to meet behind closed doors on Monday over the escalating violence in Syria.
Interim President Sharaa’s office said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides. Syrians have circulated graphic videos of executions by fighters. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.
“We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” Sharaa added in the video speech after earlier calling for national unity.

Title: CWG Federation rebranded as Commonwealth Sport
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:14:02 +0000
Content: The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has changed its name to Commonwealth Sports under the ‘More in Common’ brand campaign. The announcement was made on the occasion of Commonwealth Day, an annual celebration of the Commonwealth of Nations held on the second Monday in March.
“Commonwealth Day also marks the date we transition from a Sports Federation to a Sport Movement, Commonwealth Sport becoming our public name,” the governing body said in a statement.
Katie Sadleir, CEO, Commonwealth Sport said, “The evolution to a Movement that is Commonwealth Sport allows us to demonstrate a stronger, more unified purpose that resonates with our audience on a deeper level.”
“It will help us more clearly communicate our role of not only delivering the powerful platform of the Commonwealth Games – which allows us to share success and transform inspiration into impact – but also championing the exceptional work that goes on across our 74 nations and territories every day.
“This transformation enables greater collaboration, more impactful messaging, and an amplified sense of belonging for those who align with our cause,” she added. “The Commonwealth Sport logo with its celebration mark has been in use for some time. The three coloured V shapes represent our three values, Humanity, Equality, and Destiny, rising to the six points representing our six Regions of Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, and Oceania, reflecting the rich diversity of our cultures, coming together through the power of sport,” she added.
The Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games is the first edition of the Games to incorporate this logo into the event mark.
The Commonwealth Day also marks the launch of the Commonwealth Sport King’s Baton Relay at Buckingham Place, starting the relay with 500 days to go to the Opening Ceremony of Glasgow 2026.

Title: Capex boom ahead in India, infra projects to accelerate at state level: Jefferies
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:32:10 +0000
Content: There has been a significant increase in capital expenditure in India, with growth expected to continue in the coming months as several sectors witness strong investments, according to a new report by global brokerage Jefferies.
Mahesh Nandurkar, Head of Research and Managing Director at Jefferies, expects capital expenditure growth to remain robust in February and March.
This aligns with the government’s revised budget estimates, indicating a continued push for infrastructure and industrial development.
“These are on expected lines, but the fact that it’s happening gives confidence,” said Nandurkar.
The central government’s capital expenditure rose by 51 percent year-on-year in January 2025, reflecting its commitment to strengthening the country’s infrastructure.
The government’s focus on railways and road projects has helped achieve significant progress, with around 83-87 percent of the financial year 2025 revised estimates already completed for these sectors.
Nandurkar said that one needs to take a more of a calibrated approach. The market is cautious on private capex.
“I believe that private capex is already happening in sectors like cement, steel, hospital and real estate,” he added.
The government’s commitment to capital expenditure remains strong, with transfers to states rising by approximately 60 percent.
This financial support is expected to further accelerate infrastructure projects at the state level, boosting overall economic growth.
Jefferies also highlighted strong growth potential in key sectors. One of them was metal stocks, highlighting strong momentum in the sector.
The brokerage also pointed out that the Asian steel spread remains 20 percent below its long-term average, leaving room for potential expansion.
Additionally, Indian steel prices have risen by 5 percent from their December lows, signalling a recovery in the sector.
Jefferies further stated that any potential safeguard duty on steel could provide additional support to prices, improving margins and boosting valuations for metal companies.
With improving fundamentals and favourable market conditions, the metal sector is expected to continue its strong performance in the coming months, the brokerage firm stated.

Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:31:57 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar concluded his official visit to the United Kingdom from March 4-9, at the invitation of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. During this period, he also visited Ireland from March 6-7, reinforcing India’s growing international engagements.
The foreign minister held a series of high-level meetings with key UK leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, among others. He engaged with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government officials, businesses, academia, and the Indian diaspora.
Strengthening Diplomatic and Trade Ties
Jaishankar conveyed warm greetings from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to UK PM Starmer. The two leaders recognised the growing momentum in India-UK relations, particularly highlighting the resumption of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. They also noted the significant strengthening of cooperation in technology and people-to-people exchanges. Additionally, their discussions touched on key global issues including the ongoing Ukraine conflict, underscoring a shared commitment to addressing major geopolitical challenges together.
The foreign minister also held extensive talks with Foreign Secretary Lammy at Chevening House, where the two leaders reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations. Discussions covered a wide range of areas, including strategic coordination, political cooperation, trade negotiations, education, technology, mobility, and people-to-people exchanges. Both sides are working on an updated “Roadmap 2.0” to inject fresh energy and momentum into the India-UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
Trade, Business, and Security Cooperation
Jaishankar’s meeting with Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds focused on the progress of the India-UK FTA negotiations. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to boosting trade and investment opportunities, including efforts to reduce trade barriers and expand market access for both nations.

Title: Indian pharma market to grow 8-9 per cent in FY26: report
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:23:39 +0000
Content: The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow 8-9 per cent year-on-year in FY26, according to a report on Monday.
The report by India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said the growth in the sector will be at 7.5-8.0 per cent year-on-year for FY25.
This is “against 6.5 per cent year-on-year in FY24 and 9.9 per cent YoY growth in FY23,” said Krishnanath Munde, associate director at India Ratings and Research.
In February, the pharma market delivered revenue growth of 7.5 per cent year-on-year. This growth was driven by price growth (5.2 per cent YoY) and new launches (2.4 per cent YoY), while volume growth remained muted at negative 0.2 per cent YoY, the report said.
The sector reported growth at an average of 7.3 per cent year-to-date (YTD) in FY25. This was led by price growth (5.5 per cent), new launches growth (2.7 per cent), and volume growth.
Further, the moving annual total (MAT) — or the 12-month rolling sales of overall pharma products — saw an 8.1 per cent surge in February, the report said. Cardiac therapies outperformed growth in the pharma market with 10.8 per cent growth in MAT and a 13.7 per cent increase in monthly market share. This was followed by gastroenterology, neurology/Central Nervous System, and dermatology.
On the other hand, anti-infectives, respiratory, and gynaecology therapies saw weaker growth in February, the report said.
Meanwhile, another recent report showed that the pharma sector in the country is witnessing rapid production growth. The Indian pharma sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR and has also seen a 9 per cent increase in export rates in 2024, according to the report by McKinsey & Company.
Expanding its capabilities in APIs and biotechnology, the sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR, twice the global average. The country also emerged as the world’s largest supplier of generic medicines, with a 9 per cent pharma export growth rate, nearly double the global average, the report said.

Title: Over 50% women among 30.68 crore workers registered on e-Shram potal
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:21:33 +0000
Content: More than 30.68 crore unorganised workers have registered for social welfare benefits on the government’s e-Shram portal, with women accounting for 53.68% of the total registrants as of March 3. This information was shared by Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The government launched the e-Shram portal on August 26, 2021, with the objective of creating a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW), seeded with Aadhaar. The portal provides registered workers with a Universal Account Number (UAN) on a self-declaration basis, enabling them to access various social security schemes. Expanding on this initiative, the Ministry of Labour and Employment launched the e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution on October 21, 2024, aligning with the budgetary vision of integrating multiple welfare schemes into a single digital platform.
The e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution integrates 13 central government schemes, allowing unorganised workers to access benefits through a unified platform. These schemes include Pradhan Mantri Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM-SVANidhi), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), and Ayushman Bharat, among others. The integration allows registered workers to track the benefits availed through the portal, streamlining access to social security provisions.
To enhance accessibility, the e-Shram portal introduced multilingual functionality on January 7, incorporating the Bhashini platform to support 22 Indian languages. This initiative aims to make the portal more inclusive, enabling workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to engage with the platform seamlessly.
Additionally, on February 24, the Ministry launched the e-Shram mobile application, which provides real-time access to welfare schemes integrated with the portal. The application is designed to improve convenience for workers, allowing them to stay informed about available benefits and access them directly from their mobile devices.
Efforts to promote awareness about e-Shram and its associated services include periodic review meetings with state governments and regular interactions with Common Services Centres (CSCs). The government has also integrated e-Shram with the National Career Service (NCS) and Skill India Digital Portal to provide employment and skill development opportunities. Furthermore, to facilitate enrolment in pension schemes, the portal is linked to the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandan (PMSYM) scheme.
In a bid to enhance discovery and accessibility of government schemes, e-Shram is also integrated with the myScheme portal, ensuring workers can find relevant welfare programs with ease. An SMS campaign has been initiated to create further awareness among unorganised workers regarding the benefits available to them through the platform.

Title: North Korea fires missiles after slamming US-South Korea drills
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:18:55 +0000
Content: North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles on Monday, hours after condemning the South Korean and U.S. militaries for launching drills that Pyongyang called a “dangerous provocative act” that risked accidentally sparking a confrontation.
South Korea’s military said the missiles were fired from North Korea’s western region toward the Yellow Sea. The launch was the first reported ballistic missile test since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.
The missiles were believed to be close range ballistic missiles, a South Korean defence ministry official said, referring to a type of weapon with a range of under 300 km (186 miles).
The allies’ annual Freedom Shield drills are scheduled to run until March 20, although live-fire exercises remain suspended after South Korean jets mistakenly dropped bombs on a civilian town near the border last week, injuring 29.
North Korea has typically demanded U.S.-South Korea joint exercises to be halted, branding them a prelude to an invasion.
The South Korean military has said the joint drills aim to strengthen the readiness of the alliance to face threats such as North Korea.
“This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot, to the extreme point,” North Korea’s foreign ministry said, according to state media outlet KCNA.
The drills would harm U.S. security, the ministry added.
Lee Young-su, chief of South Korea’s Air Force, bowed in apology on Monday over the “unprecedented” accident last week in which two jets mistakenly bombed the South Korean village.
“It was an accident that should never have happened and it should never happen again,” Lee told reporters.
A pilot in one jet was pressed for time and did not double-check the target coordinates, while another pilot in the other jet followed and dropped bombs without noticing the incorrect coordinates, a South Korean military official said, citing the interim results of the military’s investigation.
The area hit by the accidental bombing in Pocheon, which is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of Seoul, was outside a training area near the border with North Korea.
Residents in the area have long complained about the disturbance and risks coming from the exercises.

Title: Dharmendra Pradhan defends NEP, questions Tamil Nadu’s opposition to language policy
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:09:36 +0000
Content: Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday questioned the Tamil Nadu government’s staunch opposition to the National Education Policy (NEP), defending the Centre’s position on the policy and the PM Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme.
Speaking outside Parliament, Pradhan said, “The Government of India recently held discussions with the Tamil Nadu government, and a compromise was found. If Tamil Nadu agrees, we have no objection to providing them PM SHRI allocations. In Tamil Nadu, only the Tamil language will be the medium of instruction in PM SHRI schools. What is their opposition? I don’t understand this.”
Pradhan reiterated that the central government was not imposing any language policy, pointing out that states like Punjab, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are successfully implementing both the PM SHRI scheme and NEP without any language-related concerns.
In a separate statement in the Lok Sabha, Pradhan accused the ruling DMK of being “dishonest” and prioritizing political gains over the future of Tamil Nadu’s students. “The DMK is not committed to the students of Tamil Nadu. Their only job is to raise language barriers. They are doing politics,” he said.
DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran refuted Pradhan’s claims, asserting that the Tamil Nadu government had never agreed to implement the NEP. Maran clarified that while Tamil Nadu is not opposed to Hindi as an optional language, it rejects the compulsory imposition of a third language.
“We are not against Hindi. If students want to learn it, they are free to do so. But it should not be compulsory,” Maran said.

Title: Bangladesh Army had no direct communication with UN during July Uprising: ISPR
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:04:24 +0000
Content: The Bangladesh Army has said that it did not have any direct communication or request from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the comments made by UN High Commissioner Volker Turk in his interview with BBC HARDtalk, according to the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR).
In a press release issued on Monday, ISPR said Bangladesh Army finds it necessary to clarify certain aspects of Turk’s statement to ensure accuracy and transparency.
In an interview with the BBC programme HardTalk on Wednesday, Volker Türk said the Bangladesh army was warned about possible removal from peacekeeping operations for engaging in any repression during the July-August Uprising.
“The remark by Volker Turk taken out of context by certain quarters, appears to misrepresent the role of the Bangladesh Army and potentially undermines its reputation, sacrifice and professionalism,” said the ISPR release.
“If any such concerns were raised, they were conveyed to the then government of Bangladesh and not directly to the Army leadership,” it said.
The Bangladesh Army operates within the framework of national security directives and adheres strictly to the rule of law and human rights principles, it added.
It said Bangladesh Army remains committed to the people, upholding its legacy of neutrality and integrity.
“Historical events such as the democratic transition of 1991 reaffirm this dedication. During the July-August 2024 protests, the Army once again stood by people, ensuring public safety without bias or external influence.”
As the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, Bangladesh is globally recognised for its professionalism and dedication, it added.
ISPR said peacekeepers receive a tiny portion of foreign earnings, the majority-around Tk 27,000 crore over 23 years-has significantly contributed to national economic growth.
The Bangladesh Army deeply values its partnership with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and remains steadfast in its commitment to serving both the people of Bangladesh and the global community, it said.

Title: There are fewer than 100 ocelots in the US – these scientists are trying to save them
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:58:24 +0000
Content: In the race to save the endangered ocelot, scientists are trekking the United States, pursuing fertility treatments and striving to kickstart a new generation of the wild cat.
Ocelots roamed the southwestern U.S. in the 1800s, but have since dwindled to fewer than 100 in two small breeding populations in South Texas.
While the feline species is found in Mexico, Central America and South America, the Texas cats with striking spotted coats are believed to be the last wild population in the United States.
“Just look at the cat – why would you not want that animal to survive in nature?” said Bill Swanson, the Cincinnati Zoo’s director of animal research, who has traveled the country trying to breed captive ocelots in animal institutions with sperm from wild ocelots from South Texas ranch land.
“It’s not just saving the ocelot, it’s saving the habitat and the ecosystem where it lives, which supports so many other animals that provide those services that let people survive on this planet,” he said,
The nonprofit East Foundation, based in San Antonio, manages one of those breeding populations on more than 200,000 acres (810 sq km) of South Texas ranch land containing thorn scrub habitat, a dense covering of short, spiky shrubs that the elusive and nocturnal ocelots adore.
Ashley Reeves, a research veterinarian at the East Foundation, said humans played a major role in the decline of the ocelot, listed in 1982 as an endangered species in the U.S.
“Back when the fur trade became very popular, they were hunted down for their beautiful fur,” Reeves said. “And then also loss of habitat, human encroachment, large cities being built and roadways, so roadways are one of their No. 1 killers today.”
Reeves and Swanson have been working on their ocelot project since 2021. The team has tried – unsuccessfully so far – to breed ocelots two ways.
The first is via artificial insemination, in which semen collected from a cat is deposited directly into a female cat’s reproductive tract.
The second is in vitro fertilization, in which oocytes, or eggs, are collected from the female cat’s body and fertilized with semen in a petri dish before developing into an embryo in an incubator. The viable embryo is then surgically transferred into a cat or frozen to be transferred later.
Of the 13 artificial inseminations and four in vitro fertilization procedures performed in recent years, none have produced a viable pregnancy.
Swanson points to decreased quality in wild ocelot sperm due to signs of inbreeding, environmental stresses like dehydration from drought and decreased motility – the ability of sperm to move – from freezing specimens.
“An ocelot usually has one kitten. That’s the normal litter size,” Swanson said. “And in the wild, the mother will raise that kitten for a full year until it’s old enough to go out on its own. So ocelots are very slowly reproducing animals naturally.”
At the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi, Texas, in December, the team extracted two eggs from a five-year-old ocelot named Milla and patiently waited to see if an embryo would form after combining the eggs with wild sperm in a petri dish. After two days of waiting for a fertilized egg to cleave, or rapidly divide and develop into an embryo, the researchers were disappointed to find neither cell cleaved.
“It’s disappointing,” Reeves said. “But at the same time, science doesn’t always go the way you expect it to.”
Researchers will spend the next few months trapping wild male ocelots to collect their sperm before resuming fertility procedures in the fall.
By the end of the year, a facility in Kingsville, Texas, will be constructed to house ocelots, provide medical and reproductive care as well as a setting for young ocelots to learn how to hunt in the wild.

Content: The Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS-95) continues to provide extensive social security benefits, offering protection to members and their families during old age and in case of various contingencies. The scheme offers a wide range of pension categories, ensuring financial support for those facing challenging life events.
In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment, Sushri Shobha Karandlaje, shared year-wise data revealing a steady rise in the number of pensioners benefiting from the scheme. The total number of pensioners under EPS-95 was recorded as 6,682,717 in 2019-20, increasing to 6,919,823 in 2020-21. The following year, the figure rose to 7,273,898 in 2021-22, and continued to climb to 7,558,913 in 2022-23. For the current year, the total number of pensioners under the scheme stands at 7,849,338 as of 2023-24.
EPS 95, also called the Employee Pension Scheme 1995, is a type of social security scheme launched by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on 19th November 1995.
Under EPS-95, members are entitled to receive a Member Pension upon reaching the age of 58, or an Early Member Pension starting from the age of 50. In cases of permanent and total disablement during service, a Disability Pension is provided. The scheme also supports families after the death of a member, offering Widow/Widower Pensions to surviving spouses and Children Pensions for up to two children until the age of 25.
Additionally, the scheme provides an Orphan Pension for up to two orphans at a time until they reach 25 years, if the member passes away and there is no spouse or upon the death of both the member and spouse. For those with special needs, the Disabled Children/Orphan Pension is available for the lifetime of the disabled child or orphan. The Nominee Pension ensures that a nominated person receives the pension for life, in cases where there is no family defined under EPS-95. Furthermore, a Pension to Dependent Father/Mother is available if the member dies and there is no family or nominee.
Members who exit service or reach superannuation but have not rendered the necessary service for a pension are eligible for a Withdrawal Benefit.

In a departure statement, PM Modi expressed his intent to engage with Mauritius’ leadership to deepen the partnership and promote regional security and development.
“At the invitation of my friend, Prime Minister Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, I am embarking on a two-day State Visit to Mauritius to participate in the celebrations of the 57th National Day of Mauritius. We are connected by history, geography, and culture. Deep mutual trust, a shared belief in democracy, and celebration of our diversity are our strengths,” PM Modi said.
He noted the progress achieved over the past decade through “people-centric initiatives” and expressed optimism that the visit would enhance India-Mauritius relations.
“I look forward to engaging with the Mauritius leadership to elevate our partnership and strengthen our enduring friendship for the progress and prosperity of our peoples, as well as for security and development in the Indian Ocean Region, as part of our Vision SAGAR,” PM Modi added.

Title: INS Tarkash assists Iranian Dhow in Indian Ocean rescue mission
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:21:51 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy’s warship INS Tarkash successfully conducted a rescue mission in the Indian Ocean, assisting an Iranian dhow and its distressed crew near the Somali coast.
The Iranian vessel had issued a distress call after facing a critical shortage of drinking water and sustaining injuries to one of its crew members due to severe weather conditions. Responding swiftly, the crew of INS Tarkash repaired the dhow’s defective Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant, restoring its drinking water supply. Additionally, the warship’s medical team provided immediate first aid to the injured sailor, stabilizing his condition.
This mission is part of the Indian Navy’s ongoing efforts to ensure maritime safety in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), reinforcing India’s proactive role in humanitarian assistance and regional stability at sea.
India and Iran share a historically deep-rooted relationship, supported by diplomatic ties, trade partnerships, and cultural exchanges. The Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre (SVCC), established in 2013, continues to strengthen cultural bonds, while tourism remains an important point of engagement.
Relations between the two nations saw significant advancement following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Iran in 2016, during which both sides signed the Trilateral Agreement on Trade, Transport, and Transit with Afghanistan. In 2018, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to India further bolstered ties with the release of the statement “Towards Prosperity Through Greater Connectivity.”
Trade remains a vital component of the partnership, with India ranking among Iran’s top five trade partners. India exports rice, pharmaceuticals, and electrical machinery, while Iran supplies dry fruits, chemicals, and glassware.

Title: CWG Federation rebranded as Commonwealth Sport
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:14:02 +0000
Content: The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has changed its name to Commonwealth Sports under the ‘More in Common’ brand campaign. The announcement was made on the occasion of Commonwealth Day, an annual celebration of the Commonwealth of Nations held on the second Monday in March.
“Commonwealth Day also marks the date we transition from a Sports Federation to a Sport Movement, Commonwealth Sport becoming our public name,” the governing body said in a statement.
Katie Sadleir, CEO, Commonwealth Sport said, “The evolution to a Movement that is Commonwealth Sport allows us to demonstrate a stronger, more unified purpose that resonates with our audience on a deeper level.”
“It will help us more clearly communicate our role of not only delivering the powerful platform of the Commonwealth Games – which allows us to share success and transform inspiration into impact – but also championing the exceptional work that goes on across our 74 nations and territories every day.
“This transformation enables greater collaboration, more impactful messaging, and an amplified sense of belonging for those who align with our cause,” she added. “The Commonwealth Sport logo with its celebration mark has been in use for some time. The three coloured V shapes represent our three values, Humanity, Equality, and Destiny, rising to the six points representing our six Regions of Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, and Oceania, reflecting the rich diversity of our cultures, coming together through the power of sport,” she added.
The Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games is the first edition of the Games to incorporate this logo into the event mark.
The Commonwealth Day also marks the launch of the Commonwealth Sport King’s Baton Relay at Buckingham Place, starting the relay with 500 days to go to the Opening Ceremony of Glasgow 2026.
King Charles will place a sealed message into the baton, which will remain inside until the opening ceremony when it will be read out to mark the start of the Games and will hand the baton to champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy – the first bearer on its journey around the world.

Title: Capex boom ahead in India, infra projects to accelerate at state level: Jefferies
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:32:10 +0000
Content: There has been a significant increase in capital expenditure in India, with growth expected to continue in the coming months as several sectors witness strong investments, according to a new report by global brokerage Jefferies.
Mahesh Nandurkar, Head of Research and Managing Director at Jefferies, expects capital expenditure growth to remain robust in February and March.
This aligns with the government’s revised budget estimates, indicating a continued push for infrastructure and industrial development.
“These are on expected lines, but the fact that it’s happening gives confidence,” said Nandurkar.
The central government’s capital expenditure rose by 51 percent year-on-year in January 2025, reflecting its commitment to strengthening the country’s infrastructure.
The government’s focus on railways and road projects has helped achieve significant progress, with around 83-87 percent of the financial year 2025 revised estimates already completed for these sectors.
Nandurkar said that one needs to take a more of a calibrated approach. The market is cautious on private capex.
“I believe that private capex is already happening in sectors like cement, steel, hospital and real estate,” he added.
The government’s commitment to capital expenditure remains strong, with transfers to states rising by approximately 60 percent.
This financial support is expected to further accelerate infrastructure projects at the state level, boosting overall economic growth.
Jefferies also highlighted strong growth potential in key sectors. One of them was metal stocks, highlighting strong momentum in the sector.
The brokerage also pointed out that the Asian steel spread remains 20 percent below its long-term average, leaving room for potential expansion.
Additionally, Indian steel prices have risen by 5 percent from their December lows, signalling a recovery in the sector.
Jefferies further stated that any potential safeguard duty on steel could provide additional support to prices, improving margins and boosting valuations for metal companies.
With improving fundamentals and favourable market conditions, the metal sector is expected to continue its strong performance in the coming months, the brokerage firm stated.

Title: Jaishankar’s UK visit: Trade, security and diplomacy take center stage
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:31:57 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar concluded his official visit to the United Kingdom from March 4-9, at the invitation of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. During this period, he also visited Ireland from March 6-7, reinforcing India’s growing international engagements.
The foreign minister held a series of high-level meetings with key UK leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, among others. He engaged with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government officials, businesses, academia, and the Indian diaspora.
Strengthening Diplomatic and Trade Ties
Jaishankar conveyed warm greetings from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to UK PM Starmer. The two leaders recognised the growing momentum in India-UK relations, particularly highlighting the resumption of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. They also noted the significant strengthening of cooperation in technology and people-to-people exchanges. Additionally, their discussions touched on key global issues including the ongoing Ukraine conflict, underscoring a shared commitment to addressing major geopolitical challenges together.
The foreign minister also held extensive talks with Foreign Secretary Lammy at Chevening House, where the two leaders reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations. Discussions covered a wide range of areas, including strategic coordination, political cooperation, trade negotiations, education, technology, mobility, and people-to-people exchanges. Both sides are working on an updated “Roadmap 2.0” to inject fresh energy and momentum into the India-UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
Trade, Business, and Security Cooperation
Jaishankar’s meeting with Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds focused on the progress of the India-UK FTA negotiations. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to boosting trade and investment opportunities, including efforts to reduce trade barriers and expand market access for both nations.
In his meeting with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, the external affairs minister discussed enhancing bilateral cooperation on talent mobility, people-to-people exchanges, and collaborative efforts to combat trafficking and extremism. The safety and security of Indian Missions and diplomats were also addressed, with Jaishankar emphasizing the need to expedite justice for those responsible for recent attacks on the High Commission of India in London.

Title: Indian pharma market to grow 8-9 per cent in FY26: report
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:23:39 +0000
Content: The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow 8-9 per cent year-on-year in FY26, according to a report on Monday.
The report by India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said the growth in the sector will be at 7.5-8.0 per cent year-on-year for FY25.
This is “against 6.5 per cent year-on-year in FY24 and 9.9 per cent YoY growth in FY23,” said Krishnanath Munde, associate director at India Ratings and Research.
In February, the pharma market delivered revenue growth of 7.5 per cent year-on-year. This growth was driven by price growth (5.2 per cent YoY) and new launches (2.4 per cent YoY), while volume growth remained muted at negative 0.2 per cent YoY, the report said.
The sector reported growth at an average of 7.3 per cent year-to-date (YTD) in FY25. This was led by price growth (5.5 per cent), new launches growth (2.7 per cent), and volume growth.
Further, the moving annual total (MAT) — or the 12-month rolling sales of overall pharma products — saw an 8.1 per cent surge in February, the report said. Cardiac therapies outperformed growth in the pharma market with 10.8 per cent growth in MAT and a 13.7 per cent increase in monthly market share. This was followed by gastroenterology, neurology/Central Nervous System, and dermatology.
On the other hand, anti-infectives, respiratory, and gynaecology therapies saw weaker growth in February, the report said.
Meanwhile, another recent report showed that the pharma sector in the country is witnessing rapid production growth. The Indian pharma sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR and has also seen a 9 per cent increase in export rates in 2024, according to the report by McKinsey & Company.
Expanding its capabilities in APIs and biotechnology, the sector has grown at 8 per cent CAGR, twice the global average. The country also emerged as the world’s largest supplier of generic medicines, with a 9 per cent pharma export growth rate, nearly double the global average, the report said.

Title: Over 50% women among 30.68 crore workers registered on e-Shram potal
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:21:33 +0000
Content: More than 30.68 crore unorganised workers have registered for social welfare benefits on the government’s e-Shram portal, with women accounting for 53.68% of the total registrants as of March 3. This information was shared by Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The government launched the e-Shram portal on August 26, 2021, with the objective of creating a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW), seeded with Aadhaar. The portal provides registered workers with a Universal Account Number (UAN) on a self-declaration basis, enabling them to access various social security schemes. Expanding on this initiative, the Ministry of Labour and Employment launched the e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution on October 21, 2024, aligning with the budgetary vision of integrating multiple welfare schemes into a single digital platform.
The e-Shram–One-Stop-Solution integrates 13 central government schemes, allowing unorganised workers to access benefits through a unified platform. These schemes include Pradhan Mantri Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM-SVANidhi), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), and Ayushman Bharat, among others. The integration allows registered workers to track the benefits availed through the portal, streamlining access to social security provisions.
To enhance accessibility, the e-Shram portal introduced multilingual functionality on January 7, incorporating the Bhashini platform to support 22 Indian languages. This initiative aims to make the portal more inclusive, enabling workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to engage with the platform seamlessly.
Additionally, on February 24, the Ministry launched the e-Shram mobile application, which provides real-time access to welfare schemes integrated with the portal. The application is designed to improve convenience for workers, allowing them to stay informed about available benefits and access them directly from their mobile devices.
Efforts to promote awareness about e-Shram and its associated services include periodic review meetings with state governments and regular interactions with Common Services Centres (CSCs). The government has also integrated e-Shram with the National Career Service (NCS) and Skill India Digital Portal to provide employment and skill development opportunities. Furthermore, to facilitate enrolment in pension schemes, the portal is linked to the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandan (PMSYM) scheme.
In a bid to enhance discovery and accessibility of government schemes, e-Shram is also integrated with the myScheme portal, ensuring workers can find relevant welfare programs with ease. An SMS campaign has been initiated to create further awareness among unorganised workers regarding the benefits available to them through the platform.

Title: Philippine ex-leader Duterte long defiant on deadly drug war
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:31:31 +0000
Content: Before he was elected president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte already was nicknamed “The Punisher” and “Duterte Harry” for his years-long and often violent campaign against drug offenders as mayor of his hometown of Davao.
He promised to take his take-no-prisoners style of law and order to the whole of the Philippines, and his rhetoric resonated. He was swept to power with 40% of the vote in the 2016 presidential election.
“Forget the laws on human rights. If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, hold-up men and, do-nothings, you better go out. Because I’d kill you,” he said during that campaign.
“I’ll dump all of you (criminals) into Manila Bay, and fatten all the fish there.”
Duterte, who turns 80 later this month, was arrested on Tuesday at Manila’s main airport on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The ICC has said it would pursue an investigation of suspected crimes against humanity related to Duterte’s role in overseeing a bloody “war on drugs” that killed thousands of Filipinos during his 2016-2022 presidency.
Earlier this week, at a rally in Hong Kong, the firebrand Duterte declared he was ready to be arrested and said of his time in office: “What is my sin? I did everything in my time for peace and a peaceful life for the Filipino people.”
During his presidency, a nationwide drug war killed at least 6,284 accused drug dealers and users, by government count. The ICC estimates that somewhere between 12,000 and 30,000 people were killed between July 2016 and March 2019.
Philippine authorities have always denied extrajudicial killings – many of those killed were said to have died in shootouts. But rights groups and others say that Philippine police and vigilantes under their direction murdered unarmed drug suspects on a massive scale on Duterte’s watch.
In September 2021, the ICC approved a formal investigation into possible crimes against humanity allegedly committed under Duterte’s leadership, but it suspended its probe in November 2021 at the request of Manila, which said it was carrying out its own investigations.
But in January 2023, the court said it was “not satisfied that the Philippines is undertaking relevant investigations” and prosecutors resumed their inquiry. It later rejected an appeal against that decision by the Philippines government.
‘NO EXCUSES, NO APOLOGIES’
Duterte unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from the ICC’s founding treaty in 2019 when it started looking into the allegations of systematic extrajudicial killings. He has always been defiant about the charges against him.
“I have nothing to hide. What I did, I did it for my country and for the young people. No excuses. No apologies. If I go to hell, so be it.” he told a congressional hearing on the drug war in 2024.
When he swept to power in 2016, Duterte drew comparisons with Donald Trump and assertive populists around the globe, a provincial city mayor with a brash style but with a common touch who defeated the establishment with pledges to crush crime.
In office, he turned his back on the country’s decades-long ties with the United States while courting China.
During a November 2016 visit to Beijing, he declined to mention an ongoing dispute with China’s sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea, even after an international tribunal backed the Philippines’ position.
Four years later, Duterte ended a pact that allowed U.S troops to operate in the Philippines, however, the withdrawal period was extended and in March he said the U.S. must “pay” to keep the deal.
He remained deferential to Chinese claims over the shoals and reefs in the South China Sea, defying public opinion, while negotiating billions of dollars worth of aid, loans and infrastructure investment, much of which did not materialise.
His successor later re-established strong military ties with the United States.
SEVEN TIMES MAYOR
Duterte was born in 1945 on the island of Leyte. His father was a lawyer and politician and his mother was a teacher and activist. His family later moved to Davao, the Philippines’ third-most populous city.
His political star began to rise when he was appointed Davao’s vice mayor in 1986 by Corazon Aquino, who had just led the People Power revolution that ended the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Duterte’s mother led the protests that ousted the city leaders associated with Marcos.
He won the first of seven terms as mayor in 1988, with stints in the Philippines House of Representatives in 1998 and as vice mayor in 2010 to avoid term-limit rules.
Duterte claimed he transformed Davao into one of the safest cities in the country by imposing curfews, enacting city-wide smoking bans and cracking down on crime.
Critics claimed reduction in crime was the result of vigilante killings. According to human rights groups, death squads have killed at least 1,400 people in Davao since 1998, most of them drug pushers, addicts, petty criminals, and street children.
Duterte denied any involvement in vigilante killings as mayor or as president.
But the people of Davao spoke highly of his accomplishments, including his push for clean governance, a city-wide smoking ban, and the setting up children’s cancer ward, vaccination programs, and, a modern 911 emergency services facility.
In the 2022 elections, Duterte was succeeded as president by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the former dictator, and his daughter Sara Duterte was elected vice president.
But the alliance between the Marcos and the Duterte families crumbled last year and Sara Duterte was impeached last month on accusations such as budget anomalies, amassing unusual wealth and, an alleged threat to the life of Marcos. An impeachment trial could start in June.
Sara Duterte has appealed to the Supreme Court against the impeachment and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying the move to remove her from office was politically motivated.

Title: Greenland election tests independence ambitions as US interest looms
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:23:35 +0000
Content: Greenland will vote in a general election on Tuesday seen by some locals as a historic chance to free themselves from Danish rule at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has offered to invest billions of dollars if they join the United States.
The election to the 31-seat Inatsisartut parliament could potentially enhance U.S. influence in Greenland, a sparsely- populated island in the eye of a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, as global warming melts the icecaps making its resources more accessible and opening up new shipping routes.
China and Russia have intensified military activity in the region, with the United States striving to keep pace.
Greenland, a Danish territory since 1953, is three times the size of Texas but with a population of 57,000. The island gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen controls foreign affairs, defence and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy.
The local government gained more autonomy in 2009, including the right to declare full independence through a referendum, though has not done so on concern living standards would drop without Denmark’s economic support.
The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems.
However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China’s near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers.
The outcome of the election is uncertain, as no polls or exit polls are expected. A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland’s inhabitants support independence, but are divided over the timing and potential impact on living standards.
Since coming to office in January, Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, rekindling a theme from his prior administration, saying the island is vital to U.S. security interests.
INVESTMENT PLEDGES
He initially declined to rule out military force, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was “ready to invest billions of dollars” if they joined the U.S.
Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump’s offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead.
Still, Trump’s interest has shaken up the status quo in Greenland and, coupled with the growing pride of the indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and centre in the election.
“The question of independence was put on steroids by Trump,” said Masaana Egede, editor of local newspaper Sermitsiaq. “It has put a lid on everyday issues.”
All six main parties, including the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit and government coalition partner Siumut, support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.
The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, has gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark’s historic exploitation of Greenland’s mineral wealth.
“This is our independence election,” said Qunanuk Olsen, a Naleraq candidate.
The party believes U.S. interest strengthens Greenland’s position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.
According to Egede, the editor, the party could increase its current five seats, but is unlikely to secure a majority in parliament.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in the capital Nuuk, all of whom said they favoured independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling.
Greenland relies on Denmark for about half its state budget.

Title: India’s venture capital funding surges 43% to $13.7 billion in 2024
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:11:24 +0000
Content: India’s venture capital (VC) ecosystem witnessed a strong resurgence in 2024, with total funding reaching $13.7 billion—a 43% increase compared to the previous year, according to a report by global consultancy Bain & Company released on Tuesday.
 
The report highlights a sharp rise in deal activity, with 1,270 transactions recorded, marking a 45% increase in deal volumes. This growth solidifies India’s position as the second-largest market for venture capital and growth funding in the Asia-Pacific region, even as overall funding in the region remained largely stable compared to 2023.
 
Investment Trends and Sectoral Performance
Investment activity surged across various deal sizes and stages, while the average deal size remained steady. Small and medium-sized deals (below $50 million), which accounted for nearly 95% of total transactions, grew by 1.4 times, while larger deals exceeding $50 million nearly doubled, returning to pre-pandemic levels.
 
Megadeals—transactions valued at over $100 million—also made a strong comeback, with a 1.6-fold increase in volume. Investors focused on backing high-quality companies that successfully navigated the two-year funding downturn, further driving momentum in the startup ecosystem.
 
Consumer technology emerged as the dominant sector, attracting $5.4 billion in funding—more than double the amount raised in 2023. The sharp rise, driven by a fourfold surge in $100 million+ deals, was largely attributed to significant investments in quick commerce, edtech, and B2C commerce. Companies like Zepto ($1.4 billion), Meesho ($275 million), and Lenskart ($200 million) were among the major beneficiaries.
 
The software and SaaS (software-as-a-service) sector, including generative AI startups, continued to attract strong investor interest, with funding rising by 1.2 times to $1.7 billion. This was fueled by growing customer spending on development and testing tools, as well as the maturation of international go-to-market strategies.
 
Traditional sectors also experienced notable traction. Investments in banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) grew by 3.5 times, driven by affordable housing finance and green financing initiatives. Meanwhile, the consumer and retail segment saw a 2.2-fold increase, with capital flowing into food and beverage (F&B) and fashion businesses.
 
Policy Reforms and Investor Sentiment
The report attributes the surge in funding activity to favorable policy reforms aimed at strengthening India’s startup ecosystem. Key measures, including the removal of the angel tax, reductions in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax rates, the elimination of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process, and the simplification of Foreign Venture Capital Investor (FVCI) registrations, have contributed to improved investor confidence.
 
“India’s evolving investment landscape reflects a strategic shift towards sustainable, long-term growth—focused on profitability, innovation, and regulatory alignment,” said Sriwatsan Krishnan, partner at Bain & Company. “Policy reforms have boosted momentum, and investors are increasingly backing companies that exhibit strong unit economics and resilience amid global macroeconomic trends.”
 
The report also notes that the top 10 most-funded startups accounted for 25% of total VC inflows in 2024, with nine of them being consumer-focused. This underscores the sector’s continued dominance in India’s startup ecosystem.
 
Surge in Exit Activity
India’s exit landscape also witnessed significant growth, with total exit values reaching $6.8 billion in 2024. Public markets played a crucial role, accounting for three-fourths of total exit value. The number of initial public offerings (IPOs) surged nearly sevenfold, as several venture-backed companies successfully listed on stock exchanges, further reinforcing India’s reputation as a maturing startup ecosystem.

Title: Only seven countries met WHO air quality standards in 2024, data shows
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:07:26 +0000
Content: Only seven countries met World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards last year, data showed on Tuesday, as researchers warned that the war on smog would only get harder after the United States shut down its global monitoring efforts.
Chad and Bangladesh were the world’s most polluted countries in 2024, with average smog levels more than 15 times higher than WHO guidelines, according to figures compiled by Swiss air quality monitoring firm IQAir.
Only Australia, New Zealand, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Estonia and Iceland made the grade, IQAir said.
Significant data gaps, especially in Asia and Africa, cloud the worldwide picture, and many developing countries have relied on air quality sensors mounted on U.S. embassy and consulate buildings to track their smog levels.
However, the State Department has recently ended the scheme, citing budget constraints, with more than 17 years of data removed last week from the U.S. government’s official air quality monitoring site, airnow.gov, including readings collected in Chad.
“Most countries have a few other data sources, but it’s going to impact Africa significantly, because oftentimes these are the only sources of publicly available real-time air quality monitoring data,” said Christi Chester-Schroeder, IQAir’s air quality science manager.
Data concerns meant Chad was excluded from IQAir’s 2023 list, but it was also ranked the most polluted country in 2022, plagued by Sahara dust as well as uncontrolled crop burning.
Average concentrations of small, hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 hit 91.8 micrograms per cubic metre (mg/cu m) last year in the country, slightly higher than 2022.
The WHO recommends levels of no more than 5 mg/cu m, a standard met by only 17% of cities last year.
India, fifth in the smog rankings behind Chad, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, saw average PM2.5 fall 7% on the year to 50.6 mg/cu m.
But it accounted for 12 of the top 20 most polluted cities, with Byrnihat, in a heavily industrialised part of the country’s northeast, in first place, registering an average PM2.5 level of 128 mg/cu m.
Climate change is playing an increasing role in driving up pollution, Chester-Schroeder warned, with higher temperatures causing fiercer and lengthier forest fires that swept through parts of South East Asia and South America.
Christa Hasenkopf, director of the Clean Air Program at the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute (EPIC), said at least 34 countries will lose access to reliable pollution data after the U.S. programme was closed.
The State Department scheme improved air quality in the cities where the monitors were placed, boosting life expectancy and even reducing hazard allowances for U.S. diplomats, meaning that it paid for itself, Hasenkopf said.
“(It) is a giant blow to air quality efforts worldwide,” she said.

Title: India’s long-term growth outlook remains strong, equity market seen as attractive opportunity: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 06:46:06 +0000
Content: India’s equity market presents an attractive opportunity, with the country expected to continue growing its share of global output in the coming decades, driven by a combination of strong foundational factors, according to a new Morgan Stanley report. Key drivers include robust population growth, a functioning democracy, stable macroeconomic policies, improving infrastructure, a rising entrepreneurial class, and better social outcomes.
The report suggests that India will emerge as the world’s most sought-after consumer market. It also predicts that the country will undergo a major energy transition, credit to GDP will rise, and manufacturing could gain a larger share of the country’s GDP in the coming years.
While high-frequency economic indicators have shown mixed results recently, they are still significantly better than a few months ago. Morgan Stanley expects economic growth to recover after a projected slowdown in the second half of 2024, supported by fiscal and monetary policy measures and a recovery in service exports. The firm forecasts GDP growth of 6.3% in FY25 and 6.5% in FY26.
Macro stability is expected to remain within comfortable ranges, providing flexibility for policymakers to maneuver effectively. The report also notes that India’s relative earnings growth is showing positive momentum, even compared to more conservative consensus forecasts. Valuations across the Indian equity market are now at their most attractive levels since the COVID-19 pandemic, making the country a key investment opportunity.
India’s low beta characteristic positions it well in an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, according to Morgan Stanley. Beta (β) indicates an asset’s volatility relative to the broader market, measuring the correlation between the asset’s price fluctuations and market movements. With its positive sentiment indicator in strong buy territory, the firm believes that a likely shift in India’s fundamentals has yet to be fully reflected in market prices. This positions India to recover lost ground against its peer group through the rest of 2025.
The ongoing quarter could see earnings surprises, with valuations across market sectors remaining attractive. Financial stocks have outperformed, and Morgan Stanley expects this trend to continue. Additionally, consumer discretionary and select industrial sectors could see stronger performance.
Despite regional trade tensions affecting Asia’s overall growth, India is well-positioned due to its low reliance on goods exports, a strong services export sector, and policy support for domestic demand. The country’s economic recovery is expected to gain momentum with a reversal of the double tightening in fiscal and monetary policies.
Monetary easing is expected to reach full throttle across three fronts—rate cuts, liquidity injection, and regulatory easing—all of which will support the country’s growth recovery. Trade tensions may weigh on the broader region’s trade outlook, but India is less exposed due to its low goods exports to GDP ratio.
The report highlights the strong recovery in India’s economic indicators, including Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, which accelerated to an average of 10.7% in January-February 2025, compared to 8.9% in Q3 2024 and 8.3% in Q4 2024. When adjusting for the leap year, GST revenue growth was close to 12.6% in January-February 2025.
Morgan Stanley expects that India’s recovery will be driven by sustained government capital expenditure, the easing of monetary policies, a moderation in food inflation that will lift real household incomes, and the continued growth of services exports. The firm believes that these policies, which have only been implemented in the past six weeks, will take time to fully support economic recovery but will prove beneficial in the longer run.
Private consumption showed signs of recovery in Q4 2024, with real private consumption growth accelerating to 6.9%. The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector also saw stronger growth, particularly in rural areas, where volume growth reached 7.1%.
The Reserve Bank of India’s recent easing of regulatory tightening on non-bank financial companies (NBFCs)—evident in the rollback of a 25% increase in risk weights for bank credit to NBFCs—is expected to improve liquidity accessibility for both NBFC lenders and end borrowers, further supporting the growth momentum.

Title: INS Imphal to participate in Mauritius National Day celebrations 2025
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 06:24:34 +0000
Content: Indian Naval Ship (INS) Imphal arrived at Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius, on Monday for its maiden port call ahead of the country’s 57th National Day celebrations on March 12.
 
The warship’s visit continues the longstanding tradition of Indian naval vessels and aircraft participating in Mauritius’ National Day events, reinforcing the strong maritime ties between the two nations.
 
During the celebrations, Imphal will contribute a marching contingent, a naval band, and a helicopter for the ceremonial flypast at the National Day Parade at Champs de Mars. The event will be graced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will attend as the Chief Guest.
 
Beyond its role in the National Day festivities, Imphal’s stay in Port Louis, from March 10 to 14, includes several bilateral engagements aimed at enhancing defense cooperation. These activities will feature cross-training visits, friendly sports fixtures, and community outreach initiatives, further deepening India-Mauritius maritime collaboration. A joint Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surveillance and exercise with Mauritius Coast Guard ships is also planned, underscoring the shared commitment to regional security.
 
The visit aligns with India’s Neighbourhood First policy and its vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), which Prime Minister Modi first articulated in Mauritius a decade ago during the commissioning of MCGS Barracuda—the first Indian-built warship inducted into the Mauritius National Coast Guard on March 12, 2015.
 
The presence of India’s latest warship and aircraft at the National Day celebrations highlights India’s commitment to fostering a secure and stable Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Mauritius, with its deep-rooted historical, political, economic, and socio-cultural ties with India, remains a key partner in this vision.
 
Commissioned in December 2023, Imphal is the third of the four Project 15B (Visakhapatnam-class) indigenous destroyers. It is equipped with cutting-edge weaponry, sensors, and advanced machinery, making it one of the most sophisticated warships in the world.

Title: Ban lifted on Wrestling Federation of India, restoring its recognition as NSF for sports
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 06:16:45 +0000
Content: The Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has officially lifted the suspension on the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) on Monday, reinstating its status as a National Sports Federation (NSF). This decision comes after months of uncertainty within Indian wrestling, following a series of controversies and protests against the WFI leadership.
The WFI was initially suspended after its newly elected president, Sanjay Singh, announced the U-15 and U-20 national championships in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, in December 2023. This move came amidst ongoing protests by several renowned wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Bajrang Punia.
These athletes had been leading protests since early 2023 against the WFI’s former president, Brij Bhushan Singh, accusing him of sexual harassment. The accusations and protests rocked the federation and led to widespread calls for reform.
In August 2023, United World Wrestling (UWW), the global governing body for the sport, imposed a ban on WFI after it failed to hold elections within the mandated time frame, further complicating the federation’s standing.
The elections were delayed due to ongoing protests and the serious allegations against Brij Bhushan Singh. In response, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) established an ad-hoc committee to manage the federation’s day-to-day activities and ensure Indian wrestling’s continuity in international competitions.
Elections were finally held in late December 2023, with Sanjay Singh emerging as the new president of WFI. However, his election sparked fresh protests from wrestlers who claimed he was an ally of former president Brij Bhushan Singh. Shortly after his election, the Sports Ministry suspended the federation once again, citing concerns after Sanjay Singh’s announcement to host the nationals in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.
In early 2024, UWW decided to lift its ban on WFI, citing the completion of elections and the successful organization of selection trials for upcoming international competitions. Following this, the IOA dissolved its ad-hoc committee in March 2024, declaring that the committee was no longer needed after WFI had regained its footing and UWW’s recognition.
The federation’s reinstatement is seen as a crucial step toward stabilizing the sport and ensuring that Indian wrestlers can continue to participate in international events under a recognized body.

Title: Dalai Lama says his successor to be born outside China
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 06:07:56 +0000
Content: The Dalai Lama’s successor will be born outside China, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism says in a new book, raising the stakes in a dispute with Beijing over control of the Himalayan region he fled more than six decades ago.
Tibetans worldwide want the institution of the Dalai Lama to continue after the 89-year-old’s death, he writes in “Voice for the Voiceless”, which was reviewed by Reuters and is being released on Tuesday.
He had previously said the line of spiritual leaders might end with him.
His book marks the first time the Dalai Lama has specified that his successor would be born in the “free world”, which he describes as outside China. He has previously said only that he could reincarnate outside Tibet, possibly in India where he lives in exile.
“Since the purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor, the new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama – that is, to be the voice for universal compassion, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and the symbol of Tibet embodying the aspirations of the Tibetan people – will continue,” the Dalai Lama writes.
Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled at the age of 23 to India with thousands of other Tibetans in 1959 after a failed uprising against the rule of Mao Zedong’s Communists.
Beijing insists it will choose his successor, but the Dalai Lama has said any successor named by China would not be respected.
China brands the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause, as a “separatist”.
When asked about the book at a press briefing on Monday, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said the Dalai Lama “is a political exile who is engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.
“On the Tibet issue, China’s position is consistent and clear. What the Dalai Lama says and does cannot change the objective fact of Tibet’s prosperity and development.”
‘REPRESSIVE COMMUNIST CHINESE RULE’
Beijing said last month it hoped the Dalai Lama would “return to the right path” and that it was open to discussing his future if he met such conditions as recognising that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People’s Republic of China. That proposal has been rejected by the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in India.
Supporters of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan cause include Richard Gere, a follower of Tibetan Buddhism, and Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
His followers have been worried about his health, especially after knee surgery last year. He told reporters in December that he might live to be 110.
In his book, the Dalai Lama says he has received numerous petitions for more than a decade from a wide spectrum of Tibetan people, including senior monks and Tibetans living in Tibet and outside, “uniformly asking me to ensure that the Dalai Lama lineage be continued”.
Tibetan tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death. The current Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor when he was two.
The book, which the Dalai Lama calls an account of his dealings with Chinese leaders over seven decades, is being published on Tuesday in the U.S. by William Morrow and in Britain by HarperNonFiction, with HarperCollins publications to follow in India and other countries.
The Dalai Lama, who has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July, writes that his homeland remains “in the grip of repressive Communist Chinese rule” and that the campaign for the freedom of the Tibetan people will continue “no matter what”, even after his death.
He expressed faith in the Tibetan government and parliament-in-exile, based with him in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala, to carry on the political work for the Tibetan cause.
“The right of the Tibetan people to be the custodians of their own homeland cannot be indefinitely denied, nor can their aspiration for freedom be crushed forever through oppression,” he writes. “One clear lesson we know from history is this: if you keep people permanently unhappy, you cannot have a stable society.”
Given his advanced age, he writes, his hopes of going back to Tibet look “increasingly unlikely”.

Title: Mumbai Indians qualify for playoffs after thrilling victory over Gujarat Giants
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 05:53:51 +0000
Content: The excitement of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) is at its peak as the tournament approaches its finale. In a thrilling encounter at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai on Monday, the Mumbai Indians, led by Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, edged out Gujarat Giants by 7 runs to secure their place in the playoffs.
With this win, Mumbai Indians (MI) have qualified for the playoffs, set to begin on Thursday in a rematch against Gujarat Giants. Delhi Capitals, led by Meg Lanning, have already secured their spot in the final, which will be played on Saturday. MI will face Royal Challengers Bangalore in their last league match on Tuesday, and with their current second-place standing, they remain strong contenders for the WPL final, scheduled at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai.
Gujarat Giants (GG) captain Ashleigh Gardner won the toss and opted to bowl first. MI had a shaky start as opener Amelia Kerr was dismissed for just 5 runs. However, West Indian all-rounder Hayley Matthews and Nat Sciver-Brunt steadied the innings, contributing 27 and 38 runs, respectively, in a 29-run partnership for the second wicket. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur then took charge, smashing the GG bowlers all around the park. Her brilliant knock of 54 runs off 33 balls, including 9 boundaries, helped MI post a competitive total of 179/6 in their 20 overs. Middle-order contributions from Amanjot Kaur (27), Sajeevan Sajna (11), and Yastika Bhatia (13) added to MI’s formidable score.
In reply, Gujarat Giants struggled to build momentum. Australian opener Beth Mooney was dismissed for just 7 runs, while Kashvee Gautam managed only 10. Last match’s hero Harleen Deol could contribute only 24, and captain Ashleigh Gardner fell for a duck. Wickets tumbled at regular intervals, but Bharti Fulmali kept GG’s hopes alive with a blistering 61 off 25 balls, including 8 fours and 4 sixes. Despite her valiant effort, GG fell short in the end.
For MI, Hayley Matthews and Amelia Kerr both took 3 wickets each, while South African pacer Shabnim Ismail grabbed 2, sealing a hard-fought victory for Mumbai. Harmanpreet Kaur was named Player of the Match for her outstanding 54-run innings.
With their playoff spot secured, MI aim to carry their winning momentum into the finals, keeping their eyes on the championship.

Title: Airtel partners with Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink’s high-speed internet to India
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:55:24 +0000
Content: Telecom major Airtel on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink’s high-speed internet services to its customers in India.
This is the first agreement to be signed in India, which is subject to SpaceX receiving authorisations to sell Starlink in the country.
Airtel and SpaceX will explore offering Starlink equipment in Airtel’s retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centres, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India.
Airtel and SpaceX will explore how Starlink could help expand and enhance the Airtel network. They will also assess how SpaceX can utilise and benefit from Airtel’s ground network infrastructure and other capabilities in India, said the company.
“Working with SpaceX to offer Starlink to Airtel customers in India is a significant milestone and further demonstrates our commitment to next-generation satellite connectivity,” said Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Vice Chairman, Bharti Airtel.
“This collaboration enhances our ability to bring world-class high-speed broadband to even the most remote parts of India, ensuring that every individual, business, and community has reliable internet,” he added.

Title: Separatist group fires upon passenger train in Pakistan carrying hundreds
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:32:15 +0000
Content: Separatist militants fired at a passenger train carrying hundreds of passengers in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, injuring a train driver, police and railway officials said.
The Jaffar Express, with around 400 passengers on board in nine bogies, was on its way from Quetta in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it was fired on, railway officials said.
In a statement, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack and said they had taken hostages from the train, including security forces.
Officials from the provincial government or railways did not confirm on hostages being taken.
Security forces had reached the site of the incident, in the Mushqaf area of the Bolan district of Balochistan, a railway official said.
The Balochistan government has imposed emergency measures and all institutions have been mobilised to deal with the situation, government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region, pressing demands for a share in mineral-rich resources.
The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation’s government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan’s rich gas and mineral resources.

Title: India’s security, facility management services to clock double-digit growth in 2025-26: Crisil
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:29:29 +0000
Content: Rapid urbanisation, rising industrial investments and expanding commercial spaces will help the organised domestic security and facility management services sector clock 10-12 per cent revenue growth in the next financial year, according to a Crisil report released on Tuesday.
The double-digit forecast comes on the back of a strong compound annual growth rate of 13 per cent over the four financial years till March 2025, the report stated.
As revenues increase, operating profitability will remain stable at around 5 per cent, driven by cost control and operating efficiencies, despite challenges related to rising labour costs, high attrition rates and workforce shortages. Higher cash flows and controlled working capital debt will support stable credit profiles.
The analysis is based on the performance of 35 entities rated by Crisil Ratings, accounting for about a fifth of the organised segment’s Rs 1.15 lakh crore revenue for fiscal 2024.
The report highlighted that a surge in new office buildings, malls, hotels and residential complexes, and the consequent focus on safety and hygiene have accelerated demand for security and facility management services, as has increasing return-to-office mandates.
Similarly, steady industrial capital expenditure (capex), particularly in manufacturing, and growth in warehousing, as well as government spending on railways, airports and metro networks are creating a need for specialised facility management services which will provide tailwinds for the organised security and facility management services sector.
Himank Sharma, Director, Crisil Ratings said, “Growing need for integrated support services and compliance standards will help organised facility management providers’ revenues to grow at 10-12 per cent next fiscal. Also, the rising adoption of technology, such as surveillance systems integrated with artificial intelligence, remote monitoring, and automated cleaning technologies, is providing entities the opportunity to increase service offerings, and cater to a broader customer base.”
While technological adoption is a growth driver, the rise of automation and smart buildings could reduce reliance on traditional manned services. Companies with technology adoption are enhancing operating efficiencies by optimising shifts and scheduling, ensuring efficient resource utilisation, according to the report.
Such operating efficiencies will help offset rising recruitment and training expenses, along with increasing labour costs and high employee attrition. Additionally, labour law reforms and skill development initiatives by the government can address workforce shortages, which remains a major challenge. With focus on workforce retention, better operational efficiency and improving technology adoption, operating margin will remain at around 5 per cent over the medium term, the report added.

Title: PM Modi hands over OCI cards to Mauritius President, First Lady
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:21:22 +0000
Content: In a special gesture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday handed over OCI (Overseas Citizen Of India) cards to Mauritius President Dharambeer Gokhool and First Lady Vrinda Gokhool, on the first day of his visit to the island nation.
Prime Minister Modi called on President Gokhool at the State House and the two leaders exchanged views on deepening the special and close bilateral ties between India and Mauritius.
“In this context, they recalled the shared history between the two countries and the existence of strong people-to-people linkages. Prime Minister noted that it was an honour for him to attend the National Day celebrations of Mauritius as Chief Guest for the second time,” read a statement issued by Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
“Prime Minister also visited the Ayurveda Garden in the State House, established in collaboration with the Government of India. Prime Minister noted that Mauritius is an important partner for India in advancing the benefits of traditional medicine including Ayurveda,” it added.
After the talks, President Gokhool hosted a State lunch in honour of Prime Minister Modi.
In a heartfelt gesture, PM Modi also gifted Mauritius President the holy Ganga water from Maha Kumbh which concluded on February 26 and saw more than 660 million pilgrims gather at the Triveni Sangam Prayagraj, making it the largest human gathering in the world.
Gokhool was unanimously elected as the new President of Mauritius in December, succeeding Prithvirajsing Roopun whose term of office ended on December 2, 2024.
A former Minister of Education, Gokhool is a distinguished statesman whose illustrious career spans across academia, public service, and politics.
Earlier, beginning his engagements after arriving on a two-day State visit to the Indian Ocean archipelago at the invitation of Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam, PM Modi paid homage to Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first Prime Minister and the founding father of Mauritius, at the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden in Port Louis. He also paid homage to former President and former Prime Minister of Mauritius Sir Anerood Jugnauth.
“Paid homage to Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and Sir Anerood Jugnauth, two great leaders who have made indelible contributions to Mauritius’ progress,” PM Modi posted on X.
PM Modi laid a wreath at the memorial and also planted a tree along with Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam.
“Humbled by the heartfelt gesture of my friend, Prime Minister Dr. Navin Ramgoolam, in taking part in ‘Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam’ — a tribute to nature, motherhood and sustainability. His support stands tall as a symbol of our shared commitment to a greener and better future,” he said.
Before holding a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Ramgoolam in the evening, PM Modi is scheduled to interact with the Indian diaspora in Mauritius. Prime Minister Ramgoolam will also be hosting a State banquet in honour of PM Modi on Tuesday evening.
On the second and final day of his two-day State Visit, Prime Minister Modi will participate in the celebrations of the 57th National Day of Mauritius on Wednesday as the chief guest.
This is PM Modi’s first visit to Mauritius since 2015 when he had outlined India’s Vision SAGAR – Security and growth for All in the Region – which along with ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, ‘Act East’ policy, ‘Think West’ policy and ‘Connect Central Asia’ policy continues to guide New Delhi’s approach to the neighbourhood and beyond while strengthening historical and civilizational ties at the same time.
On the sidelines of various events, PM Modi is also scheduled to meet leaders of several political parties in Mauritius.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described his two-day visit to Mauritius as a “wonderful opportunity” to engage with a valued ally and strengthen bilateral ties.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted after landing in Port Louis early Tuesday morning, “Landed in Mauritius. I am grateful to my friend, PM Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam, for the special gesture of welcoming me at the airport. This visit is a wonderful opportunity to engage with a valued friend and explore new avenues for collaboration in various sectors.”
A gathering of 200 dignitaries, including MPs, MLAs, members of the Diplomatic Corps, and religious leaders, also extended their welcome to the Prime Minister.
Adding to the spirited reception, members of the Indian diaspora gathered outside the Oberoi Hotel in Port Louis, welcoming PM Modi with ‘Dhols’ and garlands.

Title: “Reducing distance between Northeast, rest of India BJP’s biggest achievement”: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:38:05 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday praised the BJP government, stating that its most significant achievement has been reducing the distance between the Northeast and the rest of India.
Addressing the North-East Students’ and Youth Parliament organized by ABVP in New Delhi, Shah said, “The biggest achievement of the BJP government is that it has reduced the distance between the Northeast and the rest of India. By 2027, every capital of the Northeast will be connected by train, plane, and road.”
The Union Home Minister also highlighted a significant reduction in violence across the region under the BJP’s tenure. He added that violent incidents decreased by 70% — from 11,000 cases between 2004 and 2014 to 3,428 between 2014 and 2024. Security force fatalities also dropped by 70%, while civilian deaths reduced by 89% over the past decade.
Shah credited these improvements to peace agreements, saying that the government has signed 12 major accords with various armed groups in the Northeast over the last 10 years. “Our Northeast is experiencing peace today. Be it Meghalaya, Arunachal, Assam, Nagaland, or Mizoram, we have signed agreements with all armed groups, and more than 10,500 insurgents have laid down their arms and joined the mainstream,” Shah said.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a huge budget for the development of the Northeast. In ten years, considering the Northeast as his own, the Prime Minister has taken care of its development so much that he has decided that every month, one minister will stay overnight in some state of the Northeast,” said Shah.
The Home Minister commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, praising his dedicated focus on the Northeast’s development and peace. Shah emphasized that stability is essential for progress, and PM Modi has prioritized this region with consistent efforts.
Shah highlighted that PM Modi has made 78 visits to the Northeast (excluding Assam) since taking office, compared to a combined total of 21 visits by all previous Prime Ministers since India’s independence. This, he said, reflected the government’s strong commitment to the region.
Shah also announced a major development initiative for the Northeast, revealing plans for a semiconductor plant worth Rs 2,700 crore in Assam and an overall investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in the region. He assured the youth that within the next decade, employment opportunities would be abundant, reducing the need for people to migrate for work.
“Today, a semiconductor plant worth Rs 2,700 crore is coming up in Assam, which will be useful for you. Not only this, an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore is coming. The foundation has been laid in these 10 years. Within 10 years, not a single child or youth from the Northeast will have to leave for work. You will get employment in the Northeast itself,” Shah said.

Title: Startups in textile sector see steady growth, says Giriraj Singh
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:33:05 +0000
Content: The number of startups in India’s textile sector has seen a steady increase over the past five years, according to Union Minister for Textiles, Giriraj Singh. In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Singh revealed that the number of new entities recognized as startups in the textile industry by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has risen significantly, from 204 in 2020 to 703 in 2023, and 765 in 2024.
Under the ‘Startup India’ initiative, the government has introduced several key schemes to support startups across various sectors, including textiles. These include the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), the Start-up India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS), and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS), all aimed at providing assistance to startups at different stages of their business cycle.
FFS, which was approved in 2016, focuses on catalyzing venture capital investments. It is operationalized by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), which provides capital to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)-registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). These AIFs, in turn, invest in startups, with a requirement to invest at least double the amount received under FFS.
The SISFS provides financial assistance to seed-stage startups through incubators, while the CGSS offers collateral-free loans to startups via eligible financial institutions. The CGSS has been operational since April 1, 2023, and is managed by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC) Limited.
The minister also highlighted the government’s initiatives to strengthen the overall textile sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel Parks (PM-MITRA) scheme. This scheme aims to create a modern, integrated, large-scale industrial ecosystem, attracting investments and boosting employment in the textile sector.
Other initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the National Technical Textile Mission (NTTM) are also being implemented to generate employment and promote the growth of technical textiles.
Additionally, the Office of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts) runs schemes such as the National Handicrafts Development Programme (NHDP) and the Comprehensive Handicrafts Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS) to support the development and promotion of handicrafts across India. These schemes include various skill development programs, including the Guru Shishya Hastshilp Prashikshan Programme (GSHPP), Comprehensive Skill Upgradation Programme (CSUP), and Design and Technology Development Workshops (DDW), aimed at enhancing skills in the handicraft sector.

Title: Tibetan diaspora protests in Vienna on 66th anniversary of Uprising Day
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:59:22 +0000
Content: The Tibetan Diaspora Organisation (TGO) held a large-scale protest in front of the Chinese Embassy in Vienna to mark the 66th anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day.
Approximately 200 members of Austria’s Tibetan community gathered outside the embassy to denounce the ongoing oppression of Tibetans by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Protesters waved Tibetan flags and displayed banners condemning the CCP’s genocidal actions against ethnic and religious minorities in China.
The demonstration gained further momentum with the participation of around 60 members from the Chinese Christian and Uyghur communities. Chinese Christians expressed concerns about the CCP’s crackdown on religious freedoms, citing the destruction of churches, removal of crosses, and persecution of religious leaders. They condemned the regime’s attempts to impose state-controlled versions of Christianity, calling it an attack on their faith and liberties.
Uyghur activists also spoke out against the CCP’s oppressive policies in Xinjiang, highlighting the mass detention of over a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in so-called internment camps.
Joining the rally were Austrian organizations such as Youth for Human Rights and Save Tibet, which expressed their solidarity with the oppressed groups. Their participation underscored a shared commitment to human rights and religious freedom.
The protest concluded with a march from the Chinese Embassy to Vienna’s central Stephansplatz, where participants continued chanting slogans and delivering speeches to raise awareness about the suffering of Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other marginalized communities under CCP rule.
The Tibet Taiwan Human Rights Network said that, China invaded Tibet in 1951, leading to severe repression of Tibetan culture, religion, and traditions. On March 10, 1959, a major uprising in Lhasa was violently suppressed by the Chinese military, resulting in significant casualties and the Dalai Lama’s exile to India, where he established a government-in-exile. This event is commemorated annually as “Tibet Uprising Day.”

Title: Centre bans Awami Action Committee for five years under UAPA
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:32:48 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday declared the Jammu and Kashmir-based Awami Action Committee (AAC) an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, imposing a five-year ban on the organization. The decision was based on accusations that the AAC has been engaging in activities threatening India’s sovereignty, integrity, and security.
According to an official notification, the AAC, led by Umar Farooq, has been involved in supporting terrorist activities and spreading anti-India propaganda to fuel separatism in Jammu and Kashmir. The ministry said that the AAC has been mobilizing funds to support secessionist, separatist, and terrorist operations in the region.
The government further highlighted that the AAC is displaying blatant disregard for India’s constitutional authority by promoting unrest, encouraging armed insurgency, and spreading hatred against the government.
The notification cited multiple cases registered against AAC leaders, including Umar Farooq and other members, for their involvement in anti-national speeches, incitement of violence, and incidents of stone-pelting.
It also referenced a 2018 charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against AAC spokesperson Aftab Ahmad Shah and 11 others, of conspiring against the state. Additionally, several police cases dating back to 2008 were mentioned, which included allegations of inflammatory speeches, calls for election boycotts, and efforts to instigate public disorder.
The government warned that if AAC’s activities were left unchecked, the group could continue to promote separatist propaganda, incite violence, and support militancy in the region. The notification underscored that such actions posed a serious threat to national security and public order.
Exercising its powers under Section 3(1) of the UAPA, 1967, the MHA formally declared AAC an unlawful organization. The ban will remain in force for five years from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette unless overturned by legal intervention.

Key areas of development for Indian Web3 talent include gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and real-world assets (RWAs). Over half of these developers are relatively new to the Web3 space, having joined within the past two years, and most are under the age of 27.
Hackathons remain a popular entry point for these developers, while Web3 firms are increasingly partnering with universities in regions like Odisha, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, and Kerala to introduce blockchain technology to students early on.
Tak Lee, CEO & Managing Partner at Hashed Emergent, commented on the momentum, stating, “India’s unique combination of technological agility, entrepreneurial drive, and widespread digital adoption is fuelling this progress. We’re now seeing a renewed wave of retail participation, shifting investor dynamics, and greater integration of Web3 solutions by enterprises and the government.”

Investor confidence in India’s Web3 ecosystem has soared, with a 109 percent increase in funding compared to 2023. In 2024, Indian startups secured $564 million in investments, bringing total funding in the sector to over $3 billion.
The report identifies AI, RWAs, and staking solutions as the key areas driving investment. Both global venture capital and home-grown firms are placing big bets on Indian Web3 projects. In addition, ecosystem funds from Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain networks are making significant investments, further solidifying India’s position in the global Web3 landscape.

According to an official notification, JKIM, led by Masroor Abbas Ansari, has been actively involved in supporting terrorist activities and spreading anti-India propaganda to fuel separatism in Jammu and Kashmir.
The notification further said that JKIM and its members have been raising funds to support unlawful activities, including separatist and terrorist operations in the region.
The ban was enforced under Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The government exercised its powers under Section 3(3) of the Act to declare JKIM unlawful, ensuring that the ban will remain in place for five years from the date of its official notification.

Content: Telecom major Airtel on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink’s high-speed internet services to its customers in India.
This is the first agreement to be signed in India, which is subject to SpaceX receiving authorisations to sell Starlink in the country.
Airtel and SpaceX will explore offering Starlink equipment in Airtel’s retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centres, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India.
Airtel and SpaceX will explore how Starlink could help expand and enhance the Airtel network. They will also assess how SpaceX can utilise and benefit from Airtel’s ground network infrastructure and other capabilities in India, said the company.
“Working with SpaceX to offer Starlink to Airtel customers in India is a significant milestone and further demonstrates our commitment to next-generation satellite connectivity,” said Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Vice Chairman, Bharti Airtel.
“This collaboration enhances our ability to bring world-class high-speed broadband to even the most remote parts of India, ensuring that every individual, business, and community has reliable internet,” he added.
Starlink will complement and enhance Airtel’s suite of products to ensure reliable and affordable broadband for our Indian customers – wherever they live and work, said Vittal.
By adding Starlink in addition to its existing alliance with Eutelsat OneWeb to its offerings, Airtel will further its ability to offer nationwide connectivity and connect previously underserved areas, particularly those with limited to no coverage today.
With the Starlink Enterprise Suite, Airtel will be able to offer enterprises, businesses, and communities comprehensive and seamless connectivity packages.

Title: Separatist group fires upon passenger train in Pakistan carrying hundreds
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:32:15 +0000
Content: Separatist militants fired at a passenger train carrying hundreds of passengers in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, injuring a train driver, police and railway officials said.
The Jaffar Express, with around 400 passengers on board in nine bogies, was on its way from Quetta in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it was fired on, railway officials said.
In a statement, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack and said they had taken hostages from the train, including security forces.
Officials from the provincial government or railways did not confirm on hostages being taken.
Security forces had reached the site of the incident, in the Mushqaf area of the Bolan district of Balochistan, a railway official said.
The Balochistan government has imposed emergency measures and all institutions have been mobilised to deal with the situation, government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region, pressing demands for a share in mineral-rich resources.
The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation’s government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan’s rich gas and mineral resources.

Title: India’s security, facility management services to clock double-digit growth in 2025-26: Crisil
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:29:29 +0000
Content: Rapid urbanisation, rising industrial investments and expanding commercial spaces will help the organised domestic security and facility management services sector clock 10-12 per cent revenue growth in the next financial year, according to a Crisil report released on Tuesday.
The double-digit forecast comes on the back of a strong compound annual growth rate of 13 per cent over the four financial years till March 2025, the report stated.
As revenues increase, operating profitability will remain stable at around 5 per cent, driven by cost control and operating efficiencies, despite challenges related to rising labour costs, high attrition rates and workforce shortages. Higher cash flows and controlled working capital debt will support stable credit profiles.
The analysis is based on the performance of 35 entities rated by Crisil Ratings, accounting for about a fifth of the organised segment’s Rs 1.15 lakh crore revenue for fiscal 2024.
The report highlighted that a surge in new office buildings, malls, hotels and residential complexes, and the consequent focus on safety and hygiene have accelerated demand for security and facility management services, as has increasing return-to-office mandates.
Similarly, steady industrial capital expenditure (capex), particularly in manufacturing, and growth in warehousing, as well as government spending on railways, airports and metro networks are creating a need for specialised facility management services which will provide tailwinds for the organised security and facility management services sector.
Himank Sharma, Director, Crisil Ratings said, “Growing need for integrated support services and compliance standards will help organised facility management providers’ revenues to grow at 10-12 per cent next fiscal. Also, the rising adoption of technology, such as surveillance systems integrated with artificial intelligence, remote monitoring, and automated cleaning technologies, is providing entities the opportunity to increase service offerings, and cater to a broader customer base.”
While technological adoption is a growth driver, the rise of automation and smart buildings could reduce reliance on traditional manned services. Companies with technology adoption are enhancing operating efficiencies by optimising shifts and scheduling, ensuring efficient resource utilisation, according to the report.
Such operating efficiencies will help offset rising recruitment and training expenses, along with increasing labour costs and high employee attrition. Additionally, labour law reforms and skill development initiatives by the government can address workforce shortages, which remains a major challenge. With focus on workforce retention, better operational efficiency and improving technology adoption, operating margin will remain at around 5 per cent over the medium term, the report added.

Title: What is fluoride and why is it added to the US water supply?
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:21:28 +0000
Content: Utah is poised to become the first state to prohibit fluoride in its water systems, just weeks after fluoride-critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and promotes dental health. Here is what you need to know about fluoridation of drinking water as a public health measure:
WHAT IS FLUORIDE AND WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS?
Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in water, soil and air that has been demonstrated to prevent dental cavities, or tooth decay. It works by strengthening the tooth’s enamel, its hard outer surface, making it more resistant to the acid produced by bacteria that cause tooth decay. Fluoride also reverses early tooth decay by replacing and preventing loss of minerals in teeth.
Prior to the beginning of community water fluoridation, tooth decay was widespread and severe among Americans. After fluoride was added in many places to the U.S. water supply, tooth decay declined in both children and adults, and complete tooth loss in older adults became more rare, according to federal health officials.
WHEN DID WATER FLUORIDATION AS A POLICY BEGIN?
In the early 20th century, some U.S. researchers observed that people who lived in areas where community water supplies had naturally occurring high levels of fluoride had teeth that were resistant to decay.
In 1945, the Michigan city of Grand Rapids became the first to add fluoride to its water supply in a controlled manner, kicking off what was in effect a large-scale public health experiment. Data over a 15-year span showed a reduction of more than 60% in tooth decay among 30,000 school children in Grand Rapids, demonstrating fluoride’s protective benefits.
By the 1950s, the U.S. government’s Public Health Service and the American Dental Association acknowledged the success of water fluoridation in reducing cavities. This led to the broad U.S. adoption of adding fluoride in community water supplies and eventually its inclusion in dental products such as toothpaste and mouthwash.
No federal law mandates fluoridation of water supplies. The decision to fluoridate water is typically made by municipal governments, city councils or local water authorities.
HOW WIDESPREAD IS FLUORIDATION IN THE U.S.?
About 63% of all Americans have fluoride in their community water systems, according to CDC statistics as of 2022.
According to the American Dental Association, the average cost per year for U.S. communities to fluoridate their water supplies ranges from 50 cents per person for large communities to $3 per person for small communities.
In most of the world, fluoride is not added to the public water supply. Some countries add fluoride to table salt. In some regions, fluoride levels in water are naturally high.
ARE FLUORIDE LEVELS REGULATED?
The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that drinking water levels for fluoride remain below 0.7 milligrams per liter. Levels above 1.5 mg/L are known to increase health risks such as bone fractures, thyroid disease and nervous system damage.
The enforceable limit as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 4.0 mg/L. A federal judge in California recently ordered the EPA to strengthen its regulations.
WHAT COMPANIES MAKE FLUORIDE?
Fluorosilicic acid is the compound most widely used in water systems as it yields free fluoride rapidly when mixed with water. J.R. Simplot and Nutrien’s NTR.TO PCS Phosphate Company are among companies that manufacture the product, according to the EPA.
Total U.S. domestic production of fluorosilicic acid from phosphate rock was approximately 29 million kilograms (32,000 tons) in 2019, according to EPA statistics.
WHAT DID KENNEDY SAY?
Kennedy has claimed in the absence of conclusive evidence that water fluoridation at U.S. levels is associated with numerous health issues including cancer.
WHAT DO PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAY?
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called fluoridation of drinking water one of the nation’s top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century, noting that it effectively prevents tooth decay regardless of a person’s socioeconomic status or access to care.
The American Dental Association has reiterated its support for community water fluoridation to help prevent tooth decay. Studies show that community water fluoridation reduces tooth decay by more than 25% in children and adults even in an era with widespread availability of fluoride from other sources such as toothpaste, the association said.
WHAT QUESTIONS DO RECENT STUDIES RAISE ABOUT FLUORIDE?
A review published in October 2024 by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews raised questions about the value of fluoridation of public drinking water in wealthy countries based on the findings of 157 studies.
The research suggests that given the widespread addition of fluoride to toothpaste since 1975, community water fluoridation may now have only modest benefits in reducing tooth decay and increasing cavity-free children, compared to the effects seen in earlier studies. New lawsuits, however, are challenging manufacturers on the safety of fluoride levels in toothpaste, too.
The review also found there is not enough evidence to determine the impact of stopping fluoridation or its effect on socioeconomic disparities in dental health.
In January, researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health who analyzed 74 studies from 10 countries found IQs were lower in children with higher fluoride exposure. In four studies with a low risk of bias involving  4,179 children, urinary fluoride concentrations at levels reportedly common in developed countries were associated with lower IQ scores, the researchers reported.
The results “support concerns for vulnerable populations living in communities with fluoridated water,” according to an editorial published with the report. A second editorial, however, details multiple weaknesses of the NIH analyses and warns that public policy concerning fluoride “should not be affected by the study findings.”

Title: Over two crore rural houses completed under PMAY-G by end of FY 2023-24
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:20:53 +0000
Content: A total of 2.69 crore houses have been completed under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) by the end of FY 2023-24, with a target of constructing 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities by March 31. The Centre has allocated Rs 2.26 lakh crore to states for this initiative, according to information presented in the Lok Sabha.
The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal for the “implementation of the PMAY-G during FY 2024-25 to 2028-29” for the construction of an additional two crore rural houses, along with the remaining houses to meet the earlier target of 2.95 crore houses by March 2025. Minister of State for Rural Development, Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, stated this in a written reply in the Lower House.
Under the PMAY-G scheme, states and union territories are required to ensure that landless beneficiaries are provided land from government resources or other land, including public land (Panchayat common land, community land, or land belonging to other local authorities).
For the selected land, the states must ensure adequate infrastructure, including electricity, road connectivity, drinking water, and solid and liquid waste management facilities. The land is a state subject, and the Ministry has no role in the land acquisition matters of the states, the Minister explained.
The Ministry has been actively pursuing this matter with states/UTs to provide land to the remaining landless beneficiaries.
The Centre has been issuing instructions in the framework for the implementation of the PMAY-G to states and UTs for providing land to landless beneficiaries. Additionally, regular follow-ups with the states are conducted through review meetings and official communications, he added.
A module to capture details of landless beneficiaries has been developed on the AwaasSoft-MIS of PMAY-G for regular monitoring.
Under PMAY-G, there are no restrictions on constructing more than one-storeyed houses for multiple PMAY-G beneficiaries combined to address the landlessness issue, the minister further said.

Title: Trump’s steel, aluminum tariffs take effect as global trade war intensifies
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:56:37 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday, stepping up a campaign to reorder global trade norms in favor of the U.S. that drew swift retaliation from Europe.
Trump’s action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25% on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
The European Commission responded almost immediately, saying it would impose counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month.
Close U.S. allies Canada, Britain and Australia criticised the blanket tariffs, with Canada mulling reciprocal actions and British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds saying “all options were on the table” to respond in the national interest.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the move was “entirely unjustified … and against the spirit of our two nations’ enduring friendship” but ruled out tit-for-tat duties.
“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,” Albanese told reporters.
The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas.
The run-up to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50% on its steel and aluminum exports to the U.S.
But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province’s decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier U.S. tariffs were removed.
Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
The incident whip-sawed U.S. financial markets already jittery over Trump’s broad tariff-offensive, but left unchanged Trump’s original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
A White House spokesperson described the U.S. pressure on Canada as a “win” for the American people.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday at U.S. ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
The move was welcomed by U.S. steel producers as restoring Trump’s original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
“By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America,” Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
“The revised tariff will ensure that steelmakers in America can continue to create new high-paying jobs and make greater investments knowing that they will not be undercut by unfair trade practices,” Bell added.
The escalation of the U.S.-Canada trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepared to hand over power this week to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend.
On Monday, Carney said he could not speak with Trump until he was sworn in as prime minister. Trump again on social media said he wanted Canada “to become our cherished Fifty-First State.”
Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals, if U.S. tariffs persist.
Canada ships about 4 million barrels of crude to the U.S. per day via pipeline, mainly to Midwest refineries. Canadian tariffs on American ethanol are also an option, he added.
Most U.S.-Canada trade remains duty-free under the USMCA trade deal that Trump signed in 2020, but he continues to complain about Canada’s high tariff rates for dairy products.
Ottawa last week won a month’s reprieve for USMCA-compliant exports from Trump’s general 25% tariffs for Canada threatened over fentanyl trafficking.
But in early April, Canada also faces Trump’s reciprocal tariffs aimed at raising U.S. tariffs to match other countries’ rates and counteract non-tariff barriers.
Canada, with ample hydropower resources that have made primary aluminum production more cost-effective than in the U.S., has built a commanding position in the U.S. aluminum market, as U.S. smelters once revived by Trump’s tariffs have been idled.
China remains the number two supplier of aluminum and goods made from aluminum, but already faces high tariffs to counteract alleged dumping and subsidies, as well as a new 20% tariff that Trump has imposed over the past month over fentanyl trafficking.
Trump’s hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists increasingly worry could cause a U.S. recession.
A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump’s November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market.

Title: Greenland’s independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:47:37 +0000
Content: Greenland’s pro-business opposition Demokraatit party, which favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark, won Tuesday’s parliamentary election that was dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump’s pledge to take control of the island.
Demokraatit secured 29.9% of the votes with all ballots counted, up from 9.1% in 2021, ahead of the opposition Naleraq party, which favours rapid independence, at 24.5%.
Since taking office in January, Donald Trump has vowed to make Greenland – a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark – part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests, an idea rejected by most Greenlanders.
The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes. Both Russia and China have intensified military activity in the region.
“People want change … We want more business to finance our welfare,” said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit’s leader and a former minister of industry and minerals.
“We don’t want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation,” Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.
He will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition.
The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party and its partner Siumut, which also seek a slow path towards independence, won a combined 36% of votes, down from 66.1% in 2021.
“We respect the election outcome,” Prime Minister Mute Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit said in a Facebook post, adding that he would listen to any proposals in upcoming coalition talks.
Greenland is a former Danish colony and has been a territory since 1953. It gained some autonomy in 1979 when its first parliament was formed, but Copenhagen still controls foreign affairs, defence and monetary policy and provides just under $1 billion a year to the economy.
In 2009, it won the right to declare full independence through a referendum, even though it has not done so out of concern living standards would drop without Denmark’s economic support.
“I strongly believe that we will very soon start to live a life more based on who we are, based on our culture, based on our own language, and start to make regulations based on us, not based on Denmark,” said Qupanuk Olsen, candidate for the main pro-independence party Naleraq.
Inge Olsvig Brandt, a candidate for the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party, said:
“We don’t need the independence right now. We have too many things to work on. I think we have to work with ourselves, our history, and we are going to have a lot of healing work with us before we can take the next step.”
Voting had been extended by half an hour at some of the 72 polling stations across the Arctic island, where some 40,500 people were eligible to cast their ballot, although the final turnout was not immediately available.
INUIT PRIDE
Trump’s vocal interest has shaken up the status quo, and coupled with the growing pride of the Indigenous people in their Inuit culture, put independence front and centre in the election.
In the final debate on Greenland’s state broadcaster KNR late on Monday, leaders of the five parties currently in parliament unanimously said they did not trust Trump.
“He is trying to influence us. I can understand if citizens feel insecure,” said Erik Jensen, leader of government coalition partner Siumut.
A January poll suggested a majority of Greenland’s inhabitants support independence, but are divided on timing.
Early on, the election campaign focused on the anger and frustration aimed at historical wrongdoings by Denmark, according to Julie Rademacher, a consultant and former adviser to Greenland’s government.
“But I think the fear of the U.S. imperialist approach has lately become bigger than the anger towards Denmark,” said Rademacher.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Greenlanders in Nuuk, all of whom said they favoured independence, although many expressed concern that a swift transition could damage the economy and eliminate Nordic welfare services like universal healthcare and free schooling.
“We don’t want to be part of the U.S. for obvious reasons; healthcare and Trump,” said Tuuta Lynge-Larsen, a bank employee and Nuuk resident, adding that this election was especially important. “We don’t like the attention, to put it short.”
The island holds substantial natural resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths used in high-tech industries, ranging from electric vehicles to missile systems.
However, Greenland has been slow to extract them due to environmental concerns, severe weather, and China’s near-total control of the sector, which has made it difficult for companies elsewhere to make a profit or secure buyers.
INVESTMENT PLEDGES
Trump initially declined to rule out military force to take control of the territory, alarming many Greenlanders, although he later softened his stance, stating he would respect the will of the local people and was “ready to invest billions of dollars” if they joined the U.S..
Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and advocated for a broad coalition government to resist external pressure. In an interview aired on Monday by Danish broadcaster DR, he dismissed Trump’s offer as disrespectful, expressing willingness to cooperate with other countries instead.
Denmark’s prime minister has said Greenland is not for sale, but made it clear that it is up to the local people to decide their future.
All six main political parties support independence but differ on how and when it could be achieved.
The pro-independence Naleraq party, the leading opposition force, had gained momentum ahead of the election, bolstered by U.S. interest and fresh accusations of Denmark’s historic exploitation of Greenland’s mineral wealth.
The party believes the U.S. attention strengthens Greenland’s position in secession talks with Denmark and aims to bring a deal with Copenhagen to a vote before the next election in four years.

Title: BJP leading in nine out of 10 mayoral posts in Haryana: Early trends
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:46:12 +0000
Content: The main opposition Congress in Haryana is set to be wiped out in the civic polls, as early leads in the ongoing counting of ballots indicate that the state ruling BJP is leading in nine out of the 10 mayoral posts.
In one municipal corporation, an independent candidate, a BJP rebel, is leading.
The results will be the first electoral test for both the Congress and the BJP after the latter won the Assembly polls in Haryana in October 2024, securing a record third consecutive term.
The Congress has never contested the municipal polls on its symbol, except in the mayoral elections of three municipal corporations in December 2020.
In the mayoral election in the industrial town of Manesar, independent candidate Inderjit Yadav is leading by 1,638 votes in the first round. He has secured 4,809 votes, while BJP’s Sunder Lal has received 3,171 votes. Another independent candidate, Vijay Singh, polled 3,133 votes. The Congress candidate, Neeraj Yadav, received just 273 votes.
The elections for seven municipal corporations – Gurugram, Manesar, Faridabad, Hisar, Rohtak, Karnal, and Yamunanagar – were held on March 2, while the voting for the Panipat municipal corporation was held separately on March 9. Bypolls for the posts of mayor in Ambala and Sonipat, as well as the election of presidents and ward members in 21 municipal committees, were also held on March 2.
Votes are also being counted for municipal councils in Ambala Sadar, Pataudi-Jatauli Mandi, Thanesar, Sirsa, Sohna (by-election), and 21 other municipal councils. By-elections for the post of president in Assandh and Ismailabad municipal councils were also held.
Forty-six percent of the more than 51 lakh eligible voters exercised their franchise in the civic body polls on March 2.
A total of 26 ward members have already been elected unopposed. Among them, Kuldeep Singh (Faridabad), Vikas Yadav (Gurugram), Sankalp Bhandari and Sanjeev Kumar Mehta (Karnal), and Bhavna (Yamunanagar) secured unopposed wins from their respective wards in municipal corporations.
Likewise, three ward members were elected unopposed in Ambala Sadar and Thanesar, while 18 others won unopposed in various municipal committees across the state.
Ahead of the polls, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini had exuded confidence that the BJP would win the contests. He said work would be done three times faster after the formation of a “triple-engine” government – centre, state, and the civic bodies.

Title: Shootout hero Donnarumma helps PSG knock Liverpool out of Champions League
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:41:27 +0000
Content: Paris St Germain beat Liverpool 4-1 in a penalty shootout to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals after winning a rip-roaring last-16 second-leg match at Anfield 1-0 on Tuesday thanks to a goal from livewire Ousmane Dembele.
After the tie had finished 1-1 on aggregate, PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved spot kicks from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones, while the visitors, who have never won the Champions League, converted all of their efforts.
Ligue 1 leaders PSG will meet either Aston Villa or Club Brugge in the quarters, with Villa taking a 3-1 lead into Wednesday’s second leg.
Dembele stunned the Anfield crowd with his 12th-minute goal against the run of play. Ibrahima Konate slid in to block Bradley Barcola’s effort but pushed the ball away from goalkeeper Alisson in the process, and Dembele needed only to knock it into an empty net.
The goal was the earliest Premier League-leading Liverpool had conceded at Anfield in the Champions League since September 2017 against Sevilla.
Arne Slot’s team played considerably better than a week earlier — when they needed a last-gasp goal from substitute Harvey Elliott after the Parisians had dominated — and Reds talisman Mohamed Salah had a shot blocked on the goal line by Nuno Mendes in the game’s first few minutes.
Donnarumma was forced into making an early diving save to keep out a shot from Konate, but both sides spurned chances in a nervy game that had fans on the edge of their seats.
Six-times European champions Liverpool parked themselves in PSG’s territory for much of the second half of normal time and had a goal from Dominik Szoboszlai chalked off for offside in the build-up early in the second period.
They kept Donnarumma busy in the dying minutes, with the keeper parrying away ball after ball fired into the box, but it was Dembele who unleashed what looked like the winner in extra time before Alisson made a dramatic diving save to push the ball wide with his fingertips.
PSG were rock solid under pressure in the shootout, with Vitinha, Goncalo Ramos, Dembele and Desire Doue all finding the net. Liverpool got off to a good start with Salah slamming his effort home, but Nunez and Jones both had tame efforts comfortably stopped by Donnarumma, with Slot wrapping a disconsolate Nunez in a hug afterwards.
‘RAN OUT OF LUCK’
The Liverpool boss was magnanimous in defeat and even had words of praise for his beaten side.
“I think it was the best game of football I’ve ever been involved in,” he said.
“We ran out of luck maybe after last week. After 90 minutes we played the perfect game except for not scoring.”
History was not on the Parisians’ side on Tuesday, as they became just the fourth of 28 teams to progress after losing the first leg at home in a Champions League knockout tie.
“Both of the teams deserve to go to the next phase,” said PSG boss Luis Enrique.
“They played better than us here, but I think my team at Anfield, in a special stadium showed great personality and character.
“We tried to play our best, but it was difficult as they’re so intense. Both teams deserve to qualify.”
The thousands of travelling fans, many of them shirtless despite the chilly temperature, were not daunted by their team’s odds, as they danced and sang until the final whistle.
Liverpool have little time to rest ahead of Sunday’s League Cup final against Newcastle United.
“It’s part of football,” Reds captain Virgil van Dijk said of Tuesday’s defeat. “I said to the guys, ‘Obviously, you can be disappointed because we’re out of the competition, but chin up and get ready for the next challenge, a beautiful one on the weekend’.” Paris St Germain beat Liverpool 4-1 in a penalty shootout to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals after winning a rip-roaring last-16 second-leg match at Anfield 1-0 on Tuesday thanks to a goal from livewire Ousmane Dembele.

They kept Donnarumma busy in the dying minutes, with the keeper parrying away ball after ball fired into the box, but it was Dembele who unleashed what looked like the winner in extra time before Alisson made a dramatic diving save to push the ball wide with his fingertips.
PSG were rock solid under pressure in the shootout, with Vitinha, Goncalo Ramos, Dembele and Desire Doue all finding the net. Liverpool got off to a good start with Salah slamming his effort home, but Nunez and Jones both had tame efforts comfortably stopped by Donnarumma, with Slot wrapping a disconsolate Nunez in a hug afterwards.
‘RAN OUT OF LUCK’
The Liverpool boss was magnanimous in defeat and even had words of praise for his beaten side.
“I think it was the best game of football I’ve ever been involved in,” he said.
“We ran out of luck maybe after last week. After 90 minutes we played the perfect game except for not scoring.”
History was not on the Parisians’ side on Tuesday, as they became just the fourth of 28 teams to progress after losing the first leg at home in a Champions League knockout tie.
“Both of the teams deserve to go to the next phase,” said PSG boss Luis Enrique.
“They played better than us here, but I think my team at Anfield, in a special stadium showed great personality and character.
“We tried to play our best, but it was difficult as they’re so intense. Both teams deserve to qualify.”
The thousands of travelling fans, many of them shirtless despite the chilly temperature, were not daunted by their team’s odds, as they danced and sang until the final whistle.
Liverpool have little time to rest ahead of Sunday’s League Cup final against Newcastle United.
“It’s part of football,” Reds captain Virgil van Dijk said of Tuesday’s defeat. “I said to the guys, ‘Obviously, you can be disappointed because we’re out of the competition, but chin up and get ready for the next challenge, a beautiful one on the weekend’.”

Title: Electric solar hybrid boats to boost cruise tourism on river Yamuna in Delhi
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:29:25 +0000
Content: The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW), on Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with multiple Delhi government agencies to promote cruise tourism on the Yamuna River. The MoU, which involves the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), aims to develop a four-kilometer stretch of the River Yamuna (National Waterway 110) between Sonia Vihar and Jagatpur.
The MoU was signed at a ceremony held at Asita Park, attended by senior officials including Lt. Governor of Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, Union Minister of MoPSW Sarbananda Sonowal, and Union Minister of State (MoPSW) Shantanu Thakur.
In his address, Sarbananda Sonowal emphasized the transformative impact of the government’s focus on sustainable inland water transport. He said, “India’s waterways have witnessed a transformational revival after decades of neglect. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visionary push for sustainable and modern inland water transport has turned potential into progress. The introduction of eco-friendly cruise tourism on the Yamuna is another milestone, ensuring cleaner, greener, and more efficient waterways that will boost both connectivity and tourism in the heart of Delhi.”
The initiative aims to transform the stretch between Sonia Vihar and Jagatpur into a hub for eco-friendly cruise operations. The government will deploy electric-solar hybrid boats, each capable of carrying 20-30 passengers. These boats will feature bio-toilets, Public Announcement systems, and life jackets to ensure passenger safety. To facilitate smooth operations, IWAI will also install two HDPE jetties for ferry services.
The project is designed to promote green, sustainable tourism while enhancing short-distance navigation and recreational activities on National Waterway 110, which stretches upstream of the Wazirabad Barrage. It is expected to redefine Delhi’s tourism landscape, offering an eco-friendly travel experience along the Yamuna River.
The Yamuna River, spanning 1,089 kilometers across Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, was declared National Waterway-110 in 2014. The development of this stretch forms part of the broader effort by IWAI, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and Union Minister Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, to revive and develop India’s waterways infrastructure, enhancing economic growth and tourism.
IWAI’s efforts extend across India, with ongoing projects in states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, and Kerala. These include the development of new IWT terminals, fairways, night navigation aids, and locks on National Waterways 1, 2, 3, and 16. The Authority has also introduced electric catamarans in Varanasi and Ayodhya, with plans to deploy more in Mathura and Guwahati.

Title: PM Modi meets Pravind Jugnauth, discusses strengthening bilateral ties
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:17:36 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met former Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on Wednesday to discuss ways to further enhance cooperation between India and Mauritius across various sectors.
The two leaders share a positive relationship, with Jugnauth having attended the swearing-in ceremony of the Modi government’s third term in June 2024. Later in the day, PM Modi is also scheduled to meet the Leader of the Opposition in Mauritius, Georges Lesjongard.
PM Modi is currently on a two-day visit to Mauritius from March 11 to 12. As part of his official engagements, he will attend the National Day celebrations of the East African nation. Earlier in the day, he extended his best wishes to the people of Mauritius through a post on X, stating, “National Day wishes to the people of Mauritius. Looking forward to today’s programmes, including taking part in the celebrations.”
On Tuesday, PM Modi held “productive talks” with his Mauritian counterpart, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, in Port Louis. Their discussions focused on reviewing bilateral relations, assessing ongoing collaborations, and exploring new avenues to strengthen the deep ties between the two nations.
In a symbolic and unique gesture reflecting the warmth of their partnership, both leaders traveled together in the same car to a banquet hosted by PM Ramgoolam in honor of the visiting Indian leader. This further underscored the strong and enduring relationship between India and Mauritius, which has significantly deepened over the past decade under PM Modi’s leadership.
During the visit, the government of Mauritius announced its decision to confer its highest honor, ‘The Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean,’ upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The announcement was made by PM Ramgoolam just before Modi addressed the Indian community in Mauritius on Tuesday evening. PM Modi is the first Indian to receive this prestigious award, which also marks the 21st international honor bestowed upon him by a foreign country.
PM Ramgoolam had also personally welcomed PM Modi at the airport early Tuesday morning, further highlighting the warmth and significance of their diplomatic ties.
During their discussions, PM Modi reiterated India’s commitment to being a trusted development partner for Mauritius. He emphasized that both nations would continue working together to advance the interests of the Global South.
On Tuesday evening, PM Modi addressed a community programme in Port Louis, celebrating the cultural and emotional bonds between India and Mauritius.
“Mauritius is not just a partner country. For us, Mauritius is family,” PM Modi declared while speaking at the Trianon Convention Centre. He also acknowledged the presence of PM Ramgoolam and his wife, Veena Ramgoolam, stating that their participation made the event even more special.
Additionally, PM Modi handed over Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards to the Ramgoolams, reinforcing the importance of India-Mauritius friendship and the deep-rooted historical connections between the two nations.

Title: EU to impose counter tariffs on over $28 billion of US goods
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:06:13 +0000
Content: The European Union will impose counter tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28.33 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday.
The commission said it will end the current suspension of tariffs on U.S. products on April 1 and will also put forward a new package of countermeasures on U.S. goods by mid-April.
“This matches the economic scope of the U.S. tariffs. Our countermeasures will be introduced in two steps. Starting with 1 April and fully in place as of 13 April,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement.
“We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue. I have entrusted Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to resume his talks to explore better solutions with the U.S.,” von der Leyen added.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminium imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.

Title: Pakistan rescues 155 hostages from train, dozens still held, sources say
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:02:56 +0000
Content: Pakistani forces have rescued 155 passengers from a train that was hijacked by separatist fighters in the southwest of the country, security sources said on Wednesday, while the government said an operation was underway to rescue dozens still held hostage.
Militants blew up a railway track and opened fire on the train on Tuesday as it travelled from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital city, to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), an ethnic armed group, claimed responsibility for the attack and threatened to start executing hostages unless Baloch political prisoners, activists, and missing persons it said had been abducted by the military were not released within 48 hours.
The militants have made bombers wearing “suicide jackets” sit next to some of the hostages, said multiple sources who asked not to be named. They did not specify the number of people being held but the interior ministry said in a statement that an operation was underway to rescue them.
BLA said on Tuesday it was holding 214 people hostage, and a security source told Reuters that there were 425 passengers on the train when it was attacked.
The number of militants involved in the attack was not clear. The security sources said on Wednesday that 27 had been killed so far.
BLA is the largest of several ethnic armed groups battling Pakistan’s government in the mineral rich province of Balochistan, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.

Title: BJP sweeps Haryana polls, wins nine of 10 municipal corporations
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:01:51 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Haryana civic polls on Wednesday, with its mayoral candidates winning the municipal corporations of Ambala, Gurugram, Hisar, Karnal, Rohtak, Faridabad, Yamunanagar, Panipat, and Sonipat.
The main opposition, Congress, was defeated even in Rohtak, a stronghold of Bhupinder Hooda.
Congress, which contested the state civic polls using its symbol for the first time, failed to win a single seat.
In Manesar, independent candidate Inderjit Yadav defeated BJP’s Sundar Lal by 2,235 votes.
In Gurugram, BJP’s Raj Rani secured 270,781 votes, defeating Congress candidate Seema Pahuja by a margin of 179,485 votes. In Faridabad, Parveen Joshi of the BJP won the seat with 416,927 votes.
In Hisar, Parveen Popli of the BJP won by a margin of 64,456 votes, while in Rohtak, Ram Avtar Valmiki of the BJP triumphed by a margin of 45,198 votes.
In Karnal, Renu Bala of the BJP won with 83,630 votes, defeating Congress candidate Manoj Wadhwa, who received 25,359 votes. In Yamunanagar, Suman of the BJP emerged victorious.
In Ambala, Shailja Sachdeva of the BJP won the mayoral by-election, while in Sonipat, Rajiv Jain of the BJP secured 57,858 votes to win the seat. In Panipat, Konal Saini of the BJP won with 162,075 votes.
Elated by the party’s significant victory, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini told the media, “The people of Haryana have put their stamp of approval on the triple-engine government… I thank the people of Haryana from the bottom of my heart. Our local body government and this triple-engine government will play a crucial role in fulfilling PM Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat.'”
Believing the civic body election results won’t significantly impact the Congress, party veteran Hooda said, “The Congress must have gained in some areas, but I did not campaign actively during the elections. I don’t think these results will have an impact.”
The BJP’s sweep, especially in urban areas like Gurugram and Faridabad, proves its dominance over the state’s political landscape. The party made history in October 2024 by becoming the first political party to win three consecutive terms in the state assembly elections.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Mauritius’ sacred Ganga Talao
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:40:56 +0000
Content: Highlighting the deep-rooted civilizational and spiritual connection between India and Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday offered prayers at the revered Ganga Talao, considered the most sacred Hindu pilgrimage site in the Indian Ocean archipelago. During his visit, he also immersed holy water brought from the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela.
“I was deeply moved to visit the sacred Ganga Talao in Mauritius. The spiritual bond between the two countries can be easily felt along its sacred waters. It transcends borders and connects many of our generations to their roots,” PM Modi posted on X.
Ganga Talao, also known as Grand Basin, is a sacred crater lake located about 550 meters above sea level in the mountainous southwest district of Savanne. The site features a temple along its shoreline, along with small shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva and other Hindu deities.
According to local beliefs, a Hindu priest discovered the lake around 1897. In the 1970s, another priest from India brought sacred water from the Ganges and poured it into the lake, thus naming it ‘Ganga Talao.’ The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the offering as a symbolic gesture of the shared devotion, cultural affinity, and sacred ties between India and Mauritius.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi attended Mauritius’ National Day celebrations as the Chief Guest for the second time, an honor he first received in 2015. “Honored to attend the National Day celebrations of Mauritius! Wishing the people of Mauritius continued prosperity and success as we also strengthen the deep-rooted ties between our countries,” PM Modi posted on X after the event.
During the celebrations, Dharambeer Gokhool, President of the Republic of Mauritius, conferred the ‘Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean’ (GCSK) award on Prime Minister Modi, making him the first Indian leader to receive the nation’s highest civilian honor.
PM Modi dedicated the award to the special friendship between India and Mauritius, as well as to the 1.4 billion people of India and their 1.3 million brothers and sisters in Mauritius.
On Tuesday, the Mauritius government had announced its decision to bestow the prestigious honor upon PM Modi during his ongoing two-day State visit. Prime Minister Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam made the announcement just before PM Modi addressed an Indian community event in Port Louis.
“This honor is very fitting for you, Prime Minister. Since we became a republic, only five foreign dignitaries have received this title, and among them is a man we call the ‘Gandhi of Africa’ – Nelson Mandela, who received it in 1998. Let me tell you, we are greatly honored to have you here today and appreciate that you took time out of your very, very busy schedule,” said Ramgoolam, drawing huge applause.
PM Modi’s recognition in Mauritius marks the 21st international award conferred upon him by a foreign country.
As part of the National Day celebrations, an Indian Navy marching contingent participated in the parade, while an Indian Naval Ship made a Port Call to coincide with the event, further symbolizing the enduring partnership between the two nations.

Title: India’s retail inflation eases to 7-month low of 3.6 per cent in February
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:34:51 +0000
Content: The year-on-year inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to an 7-month low of 3.61 per cent in February this year, which is 0.65 per cent lower than the corresponding figure for January, as food prices came down further during the month. This is the lowest retail inflation after July 2024.
The food inflation in February has come down to the lowest level since May 2023 and is 222 basis points lower in comparison to January, according to the official statement.
The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during February is mainly attributed to a decline in the inflation rate of vegetables, eggs, meat &amp; fish, pulses, as well as milk &amp; products.
The key items having the lowest year-on-year inflation in February are ginger (-35.81 per cent), jeera (-28.77 per cent), tomato (-28.51 per cent), cauliflower (-21.19 per cent), garlic (-20.32 per cent), official figures show.
Prices of fuel came down during the month, easing the burden on household budgets with inflation being recorded at (-) 1.33 per cent during February.
As retail inflation continues with its downward trend and has fallen below the RBI’s targeted level of 4 per cent, the central bank will have more headroom to go for a rate cut to propel economic growth and create more jobs.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra last month announced a 25 basis cut in the policy rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth growth amid global uncertainties.
He said that inflation has declined and is expected to further moderate and gradually align with the RBI’s target of 4 per cent.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with its neutral stance in monetary policy and will focus on inflation while supporting growth. This would provide flexibility to respond to the macroeconomic environment, Malhotra said.

Title: Balochistan: BLA threatens to execute Pakistani hostages after military strikes, issues 48-hour ultimatum
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:32:30 +0000
Content: The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has threatened to execute ten Pakistani hostages in retaliation for drone strikes and artillery shelling by Pakistani forces. It has also issued a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding Pakistan release forcibly disappeared activists amidst the ongoing hostage situation in Balochistan’s Bolan district, as reported by the Balochistan Post.
In a media statement, BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch accused Pakistan’s military of executing “irresponsible and foolish military aggression,” claiming that drone strikes and artillery shelling targeted BLA positions near the hijacked Jaffar Express train.
According to the Balochistan Post, Baloch further said that the attacks demonstrated Pakistan’s inability to make responsible decisions about a prisoner exchange and accused the authorities of being motivated only by “war madness and stubbornness.” However, he asserted that none of the BLA fighters were injured, thanks to their “superior defensive strategies and full control of the battlefield.”
Jeeyand Baloch warned, “In response to today’s reckless bombardment, we are forced to execute ten more hostages immediately. If Pakistani forces launch another attack—even a single bullet—ten additional hostages will be executed immediately.”
Earlier, Pakistani military sources reported that at least 13 insurgents involved in the attack had been killed, with several others wounded. Military officials also stated that intense gunfire exchanges were ongoing as the insurgents broke into smaller groups. However, these claims have not been independently confirmed, and the BLA strongly denied them, calling the Pakistani military’s statements “outright fabrications meant to deceive the public and cover up the army’s defeat.”
Jeeyand Baloch further claimed, “Pakistani state institutions are attempting to hide their failure by claiming successes they have not achieved.”
The hostage crisis began Tuesday afternoon when BLA fighters seized control of the Jaffar Express near Machh in Balochistan’s Bolan district, taking over 200 Pakistani military, paramilitary, police, and intelligence personnel as hostages.
The BLA initially issued a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding the immediate release of detained Baloch political prisoners, forcibly disappeared activists, and captured resistance fighters.
BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch also stated that the group had repelled Pakistani ground and aerial reinforcements after intense fighting that lasted over eight hours, as cited by the Balochistan Post. In its most recent statement, the BLA renewed its ultimatum, which now has less than 40 hours left, according to the Balochistan Post.
Jeeyand Baloch cautioned, “If our demands are not met within the remaining time, or if Pakistani forces attempt any further military intervention, all prisoners of war will be executed, and the seized train will be completely destroyed.”
Pakistani authorities have yet to officially respond to the BLA’s ultimatum or recent threats. The situation remains tense and unpredictable, with additional updates expected.

Title: PM Modi conferred with Mauritius’ highest civilian honour

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was conferred with Mauritius’ highest civilian honor, The Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (GCSK), on Wednesday. The prestigious ceremony, held in the capital city of Port Louis, reaffirmed the deep-rooted diplomatic and cultural ties between India and Mauritius. With this honor, PM Modi has now received his 21st international accolade, marking another milestone in his global recognition.
A Tribute to Ancestral Bonds
Receiving the award with humility, Prime Minister Modi dedicated it to the Indian ancestors who migrated to Mauritius centuries ago and to the generations that followed. Acknowledging the shared heritage of both nations, he emphasized that the recognition belonged not just to him but to all Indians.
“This honor is a tribute to the deep-rooted and historical bonds between our two nations. I dedicate it to the 1.4 billion Indians and their 1.3 million brothers and sisters in Mauritius,” he shared on X.
Strengthening a Legacy of Cultural and Diplomatic Relations
During the National Day celebrations, PM Modi expressed gratitude for the prestigious recognition, describing it as a testament to the enduring strength of India-Mauritius relations.
“This is not just my honor; it is an honor for 1.4 billion Indians. It is a recognition of the centuries-old cultural and historical bonds between India and Mauritius. I reaffirm my commitment to strengthening the India-Mauritius strategic partnership and taking it to new heights,” he stated.
Mauritius PM Announced the Honor in a Community Gathering
The announcement to confer the award on PM Modi was made a day earlier by Navinchandra Ramgoolam, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, during a community event. Praising PM Modi’s leadership, Ramgoolam emphasized that the Indian Prime Minister truly deserved the recognition.
During the same event, PM Modi also presented the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to President Dharambeer Gokhool and First Lady Meena Gokhool. The OCI card, a significant gesture of diplomatic goodwill, grants foreign nationals of Indian origin visa-free travel to India.
India’s Expanding Global Presence in National Day Celebrations
PM Modi’s participation in international National Day celebrations reflects India’s growing global stature and strategic partnerships.
In 2023, he was the Guest of Honor at France’s Bastille Day Parade, a defining moment that symbolized India’s deepening military and strategic ties with France. The sight of Indian tri-services marching down the Champs-Élysées alongside French troops reinforced India’s growing role in global geopolitics.
In 2022, PM Modi visited Lumbini, Nepal, for Buddha Jayanti celebrations, reaffirming India’s deep historical connection to Buddhism and shared heritage with Nepal. The visit underscored India’s efforts to promote cultural and spiritual diplomacy across the region.
In 2021, Bangladesh invited PM Modi to its National Day celebrations, marking 50 years of its independence—an event closely tied to India’s role in its liberation. The visit reinforced India’s commitment to regional stability and economic cooperation.
Similarly, in 2017, PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka for International Vesak Day highlighted India’s role in cultural diplomacy, strengthening ties with Buddhist-majority nations.

Title: Ukraine’s Svitolina thankful for US support after Trump-Zelenskiy clash

Content: Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina said she had received an outpouring of support from Americans following U.S. President Donald Trump’s extraordinary clash with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House last month.
Svitolina thanked Americans for their “unwavering support” and “compassion” in a social media post on Sunday after beating Danielle Collins in the third round of Indian Wells.
After defeating another local hope Jessica Pegula 5-7 6-1 6-2 on Tuesday, Svitolina told reporters she had received solid support at the tournament in the California desert.
“I feel like since that meeting in the Oval Office, I got a lot of messages of support from the American people and a lot of people here when I arrived at the tournament, giving love and support to Ukrainians for people back at home,” she added.
“Also the massive support that I got taking in consideration that I played three American girls back-to-back. It’s amazing, really special to get that, taking into consideration all the stress that all Ukrainians are facing right now back at home.”
The U.S. on Tuesday agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after Kyiv said that it was ready to support Washington’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia.
Svitolina next faces Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells.
Ukrainian players have been boycotting the post-match tradition of shaking hands at the net when taking on opponents from Russia and Belarus, which is a staging ground for the invasion.

Title: Russia says it’s waiting to hear from US on Ukraine 30-day ceasefire plan
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:03:29 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Wednesday it needed to be briefed by the United States on the outcome of U.S.-Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia before it would comment on whether a proposed ceasefire was acceptable to Russia.
After more than eight hours of talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would take an offer of a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, accepted by Ukrainian officials, to Russia.
The United States also agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after earlier suspending them and opening up bilateral talks with Russia in a reversal of longstanding U.S. policy on Ukraine.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia was waiting for a briefing from Washington. He did not rule out the possibility of a phone call between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, which he said could be organised very quickly if needed.
A senior Russian source told Reuters earlier that Russia would need to hash out the terms of any ceasefire and get some sort of guarantees.
“It is difficult for Putin to agree to this in its current form,” the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, told reporter. “Putin has a strong position because Russia is advancing.”
Russia controls just under a fifth of Ukraine, about 113,000 square km (43,630 miles) and has been edging forward for months. Ukraine seized a sliver of western Russia in August as a bargaining chip but its grip there is weakening, according to open source maps of the war and Russian estimates.
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Title: India’s unincorporated sector sees 12.84% growth, employment surges past 12 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:01:51 +0000
Content: The unincorporated non-agricultural sector in India has witnessed remarkable growth over the past year, with the number of enterprises increasing by 12.84%, according to the latest Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) 2023-24). Conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI), the survey highlights the sector’s expansion and its growing role in employment generation.
The findings reveal that the number of establishments in the sector has surged to 7.34 crore in 2023-24, up from 6.50 crore in the previous year. Employment in these enterprises has also seen a significant boost, crossing 12 crore workers between October 2023 and September 2024—an increase of over one crore workers compared to the previous year. This surge in employment reflects the resilience of small businesses and informal enterprises that drive a significant portion of India’s economy.
The unincorporated sector, comprising manufacturing, trade, and services (excluding construction), remains a crucial pillar of India’s economy. The report underscores the importance of these enterprises in providing livelihood opportunities, particularly in states like West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, which have seen substantial increases in the number of establishments.
While government initiatives like Mudra Yojana and Startup India have played a pivotal role in encouraging entrepreneurship and expanding the informal sector. The increase in the number of establishments suggests that such schemes have contributed to the sector’s overall expansion.
The ASUSE 2023-24 report was presented in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday in a written response by Minister of State (Independent Charge) Rao Inderjit Singh.

During high-level discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mauritius Prime Minister Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, the leaders underscored their shared vision for a free, open, safe, and secure Indian Ocean Region.
 
Maritime Security and Defence Cooperation
Recognizing maritime security as a key pillar of their bilateral relations, both leaders agreed to work closely in countering maritime challenges and protecting regional strategic interests. The Prime Minister of Mauritius expressed gratitude for India’s unwavering support in safeguarding its vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through the provision of defence assets, joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys, and regular patrolling.
 
“India has emerged as a significant security provider for Mauritius,” said Prime Minister Ramgoolam, acknowledging India’s assistance in refitting Coast Guard Ships Victory, Valiant, and Barracuda.
 
Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s commitment to strengthening Mauritius’ defence capabilities under its Vision SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). “Mauritius is a special maritime partner for India. Our shared objectives in the region drive us to continue supporting its defence and security needs,” he stated.
 
The two leaders agreed to enhance maritime cooperation through increased deployment of ships and aircraft, further secure Mauritius’ EEZ using the newly built Agalega runway and jetty, and assist in setting up a National Maritime Information Sharing Centre to bolster maritime domain awareness. India also committed to providing expertise in marine operations and port security while supporting customized training initiatives for the Mauritius Police Force.
 
Regional and Multilateral Collaboration
Discussions also covered regional geopolitical matters, including the ongoing dialogue between Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the Chagos Islands. Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed India’s “firm and unwavering support” to Mauritius on the issue, a gesture appreciated by Prime Minister Ramgoolam.
 
The two leaders pledged to advance regional cooperation through frameworks such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Colombo Security Conclave, Global Biofuels Alliance, International Solar Alliance, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. They welcomed India’s upcoming chairmanship of IORA for 2025-26, recognizing its potential to enhance regional maritime security.
 
Deepening Cultural and People-to-People Ties
Highlighting the historical and cultural connections between India and Mauritius, both leaders expressed a strong commitment to preserving their shared heritage. Efforts will be made to support the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in documenting the records of indentured Indian workers, with institutional backing from the National Archives of India.
 
Diaspora engagement will be strengthened through initiatives such as the Know India Programme, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, and scholarships for Mauritian students. The leaders also discussed expanding tourism and cultural exchanges, including visits to religious sites in India, such as Char Dham and the Ramayana Trail.
 
To facilitate labor mobility, both nations agreed to expedite the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on labor recruitment between Mauritius and India.
 
A Strategic Partnership for the Future
Expressing satisfaction with the comprehensive discussions, both leaders acknowledged the evolution of the India-Mauritius relationship into a model bilateral partnership in the region. “Our special and close bilateral ties set a standard for cooperation,” they stated in a joint declaration, emphasizing their shared vision of elevating the relationship into an enhanced strategic partnership that benefits both nations.
 
Prime Minister Ramgoolam thanked Prime Minister Modi for his presence as the Guest of Honour at Mauritius’ 57th National Day celebrations, marking the anniversary of the country’s independence and the 33rd anniversary of the Republic of Mauritius.

Title: Pakistan: Security forces claim Jaffar Express train operation over, 346 hostages rescued
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:09:46 +0000
Content: The standoff between fighters of the Baloch Liberation Army’s (BLA) Majeed Brigade and the Pakistani military, following a massive attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train in Bolan district, has finally ended after more than 24 hours, multiple reports indicated on Wednesday evening.
Sources confirmed that the military operation to neutralize the attackers and rescue the hostages has concluded. A clearance operation was successfully carried out, resulting in the rescue of at least 346 hostages and the elimination of around 50 attackers.
The train, which was traveling from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, to Peshawar, the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), was hijacked by BLA militants, who took over 400 passengers hostage.
“Operation concluded, site cleared. All hostages released. Total rescued: 346—168 last night and 178 today. 50 terrorists eliminated,” confirmed a reliable security source.
Security forces stated that the militants were using women and children as human shields.
“The clearance operation was carried out with extreme caution and skill, saving many lives. The number of passengers who fell victim to the brutality of the terrorists is still being determined,” the source added.
It was also revealed that the handler and mastermind behind the attack was in active communication with the militants from Afghanistan.
The BLA separatist group claimed responsibility for the attack, making multiple unverified claims of releasing all women and children while keeping over 200 hostages—primarily individuals from Punjab province who were allegedly working with security forces. The BLA also claimed to have executed at least 20 abducted security personnel after checking their IDs.
On Tuesday, a large number of BLA militants forced the Jaffar Express to halt after blowing up the railway track in the Dhabar area of Bolan Pass, Balochistan.
Security forces and railway authorities confirmed that the train had come under attack near Tunnel No. 8 in the Bolan Pass.
The Pakistan military launched a clearance operation, reaching the site using cargo trains. Sources reported that hostages released in the initial stage had to walk at least seven kilometers to reach the nearest railway station, where they were received by security personnel.
“We came under attack from all sides. They were everywhere. We could hear gunshots coming from all directions. Passengers covered themselves with cloth to hide. It was horrific,” said one rescued hostage, recounting the ordeal.
“We walked for about three and a half hours—nearly seven kilometers—before reaching Panir railway station. The militants told us not to look back and to keep walking. Some women had to walk barefoot for hours to reach the station,” he added.
The attack has been condemned internationally, with the United States, Iran, and Germany among the countries denouncing the incident.
In response, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti chaired a high-level meeting on law and order, where officials briefed him on the Jaffar Express attack.
“They want to impose their ideology with guns and violence. Should we allow them to take people off buses and kill them?” questioned CM Sarfaraz Bugti.
Bugti highlighted that many of the passengers on the train were soldiers returning home on leave, emphasizing that they were unarmed.
“There are rules in war, and there are laws. What will history say—that innocent teachers, barbers, and doctors were murdered? Whoever commits acts of violence against the state, whoever takes up arms against it, will face unequivocal punishment,” he stated.
“Terrorists cannot occupy even an inch of our land. This attack is an attempt to create an impression of instability. The dream of anti-national elements to divide Pakistan like a cake will never be realized. We must eliminate all confusion and fight the war against terrorism with full determination,” he added.

For women in distress, the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS-112) has been established across all states and UTs, ensuring computer-aided dispatch of police and field resources, the minister said. Since its launch, the system has handled over 43 crore calls.
In addition to ERSS, a fully operational, dedicated Women Helpline (WHL-181) is available across India, except in West Bengal. The WHL has been integrated with ERSS, handling over 2.10 crore calls and assisting more than 84.43 lakh women so far.
To ensure swift justice for victims of heinous sexual offences, the government has been providing financial assistance to states and UTs for setting up Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) since 2019.
So far, 790 FTSCs have been approved, of which 745, including 404 exclusive POCSO (e-POCSO) courts, are operational across 30 states/UTs. These courts have disposed of over 3,06,000 cases related to rape and offences under the POCSO Act across the country, Thakur said.

During his visit, PM Modi engaged in discussions with Mauritian leaders and interacted with the Indian community, reinforcing cultural and diplomatic connections.
One of the key highlights of his visit was a symbolic gesture at Ganga Talao (Grand Bassin), a sacred Hindu pilgrimage site in Mauritius. On Wednesday, PM Modi mixed holy water from the Prayagraj Mahakumbh with the sacred lake, signifying the deep-rooted spiritual and cultural ties between India and Mauritius.

Title: Parliamentary delegation from Madagascar meets Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:05:16 +0000
Content: A parliamentary delegation from Madagascar, led by President of the National Assembly of Madagascar, Justin Tokely, called on Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla at the Parliament House on Wednesday. The meeting underscored the strong and historic ties between India and Madagascar, with both nations reaffirming their commitment to deepening bilateral cooperation.
During the meeting, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla emphasized that India considers Madagascar a cherished and reliable friend, as well as a steadfast partner in its journey of progress. He highlighted that under India’s “SAGAR” (Security and Growth for All in the Region) vision, Madagascar plays a crucial role as a key ally in the Indian Ocean region, contributing to regional stability and economic prosperity.
Birla added that India and Madagascar share a centuries-old history of trade, culture, and mutual interaction, and India has always been at the forefront in providing assistance to its neighbors, especially during times of crisis, guided by the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’.
The Lok Sabha Speaker also highlighted India’s proactive role in providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to Madagascar. He pointed out that India has supported various development projects in Madagascar, demonstrating its commitment to mutually beneficial growth.
Birla acknowledged the significant contribution of the Indian diaspora in Madagascar in strengthening bilateral ties and expressed happiness over the successful organization of the first ‘Jaipur Foot Camp’ in Madagascar, where hundreds of differently-abled individuals were provided with artificial limbs.
Discussing India’s democratic traditions, Birla described India as the world’s oldest and largest democracy, referring to it as the ‘Mother of Democracy’. He highlighted that even thousands of years ago, India had democratic institutions that made collective decisions for the people.
He also said that India’s increasing voter participation, noting that since the first general election in 1952, voter turnout has steadily increased, reaching nearly 66% in the 2024 elections. This, he stated, reflects the growing engagement and faith of the Indian people in the democratic process.
The Madagascar delegation was also briefed on the functioning of the Indian Parliament, including the Budget Session process. Birla introduced them to the Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE) and expressed hope that PRIDE’s capacity-building programs would benefit Madagascar’s parliamentarians.

Title: India’s IT services firms likely to post 4-6% revenue growth in FY 2026
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:23:26 +0000
Content: Indian IT services companies are expected to record a moderate 4-6% growth in USD terms in FY 2026, according to an ICRA report released on Wednesday.
ICRA anticipates that attrition levels will stabilize around the long-term average of 12-13%. Moreover, hiring is likely to remain low until the growth momentum picks up by the end of FY 2026, the report states.
Deal wins for the 15 leading large- and medium-sized listed Indian IT services companies have remained resilient in recent quarters. Industry participants continue to sit on a healthy total contract value, providing revenue visibility over the near to medium term, according to the report.
The operating profit margins for the sample set of companies, which account for 60% of IT sector revenue, are expected to remain at 22.5-23% over the next three to four quarters.
Commenting on the near-term industry performance, ICRA Vice President Deepak Jotwani said: *”The growth momentum for ICRA’s sample set of IT services companies is likely to remain muted in the near term due to uncertainty over potential US trade tariffs and macroeconomic headwinds in key markets such as the US and Europe. ICRA projects a 4-6% revenue expansion in USD terms in FY 2026, following a 4-5% increase estimated for FY 2025. Policy changes by the US government for key sectors catered to by Indian IT services companies, as well as future interest rate trajectories, will remain key monitorables.”*
The sample set recorded a year-on-year revenue growth of 3.6% in USD terms in the first nine months of FY 2025, showing gradual recovery over the past three quarters. This was supported by a relatively lower base in FY 2024, a slight uptick in discretionary spending by customers in the banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI) and retail sectors in some markets, and investments in Generative AI (GenAI) initiatives translating into new order inflows.
ICRA highlighted some relief for industry players as attrition rates and wage cost inflation—concerns in FY 2023 and the first half of FY 2024—have eased.
Attrition for the sample set of companies dropped sharply to 12.8% in Q3 FY 2025 from 22.3% in Q3 FY 2023, as slower growth and strong hiring in the previous fiscal helped address the earlier demand-supply mismatch. ICRA expects attrition levels to stabilize at a long-term average of 12-13% in the near term.
Moreover, employee costs as a percentage of operating income (OI) declined marginally to 56.2% in Q3 FY 2025 from 57.0% in Q3 FY 2024, owing to moderation in wage hikes. This, coupled with increased employee utilization and cost optimization, supported operating profit margins at 22.5-23.0% in recent quarters, which are expected to sustain through FY 2026.
ICRA expects hiring to remain low in the near term until growth momentum picks up by the end of FY 2026. The lower hiring activity can also be attributed to increased investments in GenAI, which are expected to improve productivity and drive cost savings. Leading Indian IT services companies have trained a sizeable portion of their workforce in GenAI skills and have ramped up their capabilities to deliver AI-driven solutions.
“This has started to show results, as the inflow of GenAI-related deals for major industry players has risen in recent quarters and is expected to grow materially over the medium term, as technology adoption becomes more widespread. The healthcare and BFSI sectors remain early adopters of AI/GenAI capabilities and continue to invest in this space,”* Jotwani added.

Title: SIP investments surge over 32% YoY, crossing Rs.2.63 lakh crore in FY25 to date
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:43:20 +0000
Content: Showcasing the resilience of the Indian investors, systematic investment plans (SIPs) saw a strong surge in the financial year 2024-25, with contributions reaching Rs 2,63,426 crore (April-February), according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) on Wednesday.
This marks a significant jump of 32.23 percent (sans March 2025 data) compared to the previous financial year (FY24), when the total SIP contribution stood at Rs 1,99,219 crore.
The rise in SIP contributions indicates growing confidence in the market, with retail investors continuing to invest regularly despite market fluctuations.
The SIP contributions in the month of February stood at Rs 25,999 crore against Rs 26,400 crore recorded in the previous month.
The month of February saw 44.56 lakh new SIPs being initiated, while the number of discontinued SIP accounts stood at 55 lakh.
The total assets under management (AUM) for SIPs reached Rs 12.38 lakh crore, accounting for 19.2 percent of the mutual fund industry’s total assets.
A new data point introduced by the AMFI revealed that 8.26 crore SIP accounts actively contributed to the inflows during the month.
According to Nehal Meshram from Morningstar Investment Research India, domestic investors continued their strong participation in equity-oriented mutual funds in February 2025, marking the 48th consecutive month of net inflows into the segment.
Despite this recent volatility, long-term investors remain committed to their investment strategies, demonstrating the importance of disciplined investing amid market fluctuations.
“While short-term headwinds have tempered investment flows, domestic investor confidence remains strong, as indicated by continued inflows. Investors are adopting a cautious yet steady approach, reassessing their portfolios while maintaining long-term investment commitments,” said Meshram.
Beyond thematic funds, flexi-cap funds saw the second-highest net inflows, totalling Rs 5,104.22 crore, highlighting investor preference for diversified strategies with flexibility across market caps.
Meanwhile, small-cap and mid-cap funds continued to attract healthy inflows, receiving Rs 3,722.46 crore and Rs 3,406.95 crore, respectively, as investors sought opportunities in high-growth potential segments.
Large-cap funds also saw strong investor interest, reflecting their appeal from both a valuation and asset allocation perspective.

Title: BJP sweeps Haryana polls, wins nine of 10 municipal corporations
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:01:51 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Haryana civic polls on Wednesday, with its mayoral candidates winning the municipal corporations of Ambala, Gurugram, Hisar, Karnal, Rohtak, Faridabad, Yamunanagar, Panipat, and Sonipat.
The main opposition, Congress, was defeated even in Rohtak, a stronghold of Bhupinder Hooda.
Congress, which contested the state civic polls using its symbol for the first time, failed to win a single seat.
In Manesar, independent candidate Inderjit Yadav defeated BJP’s Sundar Lal by 2,235 votes.
In Gurugram, BJP’s Raj Rani secured 270,781 votes, defeating Congress candidate Seema Pahuja by a margin of 179,485 votes. In Faridabad, Parveen Joshi of the BJP won the seat with 416,927 votes.
In Hisar, Parveen Popli of the BJP won by a margin of 64,456 votes, while in Rohtak, Ram Avtar Valmiki of the BJP triumphed by a margin of 45,198 votes.
In Karnal, Renu Bala of the BJP won with 83,630 votes, defeating Congress candidate Manoj Wadhwa, who received 25,359 votes. In Yamunanagar, Suman of the BJP emerged victorious.
In Ambala, Shailja Sachdeva of the BJP won the mayoral by-election, while in Sonipat, Rajiv Jain of the BJP secured 57,858 votes to win the seat. In Panipat, Konal Saini of the BJP won with 162,075 votes.
Elated by the party’s significant victory, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini told the media, “The people of Haryana have put their stamp of approval on the triple-engine government… I thank the people of Haryana from the bottom of my heart. Our local body government and this triple-engine government will play a crucial role in fulfilling PM Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat.'”
Believing the civic body election results won’t significantly impact the Congress, party veteran Hooda said, “The Congress must have gained in some areas, but I did not campaign actively during the elections. I don’t think these results will have an impact.”
The BJP’s sweep, especially in urban areas like Gurugram and Faridabad, proves its dominance over the state’s political landscape. The party made history in October 2024 by becoming the first political party to win three consecutive terms in the state assembly elections.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Mauritius’ sacred Ganga Talao
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:40:56 +0000
Content: Highlighting the deep-rooted civilizational and spiritual connection between India and Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday offered prayers at the revered Ganga Talao, considered the most sacred Hindu pilgrimage site in the Indian Ocean archipelago. During his visit, he also immersed holy water brought from the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela.
“I was deeply moved to visit the sacred Ganga Talao in Mauritius. The spiritual bond between the two countries can be easily felt along its sacred waters. It transcends borders and connects many of our generations to their roots,” PM Modi posted on X.
Ganga Talao, also known as Grand Basin, is a sacred crater lake located about 550 meters above sea level in the mountainous southwest district of Savanne. The site features a temple along its shoreline, along with small shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva and other Hindu deities.
According to local beliefs, a Hindu priest discovered the lake around 1897. In the 1970s, another priest from India brought sacred water from the Ganges and poured it into the lake, thus naming it ‘Ganga Talao.’ The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the offering as a symbolic gesture of the shared devotion, cultural affinity, and sacred ties between India and Mauritius.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi attended Mauritius’ National Day celebrations as the Chief Guest for the second time, an honor he first received in 2015. “Honored to attend the National Day celebrations of Mauritius! Wishing the people of Mauritius continued prosperity and success as we also strengthen the deep-rooted ties between our countries,” PM Modi posted on X after the event.
During the celebrations, Dharambeer Gokhool, President of the Republic of Mauritius, conferred the ‘Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean’ (GCSK) award on Prime Minister Modi, making him the first Indian leader to receive the nation’s highest civilian honor.
PM Modi dedicated the award to the special friendship between India and Mauritius, as well as to the 1.4 billion people of India and their 1.3 million brothers and sisters in Mauritius.
On Tuesday, the Mauritius government had announced its decision to bestow the prestigious honor upon PM Modi during his ongoing two-day State visit. Prime Minister Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam made the announcement just before PM Modi addressed an Indian community event in Port Louis.
“This honor is very fitting for you, Prime Minister. Since we became a republic, only five foreign dignitaries have received this title, and among them is a man we call the ‘Gandhi of Africa’ – Nelson Mandela, who received it in 1998. Let me tell you, we are greatly honored to have you here today and appreciate that you took time out of your very, very busy schedule,” said Ramgoolam, drawing huge applause.
PM Modi’s recognition in Mauritius marks the 21st international award conferred upon him by a foreign country.
As part of the National Day celebrations, an Indian Navy marching contingent participated in the parade, while an Indian Naval Ship made a Port Call to coincide with the event, further symbolizing the enduring partnership between the two nations.

Title: India’s retail inflation eases to 7-month low of 3.6 per cent in February
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:34:51 +0000
Content: The year-on-year inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to an 7-month low of 3.61 per cent in February this year, which is 0.65 per cent lower than the corresponding figure for January, as food prices came down further during the month. This is the lowest retail inflation after July 2024.
The food inflation in February has come down to the lowest level since May 2023 and is 222 basis points lower in comparison to January, according to the official statement.
The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during February is mainly attributed to a decline in the inflation rate of vegetables, eggs, meat &amp; fish, pulses, as well as milk &amp; products.
The key items having the lowest year-on-year inflation in February are ginger (-35.81 per cent), jeera (-28.77 per cent), tomato (-28.51 per cent), cauliflower (-21.19 per cent), garlic (-20.32 per cent), official figures show.
Prices of fuel came down during the month, easing the burden on household budgets with inflation being recorded at (-) 1.33 per cent during February.
As retail inflation continues with its downward trend and has fallen below the RBI’s targeted level of 4 per cent, the central bank will have more headroom to go for a rate cut to propel economic growth and create more jobs.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra last month announced a 25 basis cut in the policy rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth growth amid global uncertainties.
He said that inflation has declined and is expected to further moderate and gradually align with the RBI’s target of 4 per cent.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with its neutral stance in monetary policy and will focus on inflation while supporting growth. This would provide flexibility to respond to the macroeconomic environment, Malhotra said.
