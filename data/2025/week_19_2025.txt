Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 14:18:32 +0000
Content: A panel discussion on best practices for social media advertising took centre stage at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai on Saturday. Held at the Jio World Convention Centre and organised by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the session brought together media professionals and digital creators who stressed the need for authenticity, ethical content creation, and transparent branding in the influencer ecosystem.
The panel featured prominent voices from media and digital content creation: Saheli Sinha, Director, ASCII; Shibani Akhtar, film actor and influencer; Mayank Shekhar, entertainment journalist; and Vinay Pillai, Chief Business Officer, Pocket Aces. The discussion was moderated by Tanu Banerjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co.
The panelists emphasized that as influencers continue to shape public discourse and consumer behavior in the digital economy, the need for responsible advertising and honest communication is paramount.
Authenticity is Key
Shibani Akhtar encouraged influencers to stay true to their personal voice while crafting branded content. She highlighted that credibility stems from genuine engagement with the brand and messaging, rather than simply endorsing products. “Influencer marketing works best when it reflects the creator’s values and beliefs,” she said.
Tailored Storytelling Over Uniform Strategy
Vinay Pillai advised against a one-size-fits-all strategy, stating that different digital platforms demand unique content approaches. He stressed the importance of data-informed decisions and conscious brand-building that aligns with platform-specific audiences.
Credibility in the Age of Influence
Commenting on the blurring lines between traditional celebrities and digital creators, Shri Mayank Shekhar pointed out that influence today is niche-driven and platform-led. He warned creators to refrain from spreading misinformation and highlighted the need for fact-checking and originality, especially in sponsored content.
Transparency and Legal Awareness
Saheli Sinha called for full disclosure of paid and promotional posts, urging creators to earn and maintain audience trust. She also emphasized the importance of understanding legal obligations and content responsibility, adding that ASCII offers educational programs to help creators navigate the digital advertising landscape.
A Unified Call for Responsible Content
The session concluded with a consensus that the future of influencer marketing lies in building long-term trust with audiences. This includes adhering to platform guidelines, maintaining transparency, defining personal boundaries, and communicating with clarity and honesty.
The panel’s recommendations signal a collective industry move toward formalizing best practices in influencer advertising and fostering a more ethical, transparent, and professional digital ecosystem.

Title: WAVEX 2025: Catalyzing innovation and investment in India’s M&E Startup Ecosystem
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 11:02:53 +0000
Content: WAVEX 2025, the flagship startup initiative under the World Audio-Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES), is shaping up as a powerful convergence point for innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in India’s media and entertainment (M&E) sector.
The event kicked off with Ashutosh Mohle, Joint Director at the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB), who offered a concise yet compelling overview of WAVEX. He highlighted its core mission — to nurture emerging startups in the M&E space and provide them with a robust national platform to scale and succeed.
Representing the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), Chief Growth Officer Sandeep Jhingran shared insights into the enthusiastic response the initiative has received. “We received over a thousand applications. Thirty of them pitched directly to investors, and over half are already in active conversations,” he revealed. Jhingran emphasized that platforms like WAVEX are essential to spotlight the potential of M&E startups, a segment often overlooked in mainstream startup narratives.
Investor perspectives underscored the initiative’s transformative momentum. Rajesh Joshi, Venue Partner at Warmup Ventures, reflected on his journey from startup founder to investor. “Life has come a full circle… We’re now speaking with 11 startups,” he noted, signaling the growing seriousness of investor engagement in the sector.
Echoing similar sentiments,Mustafa Harnesswala, Founder of CABIL, addressed the long-standing funding hesitance around M&E ventures. “Many shy away from investing in media and entertainment. WAVES is shifting that mindset,” he said. Harnesswala revealed that efforts are underway to establish a dedicated angel network for M&E startups and to explore global collaborations with international governments.
The panel also engaged with the media, addressing key industry questions. On the challenge of identifying meaningful content, Rajesh Joshi cited the example of “Giggle,” a startup app aimed at curbing cyberbullying and sexually explicit content. “It sets a benchmark for responsible innovation,” he said.
Gender representation also surfaced as a crucial area of improvement. “We’re committed to doing better,” said Jhingran, acknowledging the limited participation of women entrepreneurs. “In future editions, we hope to see more women-led ventures take the stage.”
Elaborating on the event’s structure, Jhingran noted that 30 startups were given one-on-one pitching opportunities over two days. Harnesswala emphasized the importance of monetization for content creators, asserting that initiatives like WAVES play a pivotal role in bridging this gap.
With a strong start, WAVEX 2025 is fast emerging as a game-changer for India’s M&E startup landscape — breaking old boundaries, driving investment, and creating fresh opportunities for innovation and growth.

Title: India emerges as global creative powerhouse: Dr. L Murugan unveils landmark reports at WAVES 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:56:38 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. L. Murugan, launched five major knowledge reports that offer an in-depth perspective on India’s fast-growing media and entertainment sector. The reports were released at the ongoing WAVES Summit 2025 in Mumbai and are aimed at supporting data-backed policymaking and strengthening India’s position as a global creative leader.
 
The reports, prepared by a consortium of national and international agencies including the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Ernst & Young, Khaitan & Co., and industry experts, collectively cover the creator economy, digital content production, legal frameworks, live events, and sectoral statistics.
 
A key release, the Statistical Handbook on Media & Entertainment 2024-25, maps long-term trends across broadcasting, print, digital, and film sectors. It documents the rapid rise in content creation and dissemination platforms—from the expansion of Doordarshan’s Free Dish from 33 channels in 2004 to 381 channels in 2025, to the rise in private FM stations from just four in 2001 to 388 by March this year. The handbook notes that All India Radio now covers 98% of the Indian population through 591 stations. Film certification too has witnessed exponential growth, with 3,455 Indian feature films certified in 2024–25 alone. The cumulative number of certified films has reached 69,113.
 
The report also highlights the Ministry’s focus on digital transformation and creator empowerment. Initiatives such as the Create in India Challenge and the Indian Institute of Creative Technologies (IICT) have been spotlighted, along with schemes aimed at ease of doing business and upskilling content creators.
 
Complementing the statistical overview, BCG’s report From Content to Commerce: Mapping India’s Creator Economy notes that India is home to 2 to 2.5 million active digital creators, influencing over \$350 billion in consumer spending. This figure is projected to cross \$1 trillion by 2030. The report urges a shift in approach—from transactional influencer campaigns to long-term, trust-based partnerships that recognise creators as cultural and economic assets.
 
Ernst & Young’s *A Studio Called India* positions the country as a potential global content hub. With a skilled workforce and a 40-60% cost advantage in animation and VFX, India, the report argues, is uniquely placed to become a storytelling powerhouse for international audiences. It adds that nearly 25% of the viewership for Indian OTT content now comes from global audiences, suggesting growing resonance of Indian narratives abroad.
 
The legal landscape of the sector is explored in Khaitan & Co.’s *Legal Currents: A Regulatory Handbook on India’s Media & Entertainment Sector 2025*. The handbook provides clarity on tax implications, compliance for foreign and domestic players, influencer marketing regulations, AI-generated content, and emerging frameworks for gaming and celebrity rights. It is designed to equip stakeholders with practical legal tools to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment.
 
The whitepaper on India’s live events industry charts the sector’s 15% annual growth, adding ₹13 billion in revenue in 2024 alone. It notes a trend of cultural tourism, with nearly half a million Indians travelling inter-city to attend live events. Cities like Shillong, Vadodara, and Jamshedpur are emerging as vibrant cultural hotspots. However, the report also calls attention to infrastructure gaps and licensing hurdles, recommending streamlined processes, enhanced music rights frameworks, and formal recognition of live events under MSME and creative economy policies.
 
Dr. Murugan, speaking at the event, said that these reports collectively underscore India’s evolution from a media-consuming nation to a global cultural force. He noted that India’s multilingual and multicultural foundation, coupled with its digital ambitions, is positioning the country at the forefront of the global entertainment industry.

Title: Indigenous sports take centre stage at WAVES 2025: leaders call for global push
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:30:12 +0000
Content: At a spirited panel discussion held on the sidelines of WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, a cross-section of leaders from the world of sports, governance, and media came together to chart a new course for India’s indigenous sports. The session, titled “Indigenous Sports: From India to the Global Stage”, aimed at celebrating the cultural richness of native games while exploring strategies for their global promotion.
Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi delivered the keynote address, underscoring the deep connection between indigenous sports and India’s cultural identity. “These games are not just physical contests; they are an integral part of our communities, our traditions, and our identity,” he said, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continued support in positioning India as a global sporting power.
Majhi said that Odisha, with its vibrant tribal heritage, has played a key role in preserving and promoting traditional games. “We are committed to nurturing rural talents and ensuring every gifted athlete finds a platform to shine,” he added, pointing to the state’s growing reputation as a hub for sports infrastructure and talent development.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse, echoed similar sentiments. She hailed the Khelo India initiative as a transformative force that is bringing grassroots talent to the forefront. “India has already emerged as a global ambassador of Yoga. Now, we are proudly showcasing traditional games like Kho-Kho and Kabaddi on the international stage,” she said.
“Sport builds more than just bodies—it builds communities and strengthens the cultural fabric of the nation.”
The session also featured insights from sports administrators, league organisers, and international athletes. Anupam Goswami, League Commissioner of the Pro Kabaddi League, spoke of the emotional and cultural resonance indigenous games hold in Indian society. “India has the potential to become a global sports market by leveraging the appeal of its traditional games,” he said.
Fazel Atrachali, a Pro Kabaddi League star from Iran, shared his personal journey, crediting the league for turning Kabaddi into a professional sport.
“Thanks to PKL, Kabaddi has transformed lives, giving athletes not only fame but also financial stability,” he noted.
Nic Coward, Chair of the Regulatory Board of the England and Wales Cricket Board, emphasized the need for modernization and global outreach. “To popularize these sports globally, we must embrace digital platforms, including e-sports,” he said.
Sudhanshu Mittal, President of the Kho-Kho Federation of India, revealed the sport is now played in 55 countries, with plans to expand that number to over 90 by the end of the year. “Indigenous games demand strategy, stamina, and spirit.
They are globally relevant, but we need government support, strategic branding, and diplomatic engagement to take them further,” he said.
Yannick Colaco, founder of Fancode, highlighted the role of technology in building fan communities. “Access and engagement are key. With the right digital tools, we can deepen fan connections and globalize Indian sports,” he added.
The discussion was moderated by Mantra Mugdh, who wove together diverse perspectives into a coherent narrative around the future of India’s sporting legacy.

Title: Padma Shri awardee Baba Shivanand passes away at 128, PM Modi pays tribute
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:58:05 +0000
Content: Renowned yoga practitioner and spiritual guru Baba Shivanand, a recipient of the Padma Shri award, passed away at the age of 128 in Varanasi due to health complications.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over his demise. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “It is extremely saddening to hear about the demise of Shivanand Baba Ji, a yoga practitioner and resident of Kashi. His life, dedicated to yoga and sadhana, will continue to inspire generations. He was honoured with the Padma Shri for his service to society through yoga. Baba Ji’s departure to Shivaloka is an irreparable loss for all residents of Kashi and the countless people who drew inspiration from him. I offer my heartfelt tribute in this moment of sorrow.”
Baba Shivanand breathed his last on Saturday night. He had been admitted to the BHU Hospital on April 30 after experiencing health issues.
A resident of Kashi (Varanasi), Baba Shivanand was widely known for his simple and disciplined lifestyle centred around yoga, meditation, and spiritual discipline. In recognition of his lifelong contribution to the promotion of yoga and wellness, he was conferred the Padma Shri in 2022.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also paid homage to the spiritual leader. In a post on X, he wrote in Hindi (translated), “The demise of Kashi’s renowned yoga guru, ‘Padma Shri’ Swami Shivanand Ji, who made an unparalleled contribution in the field of yoga, is deeply saddening. Humble tributes to him. His spiritual practice and lifelong dedication to yoga will remain a great source of inspiration for society. I pray to Baba Vishwanath to grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength to his followers in this moment of grief. Om Shanti.”
Born on August 8, 1896, in the Sylhet district of present-day Bangladesh, Baba Shivanand lost both his parents to starvation at the age of six. He was later taken in by Omkarnand, who became his spiritual guide and introduced him to the path of yoga and ascetic living.

Title: Indian startups raise over $102 million across 25 deals this week
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:42:54 +0000
Content: Indian startups raised approximately $102.93 million across 25 funding deals this week, with significant participation from both early-stage and growth-stage companies.
Startups based in Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR led the funding activity with seven deals each, followed by Mumbai and Chennai.
Investments were spread across a range of sectors including cleantech, cybersecurity, edtech, and healthtech, reflecting sustained investor interest in India’s innovation-driven startup ecosystem.
Healthtech emerged as the leading sector, recording four deals, followed closely by e-commerce and foodtech startups, which secured three deals each. Other sectors such as media and entertainment, proptech, edtech, and Software as a Service (SaaS) also saw notable activity.
Among growth-stage startups, Metafin, a cleantech-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), led the way by raising $10 million in its Series A round. QNu Labs, a cybersecurity firm, raised $7 million, while neobanking startup Kaleidofin secured $5 million. CollegeDekho, an edtech platform, and Sadhav Offshore, a marine services company, also received substantial funding.

Title: Tobacco, Cannabis use may raise heart disease deaths by 50% in five years: studies
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:55:04 +0000
Content: Tobacco and cannabis consumption could significantly raise heart disease-related deaths in the coming years, with recent studies predicting a 50 per cent surge in mortality over the next five years.
Presented at the ongoing Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) 2025 annual scientific sessions in Washington, DC, the twin studies revealed alarming links between substance use and cardiovascular complications.
One study projected that tobacco use alone could increase coronary heart disease deaths by 40 per cent. In contrast, individuals diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (CUD) were found to be 50 per cent more likely to suffer from cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
“Despite major public health campaigns to raise awareness about the harms of tobacco and cannabis, usage remains widespread, and we continue to witness its impact on cardiovascular health,” said James B. Hermiller, President of SCAI.
Ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary heart disease, occurs when reduced blood flow due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries weakens the heart.
Researchers from Wayne State University in the U.S. analysed data from 1999 to 2020, focusing on tobacco-related ischemic heart disease mortality among individuals aged 25 and older. The analysis projected a 43.7 per cent rise in tobacco-related deaths by 2030. While mortality rates among females showed a decline, deaths among males registered a sharp increase.
“Tobacco-related ischemic heart disease is not merely a problem of the past; it continues to be a leading cause of death. Targeted interventions are essential, especially as vulnerable groups remain disproportionately affected,” said Roopeessh Vempati, lead researcher from Wayne State University.
In a separate study, researchers from Sinai Hospital in the U.S. examined data from over 1.3 million patients admitted with heart failure. Findings indicated that patients with both heart failure and CUD were significantly more prone to severe cardiovascular events. The risk of cardiogenic shock was 27 per cent higher, acute myocardial infarction 50 per cent higher, and arrhythmias 48 per cent higher in this group.
Interestingly, the study noted that patients with CUD had a slightly lower risk of mortality compared to those without the disorder. However, researchers cautioned that the overall cardiovascular risks remained considerably elevated.
“Even if the chance of death is slightly lower, the risk of developing severe cardiovascular conditions such as heart attacks or irregular heartbeat is substantially greater. It is essential for physicians and public health professionals to educate individuals on these risks early, even before heart failure sets in,” said Dr. Syed Ishaq, Internal Medicine resident at Sinai Hospital.

Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:09:48 +0000
Content: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast unseasonal rainfall and thunderstorms across Gujarat till May 9, attributing the weather change to a cyclonic circulation over southeast Rajasthan and a north-south trough extending to southern Tamil Nadu.
Several districts in the state are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall, with intensity expected to increase gradually over the coming days.
Gujarat has been witnessing high temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in many areas. The forecasted rainfall is expected to bring some respite from the prevailing heatwave-like conditions.
According to the IMD, the rainfall is likely to extend to most parts of the state, including Central and South Gujarat, by May 6. A fall of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius in maximum temperatures is also expected over the next five days.
The IMD has warned of hailstorms in some areas on May 5 and 6. Heavy rainfall is likely over North Gujarat, South Gujarat, and coastal Saurashtra on May 7 and 8. The department has advised caution, as these conditions could impact normal life and damage standing crops.
Districts likely to be affected include Mehsana, Aravalli, Panchmahal, Dahod, Mahisagar, Vadodara, Chhota Udepur, Tapi, Valsad, and Navsari. Light to moderate rain, lightning, and gusty winds of up to 50 kmph are also expected in Daman and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, as well as parts of Saurashtra and Kutch.
On May 5, weather conditions are expected to intensify, with moderate thunderstorms, lightning, rain, and wind speeds of 30–40 kmph (gusting up to 50 kmph) likely to affect several districts, including Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Anand, Kheda, Narmada, Bharuch, Surat, and the Dangs.
Saurashtra districts such as Surendranagar, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Gir Somnath, Dwarka, and Botad are also expected to be impacted, along with the Union Territory of Diu.

Title: PM Modi congratulates Singapore’s Lawrence Wong on re-election
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 07:36:04 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to Singapore’s newly re-elected Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, following the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) decisive victory in the general elections. The PAP secured its 14th consecutive mandate, reinforcing its long-standing political dominance in the island nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi highlighted the strong and multifaceted partnership between India and Singapore. “Heartiest congratulations, Lawrence Wong, on your resounding victory in the general elections. India and Singapore share a strong and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close people-to-people ties. I look forward to continue working closely with you to further advance our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” he wrote.
The PAP won 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, improving its vote share to 65.6%, up from 61.2% in the 2020 elections. Mr. Wong, who succeeded Lee Hsien Loong as Prime Minister, expressed gratitude for the public’s support. “Singaporeans have given the @PAPSingapore a clear and strong mandate to govern. I am humbled by and grateful for the faith you have placed in me and my team,” he posted on X.
India and Singapore share a longstanding and robust bilateral relationship, which was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Singapore in September 2024. The partnership spans various sectors, including trade, defence, digital innovation, and education, and is anchored in mutual trust, shared values, and strong people-to-people ties.
PM Modi has visited Singapore five times since 2014, reflecting the significance India places on its engagement with the country. His visits have included bilateral meetings, multilateral summits, and major public events. Notably, he was the first Indian Prime Minister to deliver the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, and the first head of government to address the Singapore FinTech Festival in November 2018.

Title: India, Angola agree to deepen energy and strategic ties
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 05:35:40 +0000
Content: India and Angola have agreed to expand their energy partnership while also enhancing cooperation in digital infrastructure, space technology, and defence. The two countries signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) on Saturday aimed at boosting bilateral ties, coinciding with the visit of Angolan President João Lourenço to India — the first such visit in 38 years.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following delegation-level talks, described the visit as “historic” and said it was not only giving new direction to India-Angola relations but also strengthening India-Africa ties. The two nations are currently marking the 40th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship.
“India stood firmly with Angola during its struggle for independence. Today, we continue to build on that foundation of friendship,” PM Modi said during a joint press statement.
The Prime Minister announced the approval of a Line of Credit worth $200 million for defence procurement to support the modernisation of Angola’s armed forces. “We have also discussed cooperation in repair, overhaul, and supply of defence platforms, as well as training support,” he said.
India also offered to share its expertise in digital public infrastructure, capacity building, and space technology with the southern African nation. Further areas of collaboration include healthcare, diamond processing, fertilisers, and critical minerals. A youth exchange programme is also being planned to strengthen people-to-people ties.
On the multilateral front, Angola signed the Framework Agreement of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), becoming its 123rd member. India also invited Angola to join other global initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Big Cat Alliance, and the Global Biofuels Alliance.
PM Modi welcomed Angola’s upcoming chairmanship of the African Union and recalled the bloc’s induction as a permanent member of the G20 during India’s presidency. “India and the African Union are pillars of the Global South. We stand united in representing the hopes and aspirations of developing countries,” he said.
In a strong statement against terrorism, the Prime Minister thanked Angola for its solidarity following the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam. “Terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity. We are committed to taking decisive action against terrorists and their supporters,” he said.
Secretary (Economic Relations) Dammu Ravi, while briefing the media, said bilateral trade between India and Angola currently stands at $4.2 billion, with oil and gas making up 90% of this trade. Angola is India’s second-largest African supplier of crude oil and liquefied natural gas, after Nigeria. India exports around $700 million worth of goods to Angola, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, automobile components, plastics, and refined oil.
Ravi added that Angola had sought Indian assistance in refining and processing its newly discovered oil fields and in setting up refineries, both onshore and offshore.
India has stepped up its diplomatic outreach across Africa in recent years. Over the past decade, it has established 17 new embassies on the continent and extended credit lines worth over $12 billion, along with $700 million in grant assistance. Vocational training centres have been set up in eight African countries, and India is working with five others on digital public infrastructure projects.
Last month, India and Africa conducted their first joint naval maritime exercise, “AIKEYME,” underscoring growing defence and maritime cooperation.
“India and Angola are natural partners in progress. I am confident that under Angola’s leadership, India’s engagement with the African Union will scale new heights,” PM Modi said.

Title: Cardinals could pick Filipino Tagle, ‘Asian Francis’, as next pope
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:19:47 +0000
Content: Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is sometimes called the “Asian Francis” because of his infectious smile, easy laugh, and spontaneity with words.
Like the late Argentine pope, he hails from a country far from the Catholic Church’s traditional power base of Europe and came to Rome with an outsider’s view.
Some who have put Tagle on unofficial short lists for the next pope say he would be a shoo-in to succeed Francis if cardinal electors who enter the secret conclave on Wednesday are looking for as close a similarity as possible in order to assertively continue Francis’ progressive streak.
If Tagle were elected, it would also likely signal to the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics that the cardinals want to go forward with Francis’ vision of generally opening up the Church to the modern world by not choosing a man who might roll back some of the late pope’s reforms.
It would also mean his fellow cardinals had shrugged off question marks over his management abilities.
“He would represent a continuity of what Pope Francis has been doing,” said Rev. Emmanuel Alfonso, a former student of Tagle’s who has known him for decades. “He’s really like Pope Francis in terms of his love for the poor, his approachability and so on.”
Tagle, the former archbishop of Manila, would be the first pope from what is now considered Asia, although in the early Church some popes hailed from what is now called the Middle East, technically part of Asia.
Tagle, who looks younger than his 67 years and likes to be called by his diminutive nickname “Chito”, has headed the Vatican’s Dicastery for Evangelization, effectively the Church’s missionary arm, for the past five years. That position gave him enormous influence over national churches in developing countries.
As archbishop of Manila, and before as bishop of the Philippine city of Imus, Tagle gained pastoral experience in running dioceses in Asia’s largest Catholic country. By bringing him to the Vatican in 2020, Francis gave him one more notch in experiences seen as helpful to papal candidates.
Tagle’s move to Rome brought criticism from then-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who oversaw a bloody “war on drugs” that killed thousands of Filipinos during his 2016-2022 administration.
Duterte said Tagle had been removed from Manila for meddling in national politics.
The Philippine Catholic bishops’ conference denied those accusations forcefully. Bishop Pablo Virgilio David of Kalookan, a conference official made a cardinal in 2024, called Duterte’s claim “unbelievably ludicrous”.
Many cardinals already know Tagle personally, and many may see an attraction in having a pope from Asia, viewed by Church leaders as an important region of growth for the faith. Young people feel comfortable with him.
When Tagle hosted Francis for a visit to the Philippines in 2014, the visit drew the largest crowds in the history of papal travel, including a Mass that attracted up to 7 million people.
DOCTRINAL BACKGROUND
Tagle, who speaks Italian, English, and Spanish as well as his native Tagalog, now has five years of experience with the Vatican’s arcane bureaucracy, although some cardinals may think even that is not enough to run the global Church.
One possible weakness in Tagle’s candidacy is that he was involved in a management scandal three years ago.
In 2022, Francis removed him from a second job as titular head of a Vatican-based confederation of 162 Catholic relief, development and social services organisations working in more than 200 countries.
Francis fired the entire leadership of the group, called Caritas Internationalis, following allegations of bullying by top management.
Tagle’s role, akin to a chancellor of the organisation, was mostly symbolic and ceremonial. He was not directly involved in day-to-day running and was generally admired by staffers.
Unlike Francis, Tagle enjoys a global reputation as a theologian, which could help him gain votes from moderate cardinals concerned by some of Francis’ off the cuff utterances, which led to what some called confusion about Church teachings.
In the 1990s, he served on the Vatican’s International Theological Commission under German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was known as a strict adherent to traditional doctrine and would later become Pope Benedict XVI.
Rev. Joseph Komonchak, Tagle’s professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., said the cardinal was one of his best students in 45 years of teaching.
“Not the least of Chito’s virtues was the joy that he radiated on everyone who encountered him,” said Komonchak. “He had a fine sense of humor, which endeared him to his fellow students.”
Rev. Robert Reyes, a seminary classmate who has known Tagle for more than 50 years, said Tagle has an ability to connect with people and a simple style of living. When he first became a bishop in 2001, he didn’t own a car.
“He preferred to take rides, to hitch a ride with someone driving to a place that perhaps both of them were going to,” said Reyes.
While 67 is sunset age in many organisations, it is considered young in the Vatican, because few cardinals want a very long pontificate.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis announce campaign targeting Israeli airports
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:08:16 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthi rebels said late on Sunday they would impose a “comprehensive” aerial blockade on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports, in response to Israel expanding its operations in Gaza.
The Iran-aligned Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Sunday that hit near Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, the latest in a string of attacks, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate.
Most attacks from Yemen have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, though a drone strike hit Tel Aviv last year. Sunday’s missile was the only one of a series launched since March that was not intercepted.
The Houthis’ Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, a body set up last year to liaise between Houthi forces and commercial shipping operators, issued the warning about targeting Israeli airports, saying Ben Gurion Airport would be the top target.
The statement attached an email it said was sent to the International Air Transport Association, the global airlines body, and the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization.
Houthi forces called “upon all international airlines to take this announcement into serious consideration … and to cancel all their flights to the airports of the criminal Israeli enemy, in order to safeguard the safety of their aircraft and passengers,” the email said.
Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for an expanded operation in the Gaza Strip, Israeli media reported on Friday, adding to signs that attempts to stop the fighting and return hostages held by Palestinian militant group Hamas have made no progress.
Since the collapse of an earlier ceasefire agreement in March, Israeli troops have been carving out wide buffer zones in Gaza, squeezing the 2.3 million population into an ever narrower zone in the centre of the enclave and along the coast and shutting off the entry of aid trucks.
Aid groups have warned the Israeli blockade risks a humanitarian disaster.
Israel’s campaign on Gaza has laid waste to much of the enclave and so far killed more than 52,000 people, according to Gaza officials, since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 people taken hostage.

Title: Current indicators show India’s economy is doing well: CEA Nageswaran
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:05:15 +0000
Content: Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran on Sunday said that current indicators point to a robust Indian economy, which continues to register strong growth despite a challenging global environment.
Speaking at an event hosted by Ashoka University, Nageswaran said, “India’s economy is in good shape despite the challenging global environment. While the final numbers for FY25 will be available in May, current indicators suggest we are progressing well.”
The CEA identified energy affordability, employment generation through energy transition, and the rise of manufacturing and MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) as key priorities for sustaining economic growth. He also highlighted the role of artificial intelligence, education, and skilling in driving future development.
He stressed the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability, which involves keeping inflation in check while ensuring inclusive growth as the country moves forward.
NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery, speaking at the event, echoed a long-term vision for India to become a developed, high-income nation by 2047. He noted that India’s economic performance over the last three decades has demonstrated both institutional maturity and agility.
“India has achieved a consistent annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent over the last 30 years, which is a remarkable achievement,” Bery said. He added that global disruptions could present strategic opportunities for India to leverage its demographic dividend, technological advancements, and geopolitical positioning to boost growth.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India remains the fastest-growing major economy in the world. The April 2025 World Economic Outlook, released last month, forecasts that India’s economy will grow at 6.2 per cent in 2025 and 6.3 per cent in 2026. These figures place India well ahead of China, which is projected to grow at 4 per cent in 2025 and 4.6 per cent in 2026.
IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath noted that global growth is expected to slow to 2.8 per cent in 2025, with 127 countries, representing 86 per cent of global GDP, facing growth downgrades.
The United States, a key global economic driver, is expected to see its GDP growth moderate to 1.8 per cent in 2025, with a further decline to 1.7 per cent in 2026, the IMF report stated.

Title: India to showcase SVAMITVA scheme at World Bank Land Conference in Washington
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 06:51:02 +0000
Content: India is poised to lead the global conversation on digital land reforms and climate-aligned governance at the World Bank Land Conference 2025, being held from May 5 to 8 at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C., United States.
A high-level Indian delegation, led by Vivek Bharadwaj, Secretary, Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR), will present the country’s flagship SVAMITVA Scheme (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) and Gram Manchitra platform during the international conference, which is being attended by global policymakers, experts, and development partners.
The Indian delegation also includes Alok Prem Nagar, Joint Secretary, MoPR, Shailesh Kumar Sinha, Additional Surveyor General, Survey of India, and senior officials from the States of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.
This year’s conference, themed “Securing Land Tenure and Access for Climate Action: Moving from Awareness to Action”, aims to examine strategies for secure land tenure, the modernization of land administration, and climate-resilient planning. India’s SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) Scheme is expected to serve as a case study in the use of drone technology and geospatial data to advance rural land ownership.
According to the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, the scheme has so far issued property cards to over 24.4 million households across 1.6 lakh villages, covering more than 100 million property parcels. The initiative is estimated to have unlocked land value worth $1.162 trillion (approximately ₹100 lakh crore).
“The SVAMITVA Scheme is a path-breaking step in rural empowerment. It not only provides people with legal ownership of land but also supports planning and disaster mitigation,” said Vivek Bharadwaj, who will represent India as a Country Champion in the plenary session titled “Good Practices and Challenges in Land Tenure and Governance Reform”. The session will highlight how the scheme contributes to women’s empowerment, dispute resolution, and secure tenure rights, in alignment with SDG Target 1.4.2.
Alok Prem Nagar, Joint Secretary, MoPR, will lead a technical session on “Establishing the Land Foundation for Climate Action and Disaster Risk Management”, where India’s Gram Manchitra platform will be featured. Built on the high-resolution geospatial data generated through SVAMITVA, Gram Manchitra facilitates village-level development planning, solar energy site selection, disaster resilience, and public service delivery.
Speaking ahead of the conference, Nagar said, “Gram Manchitra exemplifies how spatial data can be used to strengthen participatory governance at the grassroots. It empowers Panchayati Raj institutions to take informed decisions with environmental and developmental foresight.”
India’s participation in the World Bank Land Conference is being seen as a major milestone in the country’s leadership on global rural land governance. In March 2025, India hosted an International Workshop on Land Governance, which drew delegates from 22 countries. The SVAMITVA initiative, in particular, received widespread interest for its digital-first, scalable model. Several nations reportedly expressed interest in adapting similar frameworks in partnership with India.
The conference in Washington features plenary sessions, regional workshops, thematic discussions, and an innovation expo, with a strong focus on promoting secure land access, geospatial technology adoption, and climate-resilient administration systems.

Title: Global economy already feeling drag from Trump tariffs
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 06:41:56 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades were greased by predictable and relatively free trade.
Big-name multinationals right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
While financial markets are betting the U.S. and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.
“U.S. tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of 10% alongside higher, sector-specific charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.
Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over 145% U.S. tariffs, to which it has responded with 125% levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.
In the meantime companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux ELUXb.ST slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars VOLCARb.ST, computer gadget maker Logitech LOGN.S and drinks giant Diageo DGE.L abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.
Last week’s removal of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.
“We’re going from zero to 145%, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy. “I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”
SILVER LINING
The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.
China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.
Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.
“(This) means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.
However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country – which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple AAPL.O has shifted some output – could end up a genuine winner.
“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.
For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy which, by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.
The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts – something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.
But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.

Title: Opportunity to invest in India’s long-term growth story is now: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 05:54:48 +0000
Content: Global brokerage Morgan Stanley has reaffirmed its positive long-term outlook on Indian equities, highlighting that India is likely to outperform in a global bear market scenario.
According to a note by the brokerage, the opportunity to invest in India’s long-term structural growth story is now, though it will require patience, given the potential.
The global financial services major believes that while near-term volatility may persist, “the long-term reward outweighs short-term noise”.
The firm advises investors to stay focused on India’s domestic growth story and selectively build exposure — particularly in domestically driven sectors —during periods of market stress.
The macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide, with risks such as decelerating global growth, central bank policy shifts, and geopolitical tensions casting a shadow.
Morgan Stanley states that these very conditions present a compelling case for India, “supported by its robust domestic fundamentals and relative insulation from global volatility”.
India offers a mix of macro stability, earnings growth, and a reliable domestic demand base that positions it as a relative safe haven in a bear market.
Morgan Stanley also favours domestic cyclicals over defensives and globally exposed sectors.
The firm holds an overweight view on financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, backed by improving credit growth, private investment recovery, and rising consumer demand.
In its another report last month, Morgan Stanley said that India is one of their preferred equity markets where macro conditions are resilient or sufficiently buffered by stimulus.
The brokerage saw a relatively resilient outlook for financials earnings, with capital ratios and the asset quality outlook in a strong position across most of its coverage. “We particularly like Financials in Singapore, India, Chile and the UAE, as well as Japan,” it added.
Key India-specific catalysts include continuing dovish actions from the RBI, stimulus through GST rate cuts and a trade deal with the US. Morgan Stanley also sees lower food inflation and lower oil prices, keeping food and non-food inflation at benign levels.

Title: Trump says he wants a fair trade deal with China
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 04:54:02 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said the U.S. was meeting with many countries, including China, on trade deals, and his main priority with China was to secure a fair trade deal.
Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, but U.S. officials were speaking with Chinese officials about a variety of different things.
Asked if any trade agreements would be announced this week, Trump said that could “very well be” but gave no details.
Trump’s top officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10% tariff on most countries, along with higher tariff rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days. He has also imposed 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145% tariffs on China.
He suggested that he did not expect to reach an agreement with some countries, but could instead be “setting a certain tariff” for those trading partners in the next two to three weeks. It was not immediately clear if he was referring to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, which are due to kick in on July 8 after a 90-day pause.
Trump repeated his claim that China had been “ripping us for many years” on global trade, adding that former President Richard Nixon’s move to reach out and establish relations with China was “the worst thing” he ever did.
Trump sounded more upbeat about China and the prospects for reaching an agreement in an interview with NBC News that was taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday.
In the interview, he acknowledged that he had been “very tough with China,” essentially cutting off trade between the world’s top two economies, but said Beijing now wanted to reach an agreement.
“We’ve gone cold turkey,” he said. “That means we’re not losing a trillion dollars … because we’re not doing business with them right now. And they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly. We’ll see how that all turns out, but it’s got to be a fair deal.”

Title: Indian scientists develop groundbreaking metal-free catalyst for hydrogen fuel production
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 12:53:46 +0000
Content: In a significant advancement toward sustainable energy solutions, Indian researchers have developed a novel, cost-effective, metal-free catalyst that can efficiently produce hydrogen (H₂) fuel by harvesting mechanical energy. This innovation represents a major breakthrough in green hydrogen technology and offers a promising path toward cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
The research, led by Professor Tapas K. Maji of the Chemistry and Physics of Materials Unit at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru, introduces a donor-acceptor based covalent organic framework (COF) that acts as a highly efficient piezocatalyst for water splitting—a method that separates hydrogen from water molecules.
Unlike traditional catalysts that rely heavily on metal-based ferroelectric materials, the new COF system is entirely organic and metal-free. It is composed of tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) as the donor molecule and pyromellitic dianhydride (PDA) as the acceptor. These materials form imide linkages that give rise to a unique structural phenomenon known as ferrielectric (FiE) ordering.
“This breakthrough challenges the traditional reliance on heavy or transition metal-based catalysts, offering a new direction in the development of scalable, sustainable hydrogen production systems,” said Prof. Maji.
What sets this material apart is its sponge-like porous architecture that facilitates efficient water diffusion and access to charge carriers. The FiE ordering in the COF creates intense local electric fields at the pore surfaces, enabling high-density charge accumulation and, in turn, high yields of hydrogen fuel.
Prof. Umesh V. Waghmare, a collaborator from JNCASR, contributed theoretical insights showing that the COF’s electronic structure features coupled energy bands and dipolar ordering. This causes lattice instability, enabling dynamic interaction with mechanical pressure. When stimulated mechanically, the material generates electron-hole pairs, catalyzing the water-splitting reaction with exceptional efficiency.
The study, published in Advanced Functional Materials, involved a multidisciplinary team, including researchers Ms. Adrija Ghosh, Ms. Surabhi Menon, Dr. Sandip Biswas, and Dr. Anupam Dey from JNCASR. Additional contributions came from Dr. Supriya Sahoo and Prof. Ramamoorthy Boomishankar from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, and Prof. Jan K. Zaręba from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Poland.
This innovative catalyst not only reduces dependency on expensive and environmentally harmful metals but also offers a viable method to harness ambient mechanical energy—such as vibrations or pressure—for clean energy generation. The development aligns with India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, aimed at promoting large-scale green hydrogen production and positioning the country as a global leader in this emerging sector.
With global urgency to transition to renewable energy sources, the success of this metal-free piezocatalyst marks a critical step in enabling efficient, clean, and sustainable hydrogen fuel technology.

Title: Over 238 crore cylinders refilled in nine years, reflects success of PM Ujjwala Yojana: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 11:40:55 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri, marking nine years of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), shared key figures underscoring the scheme’s transformative impact, particularly among underprivileged sections of society.
Taking to social media platform X on Monday, the minister aid: “9 Years of Ujjwala Yojana, over 10.33 crore families thriving!”
“The refilling of over 238 crore cylinders during the past nine years reflects the success of this scheme”, he added.
The PMUY completed its ninth anniversary on 1 May, a significant milestone in India’s effort to ensure universal access to clean cooking fuel. The scheme provides deposit-free LPG connections to adult women from poor households across the country.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme has become a symbol of women’s empowerment and has significantly improved health outcomes for homemakers, the minister noted.
“In the past 10 years, the addition of 11,670 new LPG distributors has made cylinder delivery possible even in remote and challenging areas,” he said.
PMUY has transformed the lives of millions of economically disadvantaged citizens. As of March 2025, 10.33 crore households were covered under the scheme.
To expand coverage, the government launched Ujjwala 2.0 in August 2021, targeting an additional 1 crore connections. This target was achieved by January 2022, followed by the release of another 60 lakh connections, taking the total to 1.60 crore under Ujjwala 2.0 by December 2022.
As of 1 March 2025, India had 32.94 crore active domestic LPG consumers, including 10.33 crore PMUY beneficiaries.

Title: Who will be the next pope? Even the cardinals don’t know
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 11:26:32 +0000
Content: Catholic cardinals entering a conclave on Wednesday to pick a new pope do not yet have a clear idea of who will emerge as Pope Francis’ successor, several said, and speeches by individual clerics in meetings this week may be decisive.
The 133 cardinals are holding near daily meetings to discuss issues facing the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church before the conclave, when they will be sequestered in a hotel and barred from contact with the outside world.
While there are a few cardinals seen as front-runners to succeed Pope Francis — two often mentioned are Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle — many of the clerics who will vote have not made up their minds.
“My list is changing, and I think it will continue to change over the next few days,” British Cardinal Vincent Nichols, participating in his first conclave, told Reuters. “It’s a process which for me is far from concluded, far from concluded.”
As the cardinals are meeting this week in what are called “general congregations,” individual clerics can offer speeches to give their vision for the future of the global faith.
During the 2013 conclave, it was in this period that Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio gave a speech that, by many accounts, deeply impressed his peers. Days later, he was elected as Francis.
Nichols, the highest-ranking Church official in England and Wales, said the speeches this time have again been pivotal in helping form opinions about who could be the next pope.
“There’ll be these moments when like a stone is dropped into a pond and the ripples will go out and I’ll sit there thinking, ‘Ah, yeah, that’s important,'” said the cardinal.
Asked about whether there are cardinal front-runners who are more likely to become pope, Nichols replied: “I came with a few ideas … (and) they have changed.”
Cardinal William Goh Seng Chye, the archbishop of Singapore, told Il Messaggero newspaper that he also did not know who the next pope might be. “It may seem strange, but we really do not know,” he said. “We have not yet begun to vote, so we don’t know. The game is still going on.”
COMPARING NOTES AT DINNER
The cardinals are meeting for two pre-conclave sessions on Monday and are expected to have at least one more on Tuesday.
The conclave itself begins Wednesday morning with the celebration of a special Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica.
In the afternoon, the cardinals will formally process into the Sistine Chapel, the storied 15th century worship space adorned with frescoes by Michelangelo, where they will begin voting for the next pope.
They are expected to take one vote on Wednesday afternoon. Subsequent days will have two votes each morning and afternoon. It takes a two-thirds majority for someone to be elected.
According to conclave regulations, if no-one has been chosen after the first three days, the cardinals should take a day-long “pause of prayer” before continuing.
The only signal given to the outside world about the deliberations will come from a chimney installed above the chapel. The cardinals will burn their ballots, adding a chemical product to create one of two colours of smoke: black for a inconclusive vote; white when there is a new pope.
Italian Cardinal Fernando Filoni, a former Vatican official participating in his second conclave, told Corriere della Sera newspaper he expected the first votes to be indecisive.
“The first two votes are for orientation, then we start to sum things up,” he said.
The cardinals being sequestered from the world and living and eating together at the Vatican’s Santa Marta guest house, is also important, said Filoni.
“When we vote, we don’t talk, but afterwards we eat together, live together, and compare notes,” he said.

Title: “Phulera Ka Panchayati Raj” campaign strikes a chord nationwide; final episode crosses 6 million views
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 11:18:36 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Panchayati Raj’s innovative digital campaign, “Phulera Ka Panchayati Raj”, has resonated strongly with audiences across the country. According to an official statement released by the Ministry on Monday, the third and final episode of the series, “Alhua Vikas”, has surpassed 6 million views on YouTube.
The episode was launched on April 24, coinciding with National Panchayati Raj Day, and continues to gain traction for its relatable storytelling and impactful message highlighting grassroots governance.
Part of a three-part sketch series, “Alhua Vikas” focuses on a vital pillar of grassroots governance—the financial self-reliance of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). The short film, featuring a star-studded cast from the popular series “Panchayat,” including Neena Gupta, Faisal Malik, Chandan Roy, and Durgesh Kumar, urges citizens to contribute to local development by paying local taxes on time.
“Pay your taxes to make your Panchayat self-reliant” is the core message of the film, which highlights how timely contributions from residents enable rural local bodies to improve public services and invest in sustainable development.
The Ministry, in an official statement on Monday, said the initiative is part of a broader push to make the concept of Own Sources of Revenue (OSR) a household term across villages in India. By encouraging timely tax payments, the government aims to empower gram panchayats to independently finance development works without relying entirely on central or state assistance.
The release of “Alhua Vikas” coincided with National Panchayati Raj Day, during which Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented awards to panchayats excelling in OSR mobilization, reaffirming the government’s commitment to building financially self-sustaining rural governance systems.
The full “Phulera Ka Panchayati Raj” trilogy has gained momentum for its relatable storytelling and informative themes:

Title: Indian stocks extend rally; Sensex gains nearly 300 points
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 10:40:43 +0000
Content: Indian stock indices continued their upward momentum from the previous week, opening the new trading week on a positive note.
The Sensex closed at 80,796.84, rising 294.85 points or 0.37 per cent, while the Nifty ended the day at 24,461.15, up 114.45 points or 0.47 per cent. Most sectoral indices were in the green, with Nifty Auto and Oil & Gas leading the gains on Monday.
As the week progresses, market participants are expected to closely track the flow of foreign portfolio investments (FPIs)—which have recently turned net positive—along with developments surrounding the India-US trade deal and Q4 earnings reports from major listed companies for further cues.
On the global front, investors are also awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting, which could influence market sentiment.
Last week, the Sensex and Nifty posted their longest weekly winning streak of 2025. The Sensex surged over 1,100 points—or about 1.5 per cent—during the holiday-truncated week, with markets closed on May 1 for Maharashtra Day.
Adding to the positive sentiment, FPIs turned net buyers after three months, although the pace of inflows is still building.
“The market has sustained its positive momentum, though optimism has moderated. Continued foreign inflows and record GST collections in April reflect resilience in economic activity and support mild optimism,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.
“A weak dollar and falling oil prices have further boosted FII sentiment. However, the momentum is shifting from broad-based rallies to stock- and sector-specific moves driven by earnings. Over the past month, the broader market has recovered over 50 per cent of the losses incurred during the consolidation phase from September 2024 to March 2025,” he added.
Sundar Kewat, Technical and Derivatives Analyst at Ashika Institutional Equity, noted that gains were limited as investor sentiment turned cautious amid escalating geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan. This led to a more defensive market stance despite support from select sectors.
Markets had also found support after former U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India. The initial announcement of the tariffs had triggered a global equity sell-off, with India also being affected.
Geopolitical tensions, particularly the India-Pakistan standoff following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, have weighed on investor sentiment recently. Market participants are expected to closely monitor further developments in this regard.

Title: Putin dials PM Modi, offers Russia’s ‘full support’ to India in fight against terrorism
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 10:23:52 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and “strongly condemned” the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, offering full support to India in its ongoing fight against terrorism.
“He conveyed deepest condolences on the loss of innocent lives and expressed full support to India in the fight against terrorism. He emphasised that the perpetrators of the heinous attack and their supporters must be brought to justice,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wrote in a post on X.
“Both leaders reiterated their commitment to further deepen India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. PM Modi conveyed greetings to President Putin on the celebration of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day and invited him for the Annual Summit to be held in India later in the year,” Jaiswal added.
The brutal assault on April 22, which resulted in the death of 26 innocent tourists and left several others critically injured, unfolded in the Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam when four heavily armed terrorists, two of them from Pakistan, emerged from the surrounding dense forests and opened indiscriminate fire on tourists. The attack has been described as one of the most horrific in the region in recent memory.
Monday’s call between the two leaders took place before the Russian President hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will be on an official visit to the Russian Federation from May 7-10 and take part in the ceremonial events dedicated to the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
PM Modi, who had also been invited by Putin for the participation in the Victory Day celebrations, will however not be travelling to Russia.
The Russian President had earlier extended his condolences to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi over the tragic consequences of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam.
“Kindly accept the sincere condolences over the tragic consequences of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam whose victims were civilians — citizens of various countries. This brutal crime has no justification whatsoever. We expect that its organisers and perpetrators will face a deserved punishment. I would like to reiterate our commitment to further increasing cooperation with Indian partners in fighting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Please convey words of sincere sympathy and support to the near and dear ones of the deceased as well as wishes for a speedy recovery of all injured,” Putin wrote on April 22.
On May 2, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had dialled External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar do discuss topical issues of the Russian-Indian cooperation, as well as the “aggravation of Indian-Pakistani relations” following the terrorist attack near Pahalgam.
Lavrov called for the settlement of disagreements between New Delhi and Islamabad by political and diplomatic means on a bilateral basis in accordance with the provisions of the Simla Agreement of 1972 and the Lahore Declaration of 1999.
“Discussed the Pahalgam terrorist attack with FM Lavrov of Russia yesterday. Its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice. Also spoke about our bilateral cooperation activities,” Jaishankar posted on X after the phone call.
Earlier, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov had confirmed that the Russian President is expected to visit India in early 2025 following an invitation from Prime Minister Modi.
The visit is being planned as part of the ongoing commitment to annual meetings between the two leaders.
“Our leaders have an agreement to meet once a year. This time, it is our turn,” Ushakov had said during a press briefing.
The last visit by the Russian President to India took place on December 6, 2021, during the 21st India-Russia Annual Summit in New Delhi.
Meanwhile, PM Modi held two high-profile visits to Russia last year, attending the 22nd Russia-India Summit in July and later participated in the BRICS Summit held in Kazan in October.

Title: UDAI successfully conducts Face Authentication pilot for NEET Exam
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 10:06:53 +0000
Content: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), in collaboration with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the National Testing Agency (NTA), has successfully completed a pilot project exploring the use of Aadhaar-based face authentication for candidate verification during the NEET UG 2025 examination.
The proof-of-concept (PoC) exercise was carried out at select examination centres in the national capital during this year’s National Eligibility cum Entrance Test — one of India’s largest entrance exams. The initiative marks a step forward in the adoption of contactless biometric technologies to enhance transparency and prevent impersonation in high-stakes public examinations.
According to officials, the face authentication was conducted in real-time using Aadhaar’s biometric database, with seamless integration into NIC’s digital infrastructure and NTA’s examination protocols. The system enabled instant verification of candidate identity without physical contact, making the process both secure and efficient.
The UIDAI said the pilot demonstrated a high degree of accuracy and operational ease, reinforcing the potential of face authentication as a scalable and student-friendly solution for identity verification in large-scale examinations.
In addition to streamlining the entry process, the initiative is expected to bolster exam integrity by reducing the risk of impersonation and other fraudulent practices. The technology may also find future applications in other public service delivery systems requiring remote or contactless verification.

Title: Democratic-led states sue to block Trump’s halting of wind projects
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 19:29:55 +0000
Content: A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general sued on Monday in a bid to block President Donald Trump’s move to suspend leasing and permitting of new wind projects, saying it threatens to cripple the wind industry and a key source of clean energy.
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Boston argued that the decision by the Republican president’s administration to indefinitely pause all federal wind-energy approvals is unlawful and must be blocked.
The lawsuit, led by New York state, accused Trump of exceeding his authority and said his administration violated federal administrative law by not offering any detailed justification for the suspension.
“This administration is devastating one of our nation’s fastest-growing sources of clean, reliable and affordable energy,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said in a statement.
The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the indefinite pause unlawful and barring the agencies including the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing Trump’s directive.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers accused the Democratic attorneys general of “using lawfare to stop the president’s popular energy agenda.”
“The American people voted for the president to restore America’s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats’ radical climate agenda,” Rogers said in a statement.
Trump announced the pause on his first day back in office on January 20 when he directed his administration in a presidential memorandum to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop the issuance of permits, leases and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects.
He did so while also moving to ramp up the federal government’s support for the fossil fuel industry and maximize output in the United States, the world’s top oil and gas producer, after campaigning for the presidency on the refrain of “drill, baby, drill.”
Trump as a candidate last year promised to end the offshore wind industry, arguing it is too expensive and hurts whales and birds. In announcing the pause, Trump again cited the expense of wind projects and said they “ruin your beautiful landscapes.”
After Trump’s memorandum, U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in April directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s acting director to order a unit of Norwegian energy firm EquinorEQNR.OL to halt construction on its Empire Wind offshore wind project off New York.
The states in their lawsuit argue that Trump’s directive harmed their efforts to secure reliable, diversified sources of energy and jeopardized billions of dollars they have already invested in the industry as part of their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change.
In their lawsuit, the states said the agencies implementing Trump’s order never said why they were abruptly changing longstanding policy supporting wind energy development and were departing from government findings that wind projects can proceed with minimal adverse effects on the environment.
The lawsuit also said Congress never authorized the president to categorically halt wind-energy projects and that the agencies implementing the pause exceeded their authority under numerous laws including the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Title: “Pained” by ties reaching “boiling point”: Guterres ahead of UNSC meeting on India-Pakistan
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 18:37:37 +0000
Content: Ahead of the UN Security Council meeting on India and Pakistan, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that he is “pained” to see their ties reaching a “boiling point.”
“Tensions between India and Pakistan are at their highest in years,” he said, calling on both countries to step back from the brink.
“It is also essential—especially at this critical hour—to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” he added.
Referring to the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, Guterres said, “I understand the raw feelings following the awful terror attack in Pahalgam. It pains me to see relations reaching a boiling point between the two countries.”
Condemning the attack, he stated, “Targeting civilians is unacceptable, and those responsible must be brought to justice through transparent, credible, and lawful means.”
Reiterating his appeal, Guterres said, “Now is the time for maximum restraint and for stepping back from the brink.”
The Security Council meeting is scheduled for 3 p.m. in New York (12:30 a.m. Tuesday in India).
The Resistance Front, an affiliate of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the terrorist massacre of 26 people in Pahalgam.
Following the attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed: “We will identify, trace, and punish every terrorist and their supporters. We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.”
Guterres spoke to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last Tuesday to express his “deep concern” over the rising tensions between the two countries.

Content: Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Monday visited the Pantha Chowk transit camp in Srinagar to review the ongoing arrangements for pilgrims ahead of the upcoming Amarnath Yatra 2025.
Taking to the social media platform, the Lieutenant Governor said, “Reviewed the progress of construction work for the Office and Yatri Niwas of the Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board at Pantha Chowk, Srinagar, earlier today.”
The Amarnath Yatra is scheduled to commence on July 3 this year, simultaneously from both routes—the Pahalgam track in Anantnag district and the Baltal route in Ganderbal district. The Yatra will culminate on August 9, coinciding with the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Specifying the rules and regulations for the Yatra, Anil Sharma, Circle Head of PNB Circle Jammu, said that no pregnant women, and no individuals below 13 or above 70 years of age, would be allowed to participate, even if they possess a valid medical certificate.
“Those below 13 years and above 70 years of age will not be permitted for this Yatra by the Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board, even if they have a mandatory medical certificate. Pregnant women will also not be permitted, even if they produce a medical certificate,” Sharma added.
The dates for the Yatra were announced by Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on March 5 during the 48th Board meeting of the Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board (SASB) at Raj Bhawan.
Considering the anticipated increase in the number of pilgrims for the Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra 2025, the meeting discussed measures to enhance lodging capacity at centres in Jammu, Srinagar, and other locations.

Title: Amit Shah holds review meeting on implementation of three new criminal laws in Delhi
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 14:28:30 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a high-level review meeting on the implementation of three new criminal laws in Delhi. The meeting took place at the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the national capital on Monday.
Among those in attendance were Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena, and Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora.
The three laws under discussion are the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam. These laws were conceptualized under the vision of the Prime Minister to replace colonial-era laws that persisted after independence and to reform the judicial system by shifting the focus from punishment to justice. The theme of the program is “Secure Society, Developed India — From Punishment to Justice.”
Earlier, on May 4, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta launched MedLEaPR (Medico-Legal Examination and Postmortem Reporting) at the Secretariat. She described it as a transformative step toward improving the efficiency and credibility of India’s criminal justice process.
Speaking at an official briefing, Gupta said the initiative was launched in response to the three new criminal laws enacted by the Central Government to overhaul and modernize the justice system.
“Three new criminal laws have come into effect through the Central Government. To improve the entire justice system, MedLEaPR has been introduced. There used to be delays, loopholes, and discrepancies in the system. Through MedLEaPR, we will be able to address these issues, improve efficiency, and ensure better coordination,” Gupta said.
The MedLEaPR system integrates digital tools for medico-legal examinations and postmortem documentation. It aims to eliminate manual errors, streamline reporting, and ensure greater transparency.
These laws and digital reforms collectively aim to create a more secure and just society, aligning with the broader vision of a Developed India.

Title: Indian scientists develop groundbreaking metal-free catalyst for hydrogen fuel production
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 12:53:46 +0000
Content: In a significant advancement toward sustainable energy solutions, Indian researchers have developed a novel, cost-effective, metal-free catalyst that can efficiently produce hydrogen (H₂) fuel by harvesting mechanical energy. This innovation represents a major breakthrough in green hydrogen technology and offers a promising path toward cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
The research, led by Professor Tapas K. Maji of the Chemistry and Physics of Materials Unit at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru, introduces a donor-acceptor based covalent organic framework (COF) that acts as a highly efficient piezocatalyst for water splitting—a method that separates hydrogen from water molecules.
Unlike traditional catalysts that rely heavily on metal-based ferroelectric materials, the new COF system is entirely organic and metal-free. It is composed of tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) as the donor molecule and pyromellitic dianhydride (PDA) as the acceptor. These materials form imide linkages that give rise to a unique structural phenomenon known as ferrielectric (FiE) ordering.
“This breakthrough challenges the traditional reliance on heavy or transition metal-based catalysts, offering a new direction in the development of scalable, sustainable hydrogen production systems,” said Prof. Maji.
What sets this material apart is its sponge-like porous architecture that facilitates efficient water diffusion and access to charge carriers. The FiE ordering in the COF creates intense local electric fields at the pore surfaces, enabling high-density charge accumulation and, in turn, high yields of hydrogen fuel.
Prof. Umesh V. Waghmare, a collaborator from JNCASR, contributed theoretical insights showing that the COF’s electronic structure features coupled energy bands and dipolar ordering. This causes lattice instability, enabling dynamic interaction with mechanical pressure. When stimulated mechanically, the material generates electron-hole pairs, catalyzing the water-splitting reaction with exceptional efficiency.
The study, published in Advanced Functional Materials, involved a multidisciplinary team, including researchers Ms. Adrija Ghosh, Ms. Surabhi Menon, Dr. Sandip Biswas, and Dr. Anupam Dey from JNCASR. Additional contributions came from Dr. Supriya Sahoo and Prof. Ramamoorthy Boomishankar from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, and Prof. Jan K. Zaręba from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Poland.
This innovative catalyst not only reduces dependency on expensive and environmentally harmful metals but also offers a viable method to harness ambient mechanical energy—such as vibrations or pressure—for clean energy generation. The development aligns with India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, aimed at promoting large-scale green hydrogen production and positioning the country as a global leader in this emerging sector.
With global urgency to transition to renewable energy sources, the success of this metal-free piezocatalyst marks a critical step in enabling efficient, clean, and sustainable hydrogen fuel technology.

Title: Relationship between Australia and India “never been stronger”, says Albanese after speaking with PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 13:10:56 +0000
Content: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday said that the relationship between Australia and India has never been stronger and expressed his eagerness to work with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming years to build a prosperous future for the region.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi called Albanese to congratulate him on his party’s landslide victory in Saturday’s General Election.
“Thank you for the call, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and for your warm congratulations. The relationship between Australia and India has never been stronger. I look forward to working with you over the coming years to build a prosperous future for our region,” Albanese said in a post on X.
During the telephone conversation, Prime Minister Modi congratulated Albanese on his historic re-election as the 32nd Prime Minister of Australia.
“Spoke with my friend Anthony Albanese to personally congratulate him on his party’s historic victory. We agreed to work together with renewed vigour to advance the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and explore new areas of cooperation,” PM Modi posted on X after the phone call.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), both Prime Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between the two countries. They noted that in its five years, the CSP has fostered robust cooperation across a diverse range of sectors. They also highlighted the role played by the vibrant Indian-origin diaspora in cementing bilateral ties.
The two leaders exchanged views on regional and global matters of mutual interest and reiterated their commitment to promoting a free, open, stable, rules-based, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
“Prime Minister invited PM Albanese to visit India, including for the Annual Summit and the QUAD Summit to be hosted in India later this year. The leaders agreed to remain in touch,” the MEA said.
PM Modi had also congratulated Albanese on Saturday, immediately after Labor’s resounding win, which saw the party securing 92 lower house seats — only the third time in Australia’s history that a party has won more than 90 seats.
“Congratulations Anthony Albanese on your resounding victory and re-election as Prime Minister of Australia! This emphatic mandate indicates the enduring faith of the Australian people in your leadership. I look forward to working together to further deepen the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and advance our shared vision for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific,” PM Modi said on X.
Albanese, who also spoke with US President Donald Trump, discussed tariffs during their call. On Monday, he announced that his first overseas trip in his second term as Prime Minister would be to Indonesia.
Prime Minister Modi and his Australian counterpart last met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro last November. During that meeting, they also held the second Australia-India Annual Summit ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Australia-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2025.
Both Prime Ministers noted the significant progress in strengthening bilateral ties across a range of key sectors — including climate change and renewable energy, trade and investment, defence and security, education and research, skills and mobility, science and technology, regional and multilateral cooperation, community and cultural links, and people-to-people ties.
Reaffirming their commitment to deepen cooperation, they reflected on shared regional interests and acknowledged that closer bilateral engagement has benefited both nations and the broader region.
The leaders also emphasized that ‘Make in India’ and ‘Future Made in Australia’ have complementarity and collaborative potential, which could create new jobs, drive economic growth, and secure future prosperity in a changing world.
India and Australia are also members of the Quad grouping, alongside the United States and Japan.

Title: Global giants like Apple see economic sense in investing in India: Scindia
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 12:36:55 +0000
Content: Union telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday said that global tech giants such as Apple see strong economic logic in setting up manufacturing facilities in India.
Addressing the Bharat Telecom event here, Scindia said investing in India today is not merely an act of goodwill, but a move driven by sound economic reasoning for every OEM (original equipment manufacturer).
“Apple has decided to source and produce all its mobile phones in India in the coming years. Because when you invest in India, you are choosing affordability, reliability, and originality,” the minister remarked.
Apple CEO Tim Cook recently announced that the tech giant will source the majority of its iPhones for the US market from India in the April-June quarter, while China will produce devices for other markets. This shift comes in response to the sharp hike in US tariffs on Chinese exports, announced by President Donald Trump.
Explaining the economic rationale for investing in India, Scindia stated: “An investment of Rs 4,000 crore—half a billion dollars—has resulted in sales of Rs 80,000 crore, of which Rs 16,000 crore constitutes exports, and 25,000 jobs have been created.”
He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bold vision and unwavering resolve have transformed India from a digital follower into a global digital leader.
Scindia highlighted the remarkable growth of India’s telecom market, driven by the government’s production-linked incentive scheme.
“In just 22 months, we connected 99 per cent of our villages with 5G and brought 82 per cent of our population onto the network by deploying 470,000 towers. This is not evolution; it is a telecom revolution,” he stressed.
He noted that India has not only caught up with the world in areas like 4G and 5G but is now leading the charge, with sweeping reforms and technological innovation shaping the country’s trajectory.
Scindia also underlined the role of India’s telecom sector as a transformative force, noting that it is the world’s second-largest telecom market and the cheapest data provider.
The minister further pointed out that the digital highway built across India is not merely about communication—it is the “infrastructure of infrastructure,” empowering 1.4 billion citizens with access to healthcare, education, governance, and economic opportunity.
In his remarks, Minister of State for Communications, Dr. Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, said: “Today, India stands ready not merely as a market or consumer but as a creator, partner, and trusted provider of world-class telecom solutions. The narrative has changed from the historical ‘made-for-India’ to ‘made-by-India.’”
He emphasised that India is undergoing a pivotal transformation in the global telecom arena, evolving from a consumer to a creator of technology.

Title: Kremlin says Russia still plans to cease fire in Ukraine from May 8-10 but will respond if attacked
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 11:56:33 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Russian forces still planned to cease fire in Ukraine from May 8-10 as per President Vladimir Putin’s orders, but would respond if Ukrainian forces tried to strike Russian positions.
Putin on April 28 declared a three-day ceasefire to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies over Nazi Germany in World War Two.
The Kremlin said the 72-hour ceasefire would run on May 8, May 9 – when Putin will host international leaders on Moscow’s Red Square, including Chinese President Xi Jinping – and May 10.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has so far appeared to rule out such a brief ceasefire, saying he is only ready to sign up to a ceasefire that would last at least 30 days, an idea Putin has said needs a lot of work before it could become a reality.
Asked what Russia would do if Zelenskiy did not sign up to the three-day ceasefire, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said:
“Of course, President Putin’s initiative on a temporary ceasefire for the public holidays is valid, and relevant instructions have been given (to the military) by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief,” said Peskov.
“There will be a ceasefire, but in the event that there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime and attempts to strike our positions or our facilities continue, then an appropriate response will be given immediately.”
Peskov said that Kyiv had not yet given any indication it was ready to sign up to the proposed ceasefire.

Title: Health inequities shortening lives by more than 30 years in poor countries: WHO
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 11:02:29 +0000
Content: Poor social determinants of health are cutting life expectancy in low-income countries by more than 30 years, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The WHO defines social determinants of health as conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.
The report noted that beyond the health sector, factors such as lack of quality housing, education, and job opportunities can dramatically reduce life expectancy.
It said that people in the country with the lowest life expectancy will, on average, live 33 years shorter than those born in the country with the highest life expectancy.
“Children born in poorer countries are 13 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than in wealthier countries,” the report said.
Women from disadvantaged groups are also more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes.
“Our world is an unequal one. Where we are born, grow, live, work, and age significantly influence our health and well-being,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
“Addressing the interlinked social determinants” can help, he added.
Further, the report showed that 3.8 billion people worldwide are deprived of adequate social protection coverage, such as child/paid sick leave benefits, with a direct and lasting impact on their health outcomes.
High debt burdens have been crippling the capacity of governments to invest in these services. As a result, the total value of interest payments made by the world’s 75 poorest countries has increased four-fold in the last decade.
Worryingly, the report also cited “sufficient evidence to show that health inequities within countries are often widening”.
Closing the gap and enhancing equity between the poorest and wealthiest sectors of the population within low- and middle-income countries can help save the lives of 1.8 million children annually, revealed modelling studies.
The report also provides evidence-based strategies and policy recommendations to help countries improve health outcomes for all.
WHO emphasises that measures to address income inequality, structural discrimination, conflict, and climate disruptions are key to overcoming deep-seated health inequities.

Title: Cardinals enter seclusion ahead of secret conclave to elect new pope
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 10:51:05 +0000
Content: Cardinals who will take part in the secret conclave to elect a new Catholic pope began checking into two Vatican hotels on Tuesday, where they will be barred from contact with the outside world as they decide who should succeed Pope Francis.
The conclave will start behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon, with all cardinals under the age of 80 able to vote on who should be the next leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church.
The race to succeed Francis, who died last month, is seen as wide open. Although a few names have been cited as possible front-runners, several of the 133 cardinals expected to vote in the conclave have said they do not know who will become the next pope.
“I have no guess,” Cardinal Robert McElroy said during a visit to a parish in Rome on Monday evening.
The conclave process is “profound and mysterious,” said McElroy, the archbishop of Washington, D.C. “I can give you no insights into who is ahead,” he said.
Some cardinals are looking for a new pope who will continue with Francis’ push for a more transparent, welcoming Church, while others are seeking retrenchment to more traditional roots that put a premium on doctrine.
Conclaves are often spread out over several days, with multiple votes held before a contender wins the necessary three-quarters majority to become pope.
During the conclave period, the voting cardinals will stay in two Vatican guesthouses and take an oath to remain out of contact with anyone not participating in the secret vote.
Francis had a priority of appointing cardinals from countries that had never had them before, such as Haiti, South Sudan, and Myanmar.
This conclave will be the most geographically diverse in the Church’s 2,000-year history, with clerics from 70 countries taking part.
Japanese Cardinal Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi told La Repubblica newspaper that many of the 23 cardinals from Asia voting in the conclave planned to vote as a block.
He contrasted their strategy with that of the 53 cardinals from Europe, who are known to vote in terms of individual countries or other personal preferences.
“We Asians are probably more unanimous in supporting one or two candidates … we will see which name will come out as the leading candidate,” said Kikuchi.

Title: Poland says Russia is trying to interfere in presidential election
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 10:49:47 +0000
Content: Poland is facing an unprecedented attempt from Russia to interfere in its presidential election, the digital affairs minister said on Tuesday, as the campaign entered its final stages ahead of the first round of voting on May 18.
Poland says its role as a hub for aid to Ukraine has made it a key target for Russian sabotage, cyberattacks and disinformation efforts, and Warsaw has been on high alert for interference, especially after Romania cancelled a presidential election in December due to allegations of Russian meddling.
Russia has repeatedly denied accusations that it interferes in foreign elections and criticised the decision to cancel the election in Romania.
“During the current presidential elections in Poland, we are facing an unprecedented attempt to interfere in the electoral process from the Russian side,” Krzysztof Gawkowski told a defence conference.
“This is being done… (by) spreading disinformation in combination with hybrid attacks on Polish critical infrastructure in order to paralyse the normal functioning of the state,” he added.
He said that attacks had targeted water and sewage companies, heat and power plants and state administration bodies. The level of Russian activity in terms of cyberattcks in Poland had more than doubled compared to last year, he said.
“Today in Poland, during every minute of my speech, a dozen or so incidents targeting critical infrastructure were recorded,” he said.
The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Warsaw said in March that there had been a cyberattack on the Polish space agency. In 2024 Poland said the state news agency had likely been hit by a Russian cyberattack.
Warsaw and its allies have also alleged that Moscow is behind acts of arson and sabotage around Europe. Russia dismisses these claims.

Title: Rupee likely to remain in Rs 85-87 range against USD in 2025, US Fed may hold rates steady in next two policy cycles: SBI Report
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 10:44:47 +0000
Content: The Indian rupee is expected to remain stable in the range of Rs 85-87 against the US dollar through 2025, according to a recent report released by the State Bank of India (SBI).
The report highlighted several global and domestic factors that are likely to support the rupee and maintain stability in the USD/INR currency pair over the coming months.
“We expect the USD/INR pair to stabilize in the range Rs 85-87 for 2025, The domestic impact of tariffs on dollar will be visible in 2025 which will support rupee” the report noted.
SBI further pointed out that the DXY index, which tracks the strength of the US dollar against a basket of major currencies, is expected to decline as the US domestic economy adjusts to the impact of tariffs. A softer dollar would support emerging market currencies like the Indian rupee.
The report also referred to the Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) market for USD/INR. The May 2026 USD/INR NDF is currently factoring in a rate of around Rs 85.87 to Rs 86 per dollar over a 12-month horizon, reflecting expectations of limited volatility in the currency pair going forward.
On the macroeconomic front, the report highlighted recent data from the United States. Annual inflation in the US eased to 2.4 per cent in March 2025. At the same time, the nonfarm payroll employment rose by 177,000 in April, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2 percent.
However, the report cautioned that the full impact of tariffs on US inflation is yet to be reflected in the data. Successive inflation readings could come in higher, especially if short-term inflation expectations rise sharply.
Given the dual mandate of the US Federal Reserve — focusing on inflation and employment — the report suggests that the Fed may choose to hold interest rates steady in its next two policy cycles.
“A pause signal is unequivocal based on recent statements,” SBI added.
The interplay of these factors — a steady Fed, easing US inflation, and tariff effects — is likely to create a supportive environment for the Indian rupee in 2025, SBI concluded.

Title: India regulates Chenab river flow after Pahalgam attack; Pakistan reports acute water shortage
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 10:33:23 +0000
Content: India has closed the sluice gates of the Baglihar and Salal dams in Jammu and Kashmir, sharply reducing the flow of the Chenab River into Pakistan. The move comes in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, and follows New Delhi’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). The treaty, signed between India and Pakistan, governs the distribution of the waters of the Indus River and its tributaries.
According to local reports, the decision to halt water release through the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project and the Salal Dam has caused parts of the Chenab riverbed to dry up. Only minimal water is being released through a single gate of each dam to mitigate the environmental impact on aquatic life, officials said.
The Chenab, part of the Indus River System governed by the 1960 treaty brokered by the World Bank, plays a vital role in Pakistan’s agriculture, particularly in the Punjab province. The other rivers in the system include the Jhelum, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej.
The suspension of water flows follows a series of stern measures announced by the Indian government in response to the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, where terrorists killed civilians, including 26 tourists. The Centre has since withdrawn trade and cultural ties with Pakistan, declared key Pakistani High Commission military personnel persona non grata, and shut down the Attari-Wagah border for movement.
Pakistan, meanwhile, has reported a sharp decline in the Chenab’s water flow. According to Dawn News, data from the Marala headworks in Pakistan’s Punjab province showed a drop from 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to 3,100 cusecs by Monday morning.
“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream Pakistan after they took the decision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department in Pakistan told Dawn.
The Indus River System Authority (IRSA), which oversees water distribution in Pakistan, expressed concern at an emergency advisory committee meeting in Islamabad. The panel warned that the move could exacerbate water shortages during the ongoing Kharif crop season, which is already facing a projected 21 per cent shortfall.
Officials said the situation would be reviewed daily, and further updates on water allocations would be issued depending on the continuation of reduced river flows.
Despite the controlled outflows, certain regions witnessed temporary surges in water levels due to heavy rainfall. In the Akhnoor area of Jammu, authorities issued evacuation advisories on May 2, warning locals of a possible rise in Chenab’s water level.
Police and local administration teams patrolled the riverbanks, urging people to avoid venturing near the river amid rising currents.

Title: India launches ‘Operation Sindoor’; precision strikes hit nine terror camps in Pakistan and PoJK
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 20:58:43 +0000
Content: The Indian Armed Forces on Wednesday launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, targeting nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The strikes come just days after a brutal terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 tourists, prompting a strong response from New Delhi.
According to a statement by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the operation was aimed at neutralizing terror camps actively involved in planning and executing attacks against India. 
Officials emphasized that the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, deliberately avoiding any Pakistani military installations.
“India has shown significant restraint both in the selection of targets and the method of execution,” the statement added. 
The Pahalgam attack, which drew widespread outrage, led to a growing demand for immediate government intervention.
“India stands by its commitment that those responsible for this heinous act will be held accountable,” a government spokesperson said. 
Further details of ‘Operation Sindoor’ are expected to be shared during a detailed briefing later on Wednesday.

Title: India’s water will now serve India’s interests: PM Modi on suspension of Indus Water Treaty
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 18:41:41 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that water rightfully belonging to India, which was earlier flowing out of the country, will now be utilised domestically. His remarks came in the wake of India’s decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan following the recent terror attack in Pahalgam.
Speaking at the ABP Network India@2047 Summit, PM Modi underlined the government’s commitment to securing India’s water resources and enhancing agricultural productivity through river interlinking initiatives.
“These days, there is a lot of discussion in the media about water. Pehle Bharat ke haq ka paani bhi bahar ja raha tha… ab Bharat ka paani, Bharat ke haq mein bahega, Bharat ke haq mein rukega aur Bharat ke hi kaam aayega,” he said. (Earlier, the water over which India had a rightful claim was flowing out. Now, it will flow, stay, and be used in India’s interest.)
India has taken a series of measures following the Pahalgam terror attack, including the suspension of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, as a stern message to Pakistan for its continued support of cross-border terrorism. The attack claimed the lives of 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national. The government has vowed strict action against the perpetrators.
Under the treaty, the waters of the Western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) are allocated to Pakistan, while the Eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) are allocated to India. However, both countries are allowed limited use of each other’s rivers. Currently, India can use about 20% of the Indus system waters, while Pakistan receives the remaining 80%.
Referring to his government’s efforts to address water scarcity and enhance irrigation, PM Modi highlighted major river-linking projects.
“For decades, the water of our rivers has been a subject of conflict. Now, in coordination with state governments, we have launched large-scale projects to link rivers. The Ken-Betwa and Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal link projects will benefit millions of farmers,” he said.
The Prime Minister also spoke about the transformation in India’s banking sector over the last decade.
“Before 2014, the banking system was on the verge of collapse. Today, it is one of the strongest globally. Banks are registering record profits, and depositors are benefiting. This turnaround is the result of significant reforms, including the strategic merger of several smaller banks,” PM Modi said.
He further touched upon the implementation of the long-pending One Rank, One Pension (OROP) scheme, asserting the government’s commitment to the welfare of ex-servicemen.
“For decades, OROP was dismissed on financial grounds. We made it a reality. So far, over ₹1.25 lakh crore has been disbursed, benefiting lakhs of former soldiers and their families,” he said.
PM Modi also highlighted that 25 crore Indians have been lifted out of poverty in the last ten years, adding that schemes like Mudra Yojana have empowered small entrepreneurs and showcased that democracy can indeed deliver results.

Title: India’s Gaganyaan mission enters final phase, first human spaceflight set for 2027
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 17:06:12 +0000
Content: India’s first human space mission, ‘Gaganyaan,’ has entered its final phase, with the first human spaceflight now scheduled for the first quarter of 2027, Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday.
Singh said that the successful completion of the TV-D1 mission and the first uncrewed Test Vehicle Abort Mission earlier this year have laid a strong foundation for the upcoming test schedule.
The second Test Vehicle mission (TV-D2) is slated for later in 2025, followed by the uncrewed orbital flights of Gaganyaan. These milestones will culminate in India’s maiden human spaceflight in 2027, launching Indian astronauts into orbit aboard an Indian rocket from Indian soil.
Calling it a “historic mission,” the minister emphasized that the Gaganyaan programme represents India’s rise as a global space power built on indigenous technology, fiscal prudence, and visionary political leadership.
He also recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had clearly laid out India’s long-term ambitions in space, including setting up the ‘Bharatiya Antariksha Station’ by 2035 and sending the first Indian to the Moon by 2040.
The Human-rated LVM3 vehicle, the Crew Escape System, and the Crew Module and Service Module are all undergoing final stages of testing and integration.
The minister confirmed that the uncrewed orbital ‘Gaganyaan’ mission is on track for launch later this year, with recovery trials already conducted with the Indian Navy and more sea recovery simulations planned.
Training for astronauts is also progressing steadily. The minister informed that four Indian Air Force pilots, selected as astronaut-designates, have completed training in Russia and are undergoing further mission-specific training in India. Their health, psychological fitness, and simulation-based operational readiness are being continuously assessed at India’s astronaut training facility.
“The expenditure being incurred on the ‘Gaganyaan’ project is minimal compared to similar human spaceflight missions conducted by other countries,” the minister said. He added that the mission’s returns, both in terms of technological innovation and economic stimulus, far exceed the costs involved.
ISRO Chairman Dr. V. Narayanan echoed the view that ‘Gaganyaan’ is catalyzing India’s emergence as a self-reliant space power, inspiring a new generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
With the crewed mission expected in 2026, India is poised to join an elite group of nations that have independently developed the capability for human spaceflight.

Title: PM Modi seals historic India-UK Free Trade Agreement, 99% Indian exports to get zero duty access
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 16:30:13 +0000
Content: In a historic move set to transform economic relations between India and the United Kingdom, the two nations have concluded a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that promises to reshape the future of bilateral trade, create new employment opportunities, and strengthen India’s integration with global markets.
Announced jointly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi UK PM Keir Starmer, this modern and comprehensive agreement marks a major step forward in India’s journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse. It aligns with India’s vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 and builds upon the momentum from the G-20 Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, where the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening economic ties.
Following those discussions, negotiations gained renewed pace in early 2025 through close coordination between India’s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and UK Secretary of State Jonathan Reynolds.
The FTA eliminates tariffs on nearly 99 percent of Indian exports to the UK, offering tremendous opportunities for key sectors such as textiles, marine products, leather, footwear, sports goods, toys, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, auto components, and organic chemicals. With these tariff reductions, Indian products are expected to gain a significant competitive edge in the UK market, encouraging higher exports and growth across labour-intensive and technology-driven industries.
In addition to goods, the agreement delivers substantial gains in services, with the UK offering its most ambitious market access commitments to date. Indian professionals across sectors like IT and ITeS, financial services, business consulting, education, architecture, engineering, telecommunications, and other digitally delivered services will benefit from new openings in the UK.
The FTA also simplifies mobility for Indian professionals, including business visitors, investors, intra-corporate transferees, their families, and independent professionals such as yoga instructors, musicians, and chefs.
A particularly notable achievement is the exemption secured under the Double Contribution Convention. Indian workers temporarily based in the UK, along with their employers, will be exempt from paying UK social security contributions for a period of three years. This will significantly reduce costs and enhance the competitiveness of Indian service providers operating in the UK market.
PM Modi celebrated the agreement as a “historic milestone” that will deepen the India–UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and catalyse innovation, investment, and job creation.
Goyal praised the Prime Minister’s leadership and vision, which has positioned India as a “Vishwa Mitra” or trusted global partner. He described the agreement as a blueprint for equitable, forward-looking trade that benefits farmers, MSMEs, startups, and workers alike.
Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal underscored the transformative nature of the deal, calling it the most comprehensive FTA India has ever signed and a benchmark for future trade partnerships. He noted that bilateral trade, currently valued at around USD 60 billion, is expected to double by 2030, propelled by the increased market access and regulatory cooperation offered by the FTA.
Beyond its economic implications, the agreement also promotes transparent regulations, good governance practices, and ease of doing business, reflecting India’s ongoing domestic reform agenda. It ensures that non-tariff barriers do not obstruct the flow of goods and services and supports the development of resilient, sustainable supply chains.

The two leaders hailed the agreements as historic milestones in the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two nations.
Emphasizing the potential for fostering innovation, job creation, and sustainable growth, they agreed that the FTA would significantly boost trade and investment flows between the world’s two major open-market economies.
PM Modi and Starmer noted that the agreement will not only strengthen economic linkages but also deepen people-to-people ties and create new avenues for collaboration.
The FTA, which covers trade in both goods and services, is expected to enhance bilateral trade volumes, generate employment, improve living standards, and elevate the overall well-being of citizens in both countries.
Starmer said that reducing trade barriers and building alliances with dynamic economies like India is a key part of the UK’s Plan for Change, aimed at delivering a stronger and more secure economic future.
Both leaders reaffirmed that deepening commercial and economic ties remains a cornerstone of the evolving and robust India-UK partnership. They expressed optimism that the agreement would unlock joint opportunities for developing products and services for global markets, setting the stage for a new chapter of shared prosperity.
PM Modi also extended an invitation to the British Prime Minister to visit India, with both leaders agreeing to stay in close touch as they advance their shared economic and strategic goals.

Title: Relationship between Australia and India “never been stronger”, says Albanese after speaking with PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 13:10:56 +0000
Content: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday said that the relationship between Australia and India has never been stronger and expressed his eagerness to work with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming years to build a prosperous future for the region.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi called Albanese to congratulate him on his party’s landslide victory in Saturday’s General Election.
“Thank you for the call, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and for your warm congratulations. The relationship between Australia and India has never been stronger. I look forward to working with you over the coming years to build a prosperous future for our region,” Albanese said in a post on X.
During the telephone conversation, Prime Minister Modi congratulated Albanese on his historic re-election as the 32nd Prime Minister of Australia.
“Spoke with my friend Anthony Albanese to personally congratulate him on his party’s historic victory. We agreed to work together with renewed vigour to advance the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and explore new areas of cooperation,” PM Modi posted on X after the phone call.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), both Prime Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between the two countries. They noted that in its five years, the CSP has fostered robust cooperation across a diverse range of sectors. They also highlighted the role played by the vibrant Indian-origin diaspora in cementing bilateral ties.
The two leaders exchanged views on regional and global matters of mutual interest and reiterated their commitment to promoting a free, open, stable, rules-based, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
“Prime Minister invited PM Albanese to visit India, including for the Annual Summit and the QUAD Summit to be hosted in India later this year. The leaders agreed to remain in touch,” the MEA said.
PM Modi had also congratulated Albanese on Saturday, immediately after Labor’s resounding win, which saw the party securing 92 lower house seats — only the third time in Australia’s history that a party has won more than 90 seats.
“Congratulations Anthony Albanese on your resounding victory and re-election as Prime Minister of Australia! This emphatic mandate indicates the enduring faith of the Australian people in your leadership. I look forward to working together to further deepen the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and advance our shared vision for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific,” PM Modi said on X.
Albanese, who also spoke with US President Donald Trump, discussed tariffs during their call. On Monday, he announced that his first overseas trip in his second term as Prime Minister would be to Indonesia.
Prime Minister Modi and his Australian counterpart last met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro last November. During that meeting, they also held the second Australia-India Annual Summit ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Australia-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2025.
Both Prime Ministers noted the significant progress in strengthening bilateral ties across a range of key sectors — including climate change and renewable energy, trade and investment, defence and security, education and research, skills and mobility, science and technology, regional and multilateral cooperation, community and cultural links, and people-to-people ties.
Reaffirming their commitment to deepen cooperation, they reflected on shared regional interests and acknowledged that closer bilateral engagement has benefited both nations and the broader region.
The leaders also emphasized that ‘Make in India’ and ‘Future Made in Australia’ have complementarity and collaborative potential, which could create new jobs, drive economic growth, and secure future prosperity in a changing world.
India and Australia are also members of the Quad grouping, alongside the United States and Japan.

Title: Global giants like Apple see economic sense in investing in India: Scindia
Publication Date: Tue, 06 May 2025 12:36:55 +0000
Content: Union telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday said that global tech giants such as Apple see strong economic logic in setting up manufacturing facilities in India.
Addressing the Bharat Telecom event here, Scindia said investing in India today is not merely an act of goodwill, but a move driven by sound economic reasoning for every OEM (original equipment manufacturer).
“Apple has decided to source and produce all its mobile phones in India in the coming years. Because when you invest in India, you are choosing affordability, reliability, and originality,” the minister remarked.
Apple CEO Tim Cook recently announced that the tech giant will source the majority of its iPhones for the US market from India in the April-June quarter, while China will produce devices for other markets. This shift comes in response to the sharp hike in US tariffs on Chinese exports, announced by President Donald Trump.
Explaining the economic rationale for investing in India, Scindia stated: “An investment of Rs 4,000 crore—half a billion dollars—has resulted in sales of Rs 80,000 crore, of which Rs 16,000 crore constitutes exports, and 25,000 jobs have been created.”
He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bold vision and unwavering resolve have transformed India from a digital follower into a global digital leader.
Scindia highlighted the remarkable growth of India’s telecom market, driven by the government’s production-linked incentive scheme.
“In just 22 months, we connected 99 per cent of our villages with 5G and brought 82 per cent of our population onto the network by deploying 470,000 towers. This is not evolution; it is a telecom revolution,” he stressed.
He noted that India has not only caught up with the world in areas like 4G and 5G but is now leading the charge, with sweeping reforms and technological innovation shaping the country’s trajectory.
Scindia also underlined the role of India’s telecom sector as a transformative force, noting that it is the world’s second-largest telecom market and the cheapest data provider.
The minister further pointed out that the digital highway built across India is not merely about communication—it is the “infrastructure of infrastructure,” empowering 1.4 billion citizens with access to healthcare, education, governance, and economic opportunity.
In his remarks, Minister of State for Communications, Dr. Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, said: “Today, India stands ready not merely as a market or consumer but as a creator, partner, and trusted provider of world-class telecom solutions. The narrative has changed from the historical ‘made-for-India’ to ‘made-by-India.’”
He emphasised that India is undergoing a pivotal transformation in the global telecom arena, evolving from a consumer to a creator of technology.

Leading the chorus of support, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth took to X to express his solidarity with the armed forces. “The fighter’s fight begins… No stopping until the mission is accomplished! The entire NATION is with you,” he wrote, tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Home Ministry. He concluded his post with a rousing “JAI HIND ” and the hashtag #OperationSindoor.
He was joined by Mega Star Chiranjeevi, who retweeted the Indian Army’s official Operation Sindoor poster, writing simply, “Jai Hind.” Telugu actor Jr NTR also offered prayers for the safety and success of the military operation, stating, “Praying for the safety & strength of our Indian Army in #OperationSindoor. Jai Hind! ”
From the Malayalam film industry, veteran actor Mammootty paid tribute to the Armed Forces, describing them as the “real heroes.” He wrote, “#OperationSindoor proved again, when the nation calls, the #IndianArmy answers. Thank you for saving lives and restoring hope. You make the nation proud. Jai Hind!”
Several other stars from the Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada film industries added their voices to the growing wave of public appreciation. Actress Samyuktha posted, “Together we stand. Wishing the forces success and safety. Bharat Mata Ki Jai .”
Actor Allu Arjun stated, “May justice be served. Jai Hind #OperationSindoor,” while Telugu actor Nandamuri Kalyanram called the operation an appropriate response to the “cowardly Pahalgam terror attacks,” writing, “Respect. Resolve. Remembrance. Jai Hind .”

Even actor and political commentator Prakash Raj, often vocal about national issues, acknowledged the operation, saying, “Saluting our Indian Armed Forces… India will never tolerate terrorism… #JaiHind.”
Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen were killed in a brutal ambush believed to be orchestrated by Pakistan-backed terrorists.
The Indian Armed Forces struck nine terror camps across the border, including key hubs in Bahawalpur, Muridke, and Sialkot in Pakistan, as well as multiple sites in PoJK. The Indian Army stated that its response was focused, precise, and non-escalatory, avoiding any Pakistani military infrastructure and demonstrating measured restraint in both target selection and execution.
The strike has been lauded across political, civil, and cultural spheres as a strong message against terrorism and a resolute assertion of India’s defense posture.

Title: ‘Support India’s right to self-defence,’ Israel backs ‘Operation Sindoor’
Publication Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 06:14:49 +0000
Content: Israel has extended its support to India’s right to defend itself from terrorism as Indian armed forces carried out ‘Operation Sindoor’ against nine high-value terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
In a calculated military strike following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor late on Tuesday night.
“Israel supports India’s right for self-defence. Terrorists should know there’s no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent,” Reuven Azar, Ambassador of Israel to India, posted on X.
The military operation struck camps and logistical hubs linked to terror groups held responsible for orchestrating the Pahalgam attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians in Jammu and Kashmir.
Indian intelligence agencies have linked the assault to Pakistan-based terror groups, with The Resistance Front, a known Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, claiming responsibility.
“A little while ago, the Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, hitting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed,” the army said following the operation.
The Indian Army’s spokesperson confirmed the precision and limited scope of the strikes, stating. “Our actions have been focused and precise. We have only targeted terrorist camps from where attacks against India have been planned and executed.”
“The operation was non-escalatory in its intent and execution,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Justice is served. Jai Hind.”
The Indian government confirmed that all nine targets were successfully struck, with no civilian, military or economic infrastructure in Pakistan being affected.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with senior officials, closely monitored the progress of the operation throughout the night.

Title: India exercises right to respond to terror: Foreign Secy. briefs nation on ‘Operation Sindoor’
Publication Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 06:03:39 +0000
Content: India has exercised its sovereign right to respond to heinous acts of terror originating from across the border, the government stated on Wednesday, hours after Indian armed forces launched precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
At a press conference on Operation Sindoor, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, flanked by Colonel Sophia and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, emphasized that India’s response to the recent Pahalgam attack was “measured, calibrated, and non-escalatory.”
“Our objective was clear—to dismantle and decimate terror infrastructure across the border,” Misri said, noting that the operations were carried out with surgical precision and resulted in no collateral damage.
Calling Pakistan a “safe haven for terrorists,” Misri accused the neighbouring country of continuing to shelter terror groups despite widespread international condemnation. He cited the case of Sajid Mir, a key 26/11 conspirator, as a stark example of Pakistan’s duplicity.
“Pakistan had claimed Sajid Mir was dead. Only after sustained international pressure did they ‘resurrect’ him and place him under arrest. This is among the most glaring examples of Pakistan’s complicity in protecting terrorists,” he remarked.
Misri also described the Pahalgam massacre as a premeditated attempt by Pakistan-based elements to disrupt the growing peace and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir.
“Last year, over 23 million tourists visited J&K. This surge in tourism threatens those invested in separatism. Fearing the erosion of their influence, they orchestrated this barbaric attack,” he added.
The Foreign Secretary said the attack had provoked deep anger, not only in Jammu and Kashmir but across the country. He noted that India initially pursued diplomatic channels to hold Pakistan accountable, but ultimately resorted to targeted military action.
“Today, with Operation Sindoor, India has demonstrated its resolve to eliminate terror at its roots—precisely, decisively, and responsibly,” Misri concluded.

Publication Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 06:01:32 +0000
Content: In a decisive response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 individuals, the Indian Armed Forces launched a successful retaliatory mission codenamed Operation Sindoor.
The coordinated operation, conducted in the early hours of Wednesday, targeted nine terrorist camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). Among the locations struck were terror hubs in Bahawalpur, Muridke, and Sialkot.
The operation was closely monitored throughout the night by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Channaveerappa, father of Bharat Bhushan—one of the victims of the Pahalgam attack—expressed his support for the Indian government’s swift action. “After bringing the body of my son, we thought that Modi would take some definite steps to control these terrorist attacks, and the Government of India has done it,” he said.
He added that he had heard that around 100 terrorists were killed in the operation. “Definitely, this is 50% justice. But more needs to be done. There are still terrorist hideouts that haven’t been located yet,” he said, calling for continued military action until the threat is fully neutralized.
Kunal Ganbote, whose father Kaustabh Ganbote also died in the attack, thanked the Indian Armed Forces and the government. He noted that the operation’s name, Sindoor, symbolized respect for women like his mother, who lost their spouses in the attack. “We all were waiting for such action, and our hopes have been fulfilled,” he said.
In Kanpur, the wife of slain businessman Shubham Dwivedi also expressed her gratitude. “I want to thank PM Modi for taking revenge for my husband’s death,” she told ANI. “This is the real tribute to my husband. Wherever he is, he will be at peace today.”
Shubham’s father, Sanjay Dwivedi, echoed the sentiment, saying, “The way the Indian military has destroyed the terrorism that is flourishing in Pakistan, I thank our military… My entire family has been feeling light since we heard this news.”
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized the need for global solidarity against terrorism. In a post on social media platform X, he stated, “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism.”

In a post on X, Nadda wrote, “India’s message on Pahalgam — If you tease us, we won’t let you go. Prime Minister Modi has made it clear: those who attack the soul of India will face severe punishment.”
Reaffirming the government’s firm stance on terrorism, he added, “India is both capable and determined to uproot terrorism from its very roots. We will wipe out this menace.”
The precision strikes focused on camps and logistical hubs linked to Pakistan-based terror outfits, including The Resistance Front — a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba — which claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.
According to official sources, Prime Minister Modi personally monitored the operation and remained in constant touch with top military officials and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval throughout its execution.
An Indian Army spokesperson stated, “Our actions were focused and precise. We targeted only those terrorist camps from where attacks on India were being planned and launched.”

“This was a non-escalatory operation in both intent and execution,” the spokesperson added. “Justice has been served. Jai Hind.”

Title: Daughter of Pahalgam terror victim welcomes Operation Sindoor
Publication Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 04:57:30 +0000
Content: Aarti, the daughter of Ramachandran, the 68-year-old man gunned down during the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, has welcomed India’s military response, saying it brought a measure of solace to grieving families.
The overnight operation, codenamed ‘Operation Sindoor’, targeted nine terror infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The strikes came in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack, which claimed 26 civilian lives, including one Nepali national.
“Even though our loss can never be compensated, we are happy that India hit back at Pakistan,” Aarti said.
India responded at the right time. It was the moment we had all been waiting for. I’m relieved that no civilians were harmed in the operation.”
Aarti, a mother of twin boys, was vacationing in Pahalgam with her parents and children when the attack occurred. Breaking down as she recounted the trauma, she recalled the moment her father was shot dead in front of her and her sons. “The terrorist placed something on my head,” she had said earlier. “My sons screamed, and maybe hearing their cries, he walked away without harming them.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty gain in early trade as India carries out ‘Operation Sindoor’
Publication Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 04:30:21 +0000
Content: The Indian benchmark indices erased early losses and began rising on Wednesday as India carried out ‘Operation Sindoor’ at nine terror locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in the wake of the barbaric Pahalgam attack that took 26 lives.
At around 9.34 a.m., Sensex was 160 points up at 80,800, while Nifty was up 56 points at 24,435.35. Both indices pared early losses.
On NSE, eight sectoral indices advanced and seven declined out of twelve. The NSE Nifty Media declined the most, and the NSE Nifty PSU Bank rose the most.
Tata Motors, Shriram Finance, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Finance, and Hindalco were among the major gainers on the Nifty, while losers were Asian Paints, Titan Company, TCS, L&T, and Tech Mahindra.
According to analysts, what stands out in ‘Operation Sindoor’ from the market perspective is its focused and non-escalatory nature.
“We have to wait and watch how the enemy reacts to these precision strikes by India. The market is unlikely to be impacted by the retaliatory strike by India since that was known and discounted by the market,” said V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments.
The main catalyst of market resilience in India is the sustained FII buying of the last fourteen trading days, which has touched a cumulative figure of Rs 43,940 crore in the cash market.
FIIs are focused on global macros like a weak dollar, slower growth in the US and China in 2025, and India’s potential outperformance in growth. This can keep the market resilient. However, investors have to watch the developments on the border, said market experts.
The big shift in market preference in favour of large-caps, away from overvalued segments of mid and small-caps, is significant. FIIs, as always, are mainly buying large-caps, and this trend can continue.
Additionally, geopolitical tensions are expected to introduce further volatility, influencing short-term market movements.
Meanwhile, US stocks fell on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting. Investors are watching closely to see how President Trump’s tariffs could influence the Fed’s stance on interest rates and the broader economic outlook. (IANS)
