Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 14:18:32 +0000
Content: A panel discussion on best practices for social media advertising took centre stage at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai on Saturday. Held at the Jio World Convention Centre and organised by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the session brought together media professionals and digital creators who stressed the need for authenticity, ethical content creation, and transparent branding in the influencer ecosystem.
The panel featured prominent voices from media and digital content creation: Saheli Sinha, Director, ASCII; Shibani Akhtar, film actor and influencer; Mayank Shekhar, entertainment journalist; and Vinay Pillai, Chief Business Officer, Pocket Aces. The discussion was moderated by Tanu Banerjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co.
The panelists emphasized that as influencers continue to shape public discourse and consumer behavior in the digital economy, the need for responsible advertising and honest communication is paramount.
Authenticity is Key
Shibani Akhtar encouraged influencers to stay true to their personal voice while crafting branded content. She highlighted that credibility stems from genuine engagement with the brand and messaging, rather than simply endorsing products. “Influencer marketing works best when it reflects the creator’s values and beliefs,” she said.
Tailored Storytelling Over Uniform Strategy
Vinay Pillai advised against a one-size-fits-all strategy, stating that different digital platforms demand unique content approaches. He stressed the importance of data-informed decisions and conscious brand-building that aligns with platform-specific audiences.
Credibility in the Age of Influence
Commenting on the blurring lines between traditional celebrities and digital creators, Shri Mayank Shekhar pointed out that influence today is niche-driven and platform-led. He warned creators to refrain from spreading misinformation and highlighted the need for fact-checking and originality, especially in sponsored content.
Transparency and Legal Awareness
Saheli Sinha called for full disclosure of paid and promotional posts, urging creators to earn and maintain audience trust. She also emphasized the importance of understanding legal obligations and content responsibility, adding that ASCII offers educational programs to help creators navigate the digital advertising landscape.
A Unified Call for Responsible Content
The session concluded with a consensus that the future of influencer marketing lies in building long-term trust with audiences. This includes adhering to platform guidelines, maintaining transparency, defining personal boundaries, and communicating with clarity and honesty.
The panel’s recommendations signal a collective industry move toward formalizing best practices in influencer advertising and fostering a more ethical, transparent, and professional digital ecosystem.

Title: WAVEX 2025: Catalyzing innovation and investment in India’s M&E Startup Ecosystem
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 11:02:53 +0000
Content: WAVEX 2025, the flagship startup initiative under the World Audio-Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES), is shaping up as a powerful convergence point for innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in India’s media and entertainment (M&E) sector.
The event kicked off with Ashutosh Mohle, Joint Director at the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB), who offered a concise yet compelling overview of WAVEX. He highlighted its core mission — to nurture emerging startups in the M&E space and provide them with a robust national platform to scale and succeed.
Representing the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), Chief Growth Officer Sandeep Jhingran shared insights into the enthusiastic response the initiative has received. “We received over a thousand applications. Thirty of them pitched directly to investors, and over half are already in active conversations,” he revealed. Jhingran emphasized that platforms like WAVEX are essential to spotlight the potential of M&E startups, a segment often overlooked in mainstream startup narratives.
Investor perspectives underscored the initiative’s transformative momentum. Rajesh Joshi, Venue Partner at Warmup Ventures, reflected on his journey from startup founder to investor. “Life has come a full circle… We’re now speaking with 11 startups,” he noted, signaling the growing seriousness of investor engagement in the sector.
Echoing similar sentiments,Mustafa Harnesswala, Founder of CABIL, addressed the long-standing funding hesitance around M&E ventures. “Many shy away from investing in media and entertainment. WAVES is shifting that mindset,” he said. Harnesswala revealed that efforts are underway to establish a dedicated angel network for M&E startups and to explore global collaborations with international governments.
The panel also engaged with the media, addressing key industry questions. On the challenge of identifying meaningful content, Rajesh Joshi cited the example of “Giggle,” a startup app aimed at curbing cyberbullying and sexually explicit content. “It sets a benchmark for responsible innovation,” he said.
Gender representation also surfaced as a crucial area of improvement. “We’re committed to doing better,” said Jhingran, acknowledging the limited participation of women entrepreneurs. “In future editions, we hope to see more women-led ventures take the stage.”
Elaborating on the event’s structure, Jhingran noted that 30 startups were given one-on-one pitching opportunities over two days. Harnesswala emphasized the importance of monetization for content creators, asserting that initiatives like WAVES play a pivotal role in bridging this gap.
With a strong start, WAVEX 2025 is fast emerging as a game-changer for India’s M&E startup landscape — breaking old boundaries, driving investment, and creating fresh opportunities for innovation and growth.

Title: India emerges as global creative powerhouse: Dr. L Murugan unveils landmark reports at WAVES 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:56:38 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. L. Murugan, launched five major knowledge reports that offer an in-depth perspective on India’s fast-growing media and entertainment sector. The reports were released at the ongoing WAVES Summit 2025 in Mumbai and are aimed at supporting data-backed policymaking and strengthening India’s position as a global creative leader.
 
The reports, prepared by a consortium of national and international agencies including the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Ernst & Young, Khaitan & Co., and industry experts, collectively cover the creator economy, digital content production, legal frameworks, live events, and sectoral statistics.
 
A key release, the Statistical Handbook on Media & Entertainment 2024-25, maps long-term trends across broadcasting, print, digital, and film sectors. It documents the rapid rise in content creation and dissemination platforms—from the expansion of Doordarshan’s Free Dish from 33 channels in 2004 to 381 channels in 2025, to the rise in private FM stations from just four in 2001 to 388 by March this year. The handbook notes that All India Radio now covers 98% of the Indian population through 591 stations. Film certification too has witnessed exponential growth, with 3,455 Indian feature films certified in 2024–25 alone. The cumulative number of certified films has reached 69,113.
 
The report also highlights the Ministry’s focus on digital transformation and creator empowerment. Initiatives such as the Create in India Challenge and the Indian Institute of Creative Technologies (IICT) have been spotlighted, along with schemes aimed at ease of doing business and upskilling content creators.
 
Complementing the statistical overview, BCG’s report From Content to Commerce: Mapping India’s Creator Economy notes that India is home to 2 to 2.5 million active digital creators, influencing over \$350 billion in consumer spending. This figure is projected to cross \$1 trillion by 2030. The report urges a shift in approach—from transactional influencer campaigns to long-term, trust-based partnerships that recognise creators as cultural and economic assets.
 
Ernst & Young’s *A Studio Called India* positions the country as a potential global content hub. With a skilled workforce and a 40-60% cost advantage in animation and VFX, India, the report argues, is uniquely placed to become a storytelling powerhouse for international audiences. It adds that nearly 25% of the viewership for Indian OTT content now comes from global audiences, suggesting growing resonance of Indian narratives abroad.
 
The legal landscape of the sector is explored in Khaitan & Co.’s *Legal Currents: A Regulatory Handbook on India’s Media & Entertainment Sector 2025*. The handbook provides clarity on tax implications, compliance for foreign and domestic players, influencer marketing regulations, AI-generated content, and emerging frameworks for gaming and celebrity rights. It is designed to equip stakeholders with practical legal tools to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment.
 
The whitepaper on India’s live events industry charts the sector’s 15% annual growth, adding ₹13 billion in revenue in 2024 alone. It notes a trend of cultural tourism, with nearly half a million Indians travelling inter-city to attend live events. Cities like Shillong, Vadodara, and Jamshedpur are emerging as vibrant cultural hotspots. However, the report also calls attention to infrastructure gaps and licensing hurdles, recommending streamlined processes, enhanced music rights frameworks, and formal recognition of live events under MSME and creative economy policies.
 
Dr. Murugan, speaking at the event, said that these reports collectively underscore India’s evolution from a media-consuming nation to a global cultural force. He noted that India’s multilingual and multicultural foundation, coupled with its digital ambitions, is positioning the country at the forefront of the global entertainment industry.

Title: Indigenous sports take centre stage at WAVES 2025: leaders call for global push
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:30:12 +0000
Content: At a spirited panel discussion held on the sidelines of WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, a cross-section of leaders from the world of sports, governance, and media came together to chart a new course for India’s indigenous sports. The session, titled “Indigenous Sports: From India to the Global Stage”, aimed at celebrating the cultural richness of native games while exploring strategies for their global promotion.
Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi delivered the keynote address, underscoring the deep connection between indigenous sports and India’s cultural identity. “These games are not just physical contests; they are an integral part of our communities, our traditions, and our identity,” he said, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continued support in positioning India as a global sporting power.
Majhi said that Odisha, with its vibrant tribal heritage, has played a key role in preserving and promoting traditional games. “We are committed to nurturing rural talents and ensuring every gifted athlete finds a platform to shine,” he added, pointing to the state’s growing reputation as a hub for sports infrastructure and talent development.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse, echoed similar sentiments. She hailed the Khelo India initiative as a transformative force that is bringing grassroots talent to the forefront. “India has already emerged as a global ambassador of Yoga. Now, we are proudly showcasing traditional games like Kho-Kho and Kabaddi on the international stage,” she said.
“Sport builds more than just bodies—it builds communities and strengthens the cultural fabric of the nation.”
The session also featured insights from sports administrators, league organisers, and international athletes. Anupam Goswami, League Commissioner of the Pro Kabaddi League, spoke of the emotional and cultural resonance indigenous games hold in Indian society. “India has the potential to become a global sports market by leveraging the appeal of its traditional games,” he said.
Fazel Atrachali, a Pro Kabaddi League star from Iran, shared his personal journey, crediting the league for turning Kabaddi into a professional sport.
“Thanks to PKL, Kabaddi has transformed lives, giving athletes not only fame but also financial stability,” he noted.
Nic Coward, Chair of the Regulatory Board of the England and Wales Cricket Board, emphasized the need for modernization and global outreach. “To popularize these sports globally, we must embrace digital platforms, including e-sports,” he said.
Sudhanshu Mittal, President of the Kho-Kho Federation of India, revealed the sport is now played in 55 countries, with plans to expand that number to over 90 by the end of the year. “Indigenous games demand strategy, stamina, and spirit.
They are globally relevant, but we need government support, strategic branding, and diplomatic engagement to take them further,” he said.
Yannick Colaco, founder of Fancode, highlighted the role of technology in building fan communities. “Access and engagement are key. With the right digital tools, we can deepen fan connections and globalize Indian sports,” he added.
The discussion was moderated by Mantra Mugdh, who wove together diverse perspectives into a coherent narrative around the future of India’s sporting legacy.

Title: Padma Shri awardee Baba Shivanand passes away at 128, PM Modi pays tribute
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:58:05 +0000
Content: Renowned yoga practitioner and spiritual guru Baba Shivanand, a recipient of the Padma Shri award, passed away at the age of 128 in Varanasi due to health complications.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over his demise. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “It is extremely saddening to hear about the demise of Shivanand Baba Ji, a yoga practitioner and resident of Kashi. His life, dedicated to yoga and sadhana, will continue to inspire generations. He was honoured with the Padma Shri for his service to society through yoga. Baba Ji’s departure to Shivaloka is an irreparable loss for all residents of Kashi and the countless people who drew inspiration from him. I offer my heartfelt tribute in this moment of sorrow.”
Baba Shivanand breathed his last on Saturday night. He had been admitted to the BHU Hospital on April 30 after experiencing health issues.
A resident of Kashi (Varanasi), Baba Shivanand was widely known for his simple and disciplined lifestyle centred around yoga, meditation, and spiritual discipline. In recognition of his lifelong contribution to the promotion of yoga and wellness, he was conferred the Padma Shri in 2022.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also paid homage to the spiritual leader. In a post on X, he wrote in Hindi (translated), “The demise of Kashi’s renowned yoga guru, ‘Padma Shri’ Swami Shivanand Ji, who made an unparalleled contribution in the field of yoga, is deeply saddening. Humble tributes to him. His spiritual practice and lifelong dedication to yoga will remain a great source of inspiration for society. I pray to Baba Vishwanath to grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength to his followers in this moment of grief. Om Shanti.”
Born on August 8, 1896, in the Sylhet district of present-day Bangladesh, Baba Shivanand lost both his parents to starvation at the age of six. He was later taken in by Omkarnand, who became his spiritual guide and introduced him to the path of yoga and ascetic living.

Title: Indian startups raise over $102 million across 25 deals this week
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:42:54 +0000
Content: Indian startups raised approximately $102.93 million across 25 funding deals this week, with significant participation from both early-stage and growth-stage companies.
Startups based in Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR led the funding activity with seven deals each, followed by Mumbai and Chennai.
Investments were spread across a range of sectors including cleantech, cybersecurity, edtech, and healthtech, reflecting sustained investor interest in India’s innovation-driven startup ecosystem.
Healthtech emerged as the leading sector, recording four deals, followed closely by e-commerce and foodtech startups, which secured three deals each. Other sectors such as media and entertainment, proptech, edtech, and Software as a Service (SaaS) also saw notable activity.
Among growth-stage startups, Metafin, a cleantech-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), led the way by raising $10 million in its Series A round. QNu Labs, a cybersecurity firm, raised $7 million, while neobanking startup Kaleidofin secured $5 million.

Title: Tobacco, Cannabis use may raise heart disease deaths by 50% in five years: studies
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:55:04 +0000
Content: Tobacco and cannabis consumption could significantly raise heart disease-related deaths in the coming years, with recent studies predicting a 50 per cent surge in mortality over the next five years.
Presented at the ongoing Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) 2025 annual scientific sessions in Washington, DC, the twin studies revealed alarming links between substance use and cardiovascular complications.
One study projected that tobacco use alone could increase coronary heart disease deaths by 40 per cent. In contrast, individuals diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (CUD) were found to be 50 per cent more likely to suffer from cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
“Despite major public health campaigns to raise awareness about the harms of tobacco and cannabis, usage remains widespread, and we continue to witness its impact on cardiovascular health,” said James B. Hermiller, President of SCAI.
Ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary heart disease, occurs when reduced blood flow due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries weakens the heart.
Researchers from Wayne State University in the U.S. analysed data from 1999 to 2020, focusing on tobacco-related ischemic heart disease mortality among individuals aged 25 and older. The analysis projected a 43.7 per cent rise in tobacco-related deaths by 2030. While mortality rates among females showed a decline, deaths among males registered a sharp increase.
“Tobacco-related ischemic heart disease is not merely a problem of the past; it continues to be a leading cause of death. Targeted interventions are essential, especially as vulnerable groups remain disproportionately affected,” said Roopeessh Vempati, lead researcher from Wayne State University.
In a separate study, researchers from Sinai Hospital in the U.S. examined data from over 1.3 million patients admitted with heart failure. Findings indicated that patients with both heart failure and CUD were significantly more prone to severe cardiovascular events. The risk of cardiogenic shock was 27 per cent higher, acute myocardial infarction 50 per cent higher, and arrhythmias 48 per cent higher in this group.
Interestingly, the study noted that patients with CUD had a slightly lower risk of mortality compared to those without the disorder. However, researchers cautioned that the overall cardiovascular risks remained considerably elevated.
“Even if the chance of death is slightly lower, the risk of developing severe cardiovascular conditions such as heart attacks or irregular heartbeat is substantially greater. It is essential for physicians and public health professionals to educate individuals on these risks early, even before heart failure sets in,” said Dr. Syed Ishaq, Internal Medicine resident at Sinai Hospital.

Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:09:48 +0000
Content: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast unseasonal rainfall and thunderstorms across Gujarat till May 9, attributing the weather change to a cyclonic circulation over southeast Rajasthan and a north-south trough extending to southern Tamil Nadu.

Title: PM Modi congratulates Singapore’s Lawrence Wong on re-election
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 07:36:04 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to Singapore’s newly re-elected Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, following the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) decisive victory in the general elections. The PAP secured its 14th consecutive mandate, reinforcing its long-standing political dominance in the island nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi highlighted the strong and multifaceted partnership between India and Singapore. “Heartiest congratulations, Lawrence Wong, on your resounding victory in the general elections. India and Singapore share a strong and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close people-to-people ties. I look forward to continue working closely with you to further advance our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” he wrote.
The PAP won 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, improving its vote share to 65.6%, up from 61.2% in the 2020 elections. Mr. Wong, who succeeded Lee Hsien Loong as Prime Minister, expressed gratitude for the public’s support. “Singaporeans have given the @PAPSingapore a clear and strong mandate to govern. I am humbled by and grateful for the faith you have placed in me and my team,” he posted on X.
India and Singapore share a longstanding and robust bilateral relationship, which was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Singapore in September 2024. The partnership spans various sectors, including trade, defence, digital innovation, and education, and is anchored in mutual trust, shared values, and strong people-to-people ties.
PM Modi has visited Singapore five times since 2014, reflecting the significance India places on its engagement with the country. His visits have included bilateral meetings, multilateral summits, and major public events. Notably, he was the first Indian Prime Minister to deliver the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, and the first head of government to address the Singapore FinTech Festival in November 2018.

Title: India, Angola agree to deepen energy and strategic ties
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 05:35:40 +0000
Content: India and Angola have agreed to expand their energy partnership while also enhancing cooperation in digital infrastructure, space technology, and defence. The two countries signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) on Saturday aimed at boosting bilateral ties, coinciding with the visit of Angolan President João Lourenço to India — the first such visit in 38 years.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following delegation-level talks, described the visit as “historic” and said it was not only giving new direction to India-Angola relations but also strengthening India-Africa ties. The two nations are currently marking the 40th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship.
“India stood firmly with Angola during its struggle for independence. Today, we continue to build on that foundation of friendship,” PM Modi said during a joint press statement.
The Prime Minister announced the approval of a Line of Credit worth $200 million for defence procurement to support the modernisation of Angola’s armed forces. “We have also discussed cooperation in repair, overhaul, and supply of defence platforms, as well as training support,” he said.
India also offered to share its expertise in digital public infrastructure, capacity building, and space technology with the southern African nation. Further areas of collaboration include healthcare, diamond processing, fertilisers, and critical minerals. A youth exchange programme is also being planned to strengthen people-to-people ties.
On the multilateral front, Angola signed the Framework Agreement of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), becoming its 123rd member. India also invited Angola to join other global initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Big Cat Alliance, and the Global Biofuels Alliance.
PM Modi welcomed Angola’s upcoming chairmanship of the African Union and recalled the bloc’s induction as a permanent member of the G20 during India’s presidency. “India and the African Union are pillars of the Global South. We stand united in representing the hopes and aspirations of developing countries,” he said.
In a strong statement against terrorism, the Prime Minister thanked Angola for its solidarity following the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam. “Terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity. We are committed to taking decisive action against terrorists and their supporters,” he said.
Secretary (Economic Relations) Dammu Ravi, while briefing the media, said bilateral trade between India and Angola currently stands at $4.2 billion, with oil and gas making up 90% of this trade. Angola is India’s second-largest African supplier of crude oil and liquefied natural gas, after Nigeria. India exports around $700 million worth of goods to Angola, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, automobile components, plastics, and refined oil.
Ravi added that Angola had sought Indian assistance in refining and processing its newly discovered oil fields and in setting up refineries, both onshore and offshore.
India has stepped up its diplomatic outreach across Africa in recent years. Over the past decade, it has established 17 new embassies on the continent and extended credit lines worth over $12 billion, along with $700 million in grant assistance. Vocational training centres have been set up in eight African countries, and India is working with five others on digital public infrastructure projects.
Last month, India and Africa conducted their first joint naval maritime exercise, “AIKEYME,” underscoring growing defence and maritime cooperation.
“India and Angola are natural partners in progress. I am confident that under Angola’s leadership, India’s engagement with the African Union will scale new heights,” PM Modi said.
