Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 14:18:32 +0000
Content: A panel discussion on best practices for social media advertising took centre stage at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025 in Mumbai on Saturday. Held at the Jio World Convention Centre and organised by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the session brought together media professionals and digital creators who stressed the need for authenticity, ethical content creation, and transparent branding in the influencer ecosystem.
The panel featured prominent voices from media and digital content creation: Saheli Sinha, Director, ASCII; Shibani Akhtar, film actor and influencer; Mayank Shekhar, entertainment journalist; and Vinay Pillai, Chief Business Officer, Pocket Aces. The discussion was moderated by Tanu Banerjee, Partner at Khaitan & Co.
The panelists emphasized that as influencers continue to shape public discourse and consumer behavior in the digital economy, the need for responsible advertising and honest communication is paramount.
Authenticity is Key
Shibani Akhtar encouraged influencers to stay true to their personal voice while crafting branded content. She highlighted that credibility stems from genuine engagement with the brand and messaging, rather than simply endorsing products. “Influencer marketing works best when it reflects the creator’s values and beliefs,” she said.
Tailored Storytelling Over Uniform Strategy
Vinay Pillai advised against a one-size-fits-all strategy, stating that different digital platforms demand unique content approaches. He stressed the importance of data-informed decisions and conscious brand-building that aligns with platform-specific audiences.
Credibility in the Age of Influence
Commenting on the blurring lines between traditional celebrities and digital creators, Shri Mayank Shekhar pointed out that influence today is niche-driven and platform-led. He warned creators to refrain from spreading misinformation and highlighted the need for fact-checking and originality, especially in sponsored content.
Transparency and Legal Awareness
Saheli Sinha called for full disclosure of paid and promotional posts, urging creators to earn and maintain audience trust. She also emphasized the importance of understanding legal obligations and content responsibility, adding that ASCII offers educational programs to help creators navigate the digital advertising landscape.
A Unified Call for Responsible Content
The session concluded with a consensus that the future of influencer marketing lies in building long-term trust with audiences. This includes adhering to platform guidelines, maintaining transparency, defining personal boundaries, and communicating with clarity and honesty.
The panel’s recommendations signal a collective industry move toward formalizing best practices in influencer advertising and fostering a more ethical, transparent, and professional digital ecosystem.

Title: WAVEX 2025: Catalyzing innovation and investment in India’s M&E Startup Ecosystem
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 11:02:53 +0000
Content: WAVEX 2025, the flagship startup initiative under the World Audio-Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES), is shaping up as a powerful convergence point for innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in India’s media and entertainment (M&E) sector.
The event kicked off with Ashutosh Mohle, Joint Director at the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB), who offered a concise yet compelling overview of WAVEX. He highlighted its core mission — to nurture emerging startups in the M&E space and provide them with a robust national platform to scale and succeed.
Representing the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), Chief Growth Officer Sandeep Jhingran shared insights into the enthusiastic response the initiative has received. “We received over a thousand applications. Thirty of them pitched directly to investors, and over half are already in active conversations,” he revealed. Jhingran emphasized that platforms like WAVEX are essential to spotlight the potential of M&E startups, a segment often overlooked in mainstream startup narratives.
Investor perspectives underscored the initiative’s transformative momentum. Rajesh Joshi, Venue Partner at Warmup Ventures, reflected on his journey from startup founder to investor. “Life has come a full circle… We’re now speaking with 11 startups,” he noted, signaling the growing seriousness of investor engagement in the sector.
Echoing similar sentiments,Mustafa Harnesswala, Founder of CABIL, addressed the long-standing funding hesitance around M&E ventures. “Many shy away from investing in media and entertainment. WAVES is shifting that mindset,” he said. Harnesswala revealed that efforts are underway to establish a dedicated angel network for M&E startups and to explore global collaborations with international governments.
The panel also engaged with the media, addressing key industry questions. On the challenge of identifying meaningful content, Rajesh Joshi cited the example of “Giggle,” a startup app aimed at curbing cyberbullying and sexually explicit content. “It sets a benchmark for responsible innovation,” he said.
Gender representation also surfaced as a crucial area of improvement. “We’re committed to doing better,” said Jhingran, acknowledging the limited participation of women entrepreneurs. “In future editions, we hope to see more women-led ventures take the stage.”
Elaborating on the event’s structure, Jhingran noted that 30 startups were given one-on-one pitching opportunities over two days. Harnesswala emphasized the importance of monetization for content creators, asserting that initiatives like WAVES play a pivotal role in bridging this gap.
With a strong start, WAVEX 2025 is fast emerging as a game-changer for India’s M&E startup landscape — breaking old boundaries, driving investment, and creating fresh opportunities for innovation and growth.

Title: India emerges as global creative powerhouse: Dr. L Murugan unveils landmark reports at WAVES 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:56:38 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. L. Murugan, launched five major knowledge reports that offer an in-depth perspective on India’s fast-growing media and entertainment sector. The reports were released at the ongoing WAVES Summit 2025 in Mumbai and are aimed at supporting data-backed policymaking and strengthening India’s position as a global creative leader.
 
The reports, prepared by a consortium of national and international agencies including the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Ernst & Young, Khaitan & Co., and industry experts, collectively cover the creator economy, digital content production, legal frameworks, live events, and sectoral statistics.
 
A key release, the Statistical Handbook on Media & Entertainment 2024-25, maps long-term trends across broadcasting, print, digital, and film sectors. It documents the rapid rise in content creation and dissemination platforms—from the expansion of Doordarshan’s Free Dish from 33 channels in 2004 to 381 channels in 2025, to the rise in private FM stations from just four in 2001 to 388 by March this year. The handbook notes that All India Radio now covers 98% of the Indian population through 591 stations. Film certification too has witnessed exponential growth, with 3,455 Indian feature films certified in 2024–25 alone. The cumulative number of certified films has reached 69,113.
 
The report also highlights the Ministry’s focus on digital transformation and creator empowerment. Initiatives such as the Create in India Challenge and the Indian Institute of Creative Technologies (IICT) have been spotlighted, along with schemes aimed at ease of doing business and upskilling content creators.
 
Complementing the statistical overview, BCG’s report From Content to Commerce: Mapping India’s Creator Economy notes that India is home to 2 to 2.5 million active digital creators, influencing over \$350 billion in consumer spending. This figure is projected to cross \$1 trillion by 2030. The report urges a shift in approach—from transactional influencer campaigns to long-term, trust-based partnerships that recognise creators as cultural and economic assets.
 
Ernst & Young’s *A Studio Called India* positions the country as a potential global content hub. With a skilled workforce and a 40-60% cost advantage in animation and VFX, India, the report argues, is uniquely placed to become a storytelling powerhouse for international audiences. It adds that nearly 25% of the viewership for Indian OTT content now comes from global audiences, suggesting growing resonance of Indian narratives abroad.
 
The legal landscape of the sector is explored in Khaitan & Co.’s *Legal Currents: A Regulatory Handbook on India’s Media & Entertainment Sector 2025*. The handbook provides clarity on tax implications, compliance for foreign and domestic players, influencer marketing regulations, AI-generated content, and emerging frameworks for gaming and celebrity rights. It is designed to equip stakeholders with practical legal tools to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment.
 
The whitepaper on India’s live events industry charts the sector’s 15% annual growth, adding ₹13 billion in revenue in 2024 alone. It notes a trend of cultural tourism, with nearly half a million Indians travelling inter-city to attend live events. Cities like Shillong, Vadodara, and Jamshedpur are emerging as vibrant cultural hotspots. However, the report also calls attention to infrastructure gaps and licensing hurdles, recommending streamlined processes, enhanced music rights frameworks, and formal recognition of live events under MSME and creative economy policies.
 
Dr. Murugan, speaking at the event, said that these reports collectively underscore India’s evolution from a media-consuming nation to a global cultural force. He noted that India’s multilingual and multicultural foundation, coupled with its digital ambitions, is positioning the country at the forefront of the global entertainment industry.

Title: Indigenous sports take centre stage at WAVES 2025: leaders call for global push
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 10:30:12 +0000
Content: At a spirited panel discussion held on the sidelines of WAVES 2025 in Mumbai, a cross-section of leaders from the world of sports, governance, and media came together to chart a new course for India’s indigenous sports. The session, titled “Indigenous Sports: From India to the Global Stage”, aimed at celebrating the cultural richness of native games while exploring strategies for their global promotion.
Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi delivered the keynote address, underscoring the deep connection between indigenous sports and India’s cultural identity. “These games are not just physical contests; they are an integral part of our communities, our traditions, and our identity,” he said, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continued support in positioning India as a global sporting power.
Majhi said that Odisha, with its vibrant tribal heritage, has played a key role in preserving and promoting traditional games. “We are committed to nurturing rural talents and ensuring every gifted athlete finds a platform to shine,” he added, pointing to the state’s growing reputation as a hub for sports infrastructure and talent development.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse, echoed similar sentiments. She hailed the Khelo India initiative as a transformative force that is bringing grassroots talent to the forefront. “India has already emerged as a global ambassador of Yoga. Now, we are proudly showcasing traditional games like Kho-Kho and Kabaddi on the international stage,” she said.
“Sport builds more than just bodies—it builds communities and strengthens the cultural fabric of the nation.”
The session also featured insights from sports administrators, league organisers, and international athletes. Anupam Goswami, League Commissioner of the Pro Kabaddi League, spoke of the emotional and cultural resonance indigenous games hold in Indian society. “India has the potential to become a global sports market by leveraging the appeal of its traditional games,” he said.
Fazel Atrachali, a Pro Kabaddi League star from Iran, shared his personal journey, crediting the league for turning Kabaddi into a professional sport.
“Thanks to PKL, Kabaddi has transformed lives, giving athletes not only fame but also financial stability,” he noted.
Nic Coward, Chair of the Regulatory Board of the England and Wales Cricket Board, emphasized the need for modernization and global outreach. “To popularize these sports globally, we must embrace digital platforms, including e-sports,” he said.
Sudhanshu Mittal, President of the Kho-Kho Federation of India, revealed the sport is now played in 55 countries, with plans to expand that number to over 90 by the end of the year. “Indigenous games demand strategy, stamina, and spirit.
They are globally relevant, but we need government support, strategic branding, and diplomatic engagement to take them further,” he said.
Yannick Colaco, founder of Fancode, highlighted the role of technology in building fan communities. “Access and engagement are key. With the right digital tools, we can deepen fan connections and globalize Indian sports,” he added.
The discussion was moderated by Mantra Mugdh, who wove together diverse perspectives into a coherent narrative around the future of India’s sporting legacy.

Title: Padma Shri awardee Baba Shivanand passes away at 128, PM Modi pays tribute
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:58:05 +0000
Content: Renowned yoga practitioner and spiritual guru Baba Shivanand, a recipient of the Padma Shri award, passed away at the age of 128 in Varanasi due to health complications.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over his demise. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “It is extremely saddening to hear about the demise of Shivanand Baba Ji, a yoga practitioner and resident of Kashi. His life, dedicated to yoga and sadhana, will continue to inspire generations. He was honoured with the Padma Shri for his service to society through yoga. Baba Ji’s departure to Shivaloka is an irreparable loss for all residents of Kashi and the countless people who drew inspiration from him. I offer my heartfelt tribute in this moment of sorrow.”
Baba Shivanand breathed his last on Saturday night. He had been admitted to the BHU Hospital on April 30 after experiencing health issues.
A resident of Kashi (Varanasi), Baba Shivanand was widely known for his simple and disciplined lifestyle centred around yoga, meditation, and spiritual discipline. In recognition of his lifelong contribution to the promotion of yoga and wellness, he was conferred the Padma Shri in 2022.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also paid homage to the spiritual leader. In a post on X, he wrote in Hindi (translated), “The demise of Kashi’s renowned yoga guru, ‘Padma Shri’ Swami Shivanand Ji, who made an unparalleled contribution in the field of yoga, is deeply saddening. Humble tributes to him. His spiritual practice and lifelong dedication to yoga will remain a great source of inspiration for society. I pray to Baba Vishwanath to grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength to his followers in this moment of grief. Om Shanti.”
Born on August 8, 1896, in the Sylhet district of present-day Bangladesh, Baba Shivanand lost both his parents to starvation at the age of six. He was later taken in by Omkarnand, who became his spiritual guide and introduced him to the path of yoga and ascetic living.

Title: Indian startups raise over $102 million across 25 deals this week
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 09:42:54 +0000
Content: Indian startups raised approximately $102.93 million across 25 funding deals this week, with significant participation from both early-stage and growth-stage companies.
Startups based in Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR led the funding activity with seven deals each, followed by Mumbai and Chennai.
Investments were spread across a range of sectors including cleantech, cybersecurity, edtech, and healthtech, reflecting sustained investor interest in India’s innovation-driven startup ecosystem.
Healthtech emerged as the leading sector, recording four deals, followed closely by e-commerce and foodtech startups, which secured three deals each. Other sectors such as media and entertainment, proptech, edtech, and Software as a Service (SaaS) also saw notable activity.
Among growth-stage startups, Metafin, a cleantech-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), led the way by raising $10 million in its Series A round. QNu Labs, a cybersecurity firm, raised $7 million, while neobanking startup Kaleidofin secured $5 million. CollegeDekho, an edtech platform, and Sadhav Offshore, a marine services company, also received substantial funding.

Title: Tobacco, Cannabis use may raise heart disease deaths by 50% in five years: studies
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:55:04 +0000
Content: Tobacco and cannabis consumption could significantly raise heart disease-related deaths in the coming years, with recent studies predicting a 50 per cent surge in mortality over the next five years.
Presented at the ongoing Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) 2025 annual scientific sessions in Washington, DC, the twin studies revealed alarming links between substance use and cardiovascular complications.
One study projected that tobacco use alone could increase coronary heart disease deaths by 40 per cent. In contrast, individuals diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (CUD) were found to be 50 per cent more likely to suffer from cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
“Despite major public health campaigns to raise awareness about the harms of tobacco and cannabis, usage remains widespread, and we continue to witness its impact on cardiovascular health,” said James B. Hermiller, President of SCAI.
Ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary heart disease, occurs when reduced blood flow due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries weakens the heart.
Researchers from Wayne State University in the U.S. analysed data from 1999 to 2020, focusing on tobacco-related ischemic heart disease mortality among individuals aged 25 and older. The analysis projected a 43.7 per cent rise in tobacco-related deaths by 2030. While mortality rates among females showed a decline, deaths among males registered a sharp increase.
“Tobacco-related ischemic heart disease is not merely a problem of the past; it continues to be a leading cause of death. Targeted interventions are essential, especially as vulnerable groups remain disproportionately affected,” said Roopeessh Vempati, lead researcher from Wayne State University.
In a separate study, researchers from Sinai Hospital in the U.S. examined data from over 1.3 million patients admitted with heart failure. Findings indicated that patients with both heart failure and CUD were significantly more prone to severe cardiovascular events. The risk of cardiogenic shock was 27 per cent higher, acute myocardial infarction 50 per cent higher, and arrhythmias 48 per cent higher in this group.
Interestingly, the study noted that patients with CUD had a slightly lower risk of mortality compared to those without the disorder. However, researchers cautioned that the overall cardiovascular risks remained considerably elevated.
“Even if the chance of death is slightly lower, the risk of developing severe cardiovascular conditions such as heart attacks or irregular heartbeat is substantially greater. It is essential for physicians and public health professionals to educate individuals on these risks early, even before heart failure sets in,” said Dr. Syed Ishaq, Internal Medicine resident at Sinai Hospital.

Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 08:09:48 +0000
Content: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast unseasonal rainfall and thunderstorms across Gujarat till May 9, attributing the weather change to a cyclonic circulation over southeast Rajasthan and a north-south trough extending to southern Tamil Nadu.
Several districts in the state are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall, with intensity expected to increase gradually over the coming days.
Gujarat has been witnessing high temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in many areas. The forecasted rainfall is expected to bring some respite from the prevailing heatwave-like conditions.
According to the IMD, the rainfall is likely to extend to most parts of the state, including Central and South Gujarat, by May 6. A fall of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius in maximum temperatures is also expected over the next five days.
The IMD has warned of hailstorms in some areas on May 5 and 6. Heavy rainfall is likely over North Gujarat, South Gujarat, and coastal Saurashtra on May 7 and 8. The department has advised caution, as these conditions could impact normal life and damage standing crops.
Districts likely to be affected include Mehsana, Aravalli, Panchmahal, Dahod, Mahisagar, Vadodara, Chhota Udepur, Tapi, Valsad, and Navsari. Light to moderate rain, lightning, and gusty winds of up to 50 kmph are also expected in Daman and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, as well as parts of Saurashtra and Kutch.
On May 5, weather conditions are expected to intensify, with moderate thunderstorms, lightning, rain, and wind speeds of 30–40 kmph (gusting up to 50 kmph) likely to affect several districts, including Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Anand, Kheda, Narmada, Bharuch, Surat, and the Dangs.
Saurashtra districts such as Surendranagar, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Gir Somnath, Dwarka, and Botad are also expected to be impacted, along with the Union Territory of Diu.

Title: PM Modi congratulates Singapore’s Lawrence Wong on re-election
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 07:36:04 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to Singapore’s newly re-elected Prime Minister, Lawrence Wong, following the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) decisive victory in the general elections. The PAP secured its 14th consecutive mandate, reinforcing its long-standing political dominance in the island nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi highlighted the strong and multifaceted partnership between India and Singapore. “Heartiest congratulations, Lawrence Wong, on your resounding victory in the general elections. India and Singapore share a strong and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close people-to-people ties. I look forward to continue working closely with you to further advance our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” he wrote.
The PAP won 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, improving its vote share to 65.6%, up from 61.2% in the 2020 elections. Mr. Wong, who succeeded Lee Hsien Loong as Prime Minister, expressed gratitude for the public’s support. “Singaporeans have given the @PAPSingapore a clear and strong mandate to govern. I am humbled by and grateful for the faith you have placed in me and my team,” he posted on X.
India and Singapore share a longstanding and robust bilateral relationship, which was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Singapore in September 2024. The partnership spans various sectors, including trade, defence, digital innovation, and education, and is anchored in mutual trust, shared values, and strong people-to-people ties.
PM Modi has visited Singapore five times since 2014, reflecting the significance India places on its engagement with the country. His visits have included bilateral meetings, multilateral summits, and major public events. Notably, he was the first Indian Prime Minister to deliver the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, and the first head of government to address the Singapore FinTech Festival in November 2018.

Title: India, Angola agree to deepen energy and strategic ties
Publication Date: Sun, 04 May 2025 05:35:40 +0000
Content: India and Angola have agreed to expand their energy partnership while also enhancing cooperation in digital infrastructure, space technology, and defence. The two countries signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) on Saturday aimed at boosting bilateral ties, coinciding with the visit of Angolan President João Lourenço to India — the first such visit in 38 years.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following delegation-level talks, described the visit as “historic” and said it was not only giving new direction to India-Angola relations but also strengthening India-Africa ties. The two nations are currently marking the 40th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship.
“India stood firmly with Angola during its struggle for independence. Today, we continue to build on that foundation of friendship,” PM Modi said during a joint press statement.
The Prime Minister announced the approval of a Line of Credit worth $200 million for defence procurement to support the modernisation of Angola’s armed forces. “We have also discussed cooperation in repair, overhaul, and supply of defence platforms, as well as training support,” he said.
India also offered to share its expertise in digital public infrastructure, capacity building, and space technology with the southern African nation. Further areas of collaboration include healthcare, diamond processing, fertilisers, and critical minerals. A youth exchange programme is also being planned to strengthen people-to-people ties.
On the multilateral front, Angola signed the Framework Agreement of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), becoming its 123rd member. India also invited Angola to join other global initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Big Cat Alliance, and the Global Biofuels Alliance.
PM Modi welcomed Angola’s upcoming chairmanship of the African Union and recalled the bloc’s induction as a permanent member of the G20 during India’s presidency. “India and the African Union are pillars of the Global South. We stand united in representing the hopes and aspirations of developing countries,” he said.
In a strong statement against terrorism, the Prime Minister thanked Angola for its solidarity following the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam. “Terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity. We are committed to taking decisive action against terrorists and their supporters,” he said.
Secretary (Economic Relations) Dammu Ravi, while briefing the media, said bilateral trade between India and Angola currently stands at $4.2 billion, with oil and gas making up 90% of this trade. Angola is India’s second-largest African supplier of crude oil and liquefied natural gas, after Nigeria. India exports around $700 million worth of goods to Angola, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, automobile components, plastics, and refined oil.
Ravi added that Angola had sought Indian assistance in refining and processing its newly discovered oil fields and in setting up refineries, both onshore and offshore.
India has stepped up its diplomatic outreach across Africa in recent years. Over the past decade, it has established 17 new embassies on the continent and extended credit lines worth over $12 billion, along with $700 million in grant assistance. Vocational training centres have been set up in eight African countries, and India is working with five others on digital public infrastructure projects.
Last month, India and Africa conducted their first joint naval maritime exercise, “AIKEYME,” underscoring growing defence and maritime cooperation.
“India and Angola are natural partners in progress. I am confident that under Angola’s leadership, India’s engagement with the African Union will scale new heights,” PM Modi said.

Title: Cardinals could pick Filipino Tagle, ‘Asian Francis’, as next pope
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:19:47 +0000
Content: Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is sometimes called the “Asian Francis” because of his infectious smile, easy laugh, and spontaneity with words.
Like the late Argentine pope, he hails from a country far from the Catholic Church’s traditional power base of Europe and came to Rome with an outsider’s view.
Some who have put Tagle on unofficial short lists for the next pope say he would be a shoo-in to succeed Francis if cardinal electors who enter the secret conclave on Wednesday are looking for as close a similarity as possible in order to assertively continue Francis’ progressive streak.
If Tagle were elected, it would also likely signal to the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics that the cardinals want to go forward with Francis’ vision of generally opening up the Church to the modern world by not choosing a man who might roll back some of the late pope’s reforms.
It would also mean his fellow cardinals had shrugged off question marks over his management abilities.
“He would represent a continuity of what Pope Francis has been doing,” said Rev. Emmanuel Alfonso, a former student of Tagle’s who has known him for decades. “He’s really like Pope Francis in terms of his love for the poor, his approachability and so on.”
Tagle, the former archbishop of Manila, would be the first pope from what is now considered Asia, although in the early Church some popes hailed from what is now called the Middle East, technically part of Asia.
Tagle, who looks younger than his 67 years and likes to be called by his diminutive nickname “Chito”, has headed the Vatican’s Dicastery for Evangelization, effectively the Church’s missionary arm, for the past five years. That position gave him enormous influence over national churches in developing countries.
As archbishop of Manila, and before as bishop of the Philippine city of Imus, Tagle gained pastoral experience in running dioceses in Asia’s largest Catholic country. By bringing him to the Vatican in 2020, Francis gave him one more notch in experiences seen as helpful to papal candidates.
Tagle’s move to Rome brought criticism from then-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who oversaw a bloody “war on drugs” that killed thousands of Filipinos during his 2016-2022 administration.
Duterte said Tagle had been removed from Manila for meddling in national politics.
The Philippine Catholic bishops’ conference denied those accusations forcefully. Bishop Pablo Virgilio David of Kalookan, a conference official made a cardinal in 2024, called Duterte’s claim “unbelievably ludicrous”.
Many cardinals already know Tagle personally, and many may see an attraction in having a pope from Asia, viewed by Church leaders as an important region of growth for the faith. Young people feel comfortable with him.
When Tagle hosted Francis for a visit to the Philippines in 2014, the visit drew the largest crowds in the history of papal travel, including a Mass that attracted up to 7 million people.
DOCTRINAL BACKGROUND
Tagle, who speaks Italian, English, and Spanish as well as his native Tagalog, now has five years of experience with the Vatican’s arcane bureaucracy, although some cardinals may think even that is not enough to run the global Church.
One possible weakness in Tagle’s candidacy is that he was involved in a management scandal three years ago.
In 2022, Francis removed him from a second job as titular head of a Vatican-based confederation of 162 Catholic relief, development and social services organisations working in more than 200 countries.
Francis fired the entire leadership of the group, called Caritas Internationalis, following allegations of bullying by top management.
Tagle’s role, akin to a chancellor of the organisation, was mostly symbolic and ceremonial. He was not directly involved in day-to-day running and was generally admired by staffers.
Unlike Francis, Tagle enjoys a global reputation as a theologian, which could help him gain votes from moderate cardinals concerned by some of Francis’ off the cuff utterances, which led to what some called confusion about Church teachings.
In the 1990s, he served on the Vatican’s International Theological Commission under German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was known as a strict adherent to traditional doctrine and would later become Pope Benedict XVI.
Rev. Joseph Komonchak, Tagle’s professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., said the cardinal was one of his best students in 45 years of teaching.
“Not the least of Chito’s virtues was the joy that he radiated on everyone who encountered him,” said Komonchak. “He had a fine sense of humor, which endeared him to his fellow students.”
Rev. Robert Reyes, a seminary classmate who has known Tagle for more than 50 years, said Tagle has an ability to connect with people and a simple style of living. When he first became a bishop in 2001, he didn’t own a car.
“He preferred to take rides, to hitch a ride with someone driving to a place that perhaps both of them were going to,” said Reyes.
While 67 is sunset age in many organisations, it is considered young in the Vatican, because few cardinals want a very long pontificate.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis announce campaign targeting Israeli airports
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:08:16 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthi rebels said late on Sunday they would impose a “comprehensive” aerial blockade on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports, in response to Israel expanding its operations in Gaza.
The Iran-aligned Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Sunday that hit near Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, the latest in a string of attacks, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate.
Most attacks from Yemen have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, though a drone strike hit Tel Aviv last year. Sunday’s missile was the only one of a series launched since March that was not intercepted.
The Houthis’ Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, a body set up last year to liaise between Houthi forces and commercial shipping operators, issued the warning about targeting Israeli airports, saying Ben Gurion Airport would be the top target.
The statement attached an email it said was sent to the International Air Transport Association, the global airlines body, and the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization.
Houthi forces called “upon all international airlines to take this announcement into serious consideration … and to cancel all their flights to the airports of the criminal Israeli enemy, in order to safeguard the safety of their aircraft and passengers,” the email said.
Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for an expanded operation in the Gaza Strip, Israeli media reported on Friday, adding to signs that attempts to stop the fighting and return hostages held by Palestinian militant group Hamas have made no progress.
Since the collapse of an earlier ceasefire agreement in March, Israeli troops have been carving out wide buffer zones in Gaza, squeezing the 2.3 million population into an ever narrower zone in the centre of the enclave and along the coast and shutting off the entry of aid trucks.
Aid groups have warned the Israeli blockade risks a humanitarian disaster.
Israel’s campaign on Gaza has laid waste to much of the enclave and so far killed more than 52,000 people, according to Gaza officials, since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 people taken hostage.

Title: Current indicators show India’s economy is doing well: CEA Nageswaran
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 07:05:15 +0000
Content: Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran on Sunday said that current indicators point to a robust Indian economy, which continues to register strong growth despite a challenging global environment.
Speaking at an event hosted by Ashoka University, Nageswaran said, “India’s economy is in good shape despite the challenging global environment. While the final numbers for FY25 will be available in May, current indicators suggest we are progressing well.”
The CEA identified energy affordability, employment generation through energy transition, and the rise of manufacturing and MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) as key priorities for sustaining economic growth. He also highlighted the role of artificial intelligence, education, and skilling in driving future development.
He stressed the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability, which involves keeping inflation in check while ensuring inclusive growth as the country moves forward.
NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery, speaking at the event, echoed a long-term vision for India to become a developed, high-income nation by 2047. He noted that India’s economic performance over the last three decades has demonstrated both institutional maturity and agility.
“India has achieved a consistent annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent over the last 30 years, which is a remarkable achievement,” Bery said. He added that global disruptions could present strategic opportunities for India to leverage its demographic dividend, technological advancements, and geopolitical positioning to boost growth.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India remains the fastest-growing major economy in the world. The April 2025 World Economic Outlook, released last month, forecasts that India’s economy will grow at 6.2 per cent in 2025 and 6.3 per cent in 2026. These figures place India well ahead of China, which is projected to grow at 4 per cent in 2025 and 4.6 per cent in 2026.
IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath noted that global growth is expected to slow to 2.8 per cent in 2025, with 127 countries, representing 86 per cent of global GDP, facing growth downgrades.
The United States, a key global economic driver, is expected to see its GDP growth moderate to 1.8 per cent in 2025, with a further decline to 1.7 per cent in 2026, the IMF report stated.

Title: India to showcase SVAMITVA scheme at World Bank Land Conference in Washington
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 06:51:02 +0000
Content: India is poised to lead the global conversation on digital land reforms and climate-aligned governance at the World Bank Land Conference 2025, being held from May 5 to 8 at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C., United States.
A high-level Indian delegation, led by Vivek Bharadwaj, Secretary, Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR), will present the country’s flagship SVAMITVA Scheme (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) and Gram Manchitra platform during the international conference, which is being attended by global policymakers, experts, and development partners.
The Indian delegation also includes Alok Prem Nagar, Joint Secretary, MoPR, Shailesh Kumar Sinha, Additional Surveyor General, Survey of India, and senior officials from the States of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.
This year’s conference, themed “Securing Land Tenure and Access for Climate Action: Moving from Awareness to Action”, aims to examine strategies for secure land tenure, the modernization of land administration, and climate-resilient planning. India’s SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) Scheme is expected to serve as a case study in the use of drone technology and geospatial data to advance rural land ownership.
According to the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, the scheme has so far issued property cards to over 24.4 million households across 1.6 lakh villages, covering more than 100 million property parcels. The initiative is estimated to have unlocked land value worth $1.162 trillion (approximately ₹100 lakh crore).
“The SVAMITVA Scheme is a path-breaking step in rural empowerment. It not only provides people with legal ownership of land but also supports planning and disaster mitigation,” said Vivek Bharadwaj, who will represent India as a Country Champion in the plenary session titled “Good Practices and Challenges in Land Tenure and Governance Reform”. The session will highlight how the scheme contributes to women’s empowerment, dispute resolution, and secure tenure rights, in alignment with SDG Target 1.4.2.
Alok Prem Nagar, Joint Secretary, MoPR, will lead a technical session on “Establishing the Land Foundation for Climate Action and Disaster Risk Management”, where India’s Gram Manchitra platform will be featured. Built on the high-resolution geospatial data generated through SVAMITVA, Gram Manchitra facilitates village-level development planning, solar energy site selection, disaster resilience, and public service delivery.
Speaking ahead of the conference, Nagar said, “Gram Manchitra exemplifies how spatial data can be used to strengthen participatory governance at the grassroots. It empowers Panchayati Raj institutions to take informed decisions with environmental and developmental foresight.”
India’s participation in the World Bank Land Conference is being seen as a major milestone in the country’s leadership on global rural land governance. In March 2025, India hosted an International Workshop on Land Governance, which drew delegates from 22 countries. The SVAMITVA initiative, in particular, received widespread interest for its digital-first, scalable model. Several nations reportedly expressed interest in adapting similar frameworks in partnership with India.
The conference in Washington features plenary sessions, regional workshops, thematic discussions, and an innovation expo, with a strong focus on promoting secure land access, geospatial technology adoption, and climate-resilient administration systems.

Title: Global economy already feeling drag from Trump tariffs
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 06:41:56 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades were greased by predictable and relatively free trade.
Big-name multinationals right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
While financial markets are betting the U.S. and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.
“U.S. tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of 10% alongside higher, sector-specific charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.
Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over 145% U.S. tariffs, to which it has responded with 125% levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.
In the meantime companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux ELUXb.ST slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars VOLCARb.ST, computer gadget maker Logitech LOGN.S and drinks giant Diageo DGE.L abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.
Last week’s removal of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.
“We’re going from zero to 145%, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy. “I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”
SILVER LINING
The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.
China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.
Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.
“(This) means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.
However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country – which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple AAPL.O has shifted some output – could end up a genuine winner.
“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.
For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy which, by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.
The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts – something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.
But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.

Title: Opportunity to invest in India’s long-term growth story is now: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 05:54:48 +0000
Content: Global brokerage Morgan Stanley has reaffirmed its positive long-term outlook on Indian equities, highlighting that India is likely to outperform in a global bear market scenario.
According to a note by the brokerage, the opportunity to invest in India’s long-term structural growth story is now, though it will require patience, given the potential.
The global financial services major believes that while near-term volatility may persist, “the long-term reward outweighs short-term noise”.
The firm advises investors to stay focused on India’s domestic growth story and selectively build exposure — particularly in domestically driven sectors —during periods of market stress.
The macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide, with risks such as decelerating global growth, central bank policy shifts, and geopolitical tensions casting a shadow.
Morgan Stanley states that these very conditions present a compelling case for India, “supported by its robust domestic fundamentals and relative insulation from global volatility”.
India offers a mix of macro stability, earnings growth, and a reliable domestic demand base that positions it as a relative safe haven in a bear market.
Morgan Stanley also favours domestic cyclicals over defensives and globally exposed sectors.
The firm holds an overweight view on financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, backed by improving credit growth, private investment recovery, and rising consumer demand.
In its another report last month, Morgan Stanley said that India is one of their preferred equity markets where macro conditions are resilient or sufficiently buffered by stimulus.
The brokerage saw a relatively resilient outlook for financials earnings, with capital ratios and the asset quality outlook in a strong position across most of its coverage. “We particularly like Financials in Singapore, India, Chile and the UAE, as well as Japan,” it added.
Key India-specific catalysts include continuing dovish actions from the RBI, stimulus through GST rate cuts and a trade deal with the US. Morgan Stanley also sees lower food inflation and lower oil prices, keeping food and non-food inflation at benign levels.

Title: Trump says he wants a fair trade deal with China
Publication Date: Mon, 05 May 2025 04:54:02 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said the U.S. was meeting with many countries, including China, on trade deals, and his main priority with China was to secure a fair trade deal.
Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had no plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, but U.S. officials were speaking with Chinese officials about a variety of different things.
Asked if any trade agreements would be announced this week, Trump said that could “very well be” but gave no details.
Trump’s top officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10% tariff on most countries, along with higher tariff rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days. He has also imposed 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145% tariffs on China.
He suggested that he did not expect to reach an agreement with some countries, but could instead be “setting a certain tariff” for those trading partners in the next two to three weeks. It was not immediately clear if he was referring to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, which are due to kick in on July 8 after a 90-day pause.
Trump repeated his claim that China had been “ripping us for many years” on global trade, adding that former President Richard Nixon’s move to reach out and establish relations with China was “the worst thing” he ever did.
Trump sounded more upbeat about China and the prospects for reaching an agreement in an interview with NBC News that was taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday.
In the interview, he acknowledged that he had been “very tough with China,” essentially cutting off trade between the world’s top two economies, but said Beijing now wanted to reach an agreement.
“We’ve gone cold turkey,” he said. “That means we’re not losing a trillion dollars … because we’re not doing business with them right now. And they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly. We’ll see how that all turns out, but it’s got to be a fair deal.”
