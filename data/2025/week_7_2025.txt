Title: New Zealand concerns mount as Cook Islands PM plans to sign agreement with China
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 06:41:59 +0000
Content: Concerns are mounting in New Zealand as the Cook Islands’ Prime Minister travels to China this week to sign agreements without properly consulting with New Zealand, despite the two nations’ constitutional ties.
New Zealand has become increasingly concerned about China’s growing presence in the Pacific region and the threats it poses to the country’s national security.
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday at a press conference New Zealand expected transparency and consultation with Cook Islands after its prime minister, Mark Brown, flagged he was heading to China seeking a partnership in national development including infrastructure, trade and the economy.
The Cook Islands is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand which provides budget support and commits to defend the South Pacific nation whose people are New Zealand citizens.
“Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, in matters of defence and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,” Luxon said.
He added that once New Zealand knew what was in the agreement, the government would decide how to respond.
New Zealand had made repeated requests to the Cook Islands to share or consult on the contents of agreements that Brown plans to sign with China but had not received a proper response, raising significant concern, deputy prime minister Winston Peter’s office said in a statement on Sunday.
“To those who suggest that our engagement with China is somehow secretive, I reject that completely,” Brown said in a video statement on Cook Islands Television News Facebook page on Friday.
“We have always conducted our international affairs with integrity and transparency. Every agreement we enter into will be in the best interest of the Cook Islands,” he said. He did not provide specifics of the agreement.
Cook Islanders have also questioned secrecy around the agreement. Tina Browne, leader of the opposition Democratic party told New Zealand based radio station 531pn that people were concerned about the lack of consultation firstly about the Cook Islands’ passportand not the agreement with China.
“If there is nothing to hide, why are we not consulting with New Zealand?” Browne said.
The Cook Islands lie halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are made up of 15 islands and atolls spread over 700 square miles (1.9 million square kilometres)
The country in 2021 had a population of 15,040.
ONGOING NEW ZEALAND RELATIONSHIP
The Cook Islands was within the New Zealand borders from 1901. In 1965, it became self governing but in free association with New Zealand. It is a realm country of New Zealand, along with Niue and Tokelau.
It has its own government and King Charles III is head of state.
Cook Islanders have New Zealand citizenship and passports. They have the same rights as a New Zealander such as the ability to work, go to school and use the medical system.
There is no Cook Islands passport or citizenship. Cook Island’s Prime Minister Mark Brown had mooted a Cook Islands passport and citizenship but backed down after New Zealand said Cook Islanders could not hold both and any change would need to be decided by referendum.
Around 94,000 Cook Islands Maori live in New Zealand and over 7,000 live in Australia.
Under the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration, the Cook Island’s is able to interact with the international community as an independent state. Any action taken in New Zealand for the foreign affairs of the Cook Islands will be at their request.
However, both New Zealand and the Cook Islands undertook in the declaration to consult regularly on foreign affairs matters, cooperate in pursuit of common foreign relation objectives and advise each other when a proposed foreign policy initiative may affect the rights, obligations and interests of the other.
It also outlines that New Zealand will continue to assist with the defence of the Cook Islands if requested and that the two countries will consult regularly on defence and security agreements.
It does not qualify for United Nations membership. In 2023, the United States recognised the Cook Islands as a sovereign and independent state.

Title: Tirupati laddu row: SIT arrests four in adulteration case
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:36:14 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested four individuals over the alleged adulteration of the sacred Tirumala temple laddu.
The arrested individuals are associated with organizations that supplied ghee, including AR Dairy (Tamil Nadu), Parag Dairy (Uttar Pradesh), Premier Agri Foods, and Alpha Milk Foods. Those arrested are Bipin Jain and Pomil Jain, former directors of Bhole Baba Dairy (Roorkee, Uttarakhand); Vaishnavi Dairy (Poonambakkam) CEO Apoorva Vinay Kant Chawda; and AR Dairy (Dundigal) MD Raju Rajasekharan.
The accused were interrogated for three days in Tirupati but were found to be uncooperative despite primary evidence of their involvement.
The SIT conducted inspections at Tirumala, Tirupati, and AR Dairy’s facility in Tamil Nadu. Investigations revealed that AR Dairy, which had a contract with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), was guilty of multiple irregularities.
According to an official release, representatives of Vaishnavi Dairy secured tenders under the name of AR Dairy for ghee supply. They allegedly fabricated false documents and seals, misusing the AR Dairy name to manipulate the tender process.
Vaishnavi Dairy also created fake records claiming to have sourced ghee from Bhole Baba Dairy in Roorkee. However, authorities found that Bhole Baba Dairy lacked the capacity to supply such large quantities of ghee.
The SIT comprises Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Hyderabad Division Joint Director Viresh Prabhu, Visakha CBI SP Muraliramba, DIG Gopinath Jetty, IG Sarvashrestha Tripathi, and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) officer Satyakumar Panda.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had alleged on September 18 that the ghee used for making Tirupati laddus during the YSR Congress Party’s rule was adulterated with animal fat, triggering outrage among devotees of the famous temple.
The state government initially constituted a SIT to probe the allegations. However, the Supreme Court later replaced it with a SIT comprising both central and state officials.
TTD uses 15,000 kg of cow ghee daily for preparing Tirumala laddus.
According to officials, AR Foods from Tamil Nadu had secured a tender to supply ghee at ₹320 per kg. On July 8, 2024, eight tankers of ghee arrived, and four of them were sent to laboratories for testing.
On July 17, NDDB Lab reports confirmed the presence of adulterants in the ghee.

Title: Paris AI summit draws world leaders and CEOs eager for technology wave
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:31:58 +0000
Content: World leaders and technology executives are convening in Paris on Monday to discuss how to safely embrace artificial intelligence at a time of mounting resistance to heavy-handed red tape that businesses say stifles innovation.
Eagerness to rein in AI has waned since previous AI summits in Britain and South Korea that focused world powers’ attention on technology’s risks after ChatGPT’s viral launch in 2022.
As U.S. President Donald Trump tears up his predecessor’s AI guardrails to promote U.S. competitiveness, pressure has built on EU policymakers to pursue a lighter-touch approach to AI to help keep European firms in the tech race.
Some EU leaders, including summit host French President Emmanuel Macron, and tech companies are hoping flexibility will be applied to the bloc’s new AI Act to help homegrown startups.
“There’s a risk some decide to have no rules and that’s dangerous. But there’s also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules,” Macron told regional French newspapers in an interview published on Friday.
“We should not be afraid of innovation,” he said.
Trump’s early moves on AI underscored how far the strategies to regulate AI in the United States, China and EU have diverged.
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. Brussels is finalising an accompanying code of practice.
Moreover, Trump’s brakes-off approach has emboldened the regulation-cautious U.S. Big Tech groups from which Europe needs to seek investment, said British think-tank Chatham House.
Meanwhile, China’s DeepSeek challenged U.S. and British AI leadership last month by freely distributing a human-like reasoning system, galvanizing geopolitical and industry rivals to race faster still.
“An unpredictable global scramble to develop AI is underway, as the U.S. turns inward and China boasts new capabilities,” Chatham House said.
Trump is not sending the U.S. AI Safety Institute to Paris, in a troubling sign to those hoping for global risk-based rules governing AI.
COMPETITIVENESS
Top political leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and China’s Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the summit. Others on the attendance list are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
Macron is due to meet with Guoqing on Monday and Vance on Tuesday, the Elysee said. The plenary session is on February 11.
Top executives such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are slated to give talks as well. Executives will partake in an invitation-only dinner with political leaders on Monday.
Google Senior Vice President James Manyika said at a press reception on Sunday that the opportunities from AI were now in “much greater focus.”
Delegations are also expected to discuss how to manage AI’s massive energy needs as the planet gets hotter, as well as AI for the developing world. A non-binding communiqué has been in progress.
Macron is eager to promote France’s national industry, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: free, “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.
Ahead of the summit, France struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates for a major AI data center representing investments of up to $50 billion.
Launching a new app with generative AI software, the CEO of Nvidia-backed French startup Mistral told Reuters: “The French and the whole world are realising that European players count and that they provide cutting-edge technology.”

Title: Operation Devil Hunt sees 1,300 arrests in nationwide crackdown on violence in Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:14:48 +0000
Content: More than 1,300 people have been arrested by security forces in Bangladesh as part of a sweeping crackdown that began on Saturday.
The nationwide operation, dubbed “Operation Devil Hunt,” was launched by the interim government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, following a wave of violent attacks on properties linked to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s family and key members of her Awami League party.
The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government ordered ‘Operation Devil Hunt’ on Saturday after the attack on students and civilians in the Gazipur district on Friday night.
Violence broke out after students and civilians were attacked in the Gazipur district on Friday night. The unrest rapidly spread across the country, with mobs targeting symbols of the Awami League, further escalating tensions between political factions.
The joint forces involved in the operation include army personnel, police, and specialised units. To date, the authorities have arrested 1,300 people in connection with the unrest and violence that has gripped the nation over the past four days.
The interim government has vowed to root out “all Devils” that are attempting to destabilise the country, emphasising its resolve to restore order as it completes its six-month tenure in power.
One of the most alarming incidents during the violence occurred when protesters set fire to the historic residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, located in the capital Dhaka. This house holds immense national significance, as it was from here that Rahman declared Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.
In response to the growing unrest, a command centre has been established to monitor and oversee the execution of ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’ The Chief Adviser’s office confirmed that the operation is in full swing, with additional efforts to ensure law and order are maintained.
Meanwhile, the Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has called on the interim government to address the growing “mob culture” and restore peace.
The BNP has warned that failing to do so could allow “fascist” forces to rise again, leading to further instability. The party has announced plans for nationwide rallies starting February 11, demanding stronger measures to address the deteriorating law and order situation, as well as a clear electoral road map.

Title: Stock market trades lower as Trump threatens new tariff on all steel, aluminium imports
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:36:29 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened lower on Monday as US President Donald Trump threatened to start imposing a new 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, including those from Canada and Mexico.
The new tariffs are expected to be imposed from Monday (US time), with additional import duties expected later in the week. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he would also announce reciprocal tariffs, which would take effect almost immediately.
At 9.30 am, Sensex was trading at 77,575.91, down 284.28 points (0.37 per cent) while the Nifty was down 87.95 points (0.37 per cent) at 23,472.00.
Rupee also weakened by 53 paise to 87.95 against the US Dollar.
Most Nifty stocks were trading lower. JSW Steel and Tata Steel declined the most after Trump threatened to slap tariffs imports on steel and aluminium.
Nifty Pharma was also down over fears that the US tariffs can spillover from metals to pharma products. Nifty Auto and Nifty PSU Bank were the only ones in green.
Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Hero MotoCorp, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank were among major gainers on the Nifty.

Title: Parliament Budget Session to resume today
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:27:15 +0000
Content: The Budget Session of Parliament will reconvene on Monday, with both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha set to meet. The session will continue discussions on the Union Budget for 2025, along with other significant matters.
One of the key highlights of the session will be the introduction of the new Income Tax Bill, which received approval from the Union Cabinet on Friday.
The Bill aims to simplify India’s direct tax laws without imposing any new tax burdens. Instead, it seeks to streamline existing provisions, removing lengthy clauses and complex language to make the legislation more accessible. The Income Tax Bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha today.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget for 2025-26 on February 1, announced the government’s intent to introduce a new Direct Tax Code. This was part of a broader commitment to review the Income Tax Act of 1961, which was first outlined in the July 2024 Union Budget.
With budget debates now in full swing, critical issues such as the new tax laws and India’s international relations are expected to dominate the discussions in the upcoming sessions, promising a lively and action-packed day in Parliament.
Earlier last week, the fifth day of the session witnessed intense debates in the Rajya Sabha, where External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar addressed concerns over the deportation of illegal Indian migrants from the United States.
Jaishankar issued a detailed statement on the matter, saying, “We are in talks with the US government to ensure that the deported individuals are not mistreated during their flight. However, it is crucial for the House to understand that our primary focus is on cracking down on the illegal migration industry while simultaneously facilitating visas for legitimate travellers.”
The minister clarified that deportation is not a new procedure and stressed the importance of addressing both legal and illegal migration issues effectively.
Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha experienced repeated adjournments due to disruptions caused by the Opposition, which focused on the deportation issue. Despite these disturbances, proceedings continued with discussions on the Union Budget and deliberations on key legislative proposals expected to be introduced during the session.
As the session progresses, lawmakers are set to tackle several national issues, with tax reform and international relations continuing to take center stage.

Title: Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:00:38 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
“And very simply, it’s, if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
“Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defence, shipbuilding and auto,” Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X.
“We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries.”
Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japan’s Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
“Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management,” Trump said of U.S. Steel.
Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump.
QUOTA QUESTIONS
Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy.
Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump’s announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
“Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to (the U.S.), that is, 60% of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China?” Francois Legault, premier of Quebec, said on X.
“All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty.”
Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80% in 2019 after Trump’s initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China’s global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals.
MATCHING RATES
Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure “that we’re treated evenly with other countries.”
The new U.S. president has long complained about the EU’s 10% tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5%. He frequently states that Europe “won’t take our cars” but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year.
The U.S., however, enjoys a 25% tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis’ U.S. operations.
The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2%, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12% for India, 6.7% for Brazil, 5.1% for Vietnam and 2.7% for European Union countries.
BORDER STEPS
In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canada’s and Mexico’s actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline.
Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless America’s two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps.
Asked whether Mexico’s and Canada’s actions were good enough, Trump replied: “No, it’s not good enough,” Trump said. “Something has to happen, it’s not sustainable, and I’m changing it.”
Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Stock market ends lower amid Trump’s new tariff plan on steel
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:17:12 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed lower on Monday, with both the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ending in the red following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The move, which includes additional reciprocal tariffs, led to selling pressure across key indices.
The Sensex declined by 548.39 points, or 0.70%, to close at 77,311.80, fluctuating between an intraday high of 77,849.58 and a low of 77,106.89. The Nifty fell by 178.35 points, or 0.76%, settling at 23,381.60 after touching a high of 23,568.60 and a low of 23,316.30.
Selling was seen across multiple sectors, pulling down benchmark indices. Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 39 ended lower. Trent, Tata Steel, and Titan registered the biggest declines, with losses up to 4.48%. Some stocks, including Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Tata Consumer Products, and HCL Tech, ended higher with gains up to 1.74%.
Broader markets followed the same trend. The Nifty Smallcap100 and Nifty Midcap100 indices fell by 2.12% and 2.11%, respectively. Volatility remained high, with the India VIX rising by 5.55 points to 14.45. All sectoral indices on the NSE closed lower.
Analysts indicated that concerns over the implementation of new US tariffs may contribute to further market fluctuations. The Nifty continues to decline after forming a lower top on the daily chart, according to Rupak De from LKP Securities. Weak global cues and Trump’s tariff announcement also weighed on investor sentiment, said Vikram Kasat from PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher.
Gold prices saw an increase, surpassing Rs 85,800 on MCX and reaching $2,900 in spot markets. Analysts attributed this to growing trade concerns, suggesting that gold may remain in a positive range of Rs 84,000-Rs 86,500 in the coming days.

Title: Om Birla urges Maharashtra legislators to embrace constitutional values and foster constructive debates
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:00:17 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday emphasized that the Constitution of India is more than just a legal document—it is a source of inspiration for the citizens of the country.
Birla made the remarks while inaugurating an orientation programme for newly elected members of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and Council in New Delhi.
Addressing the gathering, he said, “Laws should be made for the nation and to drive socio-economic change. Our Constitution is not just a document; it serves as an inspiration for all of us.”
He congratulated Rahul Narwekar on being re-elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, stating that he will again have the opportunity to fulfill his parliamentary responsibilities.
Birla emphasized that an elected representative’s role goes beyond addressing challenges in their constituency. “They must also consider the high expectations of the people and their role in shaping social change,” he said.
He urged legislators to study the laws passed in the Assembly, noting that both in Parliament and state legislatures, attendance has been declining.
“It is not right to deliberately create disruptions in a planned manner in Parliament or legislatures,” he remarked.
He stressed the importance of meaningful discussions in the House, where both agreement and disagreement should take place constructively to guide the government effectively.
“The Question Hour is the most crucial time. Questions should be raised with full preparation. When a law is being made, members should refer to past debates and gain a complete understanding of the legislation. The role of legislators is to provide guidance to the government,” he added.
Birla urged members to ensure longer participation in Assembly proceedings, actively listening and contributing to discussions.

Title: JP Nadda launches nationwide MDA campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:27:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Jagat Prakash Nadda on Monday launched the Annual Nationwide Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Campaign for the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) through a video conference with State Health Ministers from 13 identified LF-endemic states. The event outlined the objectives of the campaign, key strategic activities, and the critical role of participating states in ensuring high coverage and compliance with the MDA program.
The MDA campaign, which targets 111 endemic districts across 13 states, involves a door-to-door administration of filaria prevention medications. The states that participated in the event included Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, with each health minister emphasizing the importance of the campaign in their respective regions.
Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and disfiguring disease. It is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea that are transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos.
Speaking at the launch, Nadda stressed the government’s commitment to eliminating LF, emphasizing the necessity of active community involvement and participation in the campaign. He stated, “An LF-free India is our commitment, and achieving this goal requires the participation of every citizen. With active community involvement, we can eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and ensure protection for crores.”
Highlighting the importance of the campaign, Nadda said that LF, commonly referred to as “Hathi Paon,” is a debilitating disease that can cause severe physical disabilities, such as swelling of the limbs and scrotal swelling, which places a significant burden on affected individuals and families. The MDA campaign, led by the National Center for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC), is designed to address this issue by providing free anti-filarial medications to over 17.5 crore people across the endemic regions.
The Union Minister emphasized that the MDA campaign, conducted twice a year, must ensure that at least 90% of the eligible population consumes the prescribed medication to halt the transmission of the disease. He urged the states to actively monitor the campaign and ensure that no one is left out. “From February 10 onwards, these medicines will be made available free of cost, and it is imperative that residents in these areas consume the medicines to protect themselves and their families,” he said.
Nadda also emphasized the importance of a “whole-of-government” approach, engaging various ministries and departments to support the campaign’s activities. He praised the use of digital technologies by states such as Uttar Pradesh and Odisha in enhancing awareness and extending the reach of the campaign.
He stressed the role of political leadership at the state and district levels to mobilize communities and ensure effective implementation. Nadda urged State Health Ministers to involve elected representatives, including Members of Parliament, Legislative Assemblies, and Panchayati Raj Institutions, to garner widespread participation and awareness.
He also mentioned that approximately 50% of lymphoedema cases receive MMDP kits annually and that surgeries for hydrocele (a common complication of LF) are available under the National Health Mission (NHM) and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
The MDA campaign aims to eliminate LF by reducing the spread of the disease, primarily through the administration of a combination of anti-filarial medicines. The regimen includes either a Double Drug (DA) treatment of Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) and Albendazole or a Triple Drug (IDA) treatment of Ivermectin, DEC, and Albendazole. These medications help eliminate the microscopic filarial parasites from the bloodstream, preventing further transmission through mosquitoes.

Title: South Korea spy agency says DeepSeek ‘excessively’ collects personal data
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 09:03:02 +0000
Content: South Korea’s spy agency has accused Chinese AI app DeepSeek of “excessively” collecting personal data and using all input data to train itself, and questioned the app’s responses to questions relating to issues of national pride.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app.
“Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies’ servers such as volceapplog.com,” the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday.
Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app, citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek.
The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users’ data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added.
DeepSeek also provided different answers to potentially sensitive questions in different languages, the NIS noted.
It cited one such question as asking for the origin of kimchi – a spicy, fermented dish that is a staple in South Korea.
When asked about it in Korean, the app said kimchi is a Korean dish, the NIS said.
Asked the same question in Chinese, it said the dish originated from China, it said. DeepSeek’s responses were corroborated by Reuters.
The origin of kimchi has at times been a source of contention between South Koreans and Chinese social media users in recent years.
DeepSeek has also been accused of censoring responses to political questions such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, which prompt the app to suggest changing the subject: “Let’s talk about something else.”
DeepSeek did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.When asked about moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law.
The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.

Title: Gold prices at record high as investors seek safety amid trade war concerns
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:44:46 +0000
Content: Gold prices on Monday surged to new record highs in the domestic futures market as uncertainty over the US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies increased demand for the yellow metal as a safe-haven investment.
According to the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, the price of 24-carat gold was Rs 8,537 per gram, while 22-carat gold was Rs 8,332 per gram.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for April 4 expiry touched an all-time high of Rs 85,384 per 10 grams in early trade.
The same contract was trading 0.51 per cent higher at Rs 85,325 per 10 grams.
In the international market, gold prices also remained near record levels due to growing fears of a global trade war. Last week, spot gold reached a new peak of $2,886.62 per ounce.
The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s latest trade decisions has pushed investors towards gold, which is traditionally considered a safe investment during times of economic and geopolitical instability.
Trump plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.
He was expected to make a formal announcement later on Monday (US time). Trump may introduce additional tariffs on several countries.
The trade policies have raised concerns about inflation in the US, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates in the near future.
Meanwhile, the gold reserves in India went up by $1.242 billion to $70.893 billion in the previous week, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
The apex bank said that the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were also up by $29 million to $17.889 billion.
Meanwhile, the rupee opened at a record low with falling by 49 paise to 87.92 against the US dollar on Monday, compared to its closing value of 87.43 on Friday.

Title: New Income Tax Bill to raise transparency in tax laws, say experts
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:32:02 +0000
Content: The government is preparing to introduce a new Income Tax Bill aimed at simplifying tax laws and improving compliance. The bill is expected to use clear language to help taxpayers understand their obligations and rights.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the bill this week, after which it will be referred to the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance for review. The proposed changes align with the government’s approach of placing trust in taxpayers before initiating scrutiny. Various stakeholders expect revisions compared to the existing income tax framework.
One of the anticipated changes is a simpler method for determining tax residency. The current system involves multiple conditions to qualify an individual as a tax resident. The bill is also expected to eliminate outdated provisions to reduce the overall complexity of tax regulations.
While the bill does not propose new taxes, it focuses on making tax compliance easier. It may also allow tax reliefs or amendments without waiting for the annual budget, enabling the government to implement changes through executive orders.
The proposal includes measures to limit scrutiny to cases of gross non-compliance, reducing unnecessary interactions between taxpayers and authorities. This is expected to lower litigation and make compliance more straightforward.
The ongoing review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, aims to modernize India’s tax system in line with economic objectives. It seeks to improve business operations, provide clarity in interpretations, and enhance tax administration. These reforms are expected to increase the tax-GDP ratio and support economic growth.
Sandeep Chaufla, Partner at Price Waterhouse and Co (PwC), said that the bill is part of a broader effort to streamline tax processes and improve efficiency.

Emphasizing the changing nature of warfare, Singh underscored the need for continuous advancements in defence technology.
“The use of drones in recent conflicts indicates that future warfare will rely on an integrated approach involving manned, unmanned, and autonomous systems,” he said.
He also noted a shift from hardware-based systems to software-driven solutions, with growing reliance on space-based communication, navigation, and surveillance systems.
Singh reiterated India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“We have taken numerous initiatives to strengthen domestic defence manufacturing. In these challenging times, where global security is fragile and technology is reshaping the battlefield, this Round Table provides an opportunity to deliberate on new processes and innovations,” he said.
The Minister also highlighted India’s emergence as a major defence exporter, citing a 31-fold increase in defence exports over the past decade compared to 2013-14.
To further streamline exports, Singh said the Defence Exim portal has simplified the authorization process, making it easier for Indian manufacturers to reach global markets.
Earlier in the day, Singh inaugurated Aero India 2025, Asia’s premier aerospace exhibition, at Yelahanka Air Force Station, Bengaluru. Comparing the event to the grand Mahakumbh Mela, he described it as a symbol of India’s strength and resilience in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
“On one hand, Prayagraj’s Mahakumbh reflects India’s cultural heritage and self-respect. On the other, Aero India is a Mahakumbh of research, courage, and armaments. While Prayagraj strengthens our spiritual traditions, Aero India strengthens our military and technological capabilities,” he remarked.
Underscoring the importance of a strong military, Singh asserted that peace cannot be ensured through weakness.
“Only by becoming stronger can India contribute to a better world order,” he stated.
With its 15th edition, Aero India 2025 is set to showcase India’s growing defence capabilities, featuring participation from global defence leaders, manufacturers, and policymakers.

Title: IIT Roorkee team finds superbug’s defense mechanism, to boost new treatments
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:27:47 +0000
Content: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee have uncovered a crucial regulatory mechanism in Acinetobacter baumannii—a highly drug-resistant superbug responsible for life-threatening infections.
Their study, published in the journal mBio, reveals how the pathogen regulates its virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms, paving the way for new treatment strategies.
Acinetobacter baumannii poses a serious threat in healthcare settings due to its ability to resist multiple antibiotics. It causes severe hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
To attack competing microbes, the superbug uses the Type 6 Secretion System (T6SS)—a bacterial secretion system that functions like a molecular weapon. However, how A. baumannii regulates its antibiotic resistance has remained unclear until now.
The research team, led by Prof. Ranjana Pathania, discovered that A. baumannii switches T6SS on or off based on environmental conditions. They found that a small RNA molecule, AbsR28, plays a key role in this regulation, influenced by manganese levels.
When manganese levels are high, AbsR28 binds to an essential gene (tssM) required for T6SS function. This not only leads to its degradation but also prevents the activation of T6SS, the researchers explained.
Increased manganese levels also enable A. baumannii to retain plasmid pAB3, which carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes.
“The study found that activating T6SS makes A. baumannii more susceptible to antibiotics and oxidative stress. So, the bacteria must carefully regulate this system to survive in different conditions,” said Prof. Pathania.
“Our discovery sheds light on how this pathogen adapts during infections, helping it evade both antibiotics and the immune system,” she added.
The findings suggest that targeting AbsR28 could disrupt the superbug’s regulatory system, making it more susceptible to antibiotics without directly attacking resistance genes. The discovery opens new avenues for precision medicine and novel drug development against multidrug-resistant infections.

Title: Students across the globe tune in to ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ as PM Modi guides youth on exam stress
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:51:18 +0000
Content: Students from Indian schools worldwide tuned in to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s highly anticipated Pariksha Pe Charcha (PPC) 2025 on Monday, as the interactive session continued to inspire young minds with its focus on stress-free learning, exam preparation, and holistic education.
The eighth edition of the initiative saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents across countries, including Japan, Australia, Nepal, Bhutan, Kenya, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. The event, designed to address exam-related anxieties and promote a positive academic outlook, was streamed live across multiple platforms, enabling students globally to engage with the Prime Minister’s insights on stress management, leadership, and personal growth.
Global Engagement in ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’
In Japan, students from India International School and Global Indian International School, alongside officials from the Indian Embassy in Tokyo, joined the event. A special screening was held at the Indian High Commission in Canberra, Australia, while in Bangladesh, Indian students and parents attended a live telecast organized by the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
Bhutan also witnessed strong participation, with students, parents, and teachers gathering at Thimphu’s Nehru–Wangchuck Cultural Centre to watch the session. The Indian Embassy in Bhutan later shared on social media that the discussion provided invaluable guidance on stress-free exams, leadership, and holistic learning.
In Nepal, Kendriya Vidyalaya Kathmandu, Modern School Kathmandu, and other CBSE institutions streamed the event, with students, teachers, and Indian Embassy officials in attendance. Meanwhile, in Qatar, dozens of Indian schools facilitated live screenings, offering students and parents the opportunity to learn directly from PM Modi’s insights on handling academic pressure.
Saudi Arabia saw thousands of Indian students from leading CBSE schools—including International Indian Schools in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Taif, Buraidah, and Majmaah—participate in the programme. Delhi Public School, International Indian Public School, and Yara International also took part. The Indian High Commission complemented the session with a special chair yoga exercise.
Kenya hosted a similar initiative, where the Indian High Commission organized a special screening of the event, followed by a yoga session to promote mindfulness and stress relief.
PM Modi’s Message
During the session, PM Modi interacted with students from classes 6 to 12, offering practical advice on managing stress, improving concentration, and preparing for exams with confidence. His motivational guidance resonated deeply with students, parents, and educators worldwide, many of whom expressed appreciation for his thoughtful approach to education and personal development.
The initiative also found strong support in India, particularly in Bihar, where students shared their reflections on the event.
Atif Akhtar, a Class 9 student, found the Prime Minister’s words especially impactful, noting how exam stress often stems from societal expectations. “The Prime Minister said students should never be under stress. Many children fear what their parents or teachers will think if they don’t score well, and this pressure affects their performance,” he said.
Drawing a parallel between exams and sports, Atif said, “A batsman doesn’t lose focus even when the crowd expects a six or a four. If he starts thinking about their expectations, he will get out. The same applies to students—they should stay focused and not let external pressure distract them.”
PM Modi also reassured students that marks are not the sole determinant of success, encouraging them to pursue their passions and long-term career goals.
Another key takeaway from the session was the Prime Minister’s emphasis on maintaining a nutritious diet. Urging students to avoid junk food, he highlighted the importance of eating traditional Indian meals, similar to those of farmers. Atif supported this advice, stating, “The Prime Minister is absolutely right. Fast food harms our health, whereas a farmer’s diet keeps them strong and healthy.”
Zeenat, a Class 8 student, appreciated PM Modi’s focus on balancing studies with enjoyment. “What I learned today is that life should be enjoyed in every moment. Exams should not be a source of stress. Parents should also understand their children’s hobbies instead of forcing them to study in isolation,” she said.
PM Modi further stressed the role of meditation and mindfulness in improving focus and reducing distractions. His words encouraged students to approach their academic journey with confidence, positivity, and self-discipline.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Gabbard clears Senate hurdle, heads to confirmation as top US spy
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:30:46 +0000
Content: The U.S. Senate voted on Monday to advance the nomination of former Representative Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, continuing President Donald Trump’s successful push to confirm even his most at-risk nominees for administration positions.
The Senate voted 52-46 on a procedural measure to limit debate on the closely watched nomination, more than the simple majority needed to clear the way for the 100-member chamber to vote on her confirmation later this week.
The vote was on party lines, with every Republican favoring advancing Gabbard’s nomination, while Democrats opposed it.
Trump’s fellow Republicans have rallied behind Gabbard, despite doubts about the 43-year-old former Democrat’s lack of significant intelligence experience and past statements seen as supporting U.S. adversaries.
The Senate Intelligence Committee last week recommended Gabbard’s nomination for consideration by the full Senate by a narrow 9-8 vote, also along party lines.
Urging support for her nomination, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Gabbard for agreeing to pare back the size of the DNI’s office, as the Trump administration wages a campaign to slash the size of many government agencies.
“I look forward to confirming Gabbard this week,” Thune said.
Some senators had questioned the choice of Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who has never served on an intelligence committee, for the position overseeing all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies after Trump announced the pick last year.
They expressed doubts about past statements seen as sympathetic toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and defense of the government of former Syria leader Bashar al-Assad, whom she visited in Syria while he was under U.S. sanction.
“Tulsi Gabbard is a walking five-alarm fire, and must be rejected, must be,” Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said in a Senate speech after the procedural vote.
At her confirmation hearing, Gabbard faced pointed questioning from senators from both parties about her past defense of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and comments seen as supportive of Russia.
While in the House of Representatives, Gabbard introduced legislation that would have dropped criminal charges against Snowden, who leaked thousands of highly classified National Security Agency documents, fled to China and then sought asylum in Russia.
Republicans more recently have praised Gabbard for now saying she would prosecute leakers and discounted concerns about her past statements about Russia and Syria.
When the 100-member Senate votes on her confirmation in a vote expected very early on Wednesday morning, Gabbard cannot afford to lose the support of more than three Republicans to still be confirmed, if Democrats remain united against her.

Laying out foundation of India’s energy ambitions, the Prime Minister said they rest on five pillars — abundant resources, brilliant minds, economic strength, political stability, strategic geography, and a commitment to global sustainability.
“The next two decades are crucial for achieving the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’, and in the next five years, we will accomplish several milestones. Many of our energy goals align with the 2030 deadline,” he said.
PM Modi outlined key targets for 2030, including the addition of 500 gigawatts of energy capacity, achieving net-zero carbon emissions for Indian Railways, and expanding green hydrogen production.
“Over the last 10 years, India has become the fifth-largest economy, doubled its solar generation capacity, and emerged as the third-largest solar power-generating nation. Our non-fossil fuel energy capacity has tripled,” he noted.
Citing India’s leadership in sustainability, the Prime Minister highlighted that India is the first country to meet the Paris G20 agreement goals, achieving a 90 percent ethanol blending rate and making significant progress in biofuels.
“India’s biofuels industry is set for rapid growth, backed by 500 million metric tons of sustainable feedstock. The Global Biofuels Alliance, established during India’s G20 presidency, continues to expand, now comprising 28 nations and 12 international organisations. This initiative is transforming waste into wealth and creating Centers of Excellence,” he said.
Discussing India’s strides in hydrocarbon resources, PM Modi mentioned key policy initiatives such as the Open Acreage License Policy (OALP), the opening of the exclusive economic zone, and the implementation of a single-window clearance system to attract investment.
He also highlighted efforts to empower ordinary families and farmers as energy providers.
“Last year, the government launched the PM Suryodaya Mukt Bijli Yojana. This scheme goes beyond energy production; it fosters new skills in the solar sector, builds a new service ecosystem, and enhances investment opportunities,” he said.
Reaffirming India’s commitment to sustainable energy, PM Modi expressed confidence that India Energy Week would foster innovation in the sector
“India is dedicated to providing energy solutions that drive our growth while preserving nature. I hope this Energy Week brings new ideas and solutions for a sustainable future,” he added.

Title: Govt strengthens workplace safety, financial support and maternity benefits for women
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:11:39 +0000
Content: The central government has taken significant steps to create a safe, secure, and non-discriminatory work environment for women. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, under the Companies Act, 2013, has introduced various measures to enhance workplace inclusivity and protection.
The Act mandates that every listed company and public company with a paid-up share capital of ₹100 crore or more, or a turnover of ₹300 crore or more, must appoint at least one woman director. Additionally, companies are required to confirm compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, in their Board Reports, which are filed annually with financial statements.
The Act also mandates the formation of an Internal Complaints Committee for organizations with ten or more employees and a Local Committee for smaller workplaces or cases involving the employer.
Financial and Entrepreneurial Support
Under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises, women entrepreneurs receive additional benefits compared to others. The Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) offers higher subsidies to women beneficiaries, encouraging their participation in small businesses. The Stand-Up India Scheme further facilitates loans between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or woman borrower per bank branch to support the establishment of new businesses.
To promote entrepreneurship among women, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III towns, the Yashasvini initiative was launched on June 27 last year, focusing on capacity-building and financial empowerment.
Maternity Benefits and Childcare Support
The government has implemented significant measures to support working mothers, ensuring maternity benefits and promoting gender equality in workplaces. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, mandates that establishments with fifty or more employees provide creche facilities, enabling women to continue working while ensuring proper care for their children.
Additionally, the Palna scheme, introduced in April 2022, offers centrally sponsored daycare services for children of working mothers, creating a supportive ecosystem that helps women balance their professional and personal responsibilities.
Strengthening Protection Against Workplace Harassment
In a major step towards addressing workplace harassment, the government launched a revamped version of the Sexual Harassment electronic-Box (SHe-Box) on August 29 last year. This centralized complaint portal provides a single-window grievance redressal mechanism for women across both organized and unorganized sectors.

However, the ministry does not track the number of individuals benefiting indirectly from the free meals.
The Seva Bhoj Yojana follows a structured process to ensure transparency and accountability in fund utilization. Institutions must first register on the NGO Darpan Portal of NITI Aayog before enrolling on the CSMS Portal of the Ministry of Culture. After enrollment, the institution submits its application and registration certificate to the Nodal Central Tax Officer in their respective State or Union Territory. The Nodal Central Tax Officer verifies the documents and issues a Unique Identity Number (UIN) to the applicant. The concerned GST Authority then reviews and verifies the CGST and IGST reimbursement claims before forwarding them to the Ministry of Culture, which provides funds to the GST Authority for disbursement to the eligible institutions.
The cultural ministry has been actively promoting the Seva Bhoj Yojana through official websites, social media platforms, and other communication channels to ensure that all eligible charitable and religious organizations, across various communities, benefit from the scheme.

Title: NITI Aayog launches policy report on strengthening State Public Universities
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:16:28 +0000
Content: A policy report offering insights into the standards of state public universities across India was released by NITI Aayog on Monday.
Titled Expanding Quality Higher Education through States and State Public Universities, the report was launched by Suman Bery, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, alongside CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam and other senior officials.
According to NITI Aayog, this first-of-its-kind document provides a comprehensive analysis of key indicators such as quality, funding, governance, and employability trends in state public universities (SPUs) over the past decade.
The report draws on extensive stakeholder consultations, involving higher education officials from over 20 states and union territories, vice-chancellors from 50 SPUs, and leaders from state higher education councils.
Speaking at the launch, Bery emphasized the importance of SPUs in setting high academic standards, drawing comparisons with public universities in countries like the U.S. and Brazil. He reiterated NITI Aayog’s role in research and evidence-building, while implementation falls under the purview of central and state ministries.
Dr. Vinod Kumar Paul, Member (Education), linked the report’s findings to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and India’s vision for ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’. He stressed that since 80% of India’s higher education takes place in SPUs, strengthening them is essential for human capital development.
Subrahmanyam highlighted that by 2035, NEP 2020 aims to double higher education enrollment to nearly nine crore students, with around seven crore studying in SPUs. He underscored the urgency for these universities to shift from merely providing access to education to delivering world-class academic standards.
Secretary of the Department of Higher Education, Vineet Joshi, pointed to recent budget initiatives such as the selection of 10,000 PM Research Fellows, the expansion of second-generation IITs, and the Bharatiya Bhasha textbook scheme to promote regional language education. He also noted the allocation of ₹13,000 crore under PM-USHA from 2023-24 to 2025-26, with ₹100 crore designated per SPU for their transformation into Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
Dr. Pankaj Mittal, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), highlighted that the report addresses three major challenges identified by vice chancellors: funding constraints, governance reforms, and capacity building for faculty and administrators.
The report provides nearly 80 policy recommendations with short, medium, and long-term implementation strategies. It outlines steps to improve research quality, pedagogy, and curriculum, strengthen governance frameworks, increase industry-academia collaboration, and enhance financial sustainability.

Title: Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:05:00 +0000
Content: A consortium led by Elon Musk said on Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire’s fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm.
Musk’s bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the ChatGPT maker at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”
Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House.
OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.
Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure.
Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.
“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement on Monday. “We will make sure that happens.”
Altman told staff in a message that the company’s board of directors intends to make clear it has no interest in Musk’s “supposed bid”, according to a report by The Information on Monday.
Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Emanuel Capital and others.
xAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Musk’s offer earlier on Monday. xAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters.
‘THROWING A WRENCH’
“This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,” said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance.
“The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it’s a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit.”
OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January.
Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.
Musk’s stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of X, which was then called Twitter, in 2022.
To finance such a bid, Musk could sell part of his stake in Tesla or take a loan against his stake, or use his stake in rocket company SpaceX that is worth tens of billions of dollars as collateral, according to an uninvolved investment banker, who requested anonymity.
“Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.
“The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors … OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.”

Title: India in AI Action Summit in France: Global Talks, Local Impact
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:00:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to co-host the AI Action Summit in France, marking the third summit in this series, following previous editions held in the UK in 2023 and South Korea in 2024. With recent developments in AI, such as the release of Deepseek’s disruptive AI version and extensive commitments made by US President Trump for AI innovation and development, it becomes imperative to understand how AI directly impacts people’s lives.
A detailed examination of the real concerns surrounding AI taking away jobs, and why the world is racing to advance AI, must be provided for a more realistic perspective.
What is the AI Action Summit and what is at stake for its hosts?
The AI Action Summit is the latest event in a series of global dialogues focused on AI governance. This year, the summit is being held in France, co-hosted by Prime Minister Modi and President Macron. The summit’s objectives center around tech sovereignty, the development of environmentally friendly AI, AI accessibility, and global governance.
Macron has repeatedly emphasized the importance of “tech sovereignty” at the heart of this summit, which is especially significant as the USA and China, two giants in the field, compete for a dominant position in the AI landscape.
For India and France, both of which have tremendous potential for technological innovation and application, this summit provides an opportunity to recalibrate how the world views AI advancements.
Macron has advocated for over $100 billion in AI investments, while India has its own AI mission and is recognized globally for its ability to drive scientific innovations at a fraction of the cost. Consequently, France and India position themselves as leaders in the AI revolution with a global perspective, offering alternatives to the currently dominant forces.
Impact of AI on daily lives and the significance of such summits
From recommendations on social media to self-driving cars, AI is embedded in a dense network of applications that shape daily life. AI can be understood as algorithms designed to simulate human intelligence. Often perceived as a high-end technology that will disrupt markets and societal functioning, AI should instead be viewed as a technology that enhances human capacity, supplementing human intelligence rather than replacing it.
Just as the Industrial Revolution reshaped economic balances, AI now sits at the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While it is inevitable that AI will transform labor markets, it will also generate new jobs and open new markets. McKinsey Global estimates that AI will create around 50 million jobs by 2030, leading to increased demand for AI specialists.
With automation and AI assistance, new avenues for exploration will emerge. Summits like the AI Action Summit help establish a global framework for AI development and application, redefine public-private partnerships, and ensure an equitable and just future in the context of technology.
These summits promote dialogue on the scope of AI’s development while providing a global platform to discuss its applications. As society and industry learn to grow with AI, these summits ensure its adoption is fair, effective, and sustainable.
What to expect in the future for India?
India’s leadership role in global technology governance is underscored by its co-chairmanship of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. The country has already announced its own AI model and is working on the India AI Mission, launched in March 2024.
The AI model begins with a computational facility of roughly 10,000 GPUs, with 8,693 more GPUs to be added. While global models’ computational costs range from $2.5 to $3 per hour, India’s AI model will cost less than half that after a 40% government subsidy.
In 2024, India also hosted the Global IndiaAI Summit, marking a significant milestone in the country’s AI journey, bringing together over 12,000 global AI experts, practitioners, and delegates from 50 countries.
With one of the youngest populations and a leader in trained technologists, India stands as one of the most fertile grounds for the future of AI’s advancement. According to BCG, India’s AI market is growing at a CAGR of 25-35% and is projected to reach around $17 billion by 2027.
With its vast talent pool, growing digital infrastructure, and government initiatives India stands at the helm of this revolution. As PM Modi has iterated, AI in India does not stand just for artificial intelligence but also for Aspirational India.
Therefore, The AI Action Summit represents a pivotal moment in shaping the global AI landscape. Co-hosted by India and France, this summit not only showcases the countries’ leadership in AI development but also emphasizes the importance of tech sovereignty, responsible governance, and equitable access.
As AI continues to impact daily life from job creation to market disruption the summit’s discussions on its ethical and sustainable deployment are vital. India’s focus on affordable AI and its growing influence in global technology governance strengthens its position in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Moving forward, these global dialogues will ensure that AI’s benefits are shared universally, while mitigating its challenges, thus fostering a future where technology shapes society in a sustainable manner, a future where technology is for all.

Title: Union Budget 2025-26 prioritizes Women and Child Development with 37.25% rise in allocations
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 12:05:26 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Annpurna Devi, announced that the Union Budget 2025-26 has significantly prioritised women and child development, with a 37.25% increase in funding compared to the previous year. The allocation for women’s welfare has risen to Rs. 4.49 lakh crore, highlighting the government’s strengthened financial commitment to gender-focused initiatives.
The Gender Budget, which directs resources toward programs benefiting women and girls, now constitutes 8.86% of the total budget, up from 6.8% in the 2024-25 fiscal year, reflecting a stronger emphasis on women’s empowerment and child development.
Annapurna Devi outlined the specifics of these allocations during a press briefing in New Delhi. The increase in funds will be directed toward several critical areas, particularly maternal and child nutrition and women’s entrepreneurship. The Minister stressed that 81.79% of the Women and Child Development Ministry’s budget will go toward gender-based initiatives, underscoring the government’s focus on improving outcomes for women and children.
One of the major areas of focus in the new budget is tackling malnutrition. The Suposhit Panchayat Scheme, launched in late 2024, aims to improve health and nutrition outcomes at the grassroots level by recognizing Gram Panchayats that perform well in these areas. The Minister also announced that the 7th Poshan Pakhwada, scheduled for March 2025, will emphasize key themes like nutrition during the First 1,000 Days of Life and addressing childhood obesity.
While the increased budget for women’s welfare was a highlight, concerns remain about the actual implementation of these programs. Critics have pointed out that despite consistent budget increases in recent years, ground-level challenges—such as the quality of services in anganwadis and accessibility of healthcare for rural women—still persist.
The government’s flagship Beti Bachao Beti Padhao program, aimed at promoting gender equality, was also celebrated during the budget announcement, with over 1,342 events held across the country. However, there are continuing calls for more transparency in how funds are utilized for such large-scale programs, which have faced criticism in the past for focusing too much on awareness campaigns without addressing structural gender disparities.

Title: Vance warns Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:32:46 +0000
Content: U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned Europeans on Tuesday that what he called their excessive regulation of artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian censorship.” 
The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant. 
Vance, forthright in setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory approach. 
“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance told an AI summit in Paris. 
“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,” he added.
Vance said that navigating Europe’s online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms. 
The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration would ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry’s biggest players. 
While Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI — which big players develop — he said, “Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.” He added that the world should be skeptical when incumbents call for safety regulations that could entrench their powerful status. 
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. 
On the summit’s first day, host French President Emmanuel Macron urged Europe to cut red tape to make it easier for AI to flourish in the region, after the Trump administration’s unwinding of AI guardrails laid bare how far strategies towards AI in the United States, China and Europe have diverged. 
Vance is leading the American delegation at the summit, where representatives of nearly 100 countries including China, India and the United States will meet to determine if competing national interests can be reconciled.

Title: Sensex, Nifty plunge over 1% amid US tariff concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:19:41 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market extended its losing streak on Tuesday, with both Sensex and Nifty closing significantly lower as investor sentiment took a hit following the latest tariff measures announced by former US President Donald Trump.
At the closing bell, Sensex dropped by 1,018.20 points, or 1.32%, settling at 76,293.60. During the trading session, the index fluctuated between a high of 77,387.28 and a low of 76,030.59. Similarly, the Nifty ended the day down by 309.80 points, or 1.32%, closing at 23,071.80, after touching an intraday high of 23,390.05 and a low of 22,986.65.
The sell-off was widespread, with 44 out of the 50 Nifty stocks finishing in the red. Eicher Motors, Apollo Hospitals, Shriram Finance, Coal India, and Bharat Electronics led the losses, declining up to 6.7%. In contrast, only six stocks—Adani Enterprises, Trent, Grasim, Bharti Airtel, and Hindalco—managed to stay in positive territory, with gains of up to 0.76%.
Broader markets faced even sharper declines, with the Nifty Smallcap 100 falling 3.45% and the Nifty Midcap 100 losing 3.02%. Sectoral indices across the board ended in negative territory, with the PSU Bank, Auto, Healthcare, Realty, and Media indices registering losses of up to 3.28%. Sectors such as IT, FMCG, and consumer durables also ended lower by over 1% each.
The sell-off was fueled by concerns over the impact of US tariffs on global trade. Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports has raised fears of trade disruptions, with India among the affected economies. The Indian Steel Association (ISA) has urged the government to push for the removal of longstanding anti-dumping and countervailing duties while seeking exemptions from these restrictive measures. ISA warned that the latest tariffs could reduce steel exports to the US by 85%, potentially flooding the domestic market with surplus supply.
Market analysts believe that investors should focus on hedging and diversification strategies in the current volatile scenario. “The concerns around impending trade wars and countermeasures could impact India. Investors should seek fresh opportunities in this bear market and plan their moves accordingly,” said VLA Ambala, SEBI-registered research analyst and co-founder of Stock Market Today.
Adding to market woes, continued foreign portfolio outflows and weak domestic economic growth have weighed on investor sentiment. The recent interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also failed to provide much relief amid heightened global uncertainty.

Title: World must pull together resources and talent for AI: PM Modi in Paris
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:03:01 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform millions of lives by advancing key sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and education, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.
Addressing the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, PM Modi highlighted that AI can accelerate progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making the journey “easier and faster.”
He urged the global community to pool resources and talent to harness AI’s full potential for the greater good.
“We must build quality data sets free from biases. We must democratize technology and create people-centric applications. We must address concerns related to cyber security, disinformation and deepfakes. We must also ensure that technology is rooted in local ecosystems for it to be effective and useful. Loss of jobs is AI’s most feared disruption, but history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, its nature changes and new types of jobs are created. We need to invest in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future,” PM Modi said.
Expressing gratitude to French President Emmanuel Macron for hosting the AI Action Summit and inviting him to co-chair the summit. He said that AI is developing at an “unprecedented scale and speed” and being adapted and developed even faster.
PM Modi said, “I am grateful to my friend President Macron for hosting this summit and for inviting me to co-chair it. AI is already reshaping our polity, our economy, our security and even our society. AI is writing the code for humanity in this century. But, it is very different from other technology milestones in human history. AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed and being adapted and deployed even faster. There is also a deep interdependence across borders.”
PM Modi said that the world must think deeply and discuss openly about innovation and governance and emphasised that governance is also about ensuring access to all, particularly in the Global South.
Stressing the need for collective global efforts to establish governance, he said, “Governance is not just about managing risks and rivalries; it is about promoting innovation and making technology accessible, particularly in the Global South, where resources such as computing power, talent, and data are limited.”

Title: Netanyahu says Israel will end Gaza ceasefire if hostages not returned on Saturday
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:35:36 +0000
Content: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday a fragile ceasefire in Gaza would end and the Israeli army would resume its offensive in the Palestinian enclave until the militant group is defeated.
“In light of Hamas’ announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I ordered the IDF to gather forces inside and around the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu said, speaking after a meeting of his security cabinet.
“This operation is being carried out at this time. It will be completed in the very near future,” he said in a statement.
Hamas has begun releasing some hostages gradually under the first phase of a ceasefire reached last month, but said on Monday it would not free any more until further notice, accusing Israel of violating the terms with several deadly shootings as well as hold-ups of some aid deliveries in Gaza.
U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Israel, said in response that Hamas should release all the hostages held by the Palestinian militant group by midday on Saturday or he would propose cancelling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.
“If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon – the ceasefire will end and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,” Netanyahu said.
It was not immediately clear if he meant the return of hostages who would be due to be released on Saturday, or all of those still held in the Palestinian enclave.
A Hamas official said on Tuesday that Israeli hostages could be brought home only if the ceasefire was respected, dismissing the “language of threats” after Trump said he would “let hell break out” if they were not freed.
“Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the (Israeli) prisoners. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
Israel denies holding back aid supplies and says it has fired on people who disregard warnings not to approach Israeli troop positions.
Netanyahu vowed earlier that Israel would ensure all its hostages were returned.
“We will continue to take determined and ruthless action until we return all of our hostages – the living and the deceased,” he said following military confirmation of the death of one more Israeli during the Hamas-led attack that started the Gaza war 16 months ago.
An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the prime minister met on Tuesday with the security cabinet, a select group of ministers, for almost four hours.
Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas, has been devastated by Israel’s military offensive since October 2023 and is short of food, water and shelter, and in need of billions in foreign aid.
Trump has enraged Palestinians and Arab leaders and upended decades of U.S. policy that endorsed a possible two-state solution in the region by trying to impose his vision of Gaza. He has said the United States should take over Gaza and move out its more than 2 million Palestinian residents so that the enclave can be turned into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.
The forcible displacement of a population under military occupation is a war crime banned by the 1949 Geneva conventions.
Palestinians fear a repeat of what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s creation. Israel denies they were forced out.
Gazans interviewed by Reuters criticised Trump for saying he would be prepared for “hell” to break out if all the Israeli hostages were not released by noon on Saturday.
“Hell worse than what we have already? Hell worse than killing? The destruction, all the practices and human crimes that have occurred in the Gaza Strip have not happened anywhere else in the world,” said Jomaa Abu Kosh, a Palestinian from Rafah in southern Gaza, standing beside demolished homes.
U.N. CHIEF WARNS OF ‘IMMENSE TRAGEDY’
The Gaza war has been paused under the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that was brokered by Qatar and Egypt with support from the United States.
More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, the Gaza health ministry says, and nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million population internally displaced by the conflict, which has caused a hunger crisis.
Some 1,200 people were killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities and about 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, Israeli tallies show.
Trump’s ideas have introduced new complexity into a sensitive and explosive Middle East dynamic, including the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
Trump was to meet Jordan’s King Abdullah on Tuesday for what was likely to be a tense encounter over the president’s Gaza redevelopment idea, including a threat to cut aid to the U.S.-allied Arab country if it refuses to resettle Palestinians.
For Jordan, Trump’s talk of resettlement comes dangerously close to its nightmare of a mass expulsion of Palestinians from both Gaza and the West Bank, echoing a vision of Jordan as an alternative Palestinian home that has long been propagated by ultra-nationalist Israelis.
Amman’s concern is amplified by a surge in violence on its border with the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Palestinian hopes of statehood are being eroded by expanding Jewish settlement.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on X on Tuesday that a resumption of armed conflict should be avoided at all costs because that would lead to “immense tragedy”.

Title: EU, Canada and Mexico condemn Trump move to hike steel and aluminium tariffs
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:28:42 +0000
Content: Mexico, Canada and the European Union on Tuesday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports next month, a move that has fanned fears of a trade war.
Trump signed proclamations late on Monday raising the U.S. tariff rate on aluminium to 25% from his previous 10% rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
The measures, due to take effect on March 12, will apply to millions of tons of steel and aluminium imports from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other countries that had been entering the U.S. duty free under the carve-outs.
Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard called the tariff decision “not justified” and “unfair.” He did not say if Mexico planned reciprocal tariffs on steel or aluminum it imports from the United States.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the tariffs were “unacceptable.” Canada’s response, if needed, would be firm and clear, he said at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen joined the condemnation, saying the 27-nation bloc would take “firm and proportionate countermeasures.” U.S. Vice President JD Vance said he would discuss trade and economic issues with Von der Leyen at an AI summit in Paris on Tuesday.
The move will simplify tariffs on the metals, Trump told reporters. “It’s 25% without exceptions or exemptions,” he said. “That’s all countries, no matter where it comes from, all countries.”
Trump said on Monday he would announce reciprocal tariffs over the next two days on all countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said, “I don’t mind.”
READY TO RETALIATE
In figures likely to further irk Trump, Germany’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached a record level last year of 70 billion euros ($72.3 billion), according to data from the German statistics office.
European Commission head Von der Leyen said she deeply regretted the U.S. decision, adding that tariffs were taxes that were bad for business and worse for consumers. EU steel exports to the U.S. have averaged about 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) a year over the past decade.
“Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered – they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,” she said in a statement.
One option for the EU would be to reactivate the tariffs it imposed in 2018 that were suspended under a truce agreed between Von der Leyen and then-U.S. president Joe Biden.
The EU tariffs on U.S. products such as bourbon, motorcycles and orange juice are currently suspended until the end of March.
The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), representing U.S. companies active in Europe, also criticised the move as harmful to jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.
The damage will reverberate beyond the steel and aluminium sectors to all businesses that rely on these materials, it said.
COST AND CHAOS FOR U.S. BUSINESS
Executives across industries reliant on steel and aluminum imports were scrambling to offset the cost of Trump’s move after previous tariff threats from the White House that were later scrapped.
Businesses around the U.S. have warned of fallout, with many manufacturing-heavy companies finding it difficult to plan next steps or determine if Trump will follow through.
Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Trump’s proposed and implemented tariffs have added “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos.”
Trump’s latest trade salvo pushed gold prices to a record high on Tuesday on safe-haven demand in Asian trading before retreating.
Steel imports accounted for about 23% of American steel consumption in 2023, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico the largest suppliers.
Canada, whose abundant hydropower resources aid its metal production, accounted for nearly 80% of U.S. primary aluminium imports in 2024.
Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be “smelted and cast” within the region to curb U.S. imports of minimally processed Chinese and Russian metals that circumvent other tariffs.
While China exports only tiny volumes of steel to the U.S., it is responsible for much of the world’s excess steel capacity, according to the U.S. It says subsidised production in China forces other countries to export more and leads to trans-shipment of Chinese steel through other countries into the U.S. to avoid tariffs and other trade restrictions.

Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Tuesday emphasized that India and France can play a significant role in shaping the fast-evolving global economy, including by inspiring the European Union (EU).
Speaking at the India-France CEO Forum in Paris, Jaishankar stressed the need for diversified production, reliable and resilient supply chains, and deeper business collaborations to meet the challenges of an ever-changing world.
“This applies as much to manufacturing as it does to health,” he remarked.
Highlighting the independent traditions of both nations, Jaishankar said, “We are actively working to strengthen each other’s positions and make our collaboration a significant factor in contemporary global affairs.”
He underscored that stronger India-France cooperation would contribute to global economic stability during volatile times. “The ‘Make in India’ initiative has opened up numerous new possibilities in this regard,” he said on the sidelines of the AI Action Summit.
“The Summit itself is a reminder of how much we could achieve in AI, software development, and cybersecurity. The year 2026 will be celebrated as the ‘India-France Year of Innovation.’ Let’s use that as a driver,” he added.
Jaishankar urged stakeholders to weigh in on ongoing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. “Defence, manufacturing, and aerospace are well-established areas of cooperation. Both the nature and scale of this collaboration are poised for a significant leap. The challenge before us is to fully capitalize on it,” he said.
He also highlighted India’s ongoing clean energy transition, rapid infrastructure development, and advancements in digital public infrastructure (DPI).
Earlier, Jaishankar met his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot to discuss strengthening bilateral ties with a focus on AI, innovation, connectivity, and clean energy.

Title: French President backs PM Modi on fair access to AI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:25:06 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the AI Action Summit, underscoring the importance of equitable access to Artificial Intelligence for global progress.
Addressing an audience of industry leaders, policymakers, and AI experts, Macron highlighted the need for trust and inclusivity in AI development, stressing that access to such transformative technology must be available across continents.
“Fair and open access is of decisive importance. We need a system where all continents and countries, including players from Asia Pacific and Latin America, have equal access to these innovations,” Macron said, citing PM Modi’s leadership on the issue as an example.
The French President warned against the creation of a divided world, where technological advancements benefit only a select few. “We don’t want a system where some are in power while others are merely vessels. For trust in AI, equitable access is essential,” he said.
He urged governments and civil society to act collectively to foster this trust, emphasizing the critical role of private enterprises and major investors. “If people can’t trust AI, we risk seeing resistance emerge, with citizens rejecting its adoption as a source of problems rather than solutions,” Macron added.
The President also called for investments in data infrastructure and AI education. “We want to train younger generations and expand research positions at universities. Data consolidation and sustainable data centers powered by low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power, are key to this effort,” Macron said.
Earlier, PM Modi, delivering the inaugural address at the summit, highlighted AI’s transformative potential for sectors like healthcare, education, and agriculture. “AI can help create a world where the journey toward sustainable development goals becomes easier and faster. To achieve this, we must pool resources and develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency,” PM Modi said.

Title: Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh down by 47 pc in 14 years: Nityanand Rai
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:43:21 +0000
Content: Violence perpetrated by Left Wing Extremists (LWE) has reduced in Chhattisgarh by 47 per cent in 2024 — with 122 incidents — compared to the high levels of 2010, which saw 499 incidents, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said on Tuesday.
In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the MoS said that due to the reduction in violence linked to Maoists in the state, deaths of civilians and security personnel have also reduced by 64 per cent — from 343 in 2010 to 122 in 2024.
A decline in Maoist violence has also been observed across the rest of the country. The violence perpetrated by LWE has reduced by 81 per cent in 2024 — with 150 incidents — compared to the high levels of 2010, which recorded 1,936 incidents.
The resultant deaths of civilians and security forces have also decreased by 85 per cent during the same period, from 1,005 in 2010 to 150 in 2024, the MoS said.
He noted that to address the LWE problem, a “National Policy and Action Plan” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security-related measures, development interventions, and ensuring the rights and entitlements of local communities.
On the security front, the Central government assists the LWE-affected states by providing Central Armed Police battalions, training, and funds for the modernisation of state police forces, equipment and arms, intelligence sharing, and construction of fortified police stations, he said.
Resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan” by both the Centre and the States has resulted in a consistent decline in Maoism, both in terms of geographical spread and violence, the MoS added.
There has been a progressive decline in the number of districts affected by LWE. In view of the continuously improving situation, three reviews of LWE-affected districts have been undertaken in the last six years, with a reduction from 126 to 90 districts in April 2018, further to 70 in July 2021, and then to 38 in April 2024.

Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:43:39 +0000
Content: Estonian President Alar Karis on Tuesday emphasised India’s important role in the international arena during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris.
In what was their first meeting, the two leaders discussed ongoing bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity and global conflicts.
They underlined that warm and friendly relations between India and Estonia are based on the two countries’ shared commitment to democracy, rule of law and the values of freedom and pluralism.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting, the two leaders expressed satisfaction at the growing bilateral cooperation in various fields, including trade and investment, IT and digital, culture, tourism and people-to-people ties.
Prime Minister Modi invited the Estonian government and companies to explore the opportunities offered by the India growth story and take advantage of programmes such as Digital India.
“The two leaders noted the importance of the India-Estonia partnership also in the context of the India-EU strategic partnership. They welcomed the initiation of ministerial exchanges in the India-Nordic-Baltic format. The leaders also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, and cooperation at the United Nations,” the statement detailed.
PM Modi and the President of Estonia expressed satisfaction at the growing cultural and people-to-people ties between the two countries.
“In this regard, the PM appreciated the popularity of Yoga in Estonia,” the PMO stated.
Bilateral relations between Estonia and India have gained momentum in recent years, asserted President Karis during the meeting.
“We already have good cooperation in the areas of e-governance, cybersecurity and digital government services, but I see opportunities to further intensify this and I hope that the Estonian ICT sector will be able to adapt and offer suitable solutions to Indian partners,” he said.
Karis noted that in 2023, the Estonian e-Government Academy contributed to the renewal of India’s national ICT strategy, which is a good basis for further cooperation.
In addition to discussions on digital cooperation, the Estonian President highlighted the need to strengthen international security.
While discussing the Russia-Ukraine war, the Estonian Head of State emphasised India’s important role in the international arena and stressed the importance of adhering to international law.
“The meeting also addressed compliance with sanctions against Russia and discussed the threats posed by North Korea’s deployment of soldiers to Ukraine, which, according to President Karis, links the Indo-Pacific region to European security,” read a statement issued by the Estonian President’s office after the meeting.

Title: Over 68,000 ponds completed under mission Amrit Sarovar to combat water scarcity
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:18:13 +0000
Content: Mission Amrit Sarovar, launched in April 2022, has achieved remarkable progress in addressing the country’s water scarcity issue by constructing or rejuvenating over 68,000 Amrit Sarovars (ponds) as of January. The mission, aimed at building 75 ponds in each district, with a total target of 50,000 ponds nationwide, has already surpassed its goal. These Sarovars have significantly enhanced surface and groundwater availability across various regions, addressing immediate water needs and establishing sustainable water sources.
The initiative not only highlights the government’s commitment to combating water scarcity but also emphasizes long-term environmental sustainability and the well-being of local communities. The ponds serve as symbols of climate resilience and ecological balance, contributing to the nation’s overall water management strategy.
Phase II of Mission Amrit Sarovar will continue with a renewed focus on ensuring water availability through community participation (Jan Bhagidaari). This phase aims to further strengthen climate resilience and deliver lasting benefits for future generations by fostering ecological balance.
The works under Mission Amrit Sarovar are being executed through convergence with various ongoing schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the 15th Finance Commission Grants, and sub-schemes of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichai Yojana, including the Watershed Development Component and Har Khet Ko Pani. States are also using their own schemes, and public contributions like crowdfunding and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are encouraged to support the initiative.

Title: Real Madrid’s Bellingham nets late winner in 3-2 thriller with Manchester City
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:01:53 +0000
Content: Real Madrid‘s Jude Bellingham struck a last-gasp goal to give the Champions League holders a 3-2 victory over Manchester City in an edge-of-your-seat first leg of their knockout phase playoff on Tuesday at the Etihad Stadium.
Kylian Mbappe and Brahim Diaz also struck for Real, to cancel out a double from City’s Erling Haaland, setting up what should be a thrilling second leg on February 19 in Madrid between two of Europe’s most famous teams and biggest rivals.
Haaland opened the scoring with his first career goal against Real in the 19th minute when Josko Gvardiol chested the ball down to the 24-year-old Norwegian, who volleyed into the far corner. The goal was given after fans held their breath through a four-minute VAR check for offside.
Mbappe levelled in the 60th minute with a rebound off a free kick, awkwardly looping the ball off his shin over goalkeeper Ederson and into the net.
Haaland struck from the penalty spot in the 80th minute – awarded after Dani Ceballos took down Phil Foden by his right knee in the box – sending keeper Thibaut Courtois the wrong way.
It was his 49th goal in 48 Champions League games.
But City have struggled to hold onto leads this season, conceding seven goals in the final 15 minutes of Champions League matches. And former City player Diaz pounced on a poor clearance by Ederson of Vinicius Jr’s shot to tap home in the 86th minute.
England international Bellingham scored the winner in the 92nd minute to groans from City fans after a shaky pass back from Mateo Kovacic to Rico Lewis saw Vinicius nip in and loop the ball over from the left. Bellingham got in front of John Stones to slot home.
“I’m happy for the goal and for helping the team,” Diaz said. “I feel we played a great match, it’s not easy here, against a pretty good team … but there’s still the second leg and the work is not finished.”
TOUGH TASK AT BERNABEU
Real and City failed to advance automatically to the last 16 as one of the top eight sides in the Champions League table, in the new league-phase format, meaning one of the tournament’s top contenders will be eliminated early.
“It was a weird one. We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,” Bellingham said.
“I think we were playing well and creating a lot. We were always confident throughout the game that something would drop for us. I don’t care what form City are in, they are still an unbelievable team. It’s always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.”
The clubs are clashing for a fourth consecutive year, having met in four Champions League knockout ties since 2020, although never this early in Europe’s elite competition.
City boss Pep Guardiola has said the frequency of meetings makes it feel like a derby, while Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti called the fixture a “modern classic.”
“It’s so raw and frustrating for everyone,” City defender Stones said, summing up the home side’s agony.
“We were in the game until so late and then it’s two situations that happen and we concede … We need to see games out better … Today we had a great opportunity to go to the Bernabeu with a 2-1 lead. It’s not done. We have to stay positive, which is difficult now.”
Ancelotti urged his players to keep their head for the return match. “We didn’t deserve to be 1-2 down. We were really dangerous and defended really well. At the end of the day the victory is deserved,” he said. “We have to stay calm. It’s only the first half. Anything can happen at the Bernabeu.”

Title: RBI to inject Rs 2.5 lakh crore to enhance liquidity in banking system
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 05:38:27 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was all set to inject Rs 2,50,000 crore through its Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auction on Wednesday to enhance liquidity in the banking system.
The Central Bank has stated that the amount has been decided based on an assessment of the liquidity conditions.
The Reserve Bank also said it will be conducting daily Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions on all working days in Mumbai with reversal taking place on the next working day, until further notice.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra had announced on Friday, after the monetary policy meeting, that the central bank was committed to provide sufficient liquidity in the economy and would take steps to ensure durable liquidity to meet the requirement of the system.
The RBI Governor also said that the RBI was keeping a close watch on the rupee and was taking all steps to keep the Indian currency stable.
According to a Morgan Stanley report, the RBI is expected to proactively manage liquidity and take up some additional measures (OMO purchases/FX swaps) as liquidity deficit rises towards end-March. We see risk of a longer rate cut cycle, if growth recovery is lacklustre, driven by weaker domestic demand and uncertainty from global factors.
To support its point, the report referred to the RBI governor’s statement highlighting that on the regulatory front, there is a trade-off between stability and efficiency which should be kept in mind. He said that this trade-off will be kept in mind while formulating regulations.
In a big relief for banks, RBI Governor Malhotra announced that the implementation of the proposed Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well as project financing norms will be deferred by a year and will not to be implemented before March 31, 2026.
He said that the step has been taken as the earlier deadline March 2025 deadline does not give sufficient time for the implementation of these guidelines. The RBI does not want to cause disruption in the financial system and will ensure a smooth transition, added.
Both public sector and private sector banks had opposed the implementation of these norms, announced by former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, as they feared they were would cause a liquidity crisis in the financial system. The heads of banks had raised the issue with Malhotra, shortly after he took over as RBI Governor with Das’s tenure coming to an end.

Title: Inside the collapse of Nissan and Honda’s $60 billion mega deal
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 05:38:25 +0000
Content: Nissan was deep in trouble late last year when rival Honda offered a lifeline: a $60 billion tie-up that would help both Japanese automakers compete against the Chinese brands upending the car industry.
Years of faltering sales and management turmoil had left Nissan a diminished force, especially after it underestimated demand for hybrids in the U.S., its top market.
But the merger talks unravelled in a little more than a month due to Nissan’s pride and insufficient alarm about its predicament, as well as Honda’s abrupt decision to revise the terms and propose that Nissan become a subsidiary, according to six people familiar with the matter.
Nissan, which for years until 2020 was Japan’s second-largest automaker behind Toyota, insisted on receiving near-equal treatment in the talks despite its weaker position, three of the people said.
Honda pressured Nissan to make deeper cuts to its workforce and factory capacity, but Nissan was unwilling to consider politically sensitive factory closures, three of the sources said. They said they were left with the impression Nissan felt it could recover on its own, despite its mounting difficulties.
That intransigence, combined with what Honda management saw as Nissan’s slow decision-making, helped torpedo a deal that would have created one of the world’s largest automakers, three people said.
This account of the forces that scuttled the mega merger features previously unreported information, including details about factories Nissan wanted to keep open, its resistance to Honda’s pressure for deeper cuts, and the reaction inside Nissan to some of Honda’s demands. The story is based on Reuters interviews with more than a dozen people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the topic’s sensitivity.
The reporting sheds new light on the thinking inside Nissan as it faces a deepening crisis. The storied carmaker now faces the added threat of U.S. tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico, which account for more than a quarter of its U.S. sales. Both Nissan and Honda are due to report earnings on Thursday.
“I think it’s a management problem,” said Julie Boote, analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, about the turmoil at Nissan. “They’re completely overestimating their position and their brand value, and their ability to turn around the business.”
Nissan and Honda declined to comment on the specific aspects of the talks as described by Reuters sources.
Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida visited his counterpart Toshihiro Mibe last week to say he wanted to end discussions after Honda made the subsidiary proposal.
Both automakers have said they would provide an update this month.
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
Nissan stunned investors in November when it cut its profit forecast by 70% due to worsening sales in China and the United States. Its announced a turnaround plan that involved cutting 9,000 jobs and one-fifth of global capacity, which some analysts saw as too little, too late.
Uchida promised to forfeit half his pay and said he was focused on making the business leaner and more resilient.
In December, Nissan and Honda announced plans to merge, an outgrowth of talks they had been holding since March 2024, when they said they were looking to cooperate on technology.
But the merger discussions quickly hit a wall over calculating the shareholding ratio for the combined company, two of the people said.
In private, Uchida exhibited doubts about the deal’s prospects, one of the people said. Honda managers complained that Nissan’s decision-making was too slow, four people said. A public update on the talks was originally set for the end of January before being pushed back to mid-February.
Honda managers felt Nissan’s turnaround strategy lacked details and were frustrated by what they saw as an insufficient reduction in factory capacity, two sources said.
Reuters could not determine whether Honda requested a certain number of job cuts or identified specific factories for capacity reductions.
Nissan didn’t want to shut factories because that would force a write-down of their value on paper and hurt its earnings, one person said.
The job cuts already promised as part of Nissan’s turnaround plan amounted to 7% of its global workforce. It was telling, one person said, that Honda had cut more people in China over the last two years.
Honda, for its part, appeared unwilling to budge on its plans, implying it didn’t consider Nissan an equal, one person familiar with Nissan’s thinking said.
KYUSHU VISIT
In late January, Nissan executive Hideyuki Sakamoto visited the southwestern island of Kyushu to announce plans for a battery EV plant that would create 500 jobs.
Flanked by local politicians, Sakamoto said the automaker wouldn’t reduce capacity at its existing Kyushu plant, either. Kyushu was a “highly competitive base geopolitically” and important for future EV plans, he said.
The day after Sakamoto’s visit to Kyushu, Honda’s Mibe told Uchida that Nissan would need to become a Honda subsidiary, a stipulation not in the original merger memorandum of understanding the two companies signed late last year, according to one person.
Reuters could not determine whether Mibe’s move was triggered by Nissan’s announcements in Kyushu. Nevertheless, the Kyushu trip crystallised the tensions between the companies over the best way forward.
Kyushu wasn’t the only plant that Nissan considered untouchable. Smyrna in Tennessee, Aguascalientes in Mexico and Britain’s Sunderland were all seen as critical to the company’s EV strategy, and the automaker didn’t want to close them or reduce their lines, one source said.
Honda’s abrupt change to the deal’s structure reflected its mounting impatience with Nissan over the pace of negotiations, two people said.
Nissan was blindsided by that move, given that it went against the previously agreed memorandum, two of people said. Inside Nissan, the proposal was seen as “outrageous” and an affront to the dignity of Nissan, the older automaker, one person said.
Renault, Nissan’s top shareholder, said while it was not privy to the discussions, the latest information suggested the transaction would result in a “takeover of Nissan by Honda without a control premium for Nissan shareholders”. Such an outcome was “not acceptable”, Renault said, adding it would “vigorously defend” its interests.
NEW PARTNERS
It’s not clear what, if anything, could bring the automakers back to the table. It seems likely they would revert to their original agreement to team up on technology, three of the people said.
If both companies agree to end the discussions, neither would be liable for a 100 billion yen ($650 million) break-up fee, according to their December memorandum of understanding.
Nissan is open to working with new partners, including Foxconn 2317.TW, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that makes Apple’s iPhones, Reuters has reported. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.
Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said on Wednesday that its aim was to cooperate with Nissan, not acquire it.
The Taiwanese company’s EV business is led by former Nissan executive Jun Seki, who at one point was seen by insiders as a contender to become the carmaker’s CEO.
Foxconn would likely be a more generous suitor than Honda because it needs a brand name in the auto industry, and Nissan could be attractive, said Amir Anvarzadeh, a strategist with Japan equity advisory firm Asymmetric Advisors.
“No matter what you think about their cars and their balance sheet and so forth, at least the brand is still fairly recognisable,” he said of Nissan.
So far, Japan’s government has given little sense of how it sees the breakdown in talks between Honda and Nissan, nor whether it would be open to an acquisition of Nissan by Foxconn, which is also the top shareholder in consumer electronics company Sharp Corp.
For Nissan, the question now is what management will do, said Boote.
“They don’t have a realistic view of what’s happening in the auto industry and what really needs to happen with Nissan.”

During the discussion, Deepika shared insights into her childhood, revealing her strong inclination towards sports and extracurricular activities.
“I was a very naughty child. Even today, my parents say that you will never find Deepika at the ground level. I was always jumping from sofas, tables, and chairs. I was more interested in extracurricular activities,” she said.
Expressing her gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deepika thanked him for prioritising students’ mental well-being through ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha.’
When addressing students on managing stress and handling pressure from teachers and parents, she advised, “Focus on things you can control. Talk to your parents and teachers about your stress, identify its cause, and express it to someone you trust.” She also encouraged students to practice meditation and exercise as effective ways to cope with stress.
Deepika emphasised that making mistakes is part of learning and highlighted the importance of fun, rest, and exposure to natural sunlight.
As part of an interactive session, she conducted an activity where students wrote their strengths on pieces of paper and displayed them on a board.
“This activity helps you realise that if you focus on your strengths rather than weaknesses, you’ll see how many things you’re good at,” she said.
Adding a fun element to the session, Deepika also played several games with the students.
Earlier on Tuesday, she shared a video on Instagram announcing her participation in Pariksha Pe Charcha. She highlighted the significance of mental well-being in education and expressed excitement about the episode.
She took to social media to acknowledge PM Modi’s efforts in supporting students in dealing with stress and pressure.
“Pariksha Pe Charcha is back with its 8th edition! And this time, we’ll also be discussing the importance of mental health. Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for your commitment to this cause. I look forward to launching our episode,” she wrote.
Deepika, who has been vocal about her struggle with depression, reaffirmed her dedication to mental health awareness.
“I want to thank our Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving us this platform to come out as warriors, not worriers. I want to wish all of you the very best,” she said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the eighth edition of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ on February 10 in Delhi, interacting with students at Sunder Nursery during the first episode. The episode featuring Deepika Padukone is set to be released on February 12.

Title: Champions Trophy: Harshit Rana replaces injured Bumrah in India’s squad; Jaiswal replaced by Chakaravarthy
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:51:35 +0000
Content: Team India has suffered a major setback ahead of the Champions Trophy, with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah ruled out due to a lower back injury. Harshit Rana has been named as his replacement.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed Bumrah’s absence in a statement released on Tuesday night.
“Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury. The Men’s Selection Committee has named Harshit Rana as Bumrah’s replacement,” the statement read.
Another major change in India’s 15-member squad is the exclusion of youngster Yashasvi Jaiswal, with mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy coming in as his replacement.
“Team India has also included Varun Chakaravarthy in the squad. The spinner will replace Yashasvi Jaiswal, who was initially named in the provisional squad,” the statement added.
Bumrah has been out of action since January, with his last appearance coming in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test against Australia in Sydney. After bowling 10.1 overs in the first innings, he was visibly in discomfort and underwent scans. Australian doctors advised him not to participate in the remainder of the Test. Although he came out to bat in the second innings, he did not bowl again.
Jaiswal’s omission follows his underwhelming ODI debut in the series opener against England, where he scored 15 off 22 balls. He was subsequently dropped for the second ODI in favor of Virat Kohli, while Chakaravarthy was handed his ODI debut, returning figures of 1/54 in his 10-over spell.
India will kick off its Champions Trophy campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai.
India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025:
Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.
Non-traveling substitutes: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj, and Shivam Dube. The three players will travel to Dubai if required.

Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:51:03 +0000
Content: On the occasion of ‘Maghi Purnima’ on Wednesday, thousands of devotees have gathered in Maha Kumbh at the Sangam in Prayagraj to take a holy dip.
Anticipating the massive influx, vehicle entry into the fairgrounds was restricted a day in advance. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been personally monitoring the arrangements since early morning.
DIG Prayagraj, Vaibhav Krishna, confirmed that the crowd was being efficiently managed, with bathing proceeding peacefully across all ghats. Strict traffic diversions and disciplined crowd control measures are in place.
A grand spectacle unfolded as flower petals were showered (Pushpa Varsha) upon devotees and ascetics performing the holy dip in the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The Chief Minister extended his greetings on social media X, praying for the well-being, prosperity, and fortune of all devotees.
“Hearty congratulations to all the devotees and residents of the state on the holy bathing festival Magh Purnima!

May everyone’s life be filled with happiness, prosperity and good fortune by the grace of Lord Shri Hari. May Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna and Mother Saraswati fulfil everyone’s wishes, this is my wish,” CM Yogi wrote in a post.
To ensure security, paramilitary forces have been deployed at key locations, preventing overcrowding at the main ghats and directing pilgrims to other bathing areas. Meanwhile, CM Yogi was overseeing the event from the war room at his official residence in Lucknow, alongside DGP Prashant Kumar and Home Secretary Sanjay Prasad.

Title: PM Modi, Macron hold bilateral talks; France to host 10 Indian startups
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:14:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron held bilateral talks on Wednesday, reviewing key areas of cooperation, including defense, space, civil nuclear collaboration, health, and people-to-people ties.
A major highlight of the discussions was France’s decision to host 10 Indian startups at its prestigious startup incubator, Station F, marking a significant boost for India-France business and technology collaboration.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, addressing a press conference on Wednesday, revealed that PM Modi and Macron engaged in discussions while traveling to Marseille. “These discussions continued upon landing, where the two leaders were joined by their respective delegations,” Misri said.
The meeting also focused on strengthening India’s real-time payment system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), in France. Both leaders welcomed the expanded opportunities for UPI integration, according to a joint statement.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a key focus of the discussions, with both nations agreeing to designate 2026 as the “India-France Year of Innovation.” The initiative will be officially launched in New Delhi in March 2026 with the unveiling of its logo. Additionally, a Letter of Intent was signed between India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) and France’s Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) to establish the Indo-French Center for Digital Sciences.
In the civil nuclear sector, both leaders welcomed the first meeting of the Special Task Force on Civil Nuclear Energy. Key agreements included a Letter of Intent on Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMR), along with an implementing agreement between India’s Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP) and France’s Institut National des Sciences et Techniques Nucléaires (INSTN).
“The two sides have agreed to collaborate in co-designing, co-developing, and co-producing SMRs and AMRs, recognizing their potential in the evolving energy landscape,” Misri said. He emphasized that the partnership would play a crucial role in addressing future energy demands, particularly in the AI-driven technological revolution.
Additionally, India and France renewed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and France’s Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA) for cooperation with the GCNEP.
PM Modi and Macron also expressed satisfaction with the ongoing collaboration in health, culture, tourism, education, and people-to-people ties. Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthening cooperation in global forums.

Title: India’s CPI inflation falls to 5-month low of 4.31% in January
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:01:52 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a five-month low of 4.31% in January as prices of vegetables and pulses eased, bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Wednesday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after reaching a 14-month high of 6.21% in October. CPI inflation had fallen to 5.48% in November and 5.22% in December.
Food inflation, at 6.02% in January 2025, is the lowest since August 2024.
“The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during January is mainly attributed to the decline in inflation for vegetables, eggs, pulses, cereals, education, clothing, and health,” according to an official statement.
The five items with the highest year-on-year inflation at the All India level in January were coconut oil (54.20%), potato (49.61%), coconut (38.71%), garlic (30.65%), and peas (30.17%).
The items with the lowest year-on-year inflation in January 2025 were cumin (-32.25%), ginger (-30.92%), dry chilies (-11.27%), brinjal (-9.94%), and LPG (-9.29%).
The year-on-year fuel and light inflation rate for January stood at -1.38%, compared to -1.33% in December 2024, as fuel prices continued to decline.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced on Friday a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.25% in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth amid global uncertainties.
He stated that inflation had declined and was expected to further moderate, gradually aligning with the RBI’s target.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and boosting the growth rate in a slowing economy.
The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with its neutral stance in monetary policy, focusing on inflation while supporting growth. This approach provides flexibility to respond to the macroeconomic environment, Malhotra said.
With retail inflation continuing its downward trend, the RBI will have more room to adopt a soft monetary policy, making more credit available to businesses and consumers, thereby propelling economic growth.

Title: 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots: Former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar convicted in double murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:54:55 +0000
Content: A Delhi court has convicted former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in a case related to the brutal killings of a father and son in Saraswati Vihar on November 1, 1984. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Kaveri Baweja at the Rouse Avenue Court.
Sajjan Kumar, who is already serving a life sentence in another 1984 riots case linked to the Delhi Cantonment killings, was physically produced before the court for the proceedings. The court had earlier reserved its verdict on January 31 after hearing final arguments, including additional submissions from Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat.
The case pertains to the killing of Jaswant Singh and his son Tarundeep Singh, who were murdered during the wave of anti-Sikh violence that erupted in Delhi following the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The prosecution argued that Kumar incited and led the mob that attacked and burned Sikh homes, resulting in the deaths of several individuals.
Senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, representing the victims, contended that police investigations into the anti-Sikh riots were deliberately manipulated to shield the accused. He cited the Delhi High Court’s earlier judgment, which had characterized the riots as a “crime against humanity” and part of a “larger massacre” targeting Sikhs. The court had also acknowledged that the objective of genocide is always the targeting of minorities.
Phoolka further argued that official figures recorded 2,700 Sikhs killed in Delhi alone in 1984, emphasizing that such extraordinary circumstances necessitated special legal considerations. He also drew parallels with international legal precedents and referenced the Geneva Convention, under which mass killings targeting specific communities have been categorized as genocide.
Despite the gravity of the case, delays and institutional hurdles hindered justice. A charge sheet against Kumar was initially prepared in 1992, but authorities allegedly failed to file it in court, reinforcing suspicions of police efforts to protect the powerful politician. It was only after a Supreme Court intervention that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted to reopen 114 riot cases, including this one.
The SIT’s findings led to fresh evidence, with key witnesses tracing back their traumatic accounts of looting, arson, and killings. One witness, a surviving family member of the victims, recalled how she identified Sajjan Kumar only after seeing his photograph in a magazine nearly two months after the attack. Her testimony, recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. in 2016, became crucial in establishing Kumar’s role in orchestrating the violence.
Sajjan Kumar has been convicted under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including murder (Section 302), rioting (Sections 147 and 148), and abetment to violence (Section 149). The court found that Kumar instigated and led the mob, which set Sikh homes ablaze, looted property, and mercilessly killed victims.
His conviction in this case adds to his legal troubles, as he is already serving a life sentence in the Delhi Cantt riots case. Meanwhile, an appeal challenging his previous conviction is pending before the Supreme Court.

Title: India Energy Week 2025 highlights India’s clean cooking gas model as a blueprint for Global South
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:16:57 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri chaired a Ministerial Roundtable on Clean Cooking during the second day of India Energy Week 2025, showcasing India’s success in ensuring universal access to clean cooking gas. Puri emphasised that India’s model, driven by targeted subsidies, digitised distribution networks, and cultural shifts, offers a replicable solution for other Global South nations facing similar energy challenges.
The session brought together representatives from countries like Brazil, Tanzania, Malawi, Sudan, and Nepal, along with industry leaders such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Total Energy, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Puri highlighted India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which provides LPG access at highly affordable rates—7 cents per day for beneficiaries and 15 cents per day for other consumers—making clean cooking fuel accessible to millions.
During the roundtable, international representatives shared their experiences and challenges in expanding clean cooking solutions. Tanzania’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, Hon. Dkt. Doto Mashaka Biteko, outlined efforts to enable 80% of households to transition to clean cooking by 2030, while Sudan’s Energy Minister, H.E. Dr. Mohieldien Naiem Mohamed Saied, emphasised the need for private sector engagement to address LPG supply gaps.
Mary Burce Warlick, Deputy Executive Director of IEA, praised India’s model for its affordability, access, and infrastructure solutions, highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships and concessional financing for global expansion. Representatives from Rwanda and Nepal shared their countries’ efforts to reduce firewood dependency through electric stoves and biogas.
Rahool Panandiker of BCG credited India’s transformation in clean cooking to its strong political commitment, effective subsidies, and public awareness campaigns. He stressed the need to refine the LPG refill model for sustained usage and economic sustainability.
Puri also discussed the potential of solar cookers, highlighting IOCL’s advanced solar models priced at $500 per unit. While acknowledging cost challenges, he pointed to carbon financing and private sector collaborations as solutions to drive adoption across the Global South.
In his closing remarks, Puri reaffirmed India’s commitment to supporting global energy access initiatives, calling the Indian model a scalable solution for other developing nations. He emphasized that achieving universal clean cooking access is not just an economic goal but a moral obligation due to the health and environmental impacts of traditional biomass cooking.

Title: Greece elects former parliament speaker as new president
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:15:49 +0000
Content: Greece’s parliament elected its former speaker, Constantine Tassoulas, as the country’s president on Wednesday, approving the conservative government’s nominee for the largely ceremonial role.
The decision to nominate him has angered protesters who rallied outside parliament last month seeking justice over a deadly 2023 train crash. They say that on Tassoulas’ watch as parliamentary speaker, lawmakers failed to investigate any political responsibility over Greece’s worst rail disaster.
Two years later, a judicial probe is still in progress. Parliament is the only body that can investigate politicians under Greek law.
Tassoulas, 66, a lawyer and father of two who has been a lawmaker since 2000 and has previously served as Greece’s culture minister and deputy defence minister, won the backing of 160 lawmakers in Wednesday’s vote in the 300-seat parliament.
He will succeed Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Greece’s first female president, whose five-year term expires in March.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said last month that he chose Tassoulas on account of his political experience, widespread acceptance, and his “unifying spirit”.
Political analysts view Tassoulas’ nomination as aimed at strengthening Mitsotakis’ grip on power. His conservative New Democracy party has a small parliamentary majority with 156 seats but is under mounting pressure, opinion polls suggest.
Centre-left and leftist opposition parties had proposed other candidates and did not back Tassoulas’ nomination on Wednesday.
For decades, failure by parliament to elect a president in Greece could lead to a snap election. After a reform, following a decade-long financial crisis, the process can involve up to five voting rounds in parliament, with the threshold gradually falling to the majority of those present in the chamber.
Tassoulas will be sworn in as head of state on March 13.

Title: 1984 anti-Sikh riots: Delhi court convicts Sajjan Kumar in murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:53:01 +0000
Content: A Delhi court on Wednesday convicted former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in connection with the killing of a father-son duo in the Saraswati Vihar area on November 1, 1984, during the anti-Sikh riots.
Special judge Kaveri Baweja pronounced the conviction order and fixed the arguments on the quantum of the sentence on February 18.
This case is related to the killing of Jaswant Singh and his son Tarundeep Singh in the Saraswati Vihar area during the riots. Earlier on January 31, the Rouse Avenue Court reserved its verdict after hearing additional submissions advanced by Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat. On the other hand, Advocate Anil Sharma had submitted that Sajjan Kumar’s name was not there from the very beginning and there was a delay of 16 years in naming him as an accused by the witness. It was also submitted that a case in which Sajjan Kumar was convicted by the Delhi High Court is pending appeal before the Supreme Court.
Additional Public Prosecutor Rawat, in rebuttal, had submitted that the accused was not known to the victim. When she became aware of who Sajjan Kumar was, she named him in her statement.
Earlier, senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, appearing for the riot victims, had argued that the police investigations were manipulated in the Sikh riots cases. Police investigation was tardy and to save the accused, he said.
It was also argued that during riots, the situation was extraordinary and therefore, these cases have to be dealt with in this context.
During the arguments, Phoolka referred to the judgement of the Delhi High Court and submitted that it was not an isolated case, it was a part of a bigger massacre. It was further argued that as per official figures, 2,700 Sikhs were killed in Delhi in 1984.
Senior advocate Phoolka had referred to the Delhi High Court judgement in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot case of Delhi Cantt. wherein the court called the riots a “crime against humanity”.
Initially, an FIR was registered at Punjabi Bagh police station. Later on, this case was investigated by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted on the recommendation of Justice G.P. Mathur Committee and a charge sheet was filed.
The Justice Mathur committee had recommended the reopening of 114 cases. This case was one of them.
On December 16, 2021, the court framed charges against the accused Sajjan Kumar for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 147, 148, and 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as the offences punishable under sections 302, 308, 323, 395, 397, 427, 436, and 440 read with section 149 IPC.
It has been alleged by the SIT that the accused was leading the said mob and upon his instigation and abetment, the mob had burnt alive the above two persons and had also damaged, destroyed, and looted their household articles and other property, burnt their house, and also inflicted severe injuries on the person of their family members and relatives residing in their house.
It is claimed that during the investigation, material witnesses of the case were traced out, and examined, and their statements were recorded under section 161 CrPC.
The statements of the complainant under the above provision were recorded on November 23, 2016, during the course of this further investigation, in which she again narrated the above incident of looting, arson and murders of her husband and son by the mob armed with deadly weapons and she is also claimed to have deposed therein about the injuries suffered by her and the other victims of the case, including her sister-in-law who is stated to have subsequently expired. She had also clarified in that statement that the photograph of the accused was seen by her in a magazine after around one and a half months.

Title: Israeli military calls up reservists as uncertainty over Gaza ceasefire builds
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:40:09 +0000
Content: Israel’s military has called up reservists in preparation for a possible resumption of fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to meet a Saturday deadline to release more Israeli hostages and a nearly month-old ceasefire breaks down.
Under the ceasefire deal in force since January 19, the Palestinian militant group agreed to free three more hostages on Saturday. But it said this week it was suspending the handover because of what it said were Israeli violations of the terms.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded by saying all hostages must be freed by noon on Saturday or he would “let hell break out”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that Israel would resume “intense fighting” if Hamas did not meet the deadline, but did not say how many hostages should be freed.
The standoff threatens to reignite a conflict that has devastated the Gaza Strip, internally displaced most of its people and caused shortages of food, running water and shelter, and pushed the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.
Israeli officials said government ministers had endorsed Trump’s threat to “cancel” the ceasefire unless all the remaining Israeli hostages are released on Saturday.
Hamas has said it remains committed to the agreement but has not agreed to release the hostages on Saturday.
A Palestinian official close to the talks said mediators had stepped up their intervention “to prevent things sliding into a real crisis.”
“Things are not yet clear, but there is a big intervention from the side of the mediators with both sides in an attempt to resolve the impasse and ensure no pauses in the ceasefire agreement,” said the official, who asked not to be identified.
Asked for comment on where things stand, another Hamas official told Reuters, without giving details: “Contacts are under way.”
The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken as hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
In response, Israel began a military offensive against Hamas that has laid waste the coastal enclave and killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.
FEARS OF REGIONAL INSTABILITY
So far, Hamas has released 16 Israeli hostages from an initial group of 33 children, women and older men to be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in the first stage of a multi-phase ceasefire deal. In addition, it has also returned five Thai hostages in an unscheduled release.
Negotiations on a second phase of the agreement, which mediators had hoped would include agreement on the release of the remaining hostages as well as the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, were supposed to be under way in Doha but an Israeli team returned home on Monday, two days after arriving.
The threat to cancel a 42-day ceasefire that formed the basis on the agreement has drawn thousands of Israeli protesters to the streets this week, calling on the government to continue with the deal to bring the remaining hostages back.
A plan announced by Trump to take over Gaza, move out its more than 2 million Palestinian inhabitants and redevelop it into an international beach resort could also fuel regional instability, senior Arab officials said on Wednesday.
Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the World Government Summit in Dubai that if Trump pressed ahead with his vision for Gaza, he would lead the Middle East into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.”
Palestinians fear a repeat of the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, when nearly 800,000 people fled or were driven out during the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel. Trump has said they would have no right to return.
Jasem al-Budaiwi, who heads the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council political and economic alliance, called on Trump to remember the strong ties between the region and Washington.
“But there has to be give and take, he says his opinion and Arab world should say theirs; what he is saying won’t be accepted by the Arab world,” he said.
Trump has said the Palestinians in Gaza could settle in countries such as Jordan, which already has a huge Palestinian population, and Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state. Both have rejected the proposal.
Egypt will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss “serious” developments for Palestinians.
Aboul Gheit said the idea of the Arab Peace Initiative floated in 2002, in which Arab nations offered Israel normalised ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967, would be reintroduced.
Trump’s plan has upended decades of U.S. policy that endorsed a two-state solution in which Israel and a Palestinian state would coexist.

Title: Trump makes first big foray into Ukraine diplomacy, speaking to Putin, Zelenskiy
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 19:51:20 +0000
Content: Donald Trump discussed the war in Ukraine on Wednesday in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the new U.S. president’s first big step towards diplomacy over a war he has promised to end.
In a post on his social media platform after speaking to Putin, Trump said they had “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately,” and that he would begin by phoning Zelenskiy.
After speaking to the Ukrainian leader, Trump said: “The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make PEACE.”
Zelenskiy’s office said Trump and Zelenskiy had spoken by phone for about an hour, while the Kremlin said Putin’s call with Trump lasted nearly an hour and a half.
“I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We… talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together …and Ukraine’s technological capabilities… including drones and other advanced industries,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
The Kremlin said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump’s Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, delivered the new administration’s bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying recovering all of Ukraine’s territory occupied by Russia since 2014 was unrealistic, as was securing its membership in NATO.
“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth told a meeting of Ukraine and more than 40 allies at NATO headquarters in Brussels. “Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”
Hegseth said any durable peace must include “robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again”. But he said U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.
“The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement”.
France, Germany and Spain said Ukraine’s fate must not be decided without Kyiv’s active participation, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot saying Europe would play its role in offering security guarantees for Ukraine even if NATO membership were not immediate.
ZELENSKIY OFFERS MINERALS
Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.
Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a cabinet member in the new U.S. administration, said such a mineral deal could serve as a “security shield” for Ukraine after the war.
No peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary. Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden and most Western leaders held no direct discussions with Putin after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
During the war’s first year, Ukraine succeeded in pushing Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kyiv and recapturing swathes of Russian-occupied territory.
But Moscow has mostly had the upper hand since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023, making slow but steady gains in intense fighting that has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides and laid Ukrainian cities to waste.
Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.
In recent discussions, Kyiv appears to have accepted that it will not be admitted to NATO soon but has emphasised its need for military support under a peace deal.
“If Ukraine is not in NATO, it means that Ukraine will build NATO on its territory. So we need an army as numerous as the Russians have today,” Zelenskiy said in an interview with The Economist published on Wednesday.
“And for all this, we need weapons and money. And we will ask the U.S. for this,” Zelenskiy said, describing that as his “Plan B”.

Title: Gabbard confirmed as US intel chief in latest victory for Trump
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:47:30 +0000
Content: Tulsi Gabbard, a former U.S. representative with little intelligence experience, was confirmed as the top U.S. spy on Wednesday, as Republicans lined up behind a nominee once seen as among President Donald Trump’s most controversial picks.
The Senate voted 52 to 48, mostly along party lines, to confirm Gabbard to the position overseeing the 18-agency intelligence community and acting as Trump’s top adviser on intelligence issues.
The only Republican to vote against Gabbard was Senator Mitch McConnell, the party’s former leader in the chamber. No Democrats or independents voted in favor of the nominee.
The vote was another victory for Trump as he pushes to secure quick Senate approval for all of his nominees for administration positions.
The Senate’s Republican majority leader, John Thune, held a procedural vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also faced fierce opposition to his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services, immediately after the Gabbard confirmation vote.
Gabbard, a 43-year-old former Democrat, had faced bipartisan questions about past statements seen as supporting U.S. adversaries, and lack of experience that would have prepared her to manage a $100 billion budget. Gabbard neither worked at a spy agency nor served on an intelligence committee during her four House of Representatives terms.
She will now oversee an agency created by Congress in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the country’s sprawling intelligence apparatus, one of the most important national security positions in U.S. government.
“The selection of a DNI is a very big deal,” said Emily Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting the DNI’s broad access to classified material and role as the president’s main intelligence adviser.
RUSSIA, SYRIA, SNOWDEN
Trump’s announcement of Gabbard in November sent shockwaves through the national security establishment, adding to concerns that intelligence-gathering would be politicized, and weakened, during a second Trump administration.
Skeptics questioned Gabbard’s past statements seen as sympathetic toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and defense of the government of former Syria leader Bashar al-Assad, whom she visited in Syria in 2017 while he was under U.S. sanction.
At her hearing, Gabbard faced particularly pointed questioning from senators from both parties about her past defense of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked thousands of highly classified documents and then sought asylum in Russia.
Some were noticeably frustrated at her refusal to call Snowden a traitor.
Republicans who expressed concerns faced an intense political pressure campaign, from Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, who threatened to support primary opponents of any Republican who obstructed nominees.
Senator Todd Young, an intelligence committee member who did not immediately back Gabbard, issued a statement supporting her before the panel’s party-line 9-8 vote to recommend the nominee to the full Senate.
A former Marine Corps intelligence officer criticized by Musk before he endorsed Gabbard, Young said Gabbard had reassured him that she would support intelligence professionals and provide unbiased information.
Gabbard’s supporters also praised her pledges to pare back the DNI’s office, at a time when Trump’s administration is slashing and even seeking to close government agencies.
Past DNI nominees have been intelligence veterans confirmed with broad bipartisan support. Daniel Coats, a former ambassador and Republican senator who served on the intelligence committee, was confirmed by 85-12 in 2017, as Trump began his first term.
The DNI under former President Joe Biden, Avril Haines, had held a series of major national security positions, including deputy director of the CIA. She was confirmed by 84-10.
Harding said Gabbard will need to reassure allies that they can trust Washington as Trump pursues an aggressive foreign policy, and be cautious about making cuts amid myriad global challenges.
“The person that is going to be doing it needs to be someone that he (Trump) trusts and somebody that he’ll listen to,” Harding said.
Gabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent. She backed Trump and joined the Republican Party in 2024.

Title: Russia to get back jailed cybercrime boss from US after freeing teacher Marc Fogel
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:34:35 +0000
Content: The United States is freeing a Russian cybercrime boss from prison in return for Moscow’s release of U.S. schoolteacher Marc Fogel, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
The Kremlin said the deal – the first it has struck with the new administration of President Donald Trump – could help build trust between the two countries.
But it played down Trump’s suggestion that the agreement could make a significant contribution towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war, which he has pledged to bring to a swift conclusion.
Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 and extradited eventually to the U.S., where he pleaded guilty in May 2024 to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
He operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funnelling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity.
A U.S. administration official confirmed to Reuters that he was being released, but did not elaborate on the details or timing. Earlier, the Kremlin said a Russian was being freed but that it would not name him until he was back in the country.
Fogel, 63, was serving a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling after being caught at a Moscow airport with a small amount of marijuana. He was flown on Tuesday to Washington, where he celebrated his release with Trump at the White House.
Trump said the deal “could be a big important part” of ending the three-year-old Ukraine war.
Asked about that comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any agreement on releasing prisoners was the result of “very, very meticulous negotiating work”.
He added: “Of course, such agreements are hardly capable of becoming a breakthrough moment, but at the same time, bit by bit, these are steps to build mutual trust, which is now at its lowest point.”
A source close to the negotiations told Reuters that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia’s sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev were involved in arranging the exchange.
POSSIBLE MEETING
Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have both said they are keen to meet to discuss Trump’s ideas for bringing a swift conclusion to the war, but no date for any summit has been announced.
U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said Fogel was freed in a negotiated exchange “that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine”.
Trump had said another person would be released on Wednesday, without identifying who it would be. He called the terms of Fogel’s release “very fair”.
“We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,” Trump said.
Peskov declined to comment on the possibility of a further release.
Fogel was released into the custody of Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
The Washington Post said that according to Fox News broadcaster Sean Hannity, Witkoff, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Trump, had a three-and-a-half hour meeting with Putin. Peskov said he had “nothing to say” on that.
Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: “Not much” and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
Russia’s rouble rose against the dollar on Wednesday on news of the Fogel deal and optimism about prospects for an easing of the Ukraine crisis.

Title: US actions have serious impact on global health, WHO chief says
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:30:52 +0000
Content: The United States’ pause on foreign aid contributions is having a serious impact on global health, hitting programmes fighting polio, HIV and other threats, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday.
Tedros urged the U.S. to consider resuming aid funding until solutions can be found.
“There are actions that the U.S. government is taking… which we’re concerned are having a serious impact on global health,” said Tedros in a virtual press conference from Geneva.
Efforts to tackle HIV, polio, mpox and avian flu were all impacted by the U.S. foreign aid pause implemented by President Trump last month shortly after he took office while the programs are reviewed.
In particular, Tedros said, the suspension of funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) had caused an immediate stop to HIV treatment, testing and prevention services in the 50 countries it supports.
Despite the subsequent waiver allowing some services to resume, prevention efforts for at-risk groups were not included, he said.
“Clinics are shuttered and health workers have been put on leave,” he added, saying that the WHO is trying to help countries fill gaps in supplies of anti-retroviral drugs.
Both the funding suspension and the disengagement of U.S. institutions were also affecting the effort to eradicate polio and the response to mpox, he said, and in Myanmar, almost 60,000 people had been left with no access to life-saving services.
“We ask the US to consider continuing its funding at least until solutions can be found,” Tedros said.
As well as the aid freeze, Trump also moved to withdraw the United States from the WHO on the first day of his presidency, which is also hitting collaboration, particularly in fighting outbreaks and on influenza, Tedros said.
For example, the WHO has limited information about the spread of avian influenza among dairy cattle in the U.S., or human cases, although other WHO officials later said that the country was meeting its obligations to declare cases under international health rules.
Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director for pandemics and epidemics, said that WHO had not had influenza reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since around January 24, though.
“We are continuing to reach out to our colleagues and the U.S. government agencies. We haven’t heard back from them, but we will continue to reach out, and we hope again that that exchange resumes,” she said.
Tedros also referred to the funding gap for WHO itself. The agency has already reformed its funding model in recent years, but other ideas were also on the table, he said.
These include raising an endowment of $50 billion, although he did not give details about how that would be done. He also said the agency has considered cash recovery, or charging for some of its services, for institutions or people that could pay.

In a solemn tribute, PM Modi paid homage to Indian soldiers who fought in World Wars I and II at the Mazargues War Cemetery.
“A historic visit to France in the ancient city of Marseille concludes. In a special gesture, President @EmmanuelMacron came to see off PM @narendramodi at the airport,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on X.
PM Modi is now set for an official working visit to the United States from February 12-13, marking his first trip to Washington since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.
“Although this will be our first meeting following his historic electoral victory and inauguration in January, I have a very warm recollection of working together in his first term in building a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership between India and the US,” PM Modi said before departing.
“This visit will be an opportunity to build upon the successes of our collaboration in his first term and develop an agenda to further elevate and deepen our partnership, including in the areas of technology, trade, defense, energy, and supply chain resilience,” he added.

Title: PM Modi, Macron visit Cadarache ITER facility, discuss nuclear cooperation
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:02:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron visited the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) facility in Cadarache on Wednesday, marking the first-ever visit by a Head of State or Government to the ambitious fusion energy project.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the leaders were welcomed by the Director General of ITER and were briefed on the progress of the project, including the assembly of the world’s largest Tokamak—a device designed to produce 500 MW of fusion power by creating, containing, and controlling burning plasma. PM Modi and Macron commended the dedication of engineers and scientists working on the project.
India has been a key contributor to ITER for over two decades, alongside six other members. Around 200 Indian scientists and associates, along with leading industry players such as L&T, Inox India, TCS, TCE, and HCL Technologies, are actively involved in the initiative.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri highlighted that both leaders held significant discussions on strengthening their strategic partnership in civil nuclear energy.
During the visit, PM Modi and Macron welcomed the signing of a letter of intent on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). Additionally, an implementing agreement was signed between India’s Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP), the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), and France’s Institut National des Sciences et Techniques Nucléaires (INSTN), under the Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA), for cooperation in nuclear training and education.
Addressing the media, Misri noted ongoing Indo-French collaboration on the Jaitapur nuclear power project, which involves technological, financial, and civil liability considerations. He also emphasized the rapid progress in SMR and AMR cooperation.
“This is still an emerging technology, even in countries that have been working on it for some time. Our goal is to collaborate in co-designing, co-developing, and co-producing these reactors, which will help address challenges faced in conventional nuclear projects,” Misri said.
Both nations also renewed their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India’s DAE and France’s CEA to enhance cooperation through the Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP).

Title: India’s CPI inflation falls to 5-month low of 4.31% in January
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:01:52 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a five-month low of 4.31% in January as prices of vegetables and pulses eased, bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Wednesday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after reaching a 14-month high of 6.21% in October. CPI inflation had fallen to 5.48% in November and 5.22% in December.
Food inflation, at 6.02% in January 2025, is the lowest since August 2024.
“The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during January is mainly attributed to the decline in inflation for vegetables, eggs, pulses, cereals, education, clothing, and health,” according to an official statement.
The five items with the highest year-on-year inflation at the All India level in January were coconut oil (54.20%), potato (49.61%), coconut (38.71%), garlic (30.65%), and peas (30.17%).
The items with the lowest year-on-year inflation in January 2025 were cumin (-32.25%), ginger (-30.92%), dry chilies (-11.27%), brinjal (-9.94%), and LPG (-9.29%).
The year-on-year fuel and light inflation rate for January stood at -1.38%, compared to -1.33% in December 2024, as fuel prices continued to decline.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced on Friday a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.25% in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth amid global uncertainties.
