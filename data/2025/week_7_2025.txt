Title: New Zealand concerns mount as Cook Islands PM plans to sign agreement with China
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 06:41:59 +0000
Content: Concerns are mounting in New Zealand as the Cook Islands’ Prime Minister travels to China this week to sign agreements without properly consulting with New Zealand, despite the two nations’ constitutional ties.
New Zealand has become increasingly concerned about China’s growing presence in the Pacific region and the threats it poses to the country’s national security.
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday at a press conference New Zealand expected transparency and consultation with Cook Islands after its prime minister, Mark Brown, flagged he was heading to China seeking a partnership in national development including infrastructure, trade and the economy.
The Cook Islands is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand which provides budget support and commits to defend the South Pacific nation whose people are New Zealand citizens.
“Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, in matters of defence and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,” Luxon said.
He added that once New Zealand knew what was in the agreement, the government would decide how to respond.
New Zealand had made repeated requests to the Cook Islands to share or consult on the contents of agreements that Brown plans to sign with China but had not received a proper response, raising significant concern, deputy prime minister Winston Peter’s office said in a statement on Sunday.
“To those who suggest that our engagement with China is somehow secretive, I reject that completely,” Brown said in a video statement on Cook Islands Television News Facebook page on Friday.
“We have always conducted our international affairs with integrity and transparency. Every agreement we enter into will be in the best interest of the Cook Islands,” he said. He did not provide specifics of the agreement.
Cook Islanders have also questioned secrecy around the agreement. Tina Browne, leader of the opposition Democratic party told New Zealand based radio station 531pn that people were concerned about the lack of consultation firstly about the Cook Islands’ passportand not the agreement with China.
“If there is nothing to hide, why are we not consulting with New Zealand?” Browne said.
The Cook Islands lie halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are made up of 15 islands and atolls spread over 700 square miles (1.9 million square kilometres)
The country in 2021 had a population of 15,040.
ONGOING NEW ZEALAND RELATIONSHIP
The Cook Islands was within the New Zealand borders from 1901. In 1965, it became self governing but in free association with New Zealand. It is a realm country of New Zealand, along with Niue and Tokelau.
It has its own government and King Charles III is head of state.
Cook Islanders have New Zealand citizenship and passports. They have the same rights as a New Zealander such as the ability to work, go to school and use the medical system.
There is no Cook Islands passport or citizenship. Cook Island’s Prime Minister Mark Brown had mooted a Cook Islands passport and citizenship but backed down after New Zealand said Cook Islanders could not hold both and any change would need to be decided by referendum.
Around 94,000 Cook Islands Maori live in New Zealand and over 7,000 live in Australia.
Under the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration, the Cook Island’s is able to interact with the international community as an independent state. Any action taken in New Zealand for the foreign affairs of the Cook Islands will be at their request.
However, both New Zealand and the Cook Islands undertook in the declaration to consult regularly on foreign affairs matters, cooperate in pursuit of common foreign relation objectives and advise each other when a proposed foreign policy initiative may affect the rights, obligations and interests of the other.
It also outlines that New Zealand will continue to assist with the defence of the Cook Islands if requested and that the two countries will consult regularly on defence and security agreements.
It does not qualify for United Nations membership. In 2023, the United States recognised the Cook Islands as a sovereign and independent state.

Title: Tirupati laddu row: SIT arrests four in adulteration case
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:36:14 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested four individuals over the alleged adulteration of the sacred Tirumala temple laddu.
The arrested individuals are associated with organizations that supplied ghee, including AR Dairy (Tamil Nadu), Parag Dairy (Uttar Pradesh), Premier Agri Foods, and Alpha Milk Foods. Those arrested are Bipin Jain and Pomil Jain, former directors of Bhole Baba Dairy (Roorkee, Uttarakhand); Vaishnavi Dairy (Poonambakkam) CEO Apoorva Vinay Kant Chawda; and AR Dairy (Dundigal) MD Raju Rajasekharan.
The accused were interrogated for three days in Tirupati but were found to be uncooperative despite primary evidence of their involvement.
The SIT conducted inspections at Tirumala, Tirupati, and AR Dairy’s facility in Tamil Nadu. Investigations revealed that AR Dairy, which had a contract with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), was guilty of multiple irregularities.
According to an official release, representatives of Vaishnavi Dairy secured tenders under the name of AR Dairy for ghee supply. They allegedly fabricated false documents and seals, misusing the AR Dairy name to manipulate the tender process.
Vaishnavi Dairy also created fake records claiming to have sourced ghee from Bhole Baba Dairy in Roorkee. However, authorities found that Bhole Baba Dairy lacked the capacity to supply such large quantities of ghee.
The SIT comprises Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Hyderabad Division Joint Director Viresh Prabhu, Visakha CBI SP Muraliramba, DIG Gopinath Jetty, IG Sarvashrestha Tripathi, and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) officer Satyakumar Panda.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had alleged on September 18 that the ghee used for making Tirupati laddus during the YSR Congress Party’s rule was adulterated with animal fat, triggering outrage among devotees of the famous temple.
The state government initially constituted a SIT to probe the allegations. However, the Supreme Court later replaced it with a SIT comprising both central and state officials.
TTD uses 15,000 kg of cow ghee daily for preparing Tirumala laddus.
According to officials, AR Foods from Tamil Nadu had secured a tender to supply ghee at ₹320 per kg. On July 8, 2024, eight tankers of ghee arrived, and four of them were sent to laboratories for testing.
On July 17, NDDB Lab reports confirmed the presence of adulterants in the ghee.

Title: Paris AI summit draws world leaders and CEOs eager for technology wave
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:31:58 +0000
Content: World leaders and technology executives are convening in Paris on Monday to discuss how to safely embrace artificial intelligence at a time of mounting resistance to heavy-handed red tape that businesses say stifles innovation.
Eagerness to rein in AI has waned since previous AI summits in Britain and South Korea that focused world powers’ attention on technology’s risks after ChatGPT’s viral launch in 2022.
As U.S. President Donald Trump tears up his predecessor’s AI guardrails to promote U.S. competitiveness, pressure has built on EU policymakers to pursue a lighter-touch approach to AI to help keep European firms in the tech race.
Some EU leaders, including summit host French President Emmanuel Macron, and tech companies are hoping flexibility will be applied to the bloc’s new AI Act to help homegrown startups.
“There’s a risk some decide to have no rules and that’s dangerous. But there’s also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules,” Macron told regional French newspapers in an interview published on Friday.
“We should not be afraid of innovation,” he said.
Trump’s early moves on AI underscored how far the strategies to regulate AI in the United States, China and EU have diverged.
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. Brussels is finalising an accompanying code of practice.
Moreover, Trump’s brakes-off approach has emboldened the regulation-cautious U.S. Big Tech groups from which Europe needs to seek investment, said British think-tank Chatham House.
Meanwhile, China’s DeepSeek challenged U.S. and British AI leadership last month by freely distributing a human-like reasoning system, galvanizing geopolitical and industry rivals to race faster still.
“An unpredictable global scramble to develop AI is underway, as the U.S. turns inward and China boasts new capabilities,” Chatham House said.
Trump is not sending the U.S. AI Safety Institute to Paris, in a troubling sign to those hoping for global risk-based rules governing AI.
COMPETITIVENESS
Top political leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and China’s Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the summit. Others on the attendance list are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
Macron is due to meet with Guoqing on Monday and Vance on Tuesday, the Elysee said. The plenary session is on February 11.
Top executives such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are slated to give talks as well. Executives will partake in an invitation-only dinner with political leaders on Monday.
Google Senior Vice President James Manyika said at a press reception on Sunday that the opportunities from AI were now in “much greater focus.”
Delegations are also expected to discuss how to manage AI’s massive energy needs as the planet gets hotter, as well as AI for the developing world. A non-binding communiqué has been in progress.
Macron is eager to promote France’s national industry, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: free, “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.
Ahead of the summit, France struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates for a major AI data center representing investments of up to $50 billion.
Launching a new app with generative AI software, the CEO of Nvidia-backed French startup Mistral told Reuters: “The French and the whole world are realising that European players count and that they provide cutting-edge technology.”

Title: Operation Devil Hunt sees 1,300 arrests in nationwide crackdown on violence in Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:14:48 +0000
Content: More than 1,300 people have been arrested by security forces in Bangladesh as part of a sweeping crackdown that began on Saturday.
The nationwide operation, dubbed “Operation Devil Hunt,” was launched by the interim government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, following a wave of violent attacks on properties linked to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s family and key members of her Awami League party.
The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government ordered ‘Operation Devil Hunt’ on Saturday after the attack on students and civilians in the Gazipur district on Friday night.
Violence broke out after students and civilians were attacked in the Gazipur district on Friday night. The unrest rapidly spread across the country, with mobs targeting symbols of the Awami League, further escalating tensions between political factions.
The joint forces involved in the operation include army personnel, police, and specialised units. To date, the authorities have arrested 1,300 people in connection with the unrest and violence that has gripped the nation over the past four days.
The interim government has vowed to root out “all Devils” that are attempting to destabilise the country, emphasising its resolve to restore order as it completes its six-month tenure in power.
One of the most alarming incidents during the violence occurred when protesters set fire to the historic residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, located in the capital Dhaka. This house holds immense national significance, as it was from here that Rahman declared Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.
In response to the growing unrest, a command centre has been established to monitor and oversee the execution of ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’ The Chief Adviser’s office confirmed that the operation is in full swing, with additional efforts to ensure law and order are maintained.
Meanwhile, the Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has called on the interim government to address the growing “mob culture” and restore peace.
The BNP has warned that failing to do so could allow “fascist” forces to rise again, leading to further instability. The party has announced plans for nationwide rallies starting February 11, demanding stronger measures to address the deteriorating law and order situation, as well as a clear electoral road map.

Title: Stock market trades lower as Trump threatens new tariff on all steel, aluminium imports
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:36:29 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened lower on Monday as US President Donald Trump threatened to start imposing a new 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, including those from Canada and Mexico.
The new tariffs are expected to be imposed from Monday (US time), with additional import duties expected later in the week. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he would also announce reciprocal tariffs, which would take effect almost immediately.
At 9.30 am, Sensex was trading at 77,575.91, down 284.28 points (0.37 per cent) while the Nifty was down 87.95 points (0.37 per cent) at 23,472.00.
Rupee also weakened by 53 paise to 87.95 against the US Dollar.
Most Nifty stocks were trading lower. JSW Steel and Tata Steel declined the most after Trump threatened to slap tariffs imports on steel and aluminium.
Nifty Pharma was also down over fears that the US tariffs can spillover from metals to pharma products. Nifty Auto and Nifty PSU Bank were the only ones in green.
Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Hero MotoCorp, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank were among major gainers on the Nifty.

Title: Parliament Budget Session to resume today
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:27:15 +0000
Content: The Budget Session of Parliament will reconvene on Monday, with both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha set to meet. The session will continue discussions on the Union Budget for 2025, along with other significant matters.
One of the key highlights of the session will be the introduction of the new Income Tax Bill, which received approval from the Union Cabinet on Friday.
The Bill aims to simplify India’s direct tax laws without imposing any new tax burdens. Instead, it seeks to streamline existing provisions, removing lengthy clauses and complex language to make the legislation more accessible. The Income Tax Bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha today.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget for 2025-26 on February 1, announced the government’s intent to introduce a new Direct Tax Code. This was part of a broader commitment to review the Income Tax Act of 1961, which was first outlined in the July 2024 Union Budget.
With budget debates now in full swing, critical issues such as the new tax laws and India’s international relations are expected to dominate the discussions in the upcoming sessions, promising a lively and action-packed day in Parliament.
Earlier last week, the fifth day of the session witnessed intense debates in the Rajya Sabha, where External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar addressed concerns over the deportation of illegal Indian migrants from the United States.
Jaishankar issued a detailed statement on the matter, saying, “We are in talks with the US government to ensure that the deported individuals are not mistreated during their flight. However, it is crucial for the House to understand that our primary focus is on cracking down on the illegal migration industry while simultaneously facilitating visas for legitimate travellers.”
The minister clarified that deportation is not a new procedure and stressed the importance of addressing both legal and illegal migration issues effectively.
Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha experienced repeated adjournments due to disruptions caused by the Opposition, which focused on the deportation issue. Despite these disturbances, proceedings continued with discussions on the Union Budget and deliberations on key legislative proposals expected to be introduced during the session.
As the session progresses, lawmakers are set to tackle several national issues, with tax reform and international relations continuing to take center stage.

Title: Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:00:38 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
“And very simply, it’s, if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
“Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defence, shipbuilding and auto,” Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X.
“We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries.”
Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japan’s Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
“Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management,” Trump said of U.S. Steel.
Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump.
QUOTA QUESTIONS
Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy.
Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump’s announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
“Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to (the U.S.), that is, 60% of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China?” Francois Legault, premier of Quebec, said on X.
“All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty.”
Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80% in 2019 after Trump’s initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China’s global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals.
MATCHING RATES
Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure “that we’re treated evenly with other countries.”
The new U.S. president has long complained about the EU’s 10% tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5%. He frequently states that Europe “won’t take our cars” but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year.
The U.S., however, enjoys a 25% tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis’ U.S. operations.
The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2%, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12% for India, 6.7% for Brazil, 5.1% for Vietnam and 2.7% for European Union countries.
BORDER STEPS
In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canada’s and Mexico’s actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline.
Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless America’s two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps.
Asked whether Mexico’s and Canada’s actions were good enough, Trump replied: “No, it’s not good enough,” Trump said. “Something has to happen, it’s not sustainable, and I’m changing it.”
Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Stock market ends lower amid Trump’s new tariff plan on steel
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:17:12 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed lower on Monday, with both the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ending in the red following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The move, which includes additional reciprocal tariffs, led to selling pressure across key indices.
The Sensex declined by 548.39 points, or 0.70%, to close at 77,311.80, fluctuating between an intraday high of 77,849.58 and a low of 77,106.89. The Nifty fell by 178.35 points, or 0.76%, settling at 23,381.60 after touching a high of 23,568.60 and a low of 23,316.30.
Selling was seen across multiple sectors, pulling down benchmark indices. Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 39 ended lower. Trent, Tata Steel, and Titan registered the biggest declines, with losses up to 4.48%. Some stocks, including Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Tata Consumer Products, and HCL Tech, ended higher with gains up to 1.74%.
Broader markets followed the same trend. The Nifty Smallcap100 and Nifty Midcap100 indices fell by 2.12% and 2.11%, respectively. Volatility remained high, with the India VIX rising by 5.55 points to 14.45. All sectoral indices on the NSE closed lower.
Analysts indicated that concerns over the implementation of new US tariffs may contribute to further market fluctuations. The Nifty continues to decline after forming a lower top on the daily chart, according to Rupak De from LKP Securities. Weak global cues and Trump’s tariff announcement also weighed on investor sentiment, said Vikram Kasat from PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher.
Gold prices saw an increase, surpassing Rs 85,800 on MCX and reaching $2,900 in spot markets. Analysts attributed this to growing trade concerns, suggesting that gold may remain in a positive range of Rs 84,000-Rs 86,500 in the coming days.

Title: Om Birla urges Maharashtra legislators to embrace constitutional values and foster constructive debates
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:00:17 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday emphasized that the Constitution of India is more than just a legal document—it is a source of inspiration for the citizens of the country.
Birla made the remarks while inaugurating an orientation programme for newly elected members of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and Council in New Delhi.
Addressing the gathering, he said, “Laws should be made for the nation and to drive socio-economic change. Our Constitution is not just a document; it serves as an inspiration for all of us.”
He congratulated Rahul Narwekar on being re-elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, stating that he will again have the opportunity to fulfill his parliamentary responsibilities.
Birla emphasized that an elected representative’s role goes beyond addressing challenges in their constituency. “They must also consider the high expectations of the people and their role in shaping social change,” he said.
He urged legislators to study the laws passed in the Assembly, noting that both in Parliament and state legislatures, attendance has been declining.
“It is not right to deliberately create disruptions in a planned manner in Parliament or legislatures,” he remarked.
He stressed the importance of meaningful discussions in the House, where both agreement and disagreement should take place constructively to guide the government effectively.
“The Question Hour is the most crucial time. Questions should be raised with full preparation. When a law is being made, members should refer to past debates and gain a complete understanding of the legislation. The role of legislators is to provide guidance to the government,” he added.
Birla urged members to ensure longer participation in Assembly proceedings, actively listening and contributing to discussions.

Title: JP Nadda launches nationwide MDA campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:27:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Jagat Prakash Nadda on Monday launched the Annual Nationwide Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Campaign for the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) through a video conference with State Health Ministers from 13 identified LF-endemic states. The event outlined the objectives of the campaign, key strategic activities, and the critical role of participating states in ensuring high coverage and compliance with the MDA program.
The MDA campaign, which targets 111 endemic districts across 13 states, involves a door-to-door administration of filaria prevention medications. The states that participated in the event included Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, with each health minister emphasizing the importance of the campaign in their respective regions.
Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and disfiguring disease. It is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea that are transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos.
Speaking at the launch, Nadda stressed the government’s commitment to eliminating LF, emphasizing the necessity of active community involvement and participation in the campaign. He stated, “An LF-free India is our commitment, and achieving this goal requires the participation of every citizen. With active community involvement, we can eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and ensure protection for crores.”
Highlighting the importance of the campaign, Nadda said that LF, commonly referred to as “Hathi Paon,” is a debilitating disease that can cause severe physical disabilities, such as swelling of the limbs and scrotal swelling, which places a significant burden on affected individuals and families. The MDA campaign, led by the National Center for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC), is designed to address this issue by providing free anti-filarial medications to over 17.5 crore people across the endemic regions.
The Union Minister emphasized that the MDA campaign, conducted twice a year, must ensure that at least 90% of the eligible population consumes the prescribed medication to halt the transmission of the disease. He urged the states to actively monitor the campaign and ensure that no one is left out. “From February 10 onwards, these medicines will be made available free of cost, and it is imperative that residents in these areas consume the medicines to protect themselves and their families,” he said.
Nadda also emphasized the importance of a “whole-of-government” approach, engaging various ministries and departments to support the campaign’s activities. He praised the use of digital technologies by states such as Uttar Pradesh and Odisha in enhancing awareness and extending the reach of the campaign.
He stressed the role of political leadership at the state and district levels to mobilize communities and ensure effective implementation. Nadda urged State Health Ministers to involve elected representatives, including Members of Parliament, Legislative Assemblies, and Panchayati Raj Institutions, to garner widespread participation and awareness.
He also mentioned that approximately 50% of lymphoedema cases receive MMDP kits annually and that surgeries for hydrocele (a common complication of LF) are available under the National Health Mission (NHM) and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
The MDA campaign aims to eliminate LF by reducing the spread of the disease, primarily through the administration of a combination of anti-filarial medicines. The regimen includes either a Double Drug (DA) treatment of Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) and Albendazole or a Triple Drug (IDA) treatment of Ivermectin, DEC, and Albendazole. These medications help eliminate the microscopic filarial parasites from the bloodstream, preventing further transmission through mosquitoes.

Title: South Korea spy agency says DeepSeek ‘excessively’ collects personal data
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 09:03:02 +0000
Content: South Korea’s spy agency has accused Chinese AI app DeepSeek of “excessively” collecting personal data and using all input data to train itself, and questioned the app’s responses to questions relating to issues of national pride.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app.
“Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies’ servers such as volceapplog.com,” the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday.
Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app, citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek.
The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users’ data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added.
DeepSeek also provided different answers to potentially sensitive questions in different languages, the NIS noted.
It cited one such question as asking for the origin of kimchi – a spicy, fermented dish that is a staple in South Korea.
When asked about it in Korean, the app said kimchi is a Korean dish, the NIS said.
Asked the same question in Chinese, it said the dish originated from China, it said. DeepSeek’s responses were corroborated by Reuters.
The origin of kimchi has at times been a source of contention between South Koreans and Chinese social media users in recent years.
DeepSeek has also been accused of censoring responses to political questions such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, which prompt the app to suggest changing the subject: “Let’s talk about something else.”
DeepSeek did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.When asked about moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law.
The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.

Title: Gold prices at record high as investors seek safety amid trade war concerns
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:44:46 +0000
Content: Gold prices on Monday surged to new record highs in the domestic futures market as uncertainty over the US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies increased demand for the yellow metal as a safe-haven investment.
According to the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, the price of 24-carat gold was Rs 8,537 per gram, while 22-carat gold was Rs 8,332 per gram.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for April 4 expiry touched an all-time high of Rs 85,384 per 10 grams in early trade.
The same contract was trading 0.51 per cent higher at Rs 85,325 per 10 grams.
In the international market, gold prices also remained near record levels due to growing fears of a global trade war. Last week, spot gold reached a new peak of $2,886.62 per ounce.
The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s latest trade decisions has pushed investors towards gold, which is traditionally considered a safe investment during times of economic and geopolitical instability.
Trump plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.
He was expected to make a formal announcement later on Monday (US time). Trump may introduce additional tariffs on several countries.
The trade policies have raised concerns about inflation in the US, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates in the near future.
Meanwhile, the gold reserves in India went up by $1.242 billion to $70.893 billion in the previous week, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
The apex bank said that the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were also up by $29 million to $17.889 billion.
Meanwhile, the rupee opened at a record low with falling by 49 paise to 87.92 against the US dollar on Monday, compared to its closing value of 87.43 on Friday.

Title: New Income Tax Bill to raise transparency in tax laws, say experts
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:32:02 +0000
Content: The government is preparing to introduce a new Income Tax Bill aimed at simplifying tax laws and improving compliance. The bill is expected to use clear language to help taxpayers understand their obligations and rights.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the bill this week, after which it will be referred to the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance for review. The proposed changes align with the government’s approach of placing trust in taxpayers before initiating scrutiny. Various stakeholders expect revisions compared to the existing income tax framework.
One of the anticipated changes is a simpler method for determining tax residency. The current system involves multiple conditions to qualify an individual as a tax resident. The bill is also expected to eliminate outdated provisions to reduce the overall complexity of tax regulations.
While the bill does not propose new taxes, it focuses on making tax compliance easier. It may also allow tax reliefs or amendments without waiting for the annual budget, enabling the government to implement changes through executive orders.
The proposal includes measures to limit scrutiny to cases of gross non-compliance, reducing unnecessary interactions between taxpayers and authorities. This is expected to lower litigation and make compliance more straightforward.
The ongoing review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, aims to modernize India’s tax system in line with economic objectives. It seeks to improve business operations, provide clarity in interpretations, and enhance tax administration. These reforms are expected to increase the tax-GDP ratio and support economic growth.
Sandeep Chaufla, Partner at Price Waterhouse and Co (PwC), said that the bill is part of a broader effort to streamline tax processes and improve efficiency.

Emphasizing the changing nature of warfare, Singh underscored the need for continuous advancements in defence technology.
“The use of drones in recent conflicts indicates that future warfare will rely on an integrated approach involving manned, unmanned, and autonomous systems,” he said.
He also noted a shift from hardware-based systems to software-driven solutions, with growing reliance on space-based communication, navigation, and surveillance systems.
Singh reiterated India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“We have taken numerous initiatives to strengthen domestic defence manufacturing. In these challenging times, where global security is fragile and technology is reshaping the battlefield, this Round Table provides an opportunity to deliberate on new processes and innovations,” he said.
The Minister also highlighted India’s emergence as a major defence exporter, citing a 31-fold increase in defence exports over the past decade compared to 2013-14.
To further streamline exports, Singh said the Defence Exim portal has simplified the authorization process, making it easier for Indian manufacturers to reach global markets.
Earlier in the day, Singh inaugurated Aero India 2025, Asia’s premier aerospace exhibition, at Yelahanka Air Force Station, Bengaluru. Comparing the event to the grand Mahakumbh Mela, he described it as a symbol of India’s strength and resilience in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
“On one hand, Prayagraj’s Mahakumbh reflects India’s cultural heritage and self-respect. On the other, Aero India is a Mahakumbh of research, courage, and armaments. While Prayagraj strengthens our spiritual traditions, Aero India strengthens our military and technological capabilities,” he remarked.
Underscoring the importance of a strong military, Singh asserted that peace cannot be ensured through weakness.
“Only by becoming stronger can India contribute to a better world order,” he stated.
With its 15th edition, Aero India 2025 is set to showcase India’s growing defence capabilities, featuring participation from global defence leaders, manufacturers, and policymakers.

Title: IIT Roorkee team finds superbug’s defense mechanism, to boost new treatments
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:27:47 +0000
Content: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee have uncovered a crucial regulatory mechanism in Acinetobacter baumannii—a highly drug-resistant superbug responsible for life-threatening infections.
Their study, published in the journal mBio, reveals how the pathogen regulates its virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms, paving the way for new treatment strategies.
Acinetobacter baumannii poses a serious threat in healthcare settings due to its ability to resist multiple antibiotics. It causes severe hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
To attack competing microbes, the superbug uses the Type 6 Secretion System (T6SS)—a bacterial secretion system that functions like a molecular weapon. However, how A. baumannii regulates its antibiotic resistance has remained unclear until now.
The research team, led by Prof. Ranjana Pathania, discovered that A. baumannii switches T6SS on or off based on environmental conditions. They found that a small RNA molecule, AbsR28, plays a key role in this regulation, influenced by manganese levels.
When manganese levels are high, AbsR28 binds to an essential gene (tssM) required for T6SS function. This not only leads to its degradation but also prevents the activation of T6SS, the researchers explained.
Increased manganese levels also enable A. baumannii to retain plasmid pAB3, which carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes.
“The study found that activating T6SS makes A. baumannii more susceptible to antibiotics and oxidative stress. So, the bacteria must carefully regulate this system to survive in different conditions,” said Prof. Pathania.
“Our discovery sheds light on how this pathogen adapts during infections, helping it evade both antibiotics and the immune system,” she added.
The findings suggest that targeting AbsR28 could disrupt the superbug’s regulatory system, making it more susceptible to antibiotics without directly attacking resistance genes. The discovery opens new avenues for precision medicine and novel drug development against multidrug-resistant infections.

Title: Students across the globe tune in to ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ as PM Modi guides youth on exam stress
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:51:18 +0000
Content: Students from Indian schools worldwide tuned in to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s highly anticipated Pariksha Pe Charcha (PPC) 2025 on Monday, as the interactive session continued to inspire young minds with its focus on stress-free learning, exam preparation, and holistic education.
The eighth edition of the initiative saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents across countries, including Japan, Australia, Nepal, Bhutan, Kenya, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. The event, designed to address exam-related anxieties and promote a positive academic outlook, was streamed live across multiple platforms, enabling students globally to engage with the Prime Minister’s insights on stress management, leadership, and personal growth.
Global Engagement in ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’
In Japan, students from India International School and Global Indian International School, alongside officials from the Indian Embassy in Tokyo, joined the event. A special screening was held at the Indian High Commission in Canberra, Australia, while in Bangladesh, Indian students and parents attended a live telecast organized by the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
Bhutan also witnessed strong participation, with students, parents, and teachers gathering at Thimphu’s Nehru–Wangchuck Cultural Centre to watch the session. The Indian Embassy in Bhutan later shared on social media that the discussion provided invaluable guidance on stress-free exams, leadership, and holistic learning.
In Nepal, Kendriya Vidyalaya Kathmandu, Modern School Kathmandu, and other CBSE institutions streamed the event, with students, teachers, and Indian Embassy officials in attendance. Meanwhile, in Qatar, dozens of Indian schools facilitated live screenings, offering students and parents the opportunity to learn directly from PM Modi’s insights on handling academic pressure.
Saudi Arabia saw thousands of Indian students from leading CBSE schools—including International Indian Schools in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Taif, Buraidah, and Majmaah—participate in the programme. Delhi Public School, International Indian Public School, and Yara International also took part. The Indian High Commission complemented the session with a special chair yoga exercise.
Kenya hosted a similar initiative, where the Indian High Commission organized a special screening of the event, followed by a yoga session to promote mindfulness and stress relief.
PM Modi’s Message
During the session, PM Modi interacted with students from classes 6 to 12, offering practical advice on managing stress, improving concentration, and preparing for exams with confidence. His motivational guidance resonated deeply with students, parents, and educators worldwide, many of whom expressed appreciation for his thoughtful approach to education and personal development.
The initiative also found strong support in India, particularly in Bihar, where students shared their reflections on the event.
Atif Akhtar, a Class 9 student, found the Prime Minister’s words especially impactful, noting how exam stress often stems from societal expectations. “The Prime Minister said students should never be under stress. Many children fear what their parents or teachers will think if they don’t score well, and this pressure affects their performance,” he said.
Drawing a parallel between exams and sports, Atif said, “A batsman doesn’t lose focus even when the crowd expects a six or a four. If he starts thinking about their expectations, he will get out. The same applies to students—they should stay focused and not let external pressure distract them.”
PM Modi also reassured students that marks are not the sole determinant of success, encouraging them to pursue their passions and long-term career goals.
Another key takeaway from the session was the Prime Minister’s emphasis on maintaining a nutritious diet. Urging students to avoid junk food, he highlighted the importance of eating traditional Indian meals, similar to those of farmers. Atif supported this advice, stating, “The Prime Minister is absolutely right. Fast food harms our health, whereas a farmer’s diet keeps them strong and healthy.”
Zeenat, a Class 8 student, appreciated PM Modi’s focus on balancing studies with enjoyment. “What I learned today is that life should be enjoyed in every moment. Exams should not be a source of stress. Parents should also understand their children’s hobbies instead of forcing them to study in isolation,” she said.
PM Modi further stressed the role of meditation and mindfulness in improving focus and reducing distractions. His words encouraged students to approach their academic journey with confidence, positivity, and self-discipline.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Gabbard clears Senate hurdle, heads to confirmation as top US spy
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:30:46 +0000
Content: The U.S. Senate voted on Monday to advance the nomination of former Representative Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, continuing President Donald Trump’s successful push to confirm even his most at-risk nominees for administration positions.
The Senate voted 52-46 on a procedural measure to limit debate on the closely watched nomination, more than the simple majority needed to clear the way for the 100-member chamber to vote on her confirmation later this week.
The vote was on party lines, with every Republican favoring advancing Gabbard’s nomination, while Democrats opposed it.
Trump’s fellow Republicans have rallied behind Gabbard, despite doubts about the 43-year-old former Democrat’s lack of significant intelligence experience and past statements seen as supporting U.S. adversaries.
The Senate Intelligence Committee last week recommended Gabbard’s nomination for consideration by the full Senate by a narrow 9-8 vote, also along party lines.
Urging support for her nomination, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Gabbard for agreeing to pare back the size of the DNI’s office, as the Trump administration wages a campaign to slash the size of many government agencies.
“I look forward to confirming Gabbard this week,” Thune said.
Some senators had questioned the choice of Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who has never served on an intelligence committee, for the position overseeing all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies after Trump announced the pick last year.
They expressed doubts about past statements seen as sympathetic toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and defense of the government of former Syria leader Bashar al-Assad, whom she visited in Syria while he was under U.S. sanction.
“Tulsi Gabbard is a walking five-alarm fire, and must be rejected, must be,” Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said in a Senate speech after the procedural vote.
At her confirmation hearing, Gabbard faced pointed questioning from senators from both parties about her past defense of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and comments seen as supportive of Russia.
While in the House of Representatives, Gabbard introduced legislation that would have dropped criminal charges against Snowden, who leaked thousands of highly classified National Security Agency documents, fled to China and then sought asylum in Russia.
Republicans more recently have praised Gabbard for now saying she would prosecute leakers and discounted concerns about her past statements about Russia and Syria.
When the 100-member Senate votes on her confirmation in a vote expected very early on Wednesday morning, Gabbard cannot afford to lose the support of more than three Republicans to still be confirmed, if Democrats remain united against her.

Laying out foundation of India’s energy ambitions, the Prime Minister said they rest on five pillars — abundant resources, brilliant minds, economic strength, political stability, strategic geography, and a commitment to global sustainability.
“The next two decades are crucial for achieving the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’, and in the next five years, we will accomplish several milestones. Many of our energy goals align with the 2030 deadline,” he said.
PM Modi outlined key targets for 2030, including the addition of 500 gigawatts of energy capacity, achieving net-zero carbon emissions for Indian Railways, and expanding green hydrogen production.
“Over the last 10 years, India has become the fifth-largest economy, doubled its solar generation capacity, and emerged as the third-largest solar power-generating nation. Our non-fossil fuel energy capacity has tripled,” he noted.
Citing India’s leadership in sustainability, the Prime Minister highlighted that India is the first country to meet the Paris G20 agreement goals, achieving a 90 percent ethanol blending rate and making significant progress in biofuels.
“India’s biofuels industry is set for rapid growth, backed by 500 million metric tons of sustainable feedstock. The Global Biofuels Alliance, established during India’s G20 presidency, continues to expand, now comprising 28 nations and 12 international organisations. This initiative is transforming waste into wealth and creating Centers of Excellence,” he said.
Discussing India’s strides in hydrocarbon resources, PM Modi mentioned key policy initiatives such as the Open Acreage License Policy (OALP), the opening of the exclusive economic zone, and the implementation of a single-window clearance system to attract investment.
He also highlighted efforts to empower ordinary families and farmers as energy providers.
“Last year, the government launched the PM Suryodaya Mukt Bijli Yojana. This scheme goes beyond energy production; it fosters new skills in the solar sector, builds a new service ecosystem, and enhances investment opportunities,” he said.
Reaffirming India’s commitment to sustainable energy, PM Modi expressed confidence that India Energy Week would foster innovation in the sector
“India is dedicated to providing energy solutions that drive our growth while preserving nature. I hope this Energy Week brings new ideas and solutions for a sustainable future,” he added.

Title: Govt strengthens workplace safety, financial support and maternity benefits for women
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:11:39 +0000
Content: The central government has taken significant steps to create a safe, secure, and non-discriminatory work environment for women. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, under the Companies Act, 2013, has introduced various measures to enhance workplace inclusivity and protection.
The Act mandates that every listed company and public company with a paid-up share capital of ₹100 crore or more, or a turnover of ₹300 crore or more, must appoint at least one woman director. Additionally, companies are required to confirm compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, in their Board Reports, which are filed annually with financial statements.
The Act also mandates the formation of an Internal Complaints Committee for organizations with ten or more employees and a Local Committee for smaller workplaces or cases involving the employer.
Financial and Entrepreneurial Support
Under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises, women entrepreneurs receive additional benefits compared to others. The Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) offers higher subsidies to women beneficiaries, encouraging their participation in small businesses. The Stand-Up India Scheme further facilitates loans between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or woman borrower per bank branch to support the establishment of new businesses.
To promote entrepreneurship among women, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III towns, the Yashasvini initiative was launched on June 27 last year, focusing on capacity-building and financial empowerment.
Maternity Benefits and Childcare Support
The government has implemented significant measures to support working mothers, ensuring maternity benefits and promoting gender equality in workplaces. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, mandates that establishments with fifty or more employees provide creche facilities, enabling women to continue working while ensuring proper care for their children.
Additionally, the Palna scheme, introduced in April 2022, offers centrally sponsored daycare services for children of working mothers, creating a supportive ecosystem that helps women balance their professional and personal responsibilities.
Strengthening Protection Against Workplace Harassment
In a major step towards addressing workplace harassment, the government launched a revamped version of the Sexual Harassment electronic-Box (SHe-Box) on August 29 last year. This centralized complaint portal provides a single-window grievance redressal mechanism for women across both organized and unorganized sectors.

However, the ministry does not track the number of individuals benefiting indirectly from the free meals.
The Seva Bhoj Yojana follows a structured process to ensure transparency and accountability in fund utilization. Institutions must first register on the NGO Darpan Portal of NITI Aayog before enrolling on the CSMS Portal of the Ministry of Culture. After enrollment, the institution submits its application and registration certificate to the Nodal Central Tax Officer in their respective State or Union Territory. The Nodal Central Tax Officer verifies the documents and issues a Unique Identity Number (UIN) to the applicant. The concerned GST Authority then reviews and verifies the CGST and IGST reimbursement claims before forwarding them to the Ministry of Culture, which provides funds to the GST Authority for disbursement to the eligible institutions.
The cultural ministry has been actively promoting the Seva Bhoj Yojana through official websites, social media platforms, and other communication channels to ensure that all eligible charitable and religious organizations, across various communities, benefit from the scheme.

Title: NITI Aayog launches policy report on strengthening State Public Universities
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:16:28 +0000
Content: A policy report offering insights into the standards of state public universities across India was released by NITI Aayog on Monday.
Titled Expanding Quality Higher Education through States and State Public Universities, the report was launched by Suman Bery, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, alongside CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam and other senior officials.
According to NITI Aayog, this first-of-its-kind document provides a comprehensive analysis of key indicators such as quality, funding, governance, and employability trends in state public universities (SPUs) over the past decade.
The report draws on extensive stakeholder consultations, involving higher education officials from over 20 states and union territories, vice-chancellors from 50 SPUs, and leaders from state higher education councils.
Speaking at the launch, Bery emphasized the importance of SPUs in setting high academic standards, drawing comparisons with public universities in countries like the U.S. and Brazil. He reiterated NITI Aayog’s role in research and evidence-building, while implementation falls under the purview of central and state ministries.
Dr. Vinod Kumar Paul, Member (Education), linked the report’s findings to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and India’s vision for ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’. He stressed that since 80% of India’s higher education takes place in SPUs, strengthening them is essential for human capital development.
Subrahmanyam highlighted that by 2035, NEP 2020 aims to double higher education enrollment to nearly nine crore students, with around seven crore studying in SPUs. He underscored the urgency for these universities to shift from merely providing access to education to delivering world-class academic standards.
Secretary of the Department of Higher Education, Vineet Joshi, pointed to recent budget initiatives such as the selection of 10,000 PM Research Fellows, the expansion of second-generation IITs, and the Bharatiya Bhasha textbook scheme to promote regional language education. He also noted the allocation of ₹13,000 crore under PM-USHA from 2023-24 to 2025-26, with ₹100 crore designated per SPU for their transformation into Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
Dr. Pankaj Mittal, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), highlighted that the report addresses three major challenges identified by vice chancellors: funding constraints, governance reforms, and capacity building for faculty and administrators.
The report provides nearly 80 policy recommendations with short, medium, and long-term implementation strategies. It outlines steps to improve research quality, pedagogy, and curriculum, strengthen governance frameworks, increase industry-academia collaboration, and enhance financial sustainability.

Title: Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:05:00 +0000
Content: A consortium led by Elon Musk said on Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire’s fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm.
Musk’s bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the ChatGPT maker at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”
Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House.
OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.
Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure.
Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.
“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement on Monday. “We will make sure that happens.”
Altman told staff in a message that the company’s board of directors intends to make clear it has no interest in Musk’s “supposed bid”, according to a report by The Information on Monday.
Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Emanuel Capital and others.
xAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Musk’s offer earlier on Monday. xAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters.
‘THROWING A WRENCH’
“This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,” said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance.
“The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it’s a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit.”
OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January.
Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.
Musk’s stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of X, which was then called Twitter, in 2022.
To finance such a bid, Musk could sell part of his stake in Tesla or take a loan against his stake, or use his stake in rocket company SpaceX that is worth tens of billions of dollars as collateral, according to an uninvolved investment banker, who requested anonymity.
“Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.
“The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors … OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.”

Title: India in AI Action Summit in France: Global Talks, Local Impact
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:00:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to co-host the AI Action Summit in France, marking the third summit in this series, following previous editions held in the UK in 2023 and South Korea in 2024. With recent developments in AI, such as the release of Deepseek’s disruptive AI version and extensive commitments made by US President Trump for AI innovation and development, it becomes imperative to understand how AI directly impacts people’s lives.
A detailed examination of the real concerns surrounding AI taking away jobs, and why the world is racing to advance AI, must be provided for a more realistic perspective.
What is the AI Action Summit and what is at stake for its hosts?
The AI Action Summit is the latest event in a series of global dialogues focused on AI governance. This year, the summit is being held in France, co-hosted by Prime Minister Modi and President Macron. The summit’s objectives center around tech sovereignty, the development of environmentally friendly AI, AI accessibility, and global governance.
Macron has repeatedly emphasized the importance of “tech sovereignty” at the heart of this summit, which is especially significant as the USA and China, two giants in the field, compete for a dominant position in the AI landscape.
For India and France, both of which have tremendous potential for technological innovation and application, this summit provides an opportunity to recalibrate how the world views AI advancements.
Macron has advocated for over $100 billion in AI investments, while India has its own AI mission and is recognized globally for its ability to drive scientific innovations at a fraction of the cost. Consequently, France and India position themselves as leaders in the AI revolution with a global perspective, offering alternatives to the currently dominant forces.
Impact of AI on daily lives and the significance of such summits
From recommendations on social media to self-driving cars, AI is embedded in a dense network of applications that shape daily life. AI can be understood as algorithms designed to simulate human intelligence. Often perceived as a high-end technology that will disrupt markets and societal functioning, AI should instead be viewed as a technology that enhances human capacity, supplementing human intelligence rather than replacing it.
Just as the Industrial Revolution reshaped economic balances, AI now sits at the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While it is inevitable that AI will transform labor markets, it will also generate new jobs and open new markets. McKinsey Global estimates that AI will create around 50 million jobs by 2030, leading to increased demand for AI specialists.
With automation and AI assistance, new avenues for exploration will emerge. Summits like the AI Action Summit help establish a global framework for AI development and application, redefine public-private partnerships, and ensure an equitable and just future in the context of technology.
These summits promote dialogue on the scope of AI’s development while providing a global platform to discuss its applications. As society and industry learn to grow with AI, these summits ensure its adoption is fair, effective, and sustainable.
What to expect in the future for India?
India’s leadership role in global technology governance is underscored by its co-chairmanship of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. The country has already announced its own AI model and is working on the India AI Mission, launched in March 2024.
The AI model begins with a computational facility of roughly 10,000 GPUs, with 8,693 more GPUs to be added. While global models’ computational costs range from $2.5 to $3 per hour, India’s AI model will cost less than half that after a 40% government subsidy.
In 2024, India also hosted the Global IndiaAI Summit, marking a significant milestone in the country’s AI journey, bringing together over 12,000 global AI experts, practitioners, and delegates from 50 countries.
With one of the youngest populations and a leader in trained technologists, India stands as one of the most fertile grounds for the future of AI’s advancement. According to BCG, India’s AI market is growing at a CAGR of 25-35% and is projected to reach around $17 billion by 2027.
With its vast talent pool, growing digital infrastructure, and government initiatives India stands at the helm of this revolution. As PM Modi has iterated, AI in India does not stand just for artificial intelligence but also for Aspirational India.
Therefore, The AI Action Summit represents a pivotal moment in shaping the global AI landscape. Co-hosted by India and France, this summit not only showcases the countries’ leadership in AI development but also emphasizes the importance of tech sovereignty, responsible governance, and equitable access.
As AI continues to impact daily life from job creation to market disruption the summit’s discussions on its ethical and sustainable deployment are vital. India’s focus on affordable AI and its growing influence in global technology governance strengthens its position in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Moving forward, these global dialogues will ensure that AI’s benefits are shared universally, while mitigating its challenges, thus fostering a future where technology shapes society in a sustainable manner, a future where technology is for all.
