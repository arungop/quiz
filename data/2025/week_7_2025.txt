Title: New Zealand concerns mount as Cook Islands PM plans to sign agreement with China
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 06:41:59 +0000
Content: Concerns are mounting in New Zealand as the Cook Islands’ Prime Minister travels to China this week to sign agreements without properly consulting with New Zealand, despite the two nations’ constitutional ties.
New Zealand has become increasingly concerned about China’s growing presence in the Pacific region and the threats it poses to the country’s national security.
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday at a press conference New Zealand expected transparency and consultation with Cook Islands after its prime minister, Mark Brown, flagged he was heading to China seeking a partnership in national development including infrastructure, trade and the economy.
The Cook Islands is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand which provides budget support and commits to defend the South Pacific nation whose people are New Zealand citizens.
“Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, in matters of defence and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,” Luxon said.
He added that once New Zealand knew what was in the agreement, the government would decide how to respond.
New Zealand had made repeated requests to the Cook Islands to share or consult on the contents of agreements that Brown plans to sign with China but had not received a proper response, raising significant concern, deputy prime minister Winston Peter’s office said in a statement on Sunday.
“To those who suggest that our engagement with China is somehow secretive, I reject that completely,” Brown said in a video statement on Cook Islands Television News Facebook page on Friday.
“We have always conducted our international affairs with integrity and transparency. Every agreement we enter into will be in the best interest of the Cook Islands,” he said. He did not provide specifics of the agreement.
Cook Islanders have also questioned secrecy around the agreement. Tina Browne, leader of the opposition Democratic party told New Zealand based radio station 531pn that people were concerned about the lack of consultation firstly about the Cook Islands’ passportand not the agreement with China.
“If there is nothing to hide, why are we not consulting with New Zealand?” Browne said.
The Cook Islands lie halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are made up of 15 islands and atolls spread over 700 square miles (1.9 million square kilometres)
The country in 2021 had a population of 15,040.
ONGOING NEW ZEALAND RELATIONSHIP
The Cook Islands was within the New Zealand borders from 1901. In 1965, it became self governing but in free association with New Zealand. It is a realm country of New Zealand, along with Niue and Tokelau.
It has its own government and King Charles III is head of state.
Cook Islanders have New Zealand citizenship and passports. They have the same rights as a New Zealander such as the ability to work, go to school and use the medical system.
There is no Cook Islands passport or citizenship. Cook Island’s Prime Minister Mark Brown had mooted a Cook Islands passport and citizenship but backed down after New Zealand said Cook Islanders could not hold both and any change would need to be decided by referendum.
Around 94,000 Cook Islands Maori live in New Zealand and over 7,000 live in Australia.
Under the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration, the Cook Island’s is able to interact with the international community as an independent state. Any action taken in New Zealand for the foreign affairs of the Cook Islands will be at their request.
However, both New Zealand and the Cook Islands undertook in the declaration to consult regularly on foreign affairs matters, cooperate in pursuit of common foreign relation objectives and advise each other when a proposed foreign policy initiative may affect the rights, obligations and interests of the other.
It also outlines that New Zealand will continue to assist with the defence of the Cook Islands if requested and that the two countries will consult regularly on defence and security agreements.
It does not qualify for United Nations membership. In 2023, the United States recognised the Cook Islands as a sovereign and independent state.

Title: Tirupati laddu row: SIT arrests four in adulteration case
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:36:14 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested four individuals over the alleged adulteration of the sacred Tirumala temple laddu.
The arrested individuals are associated with organizations that supplied ghee, including AR Dairy (Tamil Nadu), Parag Dairy (Uttar Pradesh), Premier Agri Foods, and Alpha Milk Foods. Those arrested are Bipin Jain and Pomil Jain, former directors of Bhole Baba Dairy (Roorkee, Uttarakhand); Vaishnavi Dairy (Poonambakkam) CEO Apoorva Vinay Kant Chawda; and AR Dairy (Dundigal) MD Raju Rajasekharan.
The accused were interrogated for three days in Tirupati but were found to be uncooperative despite primary evidence of their involvement.
The SIT conducted inspections at Tirumala, Tirupati, and AR Dairy’s facility in Tamil Nadu. Investigations revealed that AR Dairy, which had a contract with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), was guilty of multiple irregularities.
According to an official release, representatives of Vaishnavi Dairy secured tenders under the name of AR Dairy for ghee supply. They allegedly fabricated false documents and seals, misusing the AR Dairy name to manipulate the tender process.
Vaishnavi Dairy also created fake records claiming to have sourced ghee from Bhole Baba Dairy in Roorkee. However, authorities found that Bhole Baba Dairy lacked the capacity to supply such large quantities of ghee.
The SIT comprises Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Hyderabad Division Joint Director Viresh Prabhu, Visakha CBI SP Muraliramba, DIG Gopinath Jetty, IG Sarvashrestha Tripathi, and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) officer Satyakumar Panda.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had alleged on September 18 that the ghee used for making Tirupati laddus during the YSR Congress Party’s rule was adulterated with animal fat, triggering outrage among devotees of the famous temple.
The state government initially constituted a SIT to probe the allegations. However, the Supreme Court later replaced it with a SIT comprising both central and state officials.
TTD uses 15,000 kg of cow ghee daily for preparing Tirumala laddus.
According to officials, AR Foods from Tamil Nadu had secured a tender to supply ghee at ₹320 per kg. On July 8, 2024, eight tankers of ghee arrived, and four of them were sent to laboratories for testing.
On July 17, NDDB Lab reports confirmed the presence of adulterants in the ghee.

Title: Paris AI summit draws world leaders and CEOs eager for technology wave
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:31:58 +0000
Content: World leaders and technology executives are convening in Paris on Monday to discuss how to safely embrace artificial intelligence at a time of mounting resistance to heavy-handed red tape that businesses say stifles innovation.
Eagerness to rein in AI has waned since previous AI summits in Britain and South Korea that focused world powers’ attention on technology’s risks after ChatGPT’s viral launch in 2022.
As U.S. President Donald Trump tears up his predecessor’s AI guardrails to promote U.S. competitiveness, pressure has built on EU policymakers to pursue a lighter-touch approach to AI to help keep European firms in the tech race.
Some EU leaders, including summit host French President Emmanuel Macron, and tech companies are hoping flexibility will be applied to the bloc’s new AI Act to help homegrown startups.
“There’s a risk some decide to have no rules and that’s dangerous. But there’s also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules,” Macron told regional French newspapers in an interview published on Friday.
“We should not be afraid of innovation,” he said.
Trump’s early moves on AI underscored how far the strategies to regulate AI in the United States, China and EU have diverged.
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. Brussels is finalising an accompanying code of practice.
Moreover, Trump’s brakes-off approach has emboldened the regulation-cautious U.S. Big Tech groups from which Europe needs to seek investment, said British think-tank Chatham House.
Meanwhile, China’s DeepSeek challenged U.S. and British AI leadership last month by freely distributing a human-like reasoning system, galvanizing geopolitical and industry rivals to race faster still.
“An unpredictable global scramble to develop AI is underway, as the U.S. turns inward and China boasts new capabilities,” Chatham House said.
Trump is not sending the U.S. AI Safety Institute to Paris, in a troubling sign to those hoping for global risk-based rules governing AI.
COMPETITIVENESS
Top political leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and China’s Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the summit. Others on the attendance list are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
Macron is due to meet with Guoqing on Monday and Vance on Tuesday, the Elysee said. The plenary session is on February 11.
Top executives such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are slated to give talks as well. Executives will partake in an invitation-only dinner with political leaders on Monday.
Google Senior Vice President James Manyika said at a press reception on Sunday that the opportunities from AI were now in “much greater focus.”
Delegations are also expected to discuss how to manage AI’s massive energy needs as the planet gets hotter, as well as AI for the developing world. A non-binding communiqué has been in progress.
Macron is eager to promote France’s national industry, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: free, “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.
Ahead of the summit, France struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates for a major AI data center representing investments of up to $50 billion.
Launching a new app with generative AI software, the CEO of Nvidia-backed French startup Mistral told Reuters: “The French and the whole world are realising that European players count and that they provide cutting-edge technology.”

Title: Operation Devil Hunt sees 1,300 arrests in nationwide crackdown on violence in Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:14:48 +0000
Content: More than 1,300 people have been arrested by security forces in Bangladesh as part of a sweeping crackdown that began on Saturday.
The nationwide operation, dubbed “Operation Devil Hunt,” was launched by the interim government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, following a wave of violent attacks on properties linked to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s family and key members of her Awami League party.
The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government ordered ‘Operation Devil Hunt’ on Saturday after the attack on students and civilians in the Gazipur district on Friday night.
Violence broke out after students and civilians were attacked in the Gazipur district on Friday night. The unrest rapidly spread across the country, with mobs targeting symbols of the Awami League, further escalating tensions between political factions.
The joint forces involved in the operation include army personnel, police, and specialised units. To date, the authorities have arrested 1,300 people in connection with the unrest and violence that has gripped the nation over the past four days.
The interim government has vowed to root out “all Devils” that are attempting to destabilise the country, emphasising its resolve to restore order as it completes its six-month tenure in power.
One of the most alarming incidents during the violence occurred when protesters set fire to the historic residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, located in the capital Dhaka. This house holds immense national significance, as it was from here that Rahman declared Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.
In response to the growing unrest, a command centre has been established to monitor and oversee the execution of ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’ The Chief Adviser’s office confirmed that the operation is in full swing, with additional efforts to ensure law and order are maintained.
Meanwhile, the Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has called on the interim government to address the growing “mob culture” and restore peace.
The BNP has warned that failing to do so could allow “fascist” forces to rise again, leading to further instability. The party has announced plans for nationwide rallies starting February 11, demanding stronger measures to address the deteriorating law and order situation, as well as a clear electoral road map.

Title: Stock market trades lower as Trump threatens new tariff on all steel, aluminium imports
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:36:29 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened lower on Monday as US President Donald Trump threatened to start imposing a new 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, including those from Canada and Mexico.
The new tariffs are expected to be imposed from Monday (US time), with additional import duties expected later in the week. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he would also announce reciprocal tariffs, which would take effect almost immediately.
At 9.30 am, Sensex was trading at 77,575.91, down 284.28 points (0.37 per cent) while the Nifty was down 87.95 points (0.37 per cent) at 23,472.00.
Rupee also weakened by 53 paise to 87.95 against the US Dollar.
Most Nifty stocks were trading lower. JSW Steel and Tata Steel declined the most after Trump threatened to slap tariffs imports on steel and aluminium.
Nifty Pharma was also down over fears that the US tariffs can spillover from metals to pharma products. Nifty Auto and Nifty PSU Bank were the only ones in green.
Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Hero MotoCorp, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank were among major gainers on the Nifty.

Title: Parliament Budget Session to resume today
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:27:15 +0000
Content: The Budget Session of Parliament will reconvene on Monday, with both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha set to meet. The session will continue discussions on the Union Budget for 2025, along with other significant matters.
One of the key highlights of the session will be the introduction of the new Income Tax Bill, which received approval from the Union Cabinet on Friday.
The Bill aims to simplify India’s direct tax laws without imposing any new tax burdens. Instead, it seeks to streamline existing provisions, removing lengthy clauses and complex language to make the legislation more accessible. The Income Tax Bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha today.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget for 2025-26 on February 1, announced the government’s intent to introduce a new Direct Tax Code. This was part of a broader commitment to review the Income Tax Act of 1961, which was first outlined in the July 2024 Union Budget.
With budget debates now in full swing, critical issues such as the new tax laws and India’s international relations are expected to dominate the discussions in the upcoming sessions, promising a lively and action-packed day in Parliament.
Earlier last week, the fifth day of the session witnessed intense debates in the Rajya Sabha, where External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar addressed concerns over the deportation of illegal Indian migrants from the United States.
Jaishankar issued a detailed statement on the matter, saying, “We are in talks with the US government to ensure that the deported individuals are not mistreated during their flight. However, it is crucial for the House to understand that our primary focus is on cracking down on the illegal migration industry while simultaneously facilitating visas for legitimate travellers.”
The minister clarified that deportation is not a new procedure and stressed the importance of addressing both legal and illegal migration issues effectively.
Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha experienced repeated adjournments due to disruptions caused by the Opposition, which focused on the deportation issue. Despite these disturbances, proceedings continued with discussions on the Union Budget and deliberations on key legislative proposals expected to be introduced during the session.
As the session progresses, lawmakers are set to tackle several national issues, with tax reform and international relations continuing to take center stage.

Title: Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:00:38 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
“And very simply, it’s, if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
“Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defence, shipbuilding and auto,” Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X.
“We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries.”
Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japan’s Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
“Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management,” Trump said of U.S. Steel.
Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump.
QUOTA QUESTIONS
Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy.
Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump’s announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
“Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to (the U.S.), that is, 60% of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China?” Francois Legault, premier of Quebec, said on X.
“All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty.”
Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80% in 2019 after Trump’s initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China’s global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals.
MATCHING RATES
Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure “that we’re treated evenly with other countries.”
The new U.S. president has long complained about the EU’s 10% tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5%. He frequently states that Europe “won’t take our cars” but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year.
The U.S., however, enjoys a 25% tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis’ U.S. operations.
The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2%, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12% for India, 6.7% for Brazil, 5.1% for Vietnam and 2.7% for European Union countries.
BORDER STEPS
In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canada’s and Mexico’s actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline.
Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless America’s two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps.
Asked whether Mexico’s and Canada’s actions were good enough, Trump replied: “No, it’s not good enough,” Trump said. “Something has to happen, it’s not sustainable, and I’m changing it.”
Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Stock market ends lower amid Trump’s new tariff plan on steel
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:17:12 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed lower on Monday, with both the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ending in the red following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The move, which includes additional reciprocal tariffs, led to selling pressure across key indices.
The Sensex declined by 548.39 points, or 0.70%, to close at 77,311.80, fluctuating between an intraday high of 77,849.58 and a low of 77,106.89. The Nifty fell by 178.35 points, or 0.76%, settling at 23,381.60 after touching a high of 23,568.60 and a low of 23,316.30.
Selling was seen across multiple sectors, pulling down benchmark indices. Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 39 ended lower. Trent, Tata Steel, and Titan registered the biggest declines, with losses up to 4.48%. Some stocks, including Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Tata Consumer Products, and HCL Tech, ended higher with gains up to 1.74%.
Broader markets followed the same trend. The Nifty Smallcap100 and Nifty Midcap100 indices fell by 2.12% and 2.11%, respectively. Volatility remained high, with the India VIX rising by 5.55 points to 14.45. All sectoral indices on the NSE closed lower.
Analysts indicated that concerns over the implementation of new US tariffs may contribute to further market fluctuations. The Nifty continues to decline after forming a lower top on the daily chart, according to Rupak De from LKP Securities. Weak global cues and Trump’s tariff announcement also weighed on investor sentiment, said Vikram Kasat from PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher.
Gold prices saw an increase, surpassing Rs 85,800 on MCX and reaching $2,900 in spot markets. Analysts attributed this to growing trade concerns, suggesting that gold may remain in a positive range of Rs 84,000-Rs 86,500 in the coming days.

Title: Om Birla urges Maharashtra legislators to embrace constitutional values and foster constructive debates
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:00:17 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday emphasized that the Constitution of India is more than just a legal document—it is a source of inspiration for the citizens of the country.
Birla made the remarks while inaugurating an orientation programme for newly elected members of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and Council in New Delhi.
Addressing the gathering, he said, “Laws should be made for the nation and to drive socio-economic change. Our Constitution is not just a document; it serves as an inspiration for all of us.”
He congratulated Rahul Narwekar on being re-elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, stating that he will again have the opportunity to fulfill his parliamentary responsibilities.
Birla emphasized that an elected representative’s role goes beyond addressing challenges in their constituency. “They must also consider the high expectations of the people and their role in shaping social change,” he said.
He urged legislators to study the laws passed in the Assembly, noting that both in Parliament and state legislatures, attendance has been declining.
“It is not right to deliberately create disruptions in a planned manner in Parliament or legislatures,” he remarked.
He stressed the importance of meaningful discussions in the House, where both agreement and disagreement should take place constructively to guide the government effectively.
“The Question Hour is the most crucial time. Questions should be raised with full preparation. When a law is being made, members should refer to past debates and gain a complete understanding of the legislation. The role of legislators is to provide guidance to the government,” he added.
Birla urged members to ensure longer participation in Assembly proceedings, actively listening and contributing to discussions.

Title: JP Nadda launches nationwide MDA campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:27:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Jagat Prakash Nadda on Monday launched the Annual Nationwide Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Campaign for the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) through a video conference with State Health Ministers from 13 identified LF-endemic states. The event outlined the objectives of the campaign, key strategic activities, and the critical role of participating states in ensuring high coverage and compliance with the MDA program.
The MDA campaign, which targets 111 endemic districts across 13 states, involves a door-to-door administration of filaria prevention medications. The states that participated in the event included Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, with each health minister emphasizing the importance of the campaign in their respective regions.
Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and disfiguring disease. It is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea that are transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos.
Speaking at the launch, Nadda stressed the government’s commitment to eliminating LF, emphasizing the necessity of active community involvement and participation in the campaign. He stated, “An LF-free India is our commitment, and achieving this goal requires the participation of every citizen. With active community involvement, we can eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and ensure protection for crores.”
Highlighting the importance of the campaign, Nadda said that LF, commonly referred to as “Hathi Paon,” is a debilitating disease that can cause severe physical disabilities, such as swelling of the limbs and scrotal swelling, which places a significant burden on affected individuals and families. The MDA campaign, led by the National Center for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC), is designed to address this issue by providing free anti-filarial medications to over 17.5 crore people across the endemic regions.
The Union Minister emphasized that the MDA campaign, conducted twice a year, must ensure that at least 90% of the eligible population consumes the prescribed medication to halt the transmission of the disease. He urged the states to actively monitor the campaign and ensure that no one is left out. “From February 10 onwards, these medicines will be made available free of cost, and it is imperative that residents in these areas consume the medicines to protect themselves and their families,” he said.
Nadda also emphasized the importance of a “whole-of-government” approach, engaging various ministries and departments to support the campaign’s activities. He praised the use of digital technologies by states such as Uttar Pradesh and Odisha in enhancing awareness and extending the reach of the campaign.
He stressed the role of political leadership at the state and district levels to mobilize communities and ensure effective implementation. Nadda urged State Health Ministers to involve elected representatives, including Members of Parliament, Legislative Assemblies, and Panchayati Raj Institutions, to garner widespread participation and awareness.
He also mentioned that approximately 50% of lymphoedema cases receive MMDP kits annually and that surgeries for hydrocele (a common complication of LF) are available under the National Health Mission (NHM) and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
The MDA campaign aims to eliminate LF by reducing the spread of the disease, primarily through the administration of a combination of anti-filarial medicines. The regimen includes either a Double Drug (DA) treatment of Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC) and Albendazole or a Triple Drug (IDA) treatment of Ivermectin, DEC, and Albendazole. These medications help eliminate the microscopic filarial parasites from the bloodstream, preventing further transmission through mosquitoes.

Title: South Korea spy agency says DeepSeek ‘excessively’ collects personal data
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 09:03:02 +0000
Content: South Korea’s spy agency has accused Chinese AI app DeepSeek of “excessively” collecting personal data and using all input data to train itself, and questioned the app’s responses to questions relating to issues of national pride.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app.
“Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies’ servers such as volceapplog.com,” the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday.
Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app, citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek.
The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users’ data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added.
DeepSeek also provided different answers to potentially sensitive questions in different languages, the NIS noted.
It cited one such question as asking for the origin of kimchi – a spicy, fermented dish that is a staple in South Korea.
When asked about it in Korean, the app said kimchi is a Korean dish, the NIS said.
Asked the same question in Chinese, it said the dish originated from China, it said. DeepSeek’s responses were corroborated by Reuters.
The origin of kimchi has at times been a source of contention between South Koreans and Chinese social media users in recent years.
DeepSeek has also been accused of censoring responses to political questions such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, which prompt the app to suggest changing the subject: “Let’s talk about something else.”
DeepSeek did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.When asked about moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law.
The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.

Title: Gold prices at record high as investors seek safety amid trade war concerns
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:44:46 +0000
Content: Gold prices on Monday surged to new record highs in the domestic futures market as uncertainty over the US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies increased demand for the yellow metal as a safe-haven investment.
According to the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, the price of 24-carat gold was Rs 8,537 per gram, while 22-carat gold was Rs 8,332 per gram.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for April 4 expiry touched an all-time high of Rs 85,384 per 10 grams in early trade.
The same contract was trading 0.51 per cent higher at Rs 85,325 per 10 grams.
In the international market, gold prices also remained near record levels due to growing fears of a global trade war. Last week, spot gold reached a new peak of $2,886.62 per ounce.
The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s latest trade decisions has pushed investors towards gold, which is traditionally considered a safe investment during times of economic and geopolitical instability.
Trump plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.
He was expected to make a formal announcement later on Monday (US time). Trump may introduce additional tariffs on several countries.
The trade policies have raised concerns about inflation in the US, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates in the near future.
Meanwhile, the gold reserves in India went up by $1.242 billion to $70.893 billion in the previous week, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
The apex bank said that the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were also up by $29 million to $17.889 billion.
Meanwhile, the rupee opened at a record low with falling by 49 paise to 87.92 against the US dollar on Monday, compared to its closing value of 87.43 on Friday.

Title: New Income Tax Bill to raise transparency in tax laws, say experts
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:32:02 +0000
Content: The government is preparing to introduce a new Income Tax Bill aimed at simplifying tax laws and improving compliance. The bill is expected to use clear language to help taxpayers understand their obligations and rights.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the bill this week, after which it will be referred to the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance for review. The proposed changes align with the government’s approach of placing trust in taxpayers before initiating scrutiny. Various stakeholders expect revisions compared to the existing income tax framework.
One of the anticipated changes is a simpler method for determining tax residency. The current system involves multiple conditions to qualify an individual as a tax resident. The bill is also expected to eliminate outdated provisions to reduce the overall complexity of tax regulations.
While the bill does not propose new taxes, it focuses on making tax compliance easier. It may also allow tax reliefs or amendments without waiting for the annual budget, enabling the government to implement changes through executive orders.
The proposal includes measures to limit scrutiny to cases of gross non-compliance, reducing unnecessary interactions between taxpayers and authorities. This is expected to lower litigation and make compliance more straightforward.
The ongoing review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, aims to modernize India’s tax system in line with economic objectives. It seeks to improve business operations, provide clarity in interpretations, and enhance tax administration. These reforms are expected to increase the tax-GDP ratio and support economic growth.
Sandeep Chaufla, Partner at Price Waterhouse and Co (PwC), said that the bill is part of a broader effort to streamline tax processes and improve efficiency.

Emphasizing the changing nature of warfare, Singh underscored the need for continuous advancements in defence technology.
“The use of drones in recent conflicts indicates that future warfare will rely on an integrated approach involving manned, unmanned, and autonomous systems,” he said.
He also noted a shift from hardware-based systems to software-driven solutions, with growing reliance on space-based communication, navigation, and surveillance systems.
Singh reiterated India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“We have taken numerous initiatives to strengthen domestic defence manufacturing. In these challenging times, where global security is fragile and technology is reshaping the battlefield, this Round Table provides an opportunity to deliberate on new processes and innovations,” he said.
The Minister also highlighted India’s emergence as a major defence exporter, citing a 31-fold increase in defence exports over the past decade compared to 2013-14.
To further streamline exports, Singh said the Defence Exim portal has simplified the authorization process, making it easier for Indian manufacturers to reach global markets.
Earlier in the day, Singh inaugurated Aero India 2025, Asia’s premier aerospace exhibition, at Yelahanka Air Force Station, Bengaluru. Comparing the event to the grand Mahakumbh Mela, he described it as a symbol of India’s strength and resilience in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
“On one hand, Prayagraj’s Mahakumbh reflects India’s cultural heritage and self-respect. On the other, Aero India is a Mahakumbh of research, courage, and armaments. While Prayagraj strengthens our spiritual traditions, Aero India strengthens our military and technological capabilities,” he remarked.
Underscoring the importance of a strong military, Singh asserted that peace cannot be ensured through weakness.
“Only by becoming stronger can India contribute to a better world order,” he stated.
With its 15th edition, Aero India 2025 is set to showcase India’s growing defence capabilities, featuring participation from global defence leaders, manufacturers, and policymakers.

Title: IIT Roorkee team finds superbug’s defense mechanism, to boost new treatments
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:27:47 +0000
Content: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee have uncovered a crucial regulatory mechanism in Acinetobacter baumannii—a highly drug-resistant superbug responsible for life-threatening infections.
Their study, published in the journal mBio, reveals how the pathogen regulates its virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms, paving the way for new treatment strategies.
Acinetobacter baumannii poses a serious threat in healthcare settings due to its ability to resist multiple antibiotics. It causes severe hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
To attack competing microbes, the superbug uses the Type 6 Secretion System (T6SS)—a bacterial secretion system that functions like a molecular weapon. However, how A. baumannii regulates its antibiotic resistance has remained unclear until now.
The research team, led by Prof. Ranjana Pathania, discovered that A. baumannii switches T6SS on or off based on environmental conditions. They found that a small RNA molecule, AbsR28, plays a key role in this regulation, influenced by manganese levels.
When manganese levels are high, AbsR28 binds to an essential gene (tssM) required for T6SS function. This not only leads to its degradation but also prevents the activation of T6SS, the researchers explained.
Increased manganese levels also enable A. baumannii to retain plasmid pAB3, which carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes.
“The study found that activating T6SS makes A. baumannii more susceptible to antibiotics and oxidative stress. So, the bacteria must carefully regulate this system to survive in different conditions,” said Prof. Pathania.
“Our discovery sheds light on how this pathogen adapts during infections, helping it evade both antibiotics and the immune system,” she added.
The findings suggest that targeting AbsR28 could disrupt the superbug’s regulatory system, making it more susceptible to antibiotics without directly attacking resistance genes. The discovery opens new avenues for precision medicine and novel drug development against multidrug-resistant infections.

Title: Students across the globe tune in to ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ as PM Modi guides youth on exam stress
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:51:18 +0000
Content: Students from Indian schools worldwide tuned in to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s highly anticipated Pariksha Pe Charcha (PPC) 2025 on Monday, as the interactive session continued to inspire young minds with its focus on stress-free learning, exam preparation, and holistic education.
The eighth edition of the initiative saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents across countries, including Japan, Australia, Nepal, Bhutan, Kenya, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. The event, designed to address exam-related anxieties and promote a positive academic outlook, was streamed live across multiple platforms, enabling students globally to engage with the Prime Minister’s insights on stress management, leadership, and personal growth.
Global Engagement in ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’
In Japan, students from India International School and Global Indian International School, alongside officials from the Indian Embassy in Tokyo, joined the event. A special screening was held at the Indian High Commission in Canberra, Australia, while in Bangladesh, Indian students and parents attended a live telecast organized by the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
Bhutan also witnessed strong participation, with students, parents, and teachers gathering at Thimphu’s Nehru–Wangchuck Cultural Centre to watch the session. The Indian Embassy in Bhutan later shared on social media that the discussion provided invaluable guidance on stress-free exams, leadership, and holistic learning.
In Nepal, Kendriya Vidyalaya Kathmandu, Modern School Kathmandu, and other CBSE institutions streamed the event, with students, teachers, and Indian Embassy officials in attendance. Meanwhile, in Qatar, dozens of Indian schools facilitated live screenings, offering students and parents the opportunity to learn directly from PM Modi’s insights on handling academic pressure.
Saudi Arabia saw thousands of Indian students from leading CBSE schools—including International Indian Schools in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Taif, Buraidah, and Majmaah—participate in the programme. Delhi Public School, International Indian Public School, and Yara International also took part. The Indian High Commission complemented the session with a special chair yoga exercise.
Kenya hosted a similar initiative, where the Indian High Commission organized a special screening of the event, followed by a yoga session to promote mindfulness and stress relief.
PM Modi’s Message
During the session, PM Modi interacted with students from classes 6 to 12, offering practical advice on managing stress, improving concentration, and preparing for exams with confidence. His motivational guidance resonated deeply with students, parents, and educators worldwide, many of whom expressed appreciation for his thoughtful approach to education and personal development.
The initiative also found strong support in India, particularly in Bihar, where students shared their reflections on the event.
Atif Akhtar, a Class 9 student, found the Prime Minister’s words especially impactful, noting how exam stress often stems from societal expectations. “The Prime Minister said students should never be under stress. Many children fear what their parents or teachers will think if they don’t score well, and this pressure affects their performance,” he said.
Drawing a parallel between exams and sports, Atif said, “A batsman doesn’t lose focus even when the crowd expects a six or a four. If he starts thinking about their expectations, he will get out. The same applies to students—they should stay focused and not let external pressure distract them.”
PM Modi also reassured students that marks are not the sole determinant of success, encouraging them to pursue their passions and long-term career goals.
Another key takeaway from the session was the Prime Minister’s emphasis on maintaining a nutritious diet. Urging students to avoid junk food, he highlighted the importance of eating traditional Indian meals, similar to those of farmers. Atif supported this advice, stating, “The Prime Minister is absolutely right. Fast food harms our health, whereas a farmer’s diet keeps them strong and healthy.”
Zeenat, a Class 8 student, appreciated PM Modi’s focus on balancing studies with enjoyment. “What I learned today is that life should be enjoyed in every moment. Exams should not be a source of stress. Parents should also understand their children’s hobbies instead of forcing them to study in isolation,” she said.
PM Modi further stressed the role of meditation and mindfulness in improving focus and reducing distractions. His words encouraged students to approach their academic journey with confidence, positivity, and self-discipline.

Title: Gold prices surge to record high of ₹87,210 per 10g amid global economic uncertainty
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:07 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India surged to an all-time high on Monday, with 10 grams of 24K gold reaching ₹87,210, while 1 gram was priced at ₹8,721. The steady rise in prices reflects increasing investor interest in the precious metal as global economic uncertainty fuels demand for safe-haven assets.
Since the beginning of February, gold has been on an upward trajectory. On February 1, 22K gold was priced at ₹7,760 per gram, while 24K gold stood at ₹8,464 per gram. Over the course of ten days, prices rose to ₹7,995 and ₹8,721, respectively, marking a 3.03% increase in 22K gold and a 3.04% rise in 24K gold. The lowest prices recorded this month were on February 3, when 22K gold stood at ₹7,720 per gram and 24K gold at ₹8,420 per gram.
The recent rally in gold prices can be attributed to several factors, including global economic instability, trade tensions, and inflationary concerns. Investors worldwide have been shifting towards gold as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. Central banks, particularly in China and India, have also played a key role in supporting demand. The weakening of the Indian rupee has further contributed to the rise in domestic gold prices, making imports more expensive.
With ongoing geopolitical risks and strong investor interest, analysts anticipate that gold prices may continue their upward momentum in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching central bank policies, inflation trends, and global economic conditions for further signals on price movements.
According to the World Gold Council, central banks reported a net sale of 3 tonnes (t) of gold in December, as per data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. Kazakhstan emerged as the largest seller, offloading 11t of gold, while China led the buying spree with 10t of purchases. Other notable buyers included the Czech National Bank and the Bank of Ghana, which added 1t each to their reserves.
For the year 2024, Poland has emerged as the largest net buyer, increasing its reserves by 90t, followed by Turkey with 75t and India with 73t. However, overall gold transactions in 2024 have been lower compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a cautious but sustained interest in gold among global central banks.

Title: India expands crude imports to 40 countries; Argentina joins as new supplier: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:08:11 +0000
Content: India has further diversified its crude oil imports, now sourcing from 40 countries, with Argentina joining as the latest supplier, Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced on Monday.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of India Energy Week 2025, Puri highlighted the country’s ongoing efforts to secure oil supplies from multiple sources to meet its growing energy demands.
“From 27 suppliers, we have now expanded to 40 suppliers. We recently added Argentina to the list,” Puri told reporters.
India’s crude imports fluctuate based on pricing advantages and logistical considerations. Major suppliers include the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“It’s a very dynamic situation, but we are open to imports from all sources,” the minister added.
India relies on imports for over 80% of its crude oil needs. In response, the government has implemented various initiatives to boost domestic oil production and reduce dependence on foreign crude. Efforts include promoting natural gas usage as a fuel and feedstock, encouraging renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, second-generation ethanol, compressed bio-gas, and biodiesel.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India’s refined crude demand will peak later than in other major economies, positioning the country as a key driver of global oil consumption. While alternative fuels are gradually reshaping the energy landscape, fossil fuel usage is expected to remain significant in the foreseeable future.
The firm forecasts that India’s refined product demand will reach 5.7 million barrels per day (b/d) by 2026.

Title: Gabbard clears Senate hurdle, heads to confirmation as top US spy
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:30:46 +0000
Content: The U.S. Senate voted on Monday to advance the nomination of former Representative Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, continuing President Donald Trump’s successful push to confirm even his most at-risk nominees for administration positions.
The Senate voted 52-46 on a procedural measure to limit debate on the closely watched nomination, more than the simple majority needed to clear the way for the 100-member chamber to vote on her confirmation later this week.
The vote was on party lines, with every Republican favoring advancing Gabbard’s nomination, while Democrats opposed it.
Trump’s fellow Republicans have rallied behind Gabbard, despite doubts about the 43-year-old former Democrat’s lack of significant intelligence experience and past statements seen as supporting U.S. adversaries.
The Senate Intelligence Committee last week recommended Gabbard’s nomination for consideration by the full Senate by a narrow 9-8 vote, also along party lines.
Urging support for her nomination, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Gabbard for agreeing to pare back the size of the DNI’s office, as the Trump administration wages a campaign to slash the size of many government agencies.
“I look forward to confirming Gabbard this week,” Thune said.
Some senators had questioned the choice of Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who has never served on an intelligence committee, for the position overseeing all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies after Trump announced the pick last year.
They expressed doubts about past statements seen as sympathetic toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and defense of the government of former Syria leader Bashar al-Assad, whom she visited in Syria while he was under U.S. sanction.
“Tulsi Gabbard is a walking five-alarm fire, and must be rejected, must be,” Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said in a Senate speech after the procedural vote.
At her confirmation hearing, Gabbard faced pointed questioning from senators from both parties about her past defense of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and comments seen as supportive of Russia.
While in the House of Representatives, Gabbard introduced legislation that would have dropped criminal charges against Snowden, who leaked thousands of highly classified National Security Agency documents, fled to China and then sought asylum in Russia.
Republicans more recently have praised Gabbard for now saying she would prosecute leakers and discounted concerns about her past statements about Russia and Syria.
When the 100-member Senate votes on her confirmation in a vote expected very early on Wednesday morning, Gabbard cannot afford to lose the support of more than three Republicans to still be confirmed, if Democrats remain united against her.

Laying out foundation of India’s energy ambitions, the Prime Minister said they rest on five pillars — abundant resources, brilliant minds, economic strength, political stability, strategic geography, and a commitment to global sustainability.
“The next two decades are crucial for achieving the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’, and in the next five years, we will accomplish several milestones. Many of our energy goals align with the 2030 deadline,” he said.
PM Modi outlined key targets for 2030, including the addition of 500 gigawatts of energy capacity, achieving net-zero carbon emissions for Indian Railways, and expanding green hydrogen production.
“Over the last 10 years, India has become the fifth-largest economy, doubled its solar generation capacity, and emerged as the third-largest solar power-generating nation. Our non-fossil fuel energy capacity has tripled,” he noted.
Citing India’s leadership in sustainability, the Prime Minister highlighted that India is the first country to meet the Paris G20 agreement goals, achieving a 90 percent ethanol blending rate and making significant progress in biofuels.
“India’s biofuels industry is set for rapid growth, backed by 500 million metric tons of sustainable feedstock. The Global Biofuels Alliance, established during India’s G20 presidency, continues to expand, now comprising 28 nations and 12 international organisations. This initiative is transforming waste into wealth and creating Centers of Excellence,” he said.
Discussing India’s strides in hydrocarbon resources, PM Modi mentioned key policy initiatives such as the Open Acreage License Policy (OALP), the opening of the exclusive economic zone, and the implementation of a single-window clearance system to attract investment.
He also highlighted efforts to empower ordinary families and farmers as energy providers.
“Last year, the government launched the PM Suryodaya Mukt Bijli Yojana. This scheme goes beyond energy production; it fosters new skills in the solar sector, builds a new service ecosystem, and enhances investment opportunities,” he said.
Reaffirming India’s commitment to sustainable energy, PM Modi expressed confidence that India Energy Week would foster innovation in the sector
“India is dedicated to providing energy solutions that drive our growth while preserving nature. I hope this Energy Week brings new ideas and solutions for a sustainable future,” he added.

Title: Govt strengthens workplace safety, financial support and maternity benefits for women
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:11:39 +0000
Content: The central government has taken significant steps to create a safe, secure, and non-discriminatory work environment for women. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, under the Companies Act, 2013, has introduced various measures to enhance workplace inclusivity and protection.
The Act mandates that every listed company and public company with a paid-up share capital of ₹100 crore or more, or a turnover of ₹300 crore or more, must appoint at least one woman director. Additionally, companies are required to confirm compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, in their Board Reports, which are filed annually with financial statements.
The Act also mandates the formation of an Internal Complaints Committee for organizations with ten or more employees and a Local Committee for smaller workplaces or cases involving the employer.
Financial and Entrepreneurial Support
Under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises, women entrepreneurs receive additional benefits compared to others. The Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) offers higher subsidies to women beneficiaries, encouraging their participation in small businesses. The Stand-Up India Scheme further facilitates loans between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or woman borrower per bank branch to support the establishment of new businesses.
To promote entrepreneurship among women, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III towns, the Yashasvini initiative was launched on June 27 last year, focusing on capacity-building and financial empowerment.
Maternity Benefits and Childcare Support
The government has implemented significant measures to support working mothers, ensuring maternity benefits and promoting gender equality in workplaces. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, mandates that establishments with fifty or more employees provide creche facilities, enabling women to continue working while ensuring proper care for their children.
Additionally, the Palna scheme, introduced in April 2022, offers centrally sponsored daycare services for children of working mothers, creating a supportive ecosystem that helps women balance their professional and personal responsibilities.
Strengthening Protection Against Workplace Harassment
In a major step towards addressing workplace harassment, the government launched a revamped version of the Sexual Harassment electronic-Box (SHe-Box) on August 29 last year. This centralized complaint portal provides a single-window grievance redressal mechanism for women across both organized and unorganized sectors.

However, the ministry does not track the number of individuals benefiting indirectly from the free meals.
The Seva Bhoj Yojana follows a structured process to ensure transparency and accountability in fund utilization. Institutions must first register on the NGO Darpan Portal of NITI Aayog before enrolling on the CSMS Portal of the Ministry of Culture. After enrollment, the institution submits its application and registration certificate to the Nodal Central Tax Officer in their respective State or Union Territory. The Nodal Central Tax Officer verifies the documents and issues a Unique Identity Number (UIN) to the applicant. The concerned GST Authority then reviews and verifies the CGST and IGST reimbursement claims before forwarding them to the Ministry of Culture, which provides funds to the GST Authority for disbursement to the eligible institutions.
The cultural ministry has been actively promoting the Seva Bhoj Yojana through official websites, social media platforms, and other communication channels to ensure that all eligible charitable and religious organizations, across various communities, benefit from the scheme.

Title: NITI Aayog launches policy report on strengthening State Public Universities
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:16:28 +0000
Content: A policy report offering insights into the standards of state public universities across India was released by NITI Aayog on Monday.
Titled Expanding Quality Higher Education through States and State Public Universities, the report was launched by Suman Bery, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, alongside CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam and other senior officials.
According to NITI Aayog, this first-of-its-kind document provides a comprehensive analysis of key indicators such as quality, funding, governance, and employability trends in state public universities (SPUs) over the past decade.
The report draws on extensive stakeholder consultations, involving higher education officials from over 20 states and union territories, vice-chancellors from 50 SPUs, and leaders from state higher education councils.
Speaking at the launch, Bery emphasized the importance of SPUs in setting high academic standards, drawing comparisons with public universities in countries like the U.S. and Brazil. He reiterated NITI Aayog’s role in research and evidence-building, while implementation falls under the purview of central and state ministries.
Dr. Vinod Kumar Paul, Member (Education), linked the report’s findings to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and India’s vision for ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’. He stressed that since 80% of India’s higher education takes place in SPUs, strengthening them is essential for human capital development.
Subrahmanyam highlighted that by 2035, NEP 2020 aims to double higher education enrollment to nearly nine crore students, with around seven crore studying in SPUs. He underscored the urgency for these universities to shift from merely providing access to education to delivering world-class academic standards.
Secretary of the Department of Higher Education, Vineet Joshi, pointed to recent budget initiatives such as the selection of 10,000 PM Research Fellows, the expansion of second-generation IITs, and the Bharatiya Bhasha textbook scheme to promote regional language education. He also noted the allocation of ₹13,000 crore under PM-USHA from 2023-24 to 2025-26, with ₹100 crore designated per SPU for their transformation into Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
Dr. Pankaj Mittal, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), highlighted that the report addresses three major challenges identified by vice chancellors: funding constraints, governance reforms, and capacity building for faculty and administrators.
The report provides nearly 80 policy recommendations with short, medium, and long-term implementation strategies. It outlines steps to improve research quality, pedagogy, and curriculum, strengthen governance frameworks, increase industry-academia collaboration, and enhance financial sustainability.

Title: Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:05:00 +0000
Content: A consortium led by Elon Musk said on Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire’s fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm.
Musk’s bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the ChatGPT maker at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”
Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House.
OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.
Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure.
Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.
“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement on Monday. “We will make sure that happens.”
Altman told staff in a message that the company’s board of directors intends to make clear it has no interest in Musk’s “supposed bid”, according to a report by The Information on Monday.
Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Emanuel Capital and others.
xAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Musk’s offer earlier on Monday. xAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters.
‘THROWING A WRENCH’
“This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,” said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance.
“The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it’s a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit.”
OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January.
Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.
Musk’s stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of X, which was then called Twitter, in 2022.
To finance such a bid, Musk could sell part of his stake in Tesla or take a loan against his stake, or use his stake in rocket company SpaceX that is worth tens of billions of dollars as collateral, according to an uninvolved investment banker, who requested anonymity.
“Musk’s offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.
“The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors … OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.”

Title: India in AI Action Summit in France: Global Talks, Local Impact
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 05:00:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to co-host the AI Action Summit in France, marking the third summit in this series, following previous editions held in the UK in 2023 and South Korea in 2024. With recent developments in AI, such as the release of Deepseek’s disruptive AI version and extensive commitments made by US President Trump for AI innovation and development, it becomes imperative to understand how AI directly impacts people’s lives.
A detailed examination of the real concerns surrounding AI taking away jobs, and why the world is racing to advance AI, must be provided for a more realistic perspective.
What is the AI Action Summit and what is at stake for its hosts?
The AI Action Summit is the latest event in a series of global dialogues focused on AI governance. This year, the summit is being held in France, co-hosted by Prime Minister Modi and President Macron. The summit’s objectives center around tech sovereignty, the development of environmentally friendly AI, AI accessibility, and global governance.
Macron has repeatedly emphasized the importance of “tech sovereignty” at the heart of this summit, which is especially significant as the USA and China, two giants in the field, compete for a dominant position in the AI landscape.
For India and France, both of which have tremendous potential for technological innovation and application, this summit provides an opportunity to recalibrate how the world views AI advancements.
Macron has advocated for over $100 billion in AI investments, while India has its own AI mission and is recognized globally for its ability to drive scientific innovations at a fraction of the cost. Consequently, France and India position themselves as leaders in the AI revolution with a global perspective, offering alternatives to the currently dominant forces.
Impact of AI on daily lives and the significance of such summits
From recommendations on social media to self-driving cars, AI is embedded in a dense network of applications that shape daily life. AI can be understood as algorithms designed to simulate human intelligence. Often perceived as a high-end technology that will disrupt markets and societal functioning, AI should instead be viewed as a technology that enhances human capacity, supplementing human intelligence rather than replacing it.
Just as the Industrial Revolution reshaped economic balances, AI now sits at the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While it is inevitable that AI will transform labor markets, it will also generate new jobs and open new markets. McKinsey Global estimates that AI will create around 50 million jobs by 2030, leading to increased demand for AI specialists.
With automation and AI assistance, new avenues for exploration will emerge. Summits like the AI Action Summit help establish a global framework for AI development and application, redefine public-private partnerships, and ensure an equitable and just future in the context of technology.
These summits promote dialogue on the scope of AI’s development while providing a global platform to discuss its applications. As society and industry learn to grow with AI, these summits ensure its adoption is fair, effective, and sustainable.
What to expect in the future for India?
India’s leadership role in global technology governance is underscored by its co-chairmanship of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. The country has already announced its own AI model and is working on the India AI Mission, launched in March 2024.
The AI model begins with a computational facility of roughly 10,000 GPUs, with 8,693 more GPUs to be added. While global models’ computational costs range from $2.5 to $3 per hour, India’s AI model will cost less than half that after a 40% government subsidy.
In 2024, India also hosted the Global IndiaAI Summit, marking a significant milestone in the country’s AI journey, bringing together over 12,000 global AI experts, practitioners, and delegates from 50 countries.
With one of the youngest populations and a leader in trained technologists, India stands as one of the most fertile grounds for the future of AI’s advancement. According to BCG, India’s AI market is growing at a CAGR of 25-35% and is projected to reach around $17 billion by 2027.
With its vast talent pool, growing digital infrastructure, and government initiatives India stands at the helm of this revolution. As PM Modi has iterated, AI in India does not stand just for artificial intelligence but also for Aspirational India.
Therefore, The AI Action Summit represents a pivotal moment in shaping the global AI landscape. Co-hosted by India and France, this summit not only showcases the countries’ leadership in AI development but also emphasizes the importance of tech sovereignty, responsible governance, and equitable access.
As AI continues to impact daily life from job creation to market disruption the summit’s discussions on its ethical and sustainable deployment are vital. India’s focus on affordable AI and its growing influence in global technology governance strengthens its position in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Moving forward, these global dialogues will ensure that AI’s benefits are shared universally, while mitigating its challenges, thus fostering a future where technology shapes society in a sustainable manner, a future where technology is for all.

Title: Union Budget 2025-26 prioritizes Women and Child Development with 37.25% rise in allocations
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 12:05:26 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Annpurna Devi, announced that the Union Budget 2025-26 has significantly prioritised women and child development, with a 37.25% increase in funding compared to the previous year. The allocation for women’s welfare has risen to Rs. 4.49 lakh crore, highlighting the government’s strengthened financial commitment to gender-focused initiatives.
The Gender Budget, which directs resources toward programs benefiting women and girls, now constitutes 8.86% of the total budget, up from 6.8% in the 2024-25 fiscal year, reflecting a stronger emphasis on women’s empowerment and child development.
Annapurna Devi outlined the specifics of these allocations during a press briefing in New Delhi. The increase in funds will be directed toward several critical areas, particularly maternal and child nutrition and women’s entrepreneurship. The Minister stressed that 81.79% of the Women and Child Development Ministry’s budget will go toward gender-based initiatives, underscoring the government’s focus on improving outcomes for women and children.
One of the major areas of focus in the new budget is tackling malnutrition. The Suposhit Panchayat Scheme, launched in late 2024, aims to improve health and nutrition outcomes at the grassroots level by recognizing Gram Panchayats that perform well in these areas. The Minister also announced that the 7th Poshan Pakhwada, scheduled for March 2025, will emphasize key themes like nutrition during the First 1,000 Days of Life and addressing childhood obesity.
While the increased budget for women’s welfare was a highlight, concerns remain about the actual implementation of these programs. Critics have pointed out that despite consistent budget increases in recent years, ground-level challenges—such as the quality of services in anganwadis and accessibility of healthcare for rural women—still persist.
The government’s flagship Beti Bachao Beti Padhao program, aimed at promoting gender equality, was also celebrated during the budget announcement, with over 1,342 events held across the country. However, there are continuing calls for more transparency in how funds are utilized for such large-scale programs, which have faced criticism in the past for focusing too much on awareness campaigns without addressing structural gender disparities.

Title: Vance warns Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:32:46 +0000
Content: U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned Europeans on Tuesday that what he called their excessive regulation of artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian censorship.” 
The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant. 
Vance, forthright in setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory approach. 
“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance told an AI summit in Paris. 
“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,” he added.
Vance said that navigating Europe’s online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms. 
The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration would ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry’s biggest players. 
While Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI — which big players develop — he said, “Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.” He added that the world should be skeptical when incumbents call for safety regulations that could entrench their powerful status. 
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. 
On the summit’s first day, host French President Emmanuel Macron urged Europe to cut red tape to make it easier for AI to flourish in the region, after the Trump administration’s unwinding of AI guardrails laid bare how far strategies towards AI in the United States, China and Europe have diverged. 
Vance is leading the American delegation at the summit, where representatives of nearly 100 countries including China, India and the United States will meet to determine if competing national interests can be reconciled.

Title: Sensex, Nifty plunge over 1% amid US tariff concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:19:41 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market extended its losing streak on Tuesday, with both Sensex and Nifty closing significantly lower as investor sentiment took a hit following the latest tariff measures announced by former US President Donald Trump.
At the closing bell, Sensex dropped by 1,018.20 points, or 1.32%, settling at 76,293.60. During the trading session, the index fluctuated between a high of 77,387.28 and a low of 76,030.59. Similarly, the Nifty ended the day down by 309.80 points, or 1.32%, closing at 23,071.80, after touching an intraday high of 23,390.05 and a low of 22,986.65.
The sell-off was widespread, with 44 out of the 50 Nifty stocks finishing in the red. Eicher Motors, Apollo Hospitals, Shriram Finance, Coal India, and Bharat Electronics led the losses, declining up to 6.7%. In contrast, only six stocks—Adani Enterprises, Trent, Grasim, Bharti Airtel, and Hindalco—managed to stay in positive territory, with gains of up to 0.76%.
Broader markets faced even sharper declines, with the Nifty Smallcap 100 falling 3.45% and the Nifty Midcap 100 losing 3.02%. Sectoral indices across the board ended in negative territory, with the PSU Bank, Auto, Healthcare, Realty, and Media indices registering losses of up to 3.28%. Sectors such as IT, FMCG, and consumer durables also ended lower by over 1% each.
The sell-off was fueled by concerns over the impact of US tariffs on global trade. Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports has raised fears of trade disruptions, with India among the affected economies. The Indian Steel Association (ISA) has urged the government to push for the removal of longstanding anti-dumping and countervailing duties while seeking exemptions from these restrictive measures. ISA warned that the latest tariffs could reduce steel exports to the US by 85%, potentially flooding the domestic market with surplus supply.
Market analysts believe that investors should focus on hedging and diversification strategies in the current volatile scenario. “The concerns around impending trade wars and countermeasures could impact India. Investors should seek fresh opportunities in this bear market and plan their moves accordingly,” said VLA Ambala, SEBI-registered research analyst and co-founder of Stock Market Today.
Adding to market woes, continued foreign portfolio outflows and weak domestic economic growth have weighed on investor sentiment. The recent interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also failed to provide much relief amid heightened global uncertainty.

Title: World must pull together resources and talent for AI: PM Modi in Paris
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:03:01 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform millions of lives by advancing key sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and education, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.
Addressing the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, PM Modi highlighted that AI can accelerate progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making the journey “easier and faster.”
He urged the global community to pool resources and talent to harness AI’s full potential for the greater good.
“We must build quality data sets free from biases. We must democratize technology and create people-centric applications. We must address concerns related to cyber security, disinformation and deepfakes. We must also ensure that technology is rooted in local ecosystems for it to be effective and useful. Loss of jobs is AI’s most feared disruption, but history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, its nature changes and new types of jobs are created. We need to invest in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future,” PM Modi said.
Expressing gratitude to French President Emmanuel Macron for hosting the AI Action Summit and inviting him to co-chair the summit. He said that AI is developing at an “unprecedented scale and speed” and being adapted and developed even faster.
PM Modi said, “I am grateful to my friend President Macron for hosting this summit and for inviting me to co-chair it. AI is already reshaping our polity, our economy, our security and even our society. AI is writing the code for humanity in this century. But, it is very different from other technology milestones in human history. AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed and being adapted and deployed even faster. There is also a deep interdependence across borders.”
PM Modi said that the world must think deeply and discuss openly about innovation and governance and emphasised that governance is also about ensuring access to all, particularly in the Global South.
Stressing the need for collective global efforts to establish governance, he said, “Governance is not just about managing risks and rivalries; it is about promoting innovation and making technology accessible, particularly in the Global South, where resources such as computing power, talent, and data are limited.”

Title: Netanyahu says Israel will end Gaza ceasefire if hostages not returned on Saturday
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:35:36 +0000
Content: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday a fragile ceasefire in Gaza would end and the Israeli army would resume its offensive in the Palestinian enclave until the militant group is defeated.
“In light of Hamas’ announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I ordered the IDF to gather forces inside and around the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu said, speaking after a meeting of his security cabinet.
“This operation is being carried out at this time. It will be completed in the very near future,” he said in a statement.
Hamas has begun releasing some hostages gradually under the first phase of a ceasefire reached last month, but said on Monday it would not free any more until further notice, accusing Israel of violating the terms with several deadly shootings as well as hold-ups of some aid deliveries in Gaza.
U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Israel, said in response that Hamas should release all the hostages held by the Palestinian militant group by midday on Saturday or he would propose cancelling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.
“If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon – the ceasefire will end and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,” Netanyahu said.
It was not immediately clear if he meant the return of hostages who would be due to be released on Saturday, or all of those still held in the Palestinian enclave.
A Hamas official said on Tuesday that Israeli hostages could be brought home only if the ceasefire was respected, dismissing the “language of threats” after Trump said he would “let hell break out” if they were not freed.
“Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the (Israeli) prisoners. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
Israel denies holding back aid supplies and says it has fired on people who disregard warnings not to approach Israeli troop positions.
Netanyahu vowed earlier that Israel would ensure all its hostages were returned.
“We will continue to take determined and ruthless action until we return all of our hostages – the living and the deceased,” he said following military confirmation of the death of one more Israeli during the Hamas-led attack that started the Gaza war 16 months ago.
An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the prime minister met on Tuesday with the security cabinet, a select group of ministers, for almost four hours.
Gaza, one of the world’s most densely populated areas, has been devastated by Israel’s military offensive since October 2023 and is short of food, water and shelter, and in need of billions in foreign aid.
Trump has enraged Palestinians and Arab leaders and upended decades of U.S. policy that endorsed a possible two-state solution in the region by trying to impose his vision of Gaza. He has said the United States should take over Gaza and move out its more than 2 million Palestinian residents so that the enclave can be turned into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.
The forcible displacement of a population under military occupation is a war crime banned by the 1949 Geneva conventions.
Palestinians fear a repeat of what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s creation. Israel denies they were forced out.
Gazans interviewed by Reuters criticised Trump for saying he would be prepared for “hell” to break out if all the Israeli hostages were not released by noon on Saturday.
“Hell worse than what we have already? Hell worse than killing? The destruction, all the practices and human crimes that have occurred in the Gaza Strip have not happened anywhere else in the world,” said Jomaa Abu Kosh, a Palestinian from Rafah in southern Gaza, standing beside demolished homes.
U.N. CHIEF WARNS OF ‘IMMENSE TRAGEDY’
The Gaza war has been paused under the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that was brokered by Qatar and Egypt with support from the United States.
More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, the Gaza health ministry says, and nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million population internally displaced by the conflict, which has caused a hunger crisis.
Some 1,200 people were killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities and about 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, Israeli tallies show.
Trump’s ideas have introduced new complexity into a sensitive and explosive Middle East dynamic, including the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
Trump was to meet Jordan’s King Abdullah on Tuesday for what was likely to be a tense encounter over the president’s Gaza redevelopment idea, including a threat to cut aid to the U.S.-allied Arab country if it refuses to resettle Palestinians.
For Jordan, Trump’s talk of resettlement comes dangerously close to its nightmare of a mass expulsion of Palestinians from both Gaza and the West Bank, echoing a vision of Jordan as an alternative Palestinian home that has long been propagated by ultra-nationalist Israelis.
Amman’s concern is amplified by a surge in violence on its border with the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Palestinian hopes of statehood are being eroded by expanding Jewish settlement.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on X on Tuesday that a resumption of armed conflict should be avoided at all costs because that would lead to “immense tragedy”.

Title: EU, Canada and Mexico condemn Trump move to hike steel and aluminium tariffs
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:28:42 +0000
Content: Mexico, Canada and the European Union on Tuesday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports next month, a move that has fanned fears of a trade war.
Trump signed proclamations late on Monday raising the U.S. tariff rate on aluminium to 25% from his previous 10% rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
The measures, due to take effect on March 12, will apply to millions of tons of steel and aluminium imports from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other countries that had been entering the U.S. duty free under the carve-outs.
Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard called the tariff decision “not justified” and “unfair.” He did not say if Mexico planned reciprocal tariffs on steel or aluminum it imports from the United States.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the tariffs were “unacceptable.” Canada’s response, if needed, would be firm and clear, he said at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen joined the condemnation, saying the 27-nation bloc would take “firm and proportionate countermeasures.” U.S. Vice President JD Vance said he would discuss trade and economic issues with Von der Leyen at an AI summit in Paris on Tuesday.
The move will simplify tariffs on the metals, Trump told reporters. “It’s 25% without exceptions or exemptions,” he said. “That’s all countries, no matter where it comes from, all countries.”
Trump said on Monday he would announce reciprocal tariffs over the next two days on all countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said, “I don’t mind.”
READY TO RETALIATE
In figures likely to further irk Trump, Germany’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached a record level last year of 70 billion euros ($72.3 billion), according to data from the German statistics office.
European Commission head Von der Leyen said she deeply regretted the U.S. decision, adding that tariffs were taxes that were bad for business and worse for consumers. EU steel exports to the U.S. have averaged about 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) a year over the past decade.
“Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered – they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,” she said in a statement.
One option for the EU would be to reactivate the tariffs it imposed in 2018 that were suspended under a truce agreed between Von der Leyen and then-U.S. president Joe Biden.
The EU tariffs on U.S. products such as bourbon, motorcycles and orange juice are currently suspended until the end of March.
The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), representing U.S. companies active in Europe, also criticised the move as harmful to jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.
The damage will reverberate beyond the steel and aluminium sectors to all businesses that rely on these materials, it said.
COST AND CHAOS FOR U.S. BUSINESS
Executives across industries reliant on steel and aluminum imports were scrambling to offset the cost of Trump’s move after previous tariff threats from the White House that were later scrapped.
Businesses around the U.S. have warned of fallout, with many manufacturing-heavy companies finding it difficult to plan next steps or determine if Trump will follow through.
Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Trump’s proposed and implemented tariffs have added “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos.”
Trump’s latest trade salvo pushed gold prices to a record high on Tuesday on safe-haven demand in Asian trading before retreating.
Steel imports accounted for about 23% of American steel consumption in 2023, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico the largest suppliers.
Canada, whose abundant hydropower resources aid its metal production, accounted for nearly 80% of U.S. primary aluminium imports in 2024.
Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be “smelted and cast” within the region to curb U.S. imports of minimally processed Chinese and Russian metals that circumvent other tariffs.
While China exports only tiny volumes of steel to the U.S., it is responsible for much of the world’s excess steel capacity, according to the U.S. It says subsidised production in China forces other countries to export more and leads to trans-shipment of Chinese steel through other countries into the U.S. to avoid tariffs and other trade restrictions.

Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Tuesday emphasized that India and France can play a significant role in shaping the fast-evolving global economy, including by inspiring the European Union (EU).
Speaking at the India-France CEO Forum in Paris, Jaishankar stressed the need for diversified production, reliable and resilient supply chains, and deeper business collaborations to meet the challenges of an ever-changing world.
“This applies as much to manufacturing as it does to health,” he remarked.
Highlighting the independent traditions of both nations, Jaishankar said, “We are actively working to strengthen each other’s positions and make our collaboration a significant factor in contemporary global affairs.”
He underscored that stronger India-France cooperation would contribute to global economic stability during volatile times. “The ‘Make in India’ initiative has opened up numerous new possibilities in this regard,” he said on the sidelines of the AI Action Summit.
“The Summit itself is a reminder of how much we could achieve in AI, software development, and cybersecurity. The year 2026 will be celebrated as the ‘India-France Year of Innovation.’ Let’s use that as a driver,” he added.
Jaishankar urged stakeholders to weigh in on ongoing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. “Defence, manufacturing, and aerospace are well-established areas of cooperation. Both the nature and scale of this collaboration are poised for a significant leap. The challenge before us is to fully capitalize on it,” he said.
He also highlighted India’s ongoing clean energy transition, rapid infrastructure development, and advancements in digital public infrastructure (DPI).
Earlier, Jaishankar met his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot to discuss strengthening bilateral ties with a focus on AI, innovation, connectivity, and clean energy.

Title: French President backs PM Modi on fair access to AI
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:25:06 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the AI Action Summit, underscoring the importance of equitable access to Artificial Intelligence for global progress.
Addressing an audience of industry leaders, policymakers, and AI experts, Macron highlighted the need for trust and inclusivity in AI development, stressing that access to such transformative technology must be available across continents.
“Fair and open access is of decisive importance. We need a system where all continents and countries, including players from Asia Pacific and Latin America, have equal access to these innovations,” Macron said, citing PM Modi’s leadership on the issue as an example.
The French President warned against the creation of a divided world, where technological advancements benefit only a select few. “We don’t want a system where some are in power while others are merely vessels. For trust in AI, equitable access is essential,” he said.
He urged governments and civil society to act collectively to foster this trust, emphasizing the critical role of private enterprises and major investors. “If people can’t trust AI, we risk seeing resistance emerge, with citizens rejecting its adoption as a source of problems rather than solutions,” Macron added.
The President also called for investments in data infrastructure and AI education. “We want to train younger generations and expand research positions at universities. Data consolidation and sustainable data centers powered by low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power, are key to this effort,” Macron said.
Earlier, PM Modi, delivering the inaugural address at the summit, highlighted AI’s transformative potential for sectors like healthcare, education, and agriculture. “AI can help create a world where the journey toward sustainable development goals becomes easier and faster. To achieve this, we must pool resources and develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency,” PM Modi said.

Title: Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh down by 47 pc in 14 years: Nityanand Rai
Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:43:21 +0000
Content: Violence perpetrated by Left Wing Extremists (LWE) has reduced in Chhattisgarh by 47 per cent in 2024 — with 122 incidents — compared to the high levels of 2010, which saw 499 incidents, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said on Tuesday.
In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the MoS said that due to the reduction in violence linked to Maoists in the state, deaths of civilians and security personnel have also reduced by 64 per cent — from 343 in 2010 to 122 in 2024.
A decline in Maoist violence has also been observed across the rest of the country. The violence perpetrated by LWE has reduced by 81 per cent in 2024 — with 150 incidents — compared to the high levels of 2010, which recorded 1,936 incidents.
The resultant deaths of civilians and security forces have also decreased by 85 per cent during the same period, from 1,005 in 2010 to 150 in 2024, the MoS said.
He noted that to address the LWE problem, a “National Policy and Action Plan” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security-related measures, development interventions, and ensuring the rights and entitlements of local communities.
On the security front, the Central government assists the LWE-affected states by providing Central Armed Police battalions, training, and funds for the modernisation of state police forces, equipment and arms, intelligence sharing, and construction of fortified police stations, he said.
Resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan” by both the Centre and the States has resulted in a consistent decline in Maoism, both in terms of geographical spread and violence, the MoS added.
There has been a progressive decline in the number of districts affected by LWE. In view of the continuously improving situation, three reviews of LWE-affected districts have been undertaken in the last six years, with a reduction from 126 to 90 districts in April 2018, further to 70 in July 2021, and then to 38 in April 2024.

Publication Date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:43:39 +0000
Content: Estonian President Alar Karis on Tuesday emphasised India’s important role in the international arena during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris.
In what was their first meeting, the two leaders discussed ongoing bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity and global conflicts.
They underlined that warm and friendly relations between India and Estonia are based on the two countries’ shared commitment to democracy, rule of law and the values of freedom and pluralism.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting, the two leaders expressed satisfaction at the growing bilateral cooperation in various fields, including trade and investment, IT and digital, culture, tourism and people-to-people ties.
Prime Minister Modi invited the Estonian government and companies to explore the opportunities offered by the India growth story and take advantage of programmes such as Digital India.
“The two leaders noted the importance of the India-Estonia partnership also in the context of the India-EU strategic partnership. They welcomed the initiation of ministerial exchanges in the India-Nordic-Baltic format. The leaders also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, and cooperation at the United Nations,” the statement detailed.
PM Modi and the President of Estonia expressed satisfaction at the growing cultural and people-to-people ties between the two countries.
“In this regard, the PM appreciated the popularity of Yoga in Estonia,” the PMO stated.
Bilateral relations between Estonia and India have gained momentum in recent years, asserted President Karis during the meeting.
“We already have good cooperation in the areas of e-governance, cybersecurity and digital government services, but I see opportunities to further intensify this and I hope that the Estonian ICT sector will be able to adapt and offer suitable solutions to Indian partners,” he said.
Karis noted that in 2023, the Estonian e-Government Academy contributed to the renewal of India’s national ICT strategy, which is a good basis for further cooperation.
In addition to discussions on digital cooperation, the Estonian President highlighted the need to strengthen international security.
While discussing the Russia-Ukraine war, the Estonian Head of State emphasised India’s important role in the international arena and stressed the importance of adhering to international law.
“The meeting also addressed compliance with sanctions against Russia and discussed the threats posed by North Korea’s deployment of soldiers to Ukraine, which, according to President Karis, links the Indo-Pacific region to European security,” read a statement issued by the Estonian President’s office after the meeting.

Title: Over 68,000 ponds completed under mission Amrit Sarovar to combat water scarcity
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:18:13 +0000
Content: Mission Amrit Sarovar, launched in April 2022, has achieved remarkable progress in addressing the country’s water scarcity issue by constructing or rejuvenating over 68,000 Amrit Sarovars (ponds) as of January. The mission, aimed at building 75 ponds in each district, with a total target of 50,000 ponds nationwide, has already surpassed its goal. These Sarovars have significantly enhanced surface and groundwater availability across various regions, addressing immediate water needs and establishing sustainable water sources.
The initiative not only highlights the government’s commitment to combating water scarcity but also emphasizes long-term environmental sustainability and the well-being of local communities. The ponds serve as symbols of climate resilience and ecological balance, contributing to the nation’s overall water management strategy.
Phase II of Mission Amrit Sarovar will continue with a renewed focus on ensuring water availability through community participation (Jan Bhagidaari). This phase aims to further strengthen climate resilience and deliver lasting benefits for future generations by fostering ecological balance.
The works under Mission Amrit Sarovar are being executed through convergence with various ongoing schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the 15th Finance Commission Grants, and sub-schemes of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichai Yojana, including the Watershed Development Component and Har Khet Ko Pani. States are also using their own schemes, and public contributions like crowdfunding and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are encouraged to support the initiative.

Title: Real Madrid’s Bellingham nets late winner in 3-2 thriller with Manchester City
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:01:53 +0000
Content: Real Madrid‘s Jude Bellingham struck a last-gasp goal to give the Champions League holders a 3-2 victory over Manchester City in an edge-of-your-seat first leg of their knockout phase playoff on Tuesday at the Etihad Stadium.
Kylian Mbappe and Brahim Diaz also struck for Real, to cancel out a double from City’s Erling Haaland, setting up what should be a thrilling second leg on February 19 in Madrid between two of Europe’s most famous teams and biggest rivals.
Haaland opened the scoring with his first career goal against Real in the 19th minute when Josko Gvardiol chested the ball down to the 24-year-old Norwegian, who volleyed into the far corner. The goal was given after fans held their breath through a four-minute VAR check for offside.
Mbappe levelled in the 60th minute with a rebound off a free kick, awkwardly looping the ball off his shin over goalkeeper Ederson and into the net.
Haaland struck from the penalty spot in the 80th minute – awarded after Dani Ceballos took down Phil Foden by his right knee in the box – sending keeper Thibaut Courtois the wrong way.
It was his 49th goal in 48 Champions League games.
But City have struggled to hold onto leads this season, conceding seven goals in the final 15 minutes of Champions League matches. And former City player Diaz pounced on a poor clearance by Ederson of Vinicius Jr’s shot to tap home in the 86th minute.
England international Bellingham scored the winner in the 92nd minute to groans from City fans after a shaky pass back from Mateo Kovacic to Rico Lewis saw Vinicius nip in and loop the ball over from the left. Bellingham got in front of John Stones to slot home.
“I’m happy for the goal and for helping the team,” Diaz said. “I feel we played a great match, it’s not easy here, against a pretty good team … but there’s still the second leg and the work is not finished.”
TOUGH TASK AT BERNABEU
Real and City failed to advance automatically to the last 16 as one of the top eight sides in the Champions League table, in the new league-phase format, meaning one of the tournament’s top contenders will be eliminated early.
“It was a weird one. We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,” Bellingham said.
“I think we were playing well and creating a lot. We were always confident throughout the game that something would drop for us. I don’t care what form City are in, they are still an unbelievable team. It’s always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.”
The clubs are clashing for a fourth consecutive year, having met in four Champions League knockout ties since 2020, although never this early in Europe’s elite competition.
City boss Pep Guardiola has said the frequency of meetings makes it feel like a derby, while Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti called the fixture a “modern classic.”
“It’s so raw and frustrating for everyone,” City defender Stones said, summing up the home side’s agony.
“We were in the game until so late and then it’s two situations that happen and we concede … We need to see games out better … Today we had a great opportunity to go to the Bernabeu with a 2-1 lead. It’s not done. We have to stay positive, which is difficult now.”
Ancelotti urged his players to keep their head for the return match. “We didn’t deserve to be 1-2 down. We were really dangerous and defended really well. At the end of the day the victory is deserved,” he said. “We have to stay calm. It’s only the first half. Anything can happen at the Bernabeu.”

Title: RBI to inject Rs 2.5 lakh crore to enhance liquidity in banking system
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 05:38:27 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was all set to inject Rs 2,50,000 crore through its Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auction on Wednesday to enhance liquidity in the banking system.
The Central Bank has stated that the amount has been decided based on an assessment of the liquidity conditions.
The Reserve Bank also said it will be conducting daily Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions on all working days in Mumbai with reversal taking place on the next working day, until further notice.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra had announced on Friday, after the monetary policy meeting, that the central bank was committed to provide sufficient liquidity in the economy and would take steps to ensure durable liquidity to meet the requirement of the system.
The RBI Governor also said that the RBI was keeping a close watch on the rupee and was taking all steps to keep the Indian currency stable.
According to a Morgan Stanley report, the RBI is expected to proactively manage liquidity and take up some additional measures (OMO purchases/FX swaps) as liquidity deficit rises towards end-March. We see risk of a longer rate cut cycle, if growth recovery is lacklustre, driven by weaker domestic demand and uncertainty from global factors.
To support its point, the report referred to the RBI governor’s statement highlighting that on the regulatory front, there is a trade-off between stability and efficiency which should be kept in mind. He said that this trade-off will be kept in mind while formulating regulations.
In a big relief for banks, RBI Governor Malhotra announced that the implementation of the proposed Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well as project financing norms will be deferred by a year and will not to be implemented before March 31, 2026.
He said that the step has been taken as the earlier deadline March 2025 deadline does not give sufficient time for the implementation of these guidelines. The RBI does not want to cause disruption in the financial system and will ensure a smooth transition, added.
Both public sector and private sector banks had opposed the implementation of these norms, announced by former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, as they feared they were would cause a liquidity crisis in the financial system. The heads of banks had raised the issue with Malhotra, shortly after he took over as RBI Governor with Das’s tenure coming to an end.

Title: Inside the collapse of Nissan and Honda’s $60 billion mega deal
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 05:38:25 +0000
Content: Nissan was deep in trouble late last year when rival Honda offered a lifeline: a $60 billion tie-up that would help both Japanese automakers compete against the Chinese brands upending the car industry.
Years of faltering sales and management turmoil had left Nissan a diminished force, especially after it underestimated demand for hybrids in the U.S., its top market.
But the merger talks unravelled in a little more than a month due to Nissan’s pride and insufficient alarm about its predicament, as well as Honda’s abrupt decision to revise the terms and propose that Nissan become a subsidiary, according to six people familiar with the matter.
Nissan, which for years until 2020 was Japan’s second-largest automaker behind Toyota, insisted on receiving near-equal treatment in the talks despite its weaker position, three of the people said.
Honda pressured Nissan to make deeper cuts to its workforce and factory capacity, but Nissan was unwilling to consider politically sensitive factory closures, three of the sources said. They said they were left with the impression Nissan felt it could recover on its own, despite its mounting difficulties.
That intransigence, combined with what Honda management saw as Nissan’s slow decision-making, helped torpedo a deal that would have created one of the world’s largest automakers, three people said.
This account of the forces that scuttled the mega merger features previously unreported information, including details about factories Nissan wanted to keep open, its resistance to Honda’s pressure for deeper cuts, and the reaction inside Nissan to some of Honda’s demands. The story is based on Reuters interviews with more than a dozen people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the topic’s sensitivity.
The reporting sheds new light on the thinking inside Nissan as it faces a deepening crisis. The storied carmaker now faces the added threat of U.S. tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico, which account for more than a quarter of its U.S. sales. Both Nissan and Honda are due to report earnings on Thursday.
“I think it’s a management problem,” said Julie Boote, analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, about the turmoil at Nissan. “They’re completely overestimating their position and their brand value, and their ability to turn around the business.”
Nissan and Honda declined to comment on the specific aspects of the talks as described by Reuters sources.
Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida visited his counterpart Toshihiro Mibe last week to say he wanted to end discussions after Honda made the subsidiary proposal.
Both automakers have said they would provide an update this month.
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
Nissan stunned investors in November when it cut its profit forecast by 70% due to worsening sales in China and the United States. Its announced a turnaround plan that involved cutting 9,000 jobs and one-fifth of global capacity, which some analysts saw as too little, too late.
Uchida promised to forfeit half his pay and said he was focused on making the business leaner and more resilient.
In December, Nissan and Honda announced plans to merge, an outgrowth of talks they had been holding since March 2024, when they said they were looking to cooperate on technology.
But the merger discussions quickly hit a wall over calculating the shareholding ratio for the combined company, two of the people said.
In private, Uchida exhibited doubts about the deal’s prospects, one of the people said. Honda managers complained that Nissan’s decision-making was too slow, four people said. A public update on the talks was originally set for the end of January before being pushed back to mid-February.
Honda managers felt Nissan’s turnaround strategy lacked details and were frustrated by what they saw as an insufficient reduction in factory capacity, two sources said.
Reuters could not determine whether Honda requested a certain number of job cuts or identified specific factories for capacity reductions.
Nissan didn’t want to shut factories because that would force a write-down of their value on paper and hurt its earnings, one person said.
The job cuts already promised as part of Nissan’s turnaround plan amounted to 7% of its global workforce. It was telling, one person said, that Honda had cut more people in China over the last two years.
Honda, for its part, appeared unwilling to budge on its plans, implying it didn’t consider Nissan an equal, one person familiar with Nissan’s thinking said.
KYUSHU VISIT
In late January, Nissan executive Hideyuki Sakamoto visited the southwestern island of Kyushu to announce plans for a battery EV plant that would create 500 jobs.
Flanked by local politicians, Sakamoto said the automaker wouldn’t reduce capacity at its existing Kyushu plant, either. Kyushu was a “highly competitive base geopolitically” and important for future EV plans, he said.
The day after Sakamoto’s visit to Kyushu, Honda’s Mibe told Uchida that Nissan would need to become a Honda subsidiary, a stipulation not in the original merger memorandum of understanding the two companies signed late last year, according to one person.
Reuters could not determine whether Mibe’s move was triggered by Nissan’s announcements in Kyushu. Nevertheless, the Kyushu trip crystallised the tensions between the companies over the best way forward.
Kyushu wasn’t the only plant that Nissan considered untouchable. Smyrna in Tennessee, Aguascalientes in Mexico and Britain’s Sunderland were all seen as critical to the company’s EV strategy, and the automaker didn’t want to close them or reduce their lines, one source said.
Honda’s abrupt change to the deal’s structure reflected its mounting impatience with Nissan over the pace of negotiations, two people said.
Nissan was blindsided by that move, given that it went against the previously agreed memorandum, two of people said. Inside Nissan, the proposal was seen as “outrageous” and an affront to the dignity of Nissan, the older automaker, one person said.
Renault, Nissan’s top shareholder, said while it was not privy to the discussions, the latest information suggested the transaction would result in a “takeover of Nissan by Honda without a control premium for Nissan shareholders”. Such an outcome was “not acceptable”, Renault said, adding it would “vigorously defend” its interests.
NEW PARTNERS
It’s not clear what, if anything, could bring the automakers back to the table. It seems likely they would revert to their original agreement to team up on technology, three of the people said.
If both companies agree to end the discussions, neither would be liable for a 100 billion yen ($650 million) break-up fee, according to their December memorandum of understanding.
Nissan is open to working with new partners, including Foxconn 2317.TW, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that makes Apple’s iPhones, Reuters has reported. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.
Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said on Wednesday that its aim was to cooperate with Nissan, not acquire it.
The Taiwanese company’s EV business is led by former Nissan executive Jun Seki, who at one point was seen by insiders as a contender to become the carmaker’s CEO.
Foxconn would likely be a more generous suitor than Honda because it needs a brand name in the auto industry, and Nissan could be attractive, said Amir Anvarzadeh, a strategist with Japan equity advisory firm Asymmetric Advisors.
“No matter what you think about their cars and their balance sheet and so forth, at least the brand is still fairly recognisable,” he said of Nissan.
So far, Japan’s government has given little sense of how it sees the breakdown in talks between Honda and Nissan, nor whether it would be open to an acquisition of Nissan by Foxconn, which is also the top shareholder in consumer electronics company Sharp Corp.
For Nissan, the question now is what management will do, said Boote.
“They don’t have a realistic view of what’s happening in the auto industry and what really needs to happen with Nissan.”

During the discussion, Deepika shared insights into her childhood, revealing her strong inclination towards sports and extracurricular activities.
“I was a very naughty child. Even today, my parents say that you will never find Deepika at the ground level. I was always jumping from sofas, tables, and chairs. I was more interested in extracurricular activities,” she said.
Expressing her gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deepika thanked him for prioritising students’ mental well-being through ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha.’
When addressing students on managing stress and handling pressure from teachers and parents, she advised, “Focus on things you can control. Talk to your parents and teachers about your stress, identify its cause, and express it to someone you trust.” She also encouraged students to practice meditation and exercise as effective ways to cope with stress.
Deepika emphasised that making mistakes is part of learning and highlighted the importance of fun, rest, and exposure to natural sunlight.
As part of an interactive session, she conducted an activity where students wrote their strengths on pieces of paper and displayed them on a board.
“This activity helps you realise that if you focus on your strengths rather than weaknesses, you’ll see how many things you’re good at,” she said.
Adding a fun element to the session, Deepika also played several games with the students.
Earlier on Tuesday, she shared a video on Instagram announcing her participation in Pariksha Pe Charcha. She highlighted the significance of mental well-being in education and expressed excitement about the episode.
She took to social media to acknowledge PM Modi’s efforts in supporting students in dealing with stress and pressure.
“Pariksha Pe Charcha is back with its 8th edition! And this time, we’ll also be discussing the importance of mental health. Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for your commitment to this cause. I look forward to launching our episode,” she wrote.
Deepika, who has been vocal about her struggle with depression, reaffirmed her dedication to mental health awareness.
“I want to thank our Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving us this platform to come out as warriors, not worriers. I want to wish all of you the very best,” she said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the eighth edition of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ on February 10 in Delhi, interacting with students at Sunder Nursery during the first episode. The episode featuring Deepika Padukone is set to be released on February 12.

Title: Champions Trophy: Harshit Rana replaces injured Bumrah in India’s squad; Jaiswal replaced by Chakaravarthy
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:51:35 +0000
Content: Team India has suffered a major setback ahead of the Champions Trophy, with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah ruled out due to a lower back injury. Harshit Rana has been named as his replacement.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed Bumrah’s absence in a statement released on Tuesday night.
“Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury. The Men’s Selection Committee has named Harshit Rana as Bumrah’s replacement,” the statement read.
Another major change in India’s 15-member squad is the exclusion of youngster Yashasvi Jaiswal, with mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy coming in as his replacement.
“Team India has also included Varun Chakaravarthy in the squad. The spinner will replace Yashasvi Jaiswal, who was initially named in the provisional squad,” the statement added.
Bumrah has been out of action since January, with his last appearance coming in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test against Australia in Sydney. After bowling 10.1 overs in the first innings, he was visibly in discomfort and underwent scans. Australian doctors advised him not to participate in the remainder of the Test. Although he came out to bat in the second innings, he did not bowl again.
Jaiswal’s omission follows his underwhelming ODI debut in the series opener against England, where he scored 15 off 22 balls. He was subsequently dropped for the second ODI in favor of Virat Kohli, while Chakaravarthy was handed his ODI debut, returning figures of 1/54 in his 10-over spell.
India will kick off its Champions Trophy campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai.
India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025:
Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.
Non-traveling substitutes: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj, and Shivam Dube. The three players will travel to Dubai if required.

Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:51:03 +0000
Content: On the occasion of ‘Maghi Purnima’ on Wednesday, thousands of devotees have gathered in Maha Kumbh at the Sangam in Prayagraj to take a holy dip.
Anticipating the massive influx, vehicle entry into the fairgrounds was restricted a day in advance. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been personally monitoring the arrangements since early morning.
DIG Prayagraj, Vaibhav Krishna, confirmed that the crowd was being efficiently managed, with bathing proceeding peacefully across all ghats. Strict traffic diversions and disciplined crowd control measures are in place.
A grand spectacle unfolded as flower petals were showered (Pushpa Varsha) upon devotees and ascetics performing the holy dip in the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The Chief Minister extended his greetings on social media X, praying for the well-being, prosperity, and fortune of all devotees.
“Hearty congratulations to all the devotees and residents of the state on the holy bathing festival Magh Purnima!

May everyone’s life be filled with happiness, prosperity and good fortune by the grace of Lord Shri Hari. May Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna and Mother Saraswati fulfil everyone’s wishes, this is my wish,” CM Yogi wrote in a post.
To ensure security, paramilitary forces have been deployed at key locations, preventing overcrowding at the main ghats and directing pilgrims to other bathing areas. Meanwhile, CM Yogi was overseeing the event from the war room at his official residence in Lucknow, alongside DGP Prashant Kumar and Home Secretary Sanjay Prasad.

Title: PM Modi, Macron hold bilateral talks; France to host 10 Indian startups
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:14:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron held bilateral talks on Wednesday, reviewing key areas of cooperation, including defense, space, civil nuclear collaboration, health, and people-to-people ties.
A major highlight of the discussions was France’s decision to host 10 Indian startups at its prestigious startup incubator, Station F, marking a significant boost for India-France business and technology collaboration.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, addressing a press conference on Wednesday, revealed that PM Modi and Macron engaged in discussions while traveling to Marseille. “These discussions continued upon landing, where the two leaders were joined by their respective delegations,” Misri said.
The meeting also focused on strengthening India’s real-time payment system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), in France. Both leaders welcomed the expanded opportunities for UPI integration, according to a joint statement.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a key focus of the discussions, with both nations agreeing to designate 2026 as the “India-France Year of Innovation.” The initiative will be officially launched in New Delhi in March 2026 with the unveiling of its logo. Additionally, a Letter of Intent was signed between India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) and France’s Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) to establish the Indo-French Center for Digital Sciences.
In the civil nuclear sector, both leaders welcomed the first meeting of the Special Task Force on Civil Nuclear Energy. Key agreements included a Letter of Intent on Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMR), along with an implementing agreement between India’s Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP) and France’s Institut National des Sciences et Techniques Nucléaires (INSTN).
“The two sides have agreed to collaborate in co-designing, co-developing, and co-producing SMRs and AMRs, recognizing their potential in the evolving energy landscape,” Misri said. He emphasized that the partnership would play a crucial role in addressing future energy demands, particularly in the AI-driven technological revolution.
Additionally, India and France renewed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and France’s Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA) for cooperation with the GCNEP.
PM Modi and Macron also expressed satisfaction with the ongoing collaboration in health, culture, tourism, education, and people-to-people ties. Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthening cooperation in global forums.

Title: India’s CPI inflation falls to 5-month low of 4.31% in January
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:01:52 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a five-month low of 4.31% in January as prices of vegetables and pulses eased, bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Wednesday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after reaching a 14-month high of 6.21% in October. CPI inflation had fallen to 5.48% in November and 5.22% in December.
Food inflation, at 6.02% in January 2025, is the lowest since August 2024.
“The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during January is mainly attributed to the decline in inflation for vegetables, eggs, pulses, cereals, education, clothing, and health,” according to an official statement.
The five items with the highest year-on-year inflation at the All India level in January were coconut oil (54.20%), potato (49.61%), coconut (38.71%), garlic (30.65%), and peas (30.17%).
The items with the lowest year-on-year inflation in January 2025 were cumin (-32.25%), ginger (-30.92%), dry chilies (-11.27%), brinjal (-9.94%), and LPG (-9.29%).
The year-on-year fuel and light inflation rate for January stood at -1.38%, compared to -1.33% in December 2024, as fuel prices continued to decline.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced on Friday a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.25% in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth amid global uncertainties.
He stated that inflation had declined and was expected to further moderate, gradually aligning with the RBI’s target.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and boosting the growth rate in a slowing economy.
The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with its neutral stance in monetary policy, focusing on inflation while supporting growth. This approach provides flexibility to respond to the macroeconomic environment, Malhotra said.
With retail inflation continuing its downward trend, the RBI will have more room to adopt a soft monetary policy, making more credit available to businesses and consumers, thereby propelling economic growth.

Title: 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots: Former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar convicted in double murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:54:55 +0000
Content: A Delhi court has convicted former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in a case related to the brutal killings of a father and son in Saraswati Vihar on November 1, 1984. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Kaveri Baweja at the Rouse Avenue Court.
Sajjan Kumar, who is already serving a life sentence in another 1984 riots case linked to the Delhi Cantonment killings, was physically produced before the court for the proceedings. The court had earlier reserved its verdict on January 31 after hearing final arguments, including additional submissions from Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat.
The case pertains to the killing of Jaswant Singh and his son Tarundeep Singh, who were murdered during the wave of anti-Sikh violence that erupted in Delhi following the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The prosecution argued that Kumar incited and led the mob that attacked and burned Sikh homes, resulting in the deaths of several individuals.
Senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, representing the victims, contended that police investigations into the anti-Sikh riots were deliberately manipulated to shield the accused. He cited the Delhi High Court’s earlier judgment, which had characterized the riots as a “crime against humanity” and part of a “larger massacre” targeting Sikhs. The court had also acknowledged that the objective of genocide is always the targeting of minorities.
Phoolka further argued that official figures recorded 2,700 Sikhs killed in Delhi alone in 1984, emphasizing that such extraordinary circumstances necessitated special legal considerations. He also drew parallels with international legal precedents and referenced the Geneva Convention, under which mass killings targeting specific communities have been categorized as genocide.
Despite the gravity of the case, delays and institutional hurdles hindered justice. A charge sheet against Kumar was initially prepared in 1992, but authorities allegedly failed to file it in court, reinforcing suspicions of police efforts to protect the powerful politician. It was only after a Supreme Court intervention that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted to reopen 114 riot cases, including this one.
The SIT’s findings led to fresh evidence, with key witnesses tracing back their traumatic accounts of looting, arson, and killings. One witness, a surviving family member of the victims, recalled how she identified Sajjan Kumar only after seeing his photograph in a magazine nearly two months after the attack. Her testimony, recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. in 2016, became crucial in establishing Kumar’s role in orchestrating the violence.
Sajjan Kumar has been convicted under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including murder (Section 302), rioting (Sections 147 and 148), and abetment to violence (Section 149). The court found that Kumar instigated and led the mob, which set Sikh homes ablaze, looted property, and mercilessly killed victims.
His conviction in this case adds to his legal troubles, as he is already serving a life sentence in the Delhi Cantt riots case. Meanwhile, an appeal challenging his previous conviction is pending before the Supreme Court.

Title: India Energy Week 2025 highlights India’s clean cooking gas model as a blueprint for Global South
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:16:57 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri chaired a Ministerial Roundtable on Clean Cooking during the second day of India Energy Week 2025, showcasing India’s success in ensuring universal access to clean cooking gas. Puri emphasised that India’s model, driven by targeted subsidies, digitised distribution networks, and cultural shifts, offers a replicable solution for other Global South nations facing similar energy challenges.
The session brought together representatives from countries like Brazil, Tanzania, Malawi, Sudan, and Nepal, along with industry leaders such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Total Energy, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Puri highlighted India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which provides LPG access at highly affordable rates—7 cents per day for beneficiaries and 15 cents per day for other consumers—making clean cooking fuel accessible to millions.
During the roundtable, international representatives shared their experiences and challenges in expanding clean cooking solutions. Tanzania’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, Hon. Dkt. Doto Mashaka Biteko, outlined efforts to enable 80% of households to transition to clean cooking by 2030, while Sudan’s Energy Minister, H.E. Dr. Mohieldien Naiem Mohamed Saied, emphasised the need for private sector engagement to address LPG supply gaps.
Mary Burce Warlick, Deputy Executive Director of IEA, praised India’s model for its affordability, access, and infrastructure solutions, highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships and concessional financing for global expansion. Representatives from Rwanda and Nepal shared their countries’ efforts to reduce firewood dependency through electric stoves and biogas.
Rahool Panandiker of BCG credited India’s transformation in clean cooking to its strong political commitment, effective subsidies, and public awareness campaigns. He stressed the need to refine the LPG refill model for sustained usage and economic sustainability.
Puri also discussed the potential of solar cookers, highlighting IOCL’s advanced solar models priced at $500 per unit. While acknowledging cost challenges, he pointed to carbon financing and private sector collaborations as solutions to drive adoption across the Global South.
In his closing remarks, Puri reaffirmed India’s commitment to supporting global energy access initiatives, calling the Indian model a scalable solution for other developing nations. He emphasized that achieving universal clean cooking access is not just an economic goal but a moral obligation due to the health and environmental impacts of traditional biomass cooking.

Title: Greece elects former parliament speaker as new president
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:15:49 +0000
Content: Greece’s parliament elected its former speaker, Constantine Tassoulas, as the country’s president on Wednesday, approving the conservative government’s nominee for the largely ceremonial role.
The decision to nominate him has angered protesters who rallied outside parliament last month seeking justice over a deadly 2023 train crash. They say that on Tassoulas’ watch as parliamentary speaker, lawmakers failed to investigate any political responsibility over Greece’s worst rail disaster.
Two years later, a judicial probe is still in progress. Parliament is the only body that can investigate politicians under Greek law.
Tassoulas, 66, a lawyer and father of two who has been a lawmaker since 2000 and has previously served as Greece’s culture minister and deputy defence minister, won the backing of 160 lawmakers in Wednesday’s vote in the 300-seat parliament.
He will succeed Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Greece’s first female president, whose five-year term expires in March.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said last month that he chose Tassoulas on account of his political experience, widespread acceptance, and his “unifying spirit”.
Political analysts view Tassoulas’ nomination as aimed at strengthening Mitsotakis’ grip on power. His conservative New Democracy party has a small parliamentary majority with 156 seats but is under mounting pressure, opinion polls suggest.
Centre-left and leftist opposition parties had proposed other candidates and did not back Tassoulas’ nomination on Wednesday.
For decades, failure by parliament to elect a president in Greece could lead to a snap election. After a reform, following a decade-long financial crisis, the process can involve up to five voting rounds in parliament, with the threshold gradually falling to the majority of those present in the chamber.
Tassoulas will be sworn in as head of state on March 13.

Title: 1984 anti-Sikh riots: Delhi court convicts Sajjan Kumar in murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:53:01 +0000
Content: A Delhi court on Wednesday convicted former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in connection with the killing of a father-son duo in the Saraswati Vihar area on November 1, 1984, during the anti-Sikh riots.
Special judge Kaveri Baweja pronounced the conviction order and fixed the arguments on the quantum of the sentence on February 18.
This case is related to the killing of Jaswant Singh and his son Tarundeep Singh in the Saraswati Vihar area during the riots. Earlier on January 31, the Rouse Avenue Court reserved its verdict after hearing additional submissions advanced by Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat. On the other hand, Advocate Anil Sharma had submitted that Sajjan Kumar’s name was not there from the very beginning and there was a delay of 16 years in naming him as an accused by the witness. It was also submitted that a case in which Sajjan Kumar was convicted by the Delhi High Court is pending appeal before the Supreme Court.
Additional Public Prosecutor Rawat, in rebuttal, had submitted that the accused was not known to the victim. When she became aware of who Sajjan Kumar was, she named him in her statement.
Earlier, senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, appearing for the riot victims, had argued that the police investigations were manipulated in the Sikh riots cases. Police investigation was tardy and to save the accused, he said.
It was also argued that during riots, the situation was extraordinary and therefore, these cases have to be dealt with in this context.
During the arguments, Phoolka referred to the judgement of the Delhi High Court and submitted that it was not an isolated case, it was a part of a bigger massacre. It was further argued that as per official figures, 2,700 Sikhs were killed in Delhi in 1984.
Senior advocate Phoolka had referred to the Delhi High Court judgement in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot case of Delhi Cantt. wherein the court called the riots a “crime against humanity”.
Initially, an FIR was registered at Punjabi Bagh police station. Later on, this case was investigated by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted on the recommendation of Justice G.P. Mathur Committee and a charge sheet was filed.
The Justice Mathur committee had recommended the reopening of 114 cases. This case was one of them.
On December 16, 2021, the court framed charges against the accused Sajjan Kumar for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 147, 148, and 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as the offences punishable under sections 302, 308, 323, 395, 397, 427, 436, and 440 read with section 149 IPC.
It has been alleged by the SIT that the accused was leading the said mob and upon his instigation and abetment, the mob had burnt alive the above two persons and had also damaged, destroyed, and looted their household articles and other property, burnt their house, and also inflicted severe injuries on the person of their family members and relatives residing in their house.
It is claimed that during the investigation, material witnesses of the case were traced out, and examined, and their statements were recorded under section 161 CrPC.
The statements of the complainant under the above provision were recorded on November 23, 2016, during the course of this further investigation, in which she again narrated the above incident of looting, arson and murders of her husband and son by the mob armed with deadly weapons and she is also claimed to have deposed therein about the injuries suffered by her and the other victims of the case, including her sister-in-law who is stated to have subsequently expired. She had also clarified in that statement that the photograph of the accused was seen by her in a magazine after around one and a half months.

Title: Israeli military calls up reservists as uncertainty over Gaza ceasefire builds
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:40:09 +0000
Content: Israel’s military has called up reservists in preparation for a possible resumption of fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to meet a Saturday deadline to release more Israeli hostages and a nearly month-old ceasefire breaks down.
Under the ceasefire deal in force since January 19, the Palestinian militant group agreed to free three more hostages on Saturday. But it said this week it was suspending the handover because of what it said were Israeli violations of the terms.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded by saying all hostages must be freed by noon on Saturday or he would “let hell break out”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that Israel would resume “intense fighting” if Hamas did not meet the deadline, but did not say how many hostages should be freed.
The standoff threatens to reignite a conflict that has devastated the Gaza Strip, internally displaced most of its people and caused shortages of food, running water and shelter, and pushed the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.
Israeli officials said government ministers had endorsed Trump’s threat to “cancel” the ceasefire unless all the remaining Israeli hostages are released on Saturday.
Hamas has said it remains committed to the agreement but has not agreed to release the hostages on Saturday.
A Palestinian official close to the talks said mediators had stepped up their intervention “to prevent things sliding into a real crisis.”
“Things are not yet clear, but there is a big intervention from the side of the mediators with both sides in an attempt to resolve the impasse and ensure no pauses in the ceasefire agreement,” said the official, who asked not to be identified.
Asked for comment on where things stand, another Hamas official told Reuters, without giving details: “Contacts are under way.”
The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken as hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
In response, Israel began a military offensive against Hamas that has laid waste the coastal enclave and killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.
FEARS OF REGIONAL INSTABILITY
So far, Hamas has released 16 Israeli hostages from an initial group of 33 children, women and older men to be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in the first stage of a multi-phase ceasefire deal. In addition, it has also returned five Thai hostages in an unscheduled release.
Negotiations on a second phase of the agreement, which mediators had hoped would include agreement on the release of the remaining hostages as well as the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, were supposed to be under way in Doha but an Israeli team returned home on Monday, two days after arriving.
The threat to cancel a 42-day ceasefire that formed the basis on the agreement has drawn thousands of Israeli protesters to the streets this week, calling on the government to continue with the deal to bring the remaining hostages back.
A plan announced by Trump to take over Gaza, move out its more than 2 million Palestinian inhabitants and redevelop it into an international beach resort could also fuel regional instability, senior Arab officials said on Wednesday.
Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the World Government Summit in Dubai that if Trump pressed ahead with his vision for Gaza, he would lead the Middle East into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.”
Palestinians fear a repeat of the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, when nearly 800,000 people fled or were driven out during the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel. Trump has said they would have no right to return.
Jasem al-Budaiwi, who heads the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council political and economic alliance, called on Trump to remember the strong ties between the region and Washington.
“But there has to be give and take, he says his opinion and Arab world should say theirs; what he is saying won’t be accepted by the Arab world,” he said.
Trump has said the Palestinians in Gaza could settle in countries such as Jordan, which already has a huge Palestinian population, and Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state. Both have rejected the proposal.
Egypt will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss “serious” developments for Palestinians.
Aboul Gheit said the idea of the Arab Peace Initiative floated in 2002, in which Arab nations offered Israel normalised ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967, would be reintroduced.
Trump’s plan has upended decades of U.S. policy that endorsed a two-state solution in which Israel and a Palestinian state would coexist.

Title: Trump makes first big foray into Ukraine diplomacy, speaking to Putin, Zelenskiy
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 19:51:20 +0000
Content: Donald Trump discussed the war in Ukraine on Wednesday in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the new U.S. president’s first big step towards diplomacy over a war he has promised to end.
In a post on his social media platform after speaking to Putin, Trump said they had “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately,” and that he would begin by phoning Zelenskiy.
After speaking to the Ukrainian leader, Trump said: “The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make PEACE.”
Zelenskiy’s office said Trump and Zelenskiy had spoken by phone for about an hour, while the Kremlin said Putin’s call with Trump lasted nearly an hour and a half.
“I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We… talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together …and Ukraine’s technological capabilities… including drones and other advanced industries,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
The Kremlin said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump’s Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, delivered the new administration’s bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying recovering all of Ukraine’s territory occupied by Russia since 2014 was unrealistic, as was securing its membership in NATO.
“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth told a meeting of Ukraine and more than 40 allies at NATO headquarters in Brussels. “Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”
Hegseth said any durable peace must include “robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again”. But he said U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.
“The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement”.
France, Germany and Spain said Ukraine’s fate must not be decided without Kyiv’s active participation, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot saying Europe would play its role in offering security guarantees for Ukraine even if NATO membership were not immediate.
ZELENSKIY OFFERS MINERALS
Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.
Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a cabinet member in the new U.S. administration, said such a mineral deal could serve as a “security shield” for Ukraine after the war.
No peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary. Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden and most Western leaders held no direct discussions with Putin after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
During the war’s first year, Ukraine succeeded in pushing Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kyiv and recapturing swathes of Russian-occupied territory.
But Moscow has mostly had the upper hand since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023, making slow but steady gains in intense fighting that has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides and laid Ukrainian cities to waste.
Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.
In recent discussions, Kyiv appears to have accepted that it will not be admitted to NATO soon but has emphasised its need for military support under a peace deal.
“If Ukraine is not in NATO, it means that Ukraine will build NATO on its territory. So we need an army as numerous as the Russians have today,” Zelenskiy said in an interview with The Economist published on Wednesday.
“And for all this, we need weapons and money. And we will ask the U.S. for this,” Zelenskiy said, describing that as his “Plan B”.

Title: Gabbard confirmed as US intel chief in latest victory for Trump
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:47:30 +0000
Content: Tulsi Gabbard, a former U.S. representative with little intelligence experience, was confirmed as the top U.S. spy on Wednesday, as Republicans lined up behind a nominee once seen as among President Donald Trump’s most controversial picks.
The Senate voted 52 to 48, mostly along party lines, to confirm Gabbard to the position overseeing the 18-agency intelligence community and acting as Trump’s top adviser on intelligence issues.
The only Republican to vote against Gabbard was Senator Mitch McConnell, the party’s former leader in the chamber. No Democrats or independents voted in favor of the nominee.
The vote was another victory for Trump as he pushes to secure quick Senate approval for all of his nominees for administration positions.
The Senate’s Republican majority leader, John Thune, held a procedural vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also faced fierce opposition to his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services, immediately after the Gabbard confirmation vote.
Gabbard, a 43-year-old former Democrat, had faced bipartisan questions about past statements seen as supporting U.S. adversaries, and lack of experience that would have prepared her to manage a $100 billion budget. Gabbard neither worked at a spy agency nor served on an intelligence committee during her four House of Representatives terms.
She will now oversee an agency created by Congress in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the country’s sprawling intelligence apparatus, one of the most important national security positions in U.S. government.
“The selection of a DNI is a very big deal,” said Emily Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting the DNI’s broad access to classified material and role as the president’s main intelligence adviser.
RUSSIA, SYRIA, SNOWDEN
Trump’s announcement of Gabbard in November sent shockwaves through the national security establishment, adding to concerns that intelligence-gathering would be politicized, and weakened, during a second Trump administration.
Skeptics questioned Gabbard’s past statements seen as sympathetic toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and defense of the government of former Syria leader Bashar al-Assad, whom she visited in Syria in 2017 while he was under U.S. sanction.
At her hearing, Gabbard faced particularly pointed questioning from senators from both parties about her past defense of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked thousands of highly classified documents and then sought asylum in Russia.
Some were noticeably frustrated at her refusal to call Snowden a traitor.
Republicans who expressed concerns faced an intense political pressure campaign, from Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, who threatened to support primary opponents of any Republican who obstructed nominees.
Senator Todd Young, an intelligence committee member who did not immediately back Gabbard, issued a statement supporting her before the panel’s party-line 9-8 vote to recommend the nominee to the full Senate.
A former Marine Corps intelligence officer criticized by Musk before he endorsed Gabbard, Young said Gabbard had reassured him that she would support intelligence professionals and provide unbiased information.
Gabbard’s supporters also praised her pledges to pare back the DNI’s office, at a time when Trump’s administration is slashing and even seeking to close government agencies.
Past DNI nominees have been intelligence veterans confirmed with broad bipartisan support. Daniel Coats, a former ambassador and Republican senator who served on the intelligence committee, was confirmed by 85-12 in 2017, as Trump began his first term.
The DNI under former President Joe Biden, Avril Haines, had held a series of major national security positions, including deputy director of the CIA. She was confirmed by 84-10.
Harding said Gabbard will need to reassure allies that they can trust Washington as Trump pursues an aggressive foreign policy, and be cautious about making cuts amid myriad global challenges.
“The person that is going to be doing it needs to be someone that he (Trump) trusts and somebody that he’ll listen to,” Harding said.
Gabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent. She backed Trump and joined the Republican Party in 2024.

Title: Russia to get back jailed cybercrime boss from US after freeing teacher Marc Fogel
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:34:35 +0000
Content: The United States is freeing a Russian cybercrime boss from prison in return for Moscow’s release of U.S. schoolteacher Marc Fogel, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
The Kremlin said the deal – the first it has struck with the new administration of President Donald Trump – could help build trust between the two countries.
But it played down Trump’s suggestion that the agreement could make a significant contribution towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war, which he has pledged to bring to a swift conclusion.
Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 and extradited eventually to the U.S., where he pleaded guilty in May 2024 to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
He operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funnelling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity.
A U.S. administration official confirmed to Reuters that he was being released, but did not elaborate on the details or timing. Earlier, the Kremlin said a Russian was being freed but that it would not name him until he was back in the country.
Fogel, 63, was serving a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling after being caught at a Moscow airport with a small amount of marijuana. He was flown on Tuesday to Washington, where he celebrated his release with Trump at the White House.
Trump said the deal “could be a big important part” of ending the three-year-old Ukraine war.
Asked about that comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any agreement on releasing prisoners was the result of “very, very meticulous negotiating work”.
He added: “Of course, such agreements are hardly capable of becoming a breakthrough moment, but at the same time, bit by bit, these are steps to build mutual trust, which is now at its lowest point.”
A source close to the negotiations told Reuters that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia’s sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev were involved in arranging the exchange.
POSSIBLE MEETING
Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have both said they are keen to meet to discuss Trump’s ideas for bringing a swift conclusion to the war, but no date for any summit has been announced.
U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said Fogel was freed in a negotiated exchange “that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine”.
Trump had said another person would be released on Wednesday, without identifying who it would be. He called the terms of Fogel’s release “very fair”.
“We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,” Trump said.
Peskov declined to comment on the possibility of a further release.
Fogel was released into the custody of Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
The Washington Post said that according to Fox News broadcaster Sean Hannity, Witkoff, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Trump, had a three-and-a-half hour meeting with Putin. Peskov said he had “nothing to say” on that.
Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: “Not much” and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
Russia’s rouble rose against the dollar on Wednesday on news of the Fogel deal and optimism about prospects for an easing of the Ukraine crisis.

Title: US actions have serious impact on global health, WHO chief says
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:30:52 +0000
Content: The United States’ pause on foreign aid contributions is having a serious impact on global health, hitting programmes fighting polio, HIV and other threats, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday.
Tedros urged the U.S. to consider resuming aid funding until solutions can be found.
“There are actions that the U.S. government is taking… which we’re concerned are having a serious impact on global health,” said Tedros in a virtual press conference from Geneva.
Efforts to tackle HIV, polio, mpox and avian flu were all impacted by the U.S. foreign aid pause implemented by President Trump last month shortly after he took office while the programs are reviewed.
In particular, Tedros said, the suspension of funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) had caused an immediate stop to HIV treatment, testing and prevention services in the 50 countries it supports.
Despite the subsequent waiver allowing some services to resume, prevention efforts for at-risk groups were not included, he said.
“Clinics are shuttered and health workers have been put on leave,” he added, saying that the WHO is trying to help countries fill gaps in supplies of anti-retroviral drugs.
Both the funding suspension and the disengagement of U.S. institutions were also affecting the effort to eradicate polio and the response to mpox, he said, and in Myanmar, almost 60,000 people had been left with no access to life-saving services.
“We ask the US to consider continuing its funding at least until solutions can be found,” Tedros said.
As well as the aid freeze, Trump also moved to withdraw the United States from the WHO on the first day of his presidency, which is also hitting collaboration, particularly in fighting outbreaks and on influenza, Tedros said.
For example, the WHO has limited information about the spread of avian influenza among dairy cattle in the U.S., or human cases, although other WHO officials later said that the country was meeting its obligations to declare cases under international health rules.
Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director for pandemics and epidemics, said that WHO had not had influenza reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since around January 24, though.
“We are continuing to reach out to our colleagues and the U.S. government agencies. We haven’t heard back from them, but we will continue to reach out, and we hope again that that exchange resumes,” she said.
Tedros also referred to the funding gap for WHO itself. The agency has already reformed its funding model in recent years, but other ideas were also on the table, he said.
These include raising an endowment of $50 billion, although he did not give details about how that would be done. He also said the agency has considered cash recovery, or charging for some of its services, for institutions or people that could pay.

In a solemn tribute, PM Modi paid homage to Indian soldiers who fought in World Wars I and II at the Mazargues War Cemetery.
“A historic visit to France in the ancient city of Marseille concludes. In a special gesture, President @EmmanuelMacron came to see off PM @narendramodi at the airport,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on X.
PM Modi is now set for an official working visit to the United States from February 12-13, marking his first trip to Washington since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.
“Although this will be our first meeting following his historic electoral victory and inauguration in January, I have a very warm recollection of working together in his first term in building a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership between India and the US,” PM Modi said before departing.
“This visit will be an opportunity to build upon the successes of our collaboration in his first term and develop an agenda to further elevate and deepen our partnership, including in the areas of technology, trade, defense, energy, and supply chain resilience,” he added.

Title: PM Modi, Macron visit Cadarache ITER facility, discuss nuclear cooperation
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:02:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron visited the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) facility in Cadarache on Wednesday, marking the first-ever visit by a Head of State or Government to the ambitious fusion energy project.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the leaders were welcomed by the Director General of ITER and were briefed on the progress of the project, including the assembly of the world’s largest Tokamak—a device designed to produce 500 MW of fusion power by creating, containing, and controlling burning plasma. PM Modi and Macron commended the dedication of engineers and scientists working on the project.
India has been a key contributor to ITER for over two decades, alongside six other members. Around 200 Indian scientists and associates, along with leading industry players such as L&T, Inox India, TCS, TCE, and HCL Technologies, are actively involved in the initiative.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri highlighted that both leaders held significant discussions on strengthening their strategic partnership in civil nuclear energy.
During the visit, PM Modi and Macron welcomed the signing of a letter of intent on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). Additionally, an implementing agreement was signed between India’s Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP), the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), and France’s Institut National des Sciences et Techniques Nucléaires (INSTN), under the Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA), for cooperation in nuclear training and education.
Addressing the media, Misri noted ongoing Indo-French collaboration on the Jaitapur nuclear power project, which involves technological, financial, and civil liability considerations. He also emphasized the rapid progress in SMR and AMR cooperation.
“This is still an emerging technology, even in countries that have been working on it for some time. Our goal is to collaborate in co-designing, co-developing, and co-producing these reactors, which will help address challenges faced in conventional nuclear projects,” Misri said.
Both nations also renewed their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India’s DAE and France’s CEA to enhance cooperation through the Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP).

Title: India’s CPI inflation falls to 5-month low of 4.31% in January
Publication Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:01:52 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a five-month low of 4.31% in January as prices of vegetables and pulses eased, bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Wednesday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after reaching a 14-month high of 6.21% in October. CPI inflation had fallen to 5.48% in November and 5.22% in December.
Food inflation, at 6.02% in January 2025, is the lowest since August 2024.
“The significant decline in headline inflation and food inflation during January is mainly attributed to the decline in inflation for vegetables, eggs, pulses, cereals, education, clothing, and health,” according to an official statement.
The five items with the highest year-on-year inflation at the All India level in January were coconut oil (54.20%), potato (49.61%), coconut (38.71%), garlic (30.65%), and peas (30.17%).
The items with the lowest year-on-year inflation in January 2025 were cumin (-32.25%), ginger (-30.92%), dry chilies (-11.27%), brinjal (-9.94%), and LPG (-9.29%).
The year-on-year fuel and light inflation rate for January stood at -1.38%, compared to -1.33% in December 2024, as fuel prices continued to decline.
RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced on Friday a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.25% in the monetary policy review to accelerate growth amid global uncertainties.
He stated that inflation had declined and was expected to further moderate, gradually aligning with the RBI’s target.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and boosting the growth rate in a slowing economy.
The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with its neutral stance in monetary policy, focusing on inflation while supporting growth. This approach provides flexibility to respond to the macroeconomic environment, Malhotra said.
With retail inflation continuing its downward trend, the RBI will have more room to adopt a soft monetary policy, making more credit available to businesses and consumers, thereby propelling economic growth.

Title: FM Sitharaman to introduce Income Tax Bill today, LS adjourned till 2 pm
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 07:26:09 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to introduce a new Income Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha on Thursday as part of the tax reforms aimed at streamlining and simplifying provisions to enhance clarity and reduce legal disputes.
The ninth day of the Parliament’s Budget Session began at 11 am on Thursday. However, amid protests by opposition members on various issues, the Lok Sabha was adjourned until 2 pm. The finance minister is expected to present the Income Tax Bill in the Lower House later in the day.
The Income Tax Bill is being reduced to 622 pages and contains 536 clauses. It will replace the existing 64-year-old law that runs into 823 pages with 819 sections. The proposed bill seeks to simplify the language by introducing clearer terms, such as replacing ‘assessment year’ with ‘tax year’. It will eliminate various convoluted provisions and explanations to make it easier to understand and reduce the scope of legal disputes. Some archaic clauses are being dropped as part of the simplification process.
The legislation will supersede the Income Tax Act, 1961, which has grown extensively due to numerous modifications carried out over six decades. The revised tax framework is expected to come into force from April 1, 2026.
Its primary objective is to simplify the tax laws, ensuring they are more transparent, easier to interpret, and taxpayer-friendly. By replacing complex provisions with clearer provisions, it aims to reduce legal disputes and encourage voluntary tax compliance.
Once introduced in the Lok Sabha, the Bill will be sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for further deliberations. The new law is expected to take effect on April 1, 2026.
The bill will not change the existing tax slabs or review the tax rebate given. Instead, it aims to make the six-decade-old legislation reader-friendly.
“This reform is a significant step towards modernizing India’s tax framework, bringing greater clarity and efficiency. The bill promises a more streamlined, accessible tax system, making it easier for citizens and businesses to fulfil their obligations while fostering trust in the system,” says Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner, Deloitte India.

Title: Rajat Patidar takes the helm as RCB’s new captain for IPL 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 07:23:43 +0000
Content: India batter Rajat Patidar has been appointed captain of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) for the upcoming IPL 2025, starting on March 21.
RCB made the announcement at an event in Bengaluru on Thursday, with Patidar, director of cricket Mo Bobat, and head coach Andy Flower in attendance.
Patidar will replace former South African batter Faf du Plessis, who captained the side from 2022 to 2024 but was not retained in last year’s IPL mega auction.
The right-hander was one of the three players retained by the franchise, along with former India captain Virat Kohli and pacer Yash Dayal. This will be his first leadership role in the IPL. At the domestic level, he captained Madhya Pradesh in the 2024-25 seasons of the 20-over Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy.
The 31-year-old has played three seasons for the franchise since joining RCB in 2021 and has become a vital player for the side. He has scored 799 runs in 28 matches at a strike rate of 158.85.
On Patidar’s appointment as RCB captain, Kohli congratulated him, saying, “Rajat, firstly, I want to congratulate you and wish you all the very best. The way you have grown in this franchise and performed, you have truly earned a place in the hearts of RCB fans across India. They get really excited to watch you play, so this is very well deserved. I want to tell you that I and the other team members will be right behind you, and you’ll have all our support as you grow into this role.
“Of course, it’s a big responsibility. I’ve done this for many years, and Faf has done it for the last few years. To be seen as the person who will take this franchise forward, I’m sure, is a huge honor for you, and I’m very, very happy for you. You have earned the right to be in this position, and I’m sure you will grow from strength to strength,” he added.
Patidar was the second-highest run-scorer in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, amassing 428 runs in nine innings at an impressive average of 61.14 and a strike rate of 186.08. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he scored 226 runs, maintaining an average of 56.50 and a strike rate of 107.10.
“I’ve seen Rajat evolve over the last couple of years as a player. He’s had the opportunity to play for India, and his game has improved significantly. The way he has led his state team and the responsibility he has taken on have shown everyone that he has what it takes to lead this amazing franchise,” Kohli said.
“I just wish him all the very best, and I request all the fans to show him absolute support, get right behind him, and know that he will always do what’s best for the team and the franchise.
“We must all come together and support him because, regardless of what happens or who does what, the most important thing is the team and the franchise. We all have a responsibility to work toward the growth of this amazing team. Sending my best wishes to him and lots of love to the fans. Looking forward to seeing you all soon and having Rajat start the season with a bang,” the former RCB captain signed off.
Despite reaching the final three times, RCB are yet to win the IPL title, with their most recent final appearance coming in 2016. They have reached the playoffs in four of the last five seasons, including in 2024, when they secured a top-four spot by winning their last six league matches, only to lose in the eliminator.
With Patidar’s appointment, Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals remain the only teams yet to announce their captains for the upcoming season.
Shreyas Iyer, who captained KKR last year, will now lead Punjab Kings, while former DC captain Rishabh Pant will take over as captain of Lucknow Super Giants.

Title: Pariksha Pe Charcha: Technology should be a tool, not a crutch, say experts
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 07:14:07 +0000
Content: Students must learn to harness technology effectively without becoming overly dependent on it, said Radhika Gupta, CEO of Edelweiss Asset Management, during the third episode of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025, on Thursday.
Alongside tech expert and YouTuber Gaurav Chaudhary—popularly known as “Technical Guruji”—Gupta stressed the importance of maintaining a balance between digital assistance and personal skills.
“In a professional context, if our skills are overshadowed by technology, it becomes problematic. I strive to make technology my servant, not my master,” Gupta said.
She cautioned against the overuse of AI. “My passion is writing, framing sentences, and playing with words. I don’t want AI to write an 800-word essay for me; I want to do it myself. I constantly remind myself not to rely on AI for this, even if it takes longer.”
Chaudhary added that while technology has undeniably simplified many aspects of life, it has also impaired our ability to retain simple information, like phone numbers.
“Our dependency on technology must not come at the cost of our skill sets, creativity, and core identity,” he said.
Both speakers agreed that AI’s role in education should be confined to providing illustrative examples.
“I think a teacher’s role is to provide wisdom and experience. Just like an English teacher wants to demonstrate how to write well, they can use AI to showcase a few good examples in the classroom…The teacher can use it as a slave though guiding it,” Chaudhary said.
“Think of AI as an assistant that can do all the tasks you want, and the best part is — it doesn’t even take a salary…,” he added.
Earlier, Gupta pointed out that this year’s Pariksha Pe Charcha addressed modern challenges—issues such as AI integration and mental health that were barely on the radar two decades ago.
“Platforms like ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ provide students with an opportunity to openly discuss mental health, time management, and technology-related concerns as they face the immense stress and pressure in today’s fast-paced world,” she said.
Gupta also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ability to connect with and inspire individuals—from athletes to professionals—by engaging with them as both a friend and a motivator.

Title: Elon Musk says Grok 3 in final stages, outperforming all chatbots
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:50:18 +0000
Content: Elon Musk said on Thursday his AI chatbot, and ChatGPT challenger, Grok 3, is in the final stages of development and will be released in about a week or two.
“Grok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we’ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that’s been released, that we’re aware of, so that’s a good sign,” he said in a video call addressing the World Governments Summit in Dubai.
The billionaire tech mogul founded xAI as a challenger to Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google. Musk also co-founded OpenAI.
On Monday, a consortium of investors led by Musk said it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the assets of OpenAI’s nonprofit, in another salvo from the world’s richest man against the artificial intelligence startup.
OpenAI has said it wants to become a for-profit organization to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.
Musk sued OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and others in August and has asked a U.S. district judge to block OpenAI’s attempt to transition to a for-profit entity. OpenAI said this week Musk’s bid clashes with his lawsuit.
“I think the evidence is there in that OpenAI has gotten this far while having at least a sort of dual profit, non-profit role. What they’re trying to do now is to completely delete the non-profit, and that seems really going too far.”
Musk, who was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to oversee the so-called Department of Government Efficiency aimed at dramatically reducing the size of the federal workforce, said government spending could be reduced by $1 trillion or more.
“Maybe the economy could grow at 4 or 5% potentially, in terms of real useful goods and services output, and government spending can be reduced by about 3 or 4% of the economy, about maybe a trillion dollars or more, and the net effect of that would be no inflation from 2025 to 2026 so that would be quite remarkable,” Musk said.
Turning to international affairs, Musk told the Middle East audience the United States has been “pushy” in the past and it should “mind its own business”.
“I think we should, in general leave other countries to their own business,” he said.
Trump has enraged the Arab world by saying the U.S. would take over the Gaza strip, resettle its Palestinian inhabitants and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.

Title: India’s best audition for World Cup slots in WPL 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:42:10 +0000
Content: The 2025 Women’s Premier League (WPL) gets underway in Vadodara on Friday and the expanding edition of the five-team league is tipped to showcase India’s formidable pool of exciting talent over the next four weeks.
Defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will clash with hosts Gujarat Giants in Vadodara on Friday in what would be a new beginning for the league, which was confined to two venues in Mumbai in its inaugural edition in 2023.
The 2024 edition was split between Bengaluru and Delhi but the tournament will be held in home-and-away format from Friday.
The likes of Asha Sobhana, Uma Chetry, Shreyanka Patil and Saika Ishaque have earned their India call-ups after match-winning performances in the WPL.
“The improvement of domestic Indian players and national players as well has been incredible to watch,” Delhi Capitals skipper Meg Lanning told a virtual press conference this week.
“I’ve really enjoyed seeing their development and how much they’ve been getting better just through the opportunity that WPL provides,” the former Australia captain added.
With India hosting the women’s ODI World Cup later this year, the WPL, despite being a different format, will serve as an audition for several Indian players.
“It was a huge gap to play international cricket after coming from domestic cricket,” India and Mumbai Indians skipper Harmanpreet Kaur told Cricinfo.
“WPL has filled that gap … and because of that, the hard work I, as a captain, had to put in along with the support staff to make the players ready for internationals has reduced.”
The newly appointed UP Warriorz captain Deepti Sharma said the WPL provided players with a priceless experience of sharing the dressing room with the best talents.
“When you play with the overseas players in the same team then you get to know how they play, read the game and their patterns,” Deepti told Reuters.
“If you play with them (youngsters) in the same team then they get good confidence and nervousness goes down.”
The money offered has also been life-changing for many, including some uncapped players.
In the 2025 WPL auction, Gujarat splashed 19 million Indian rupees ($218,800) on an uncapped Simran Shaikh.
“I thought of getting selected in 10-12 lakhs (around one million) but had no hopes to get signed in crores (tens of millions),” the all-rounder said.
RCB captain Smriti Mandhana said the financial stability that the WPL offered to domestic players “was a huge positive.”
“It allows them more freedom in their game, enabling them to express themselves better on the field,” Mandhana said in the franchise’s ‘Sports Forward Nation’ report.

Title: Syria’s new leaders zero in on Assad’s business barons
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:39:45 +0000
Content: Syria’s new rulers are combing through the billion-dollar corporate empires of ousted president Bashar al-Assad’s allies, and have held talks with some of these tycoons, in what they say is a campaign to root out corruption and illegal activity.
After seizing power in December, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel group that now runs Syria pledged to reconstruct the country after 13 years of brutal civil war and abandon a highly-centralized and corrupt economic system where Assad’s cronies held sway.
To do so, the executive led by new president Ahmed al-Sharaa has set up a committee tasked with dissecting the sprawling corporate interests of high-profile Assad-linked tycoons including Samer Foz and Mohammad Hamsho, three sources told Reporters.
Days after taking Damascus, the new administration issued orders aimed at freezing companies and bank accounts of Assad-linked businesses and individuals, and later specifically included those on U.S. sanctions lists, according to correspondence between the Syrian central bank and commercial banks reviewed by Reporters.
Hamsho and Foz, targeted by U.S. sanctions since 2011 and 2019 respectively, returned to Syria from abroad and met with senior HTS figures in Damascus in January, according to a government official and two Syrians with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The two men, who are reviled by many ordinary Syrians for their close ties to Assad, pledged to cooperate with the new leadership’s fact-finding efforts, the three sources said.
Accused by the U.S. Treasury of getting rich off Syria’s war, Foz’s sprawling Aman Holding conglomerate has interests in pharma, sugar refining, trading and transport.
Hamsho’s interests, grouped under the Hamsho International Group, are similarly wide-ranging, from petrochemicals and metal products to television production.
Hamsho, whom the U.S. Treasury has accused of being a front for Assad and his brother Maher, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Foz could not be reached.
The establishment of the committee, whose members are not public, and the conversations between Syria’s new government and two of the Assad government’s closest tycoons who control large parts of Syria’s economy have not been previously reported.
The new Syrian government’s approach towards powerful Assad-linked businesses, yet to be fully clarified, will be key in determining the fate of the economy as the administration struggles to convince Washington and its allies to remove sanctions, Syrian analysts and businessmen say.
Trade Minister Maher Khalil Al-Hasan and Syrian investment chief Ayman Hamawiye both confirmed to Reuters the government had been in contact with some Assad-linked businessmen, but did not identify them or provide further details.
Khaldoun Zoubi, a long-term partner of Foz, confirmed his associate had held talks with Syrian authorities but did not confirm if he had been in the country.
“Foz told them he is ready to cooperate with the new administration and provide all the support to the Syrian people and the new state,” Zoubi said from the gilded lobby of the Four Seasons hotel in central Damascus, which Foz’s group majority owns. “He is ready to do anything asked of him.”
The two Syrian sources said Foz, who holds a Turkish citizenship, had left Damascus after the talks. Reuters could not ascertain Hamsho’s whereabouts.
‘ECONOMY IN THEIR HANDS’
The U.S. has sanctioned Foz, Hamsho and others with a prominent economic role, including Yasser Ibrahim, Assad’s most trusted advisor.
Syrian analysts say around a dozen men make up the close ring of business barons tied to the former regime. HTS-appointed government officials consider all of them to be persons of interest.
Syrian authorities have ordered companies and factories belonging or linked to the tycoons to keep working, under supervision of HTS authorities, while the committee investigates their various businesses.
“Our policy is to allow for their employees to continue working and supplying goods to the market while freezing their money movements now,” Trade Minister Hasan told Reuters in an interview early in January.
“It’s a huge file. (Assad’s business allies) have the economy of a state in their hands. You can’t just tell them to leave,” he added, explaining the new government could not avoid engaging with the tycoons.
Hamsho International Group is among those put under HTS supervision, according to the sources with direct knowledge.
A Reuters visit in late January showed little work was being carried out at its modern multi-storey headquarters in Damascus, where some offices had been looted in the wake of Assad’s fall.
Staff have been instructed to cooperate fully with the new Syrian administration, members of whom regularly visit the company seeking information, said one employee, who asked not to be identified by name.
Some economists say the country’s dire economic situation required major domestic corporations to continue to operate regardless of who they may be affiliated with.
The UN says 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line.
While basic goods shortages have eased after strict trade controls dissolved in the aftermath of Assad’s fall, many Syrians still struggle to afford them.
“Syrian authorities need to be wary of a harsh crackdown on former regime cronies because this could create significant shortages (of goods),” said Karam Shaar, director of a Syria-focused economic consultancy bearing his name.
‘TOTAL JUSTICE’
Assad’s rapid fall, culminating with his December 8 escape to Russia, left many Syrian oligarchs with no time to dispose of or move their local assets that have since been frozen, giving Syria’s new rulers strong leverage in dealing with the tycoons, according to two prominent businessmen and the government official.
But a lack of transparency by HTS authorities in dealing with the tycoons and their businesses risks backlash.
“The overall approach to these Assad regime cronies is not clear and it might depend on the actor and also how much backing they have,” said Shaar, who advocates following a strict legal path.
Hamawiye, who has been appointed to deal with potential foreign investors and advises the new ruling authorities on economic policy, acknowledged public concerns over the future of regime-linked businesses, which vary in size and importance.
He said ordinary businessmen who were forced to pay bribes or work with the regime so they could function were not under the new administration’s microscope.
But the process would be different for a few who partnered with Assad and made fortunes at the expense of the state and engaged in illegal activities, he said.
For example, Assad’s brother Maher, whom the U.S. says had links with Hamsho, ran the Fourth Division of the Syrian army that was later linked to the production of the amphetamine-like drug captagon.
“If you beat one of (the business tycoons) or throw them in jail, who will benefit? You need to work slowly, with committees and information and investigations, so that you get as much justice as possible,” Hamawiye said.
Meanwhile Zoubi, who maintained links to some Syrian opposition groups alongside his partnership with Foz, said he had understood from his dealings with the new rulers that they sought a “conciliatory” approach.
“I’m optimistic the new administration is not personalizing matters,” he said.

Title: JPC on Waqf Bill to present report in Parliament today; Prepared after touring the nation, says Chairman
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:13:13 +0000
Content: BJP MP and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Jagadambika Pal said on Thursday that the JPC will present its report in Parliament today, after six months of nationwide consultations.
Speaking to ANI, the JPC Chairman emphasized the committee toured the country to collect inputs before finalizing the report, which included the adoption of 25 amendments across 14 clauses.
“Today the JPC will produce its report in the Parliament. To have a detailed discussion and deliberation, the JPC was formed six months ago. In the last six months, we have prepared a report after touring the whole nation. We have adopted 25 amendments in 14 clauses,” he said.
The Waqf JPC Chairman also spoke about the concerns of some JPC members who felt their views were not heard, clarifying that dissenting notes have been included in the report’s appendix, along with records from relevant stakeholders.
“Some members of the JPC had a complaint that they were not listened to. After the adoption of the report, we asked them to submit a note of dissent. We have also attached the note of dissent to the appendix of the report. We will also present the records of the stakeholders today,” Jagdambika Pal said.
According to the List of Business of Lok Sabha, Jagdambika Pal, chairperson of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, along with BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal, will present the report of the Joint Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 today.
They will also lay on the table the record of evidence given before the Joint Committee. The report was presented to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on January 30, 2025.
In Rajya Sabha, the report will be tabled by Medha Vishram Kulkarni and Gulam Ali.
The JPC on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill adopted the draft report and the amended revised bill on January 29.
However, opposition leaders submitted their dissent notes on the report.
Trinamool Congress MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Md Nadimul Haque, who were members of the panel, had protested “the expunction of key portions of their dissent notes” submitted to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
Banerjee and Haque alleged that the committee’s conclusions were biased and predetermined and claimed that the committee ignored stakeholder representations, witness depositions, and submissions made by opposition members.
The Waqf Act of 1995, enacted to regulate Waqf properties, has long been criticised for issues such as mismanagement, corruption, and encroachments.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to address these challenges by introducing reforms such as digitisation, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties.

Title: North Korea dismantling facility near border for separated families, Seoul says
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:10:53 +0000
Content: North Korea is dismantling a facility at its Mount Kumgang resort used for hosting meetings between families separated after the Korean War, South Korea said on Thursday, in the latest sign of strained tensions between the two Koreas.
Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles affairs between the two Koreas, urged in a statement North Korea to immediately stop the action at the site near the border.
The demolition of the facility is an “anti-humanitarian act that tramples on the wishes of separated families,” the ministry said, adding that it would consider legal measures over the action and a joint response with the international community.
North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbour in recent years, designating South Korea as a “hostile state”.
Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea’s military to fire warning shots at the time.
In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step.
Nonetheless, there have been recent signs that North Korea may be prepared to reopen to some foreign visitors for the first time in more than five years since the closure of its borders to tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beijing-based Koryo Tours on Thursday said tours to North Korea were “officially back”, with some of its staff allowed to enter the Rason area in what it hoped would mark the relaunch of tourism.

He emphasized that parliamentary democracy is the best form of governance, providing effective solutions to various issues, and stressed the importance of making citizens active stakeholders in governance to achieve “Good Governance.”

Title: Brazil nixes BRICS currency, eyes less reliance on ‘mighty’ dollar
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:14:54 +0000
Content: Brazil’s BRICS presidency this year will not advance a common currency for the group of major developing economies this year, four government officials said, but its agenda may pave the way for less reliance on the U.S. dollar in global trade.
That agenda could draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has twice in recent months warned the BRICS group, founded by Brazil, Russia, India, China, not to challenge the dominance of “the mighty U.S. Dollar.”
“There is no chance that BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, or anywhere else, and any Country that tries should say hello to Tariffs, and goodbye to America!” Trump wrote on social media last month.
The Brazilian officials, who requested anonymity to discuss plans, said the idea of a shared currency to replace the dollar, floated by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and others at recent BRICS summits, has never entered technical discussions.
Three of the sources said Brazil is instead pushing reforms within BRICS to ease international payments in local currencies, opening the door to less dependence on the dollar for global trade, although they said that is not the main objective.
“It’s not directed against anyone,” said one source, who stressed the focus was on reducing friction for global trade.
The agenda includes studying technologies such as blockchain and linking payment systems to cut transaction costs, following standards set by multilateral bodies like the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the three sources said.
“No one wants to create trouble, but BRICS countries also don’t want to abandon the idea of exploring this possibility,” said another source, adding that no member countries intend to eliminate their dollar reserves.
Even Lula has backed off the idea of a new currency for the bloc, while still defending last week the BRICS nations’ “right to discuss establishing forms of trade that do not make us fully dependent on the dollar.”
Last week, Brazil’s Finance Ministry and central bank discussed their proposals for the BRICS presidency this year, including cross-border payment initiatives, sources said.
Neither institution responded to a request for comment.
SUMMIT IN SIGHT
BRICS representatives will meet in South Africa this month on the sidelines of the G20 meetings, where Brazil will present its plan for the BRICS summit in July, the sources added.
Founded in 2009 and soon expanded to add South Africa, the BRICS group has recently included Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, making it a growing diplomatic counterweight to traditional Western powers.
Brazil has gained prominence in discussions of global payments with the rapid rise of its instant payments system, called Pix, which launched in late 2020 and has already surpassed use of cash, credit and debit cards.
In his first public remarks as Brazil’s new central bank chief last week, Gabriel Galipolo said Pix is programmed in a way that it can be easily integrated with other payment systems, although governance challenges remain an important hurdle.
Brazil already operates a Local Currency Payment System (SML), managed by its central bank through agreements with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
The system allows transactions to be settled directly in Brazilian reais, bypassing the dollar as an intermediary and eliminating the need for foreign exchange contracts.
Although the system lowers intermediation costs, settlements take at least three business days, which have limited adoption.
Argentina was the top trade partner with SML transactions last year, totaling 5.1 billion reais ($878 million) — just a fraction of their overall $27.4 billion in bilateral trade.
“With instant payment technology, these connections could become more secure, faster and cheaper,” one of the sources said.

Title: India’s first manned submersible Matsya 6000 to launch by 2026: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:38:46 +0000
Content: India’s first manned submersible, Matsya 6000, is expected to carry three people to a depth of 6,000 metres in the ocean by 2026, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Jitendra Singh said on Thursday.
In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today, Singh said that Matsya 6000, part of the Deep Ocean Mission, will explore ocean biodiversity, conduct surveys, and assess mineral resources with a suite of scientific sensors.
“The manned submersible Matsya 6000 is likely to be realised by 2026,” Singh said, adding that the technologies developed under the Deep Ocean Mission will “expand the country’s capability for deep-sea man-rated vehicle development.”
The mission will also pave the way for sustainable deep-sea exploration and the harnessing of deep-sea living and non-living resources. Additionally, it offers immediate spin-offs in underwater engineering innovations, asset inspection, and the promotion of ocean literacy.
Matsya 6000 will feature a 2.1-metre internal diameter Titanium alloy personnel sphere to safely carry humans to a depth of 6,000 metres. This sphere is being integrated in collaboration with ISRO.
The submersible will also be equipped with subsystems for buoyancy management, enabling descent and ascent, along with power and control systems, maneuvering propellers, subsea intervention manipulators, navigation and positioning devices, data and voice communication systems, onboard energy storage batteries, and emergency support systems, Singh said.
The submersible is designed to enable continuous operations at 6,000 metres depth for up to 12 hours, with an emergency endurance of up to 96 hours for deep-water observation and exploration.
“A Human Support and Safety System, critical for supporting three crew members, has been developed for acclimatisation and usage during routine and emergency scenarios,” the Minister informed.

Title: At least 20 injured after car drives into Munich crowd
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:41:55 +0000
Content: At least 20 people were injured when a car drove into a crowd in Munich on Thursday, police said, as the southern German city prepares for a top-level security conference due to be attended by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The Bild newspaper said police would have to establish whether the driver of the Mini Cooper had deliberately driven into the crowd or mixed up the accelerator and brake.
Police said on X they had detained the driver and did not consider him to pose any further threat, but declined to comment on whether it was an accident.
“At least 20 people injured, some seriously and critically,” a spokesperson for Munich police said.
The Munich Security Conference starts on Friday and senior officials, including Vance and Zelenskiy, were arriving later on Thursday.
A large-scale police operation was underway near the city’s central train station.
“One person is lying on the street and a young man has been taken away by the police. People are sitting on the ground, crying and trembling,” a reporter for the local BR broadcaster wrote in a post on X.
The incident appeared to have affected people participating in a demonstration linked to a strike organised by the Verdi union, according to the broadcaster.
The union said it did not have any information on the incident.
Police set up a gathering point for witnesses in the Loewenbraeukeller, one of Munich’s oldest beer halls.
The incident occurred around 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) from the security conference venue.
Security has been in sharp focus in Germany ahead of a federal election next week and following a string of violent attacks.

Title: India’s ongoing efforts to strengthen cancer care and research
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:18:08 +0000
Content: Cancer continues to be one of the major causes of death worldwide, with millions of new cases reported each year. In 2022, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were recorded, and 9.7 million people died from the disease globally. In India, cancer remains a pressing health concern, with cases projected to rise. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), more than 14 lakh new cases were estimated in 2023.
The National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), under ICMR, has been monitoring cancer incidence and trends since 1982, providing essential data for policy decisions. The National Institute of Cancer Prevention & Research (NICPR) plays a role in research and screening guidelines. The government has introduced policies, financial support, and strategic interventions to improve prevention, early detection, and treatment across the country.
Government Initiatives in Cancer Care
The Union Budget 2025-26 reflects the government’s focus on healthcare, with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare allocated Rs. 99,858.56 crore. The government plans to set up Day Care Cancer Centres in all district hospitals within the next three years, with 200 centres planned for 2025-26. To make treatment more accessible, customs duty exemptions have been introduced for 36 life-saving drugs used in cancer and other diseases, with some medicines attracting a concessional customs duty of 5%. Drugs provided under pharmaceutical companies’ patient assistance programs have also been exempted from customs duty.
The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under the National Health Mission. The programme focuses on early detection and screening for oral, breast, and cervical cancers. Several district clinics and community health centres provide screenings and related services. Infrastructure is being strengthened through tertiary cancer centres and state cancer institutes.
Efforts to decentralize cancer care have resulted in the establishment of multiple tertiary care centres. There are now 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres across the country. Institutions such as the National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar, Haryana, and the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in Kolkata contribute to advancing treatment and research.
Expanding Access to Treatment
The Ayushman Bharat scheme, launched in 2018, provides healthcare coverage to economically weaker sections, ensuring timely treatment for cancer patients. The scheme includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical oncology, reducing financial strain on families. The Health Minister’s Cancer Patient Fund under the Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi programme provides financial aid of up to Rs. 5 lakh for cancer treatment, with a maximum assistance limit of Rs. 15 lakh. Funds are allocated to 27 regional cancer centres to support underprivileged patients.
The National Cancer Grid (NCG), established in 2012, works to standardize cancer care across the country. The network has expanded to 287 members, including research institutes, hospitals, and advocacy groups. The NCG supports evidence-based treatment and collaborates with Ayushman Bharat to ensure affordability. It has also contributed to digital health initiatives by developing electronic patient records.
Advancements in Cancer Research
India has made progress in cancer research, with recent developments in treatment technology. In 2024, NexCAR19, India’s first indigenous CAR-T cell therapy, was introduced through a collaboration between IIT Bombay, Tata Memorial Centre, and ImmunoACT. This therapy offers a treatment option for blood cancers and aims to make advanced care more accessible.
International collaborations are also shaping cancer research. In 2024, India partnered with the US, Australia, and Japan under the Quad Cancer Moonshot initiative to address cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region. The initiative focuses on expanding screening and vaccination programs and advancing research.
The Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research, and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), a key unit of Tata Memorial Centre, has initiated an expansion plan to enhance cancer research and patient care. This development supports ongoing clinical advancements and new therapeutic approaches.
Raising Awareness and Promoting Prevention
Efforts to educate the public on cancer prevention and early detection are being strengthened. The government has integrated cancer awareness into primary healthcare through community-level programs. Media campaigns across print, electronic, and social platforms promote healthy lifestyles and early detection. National Cancer Awareness Day and World Cancer Day serve as opportunities to encourage public participation in health initiatives.
Other initiatives, such as the Eat Right India campaign by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, promote nutritious food choices. The Fit India Movement encourages physical activity, and yoga programs under the Ministry of AYUSH support overall well-being. These initiatives contribute to awareness and prevention efforts.
Building a Stronger Cancer Care System
India’s approach to cancer care involves policy measures, infrastructure development, and financial assistance programs. The government is expanding access to treatment through district-level cancer centres and affordable healthcare schemes. Research efforts, such as indigenous CAR-T cell therapy and global collaborations, are contributing to advanced treatment options. Digital health initiatives and standardized care networks are improving coordination in cancer management.

Title: No objection to dissent notes, says Amit Shah amid opposition protests in Lok Sabha on Waqf Bill report
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:17:32 +0000
Content: Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that the government has no opposition if dissent notes of the Opposition are added to the Joint Parliamentary Committee report on the Waqf Amendment Bill that was tabled in Parliament today.
Chairman of JPC on waqf, Jagdambika Pal today tabled the panel’s report in the Lok Sabha amid opposition protest. Earlier in the day, the report was tabled in the Rajya Sabha with the opposition alleging that their dissent notes were not included in the JPC’s final report.
Addressing the Lower House amidst opposition protests, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, “Some members of the Opposition have raised objections that their dissent notes have not been fully included in the report. On behalf of my party, I would like to request that the disputes of the opposition be included in the appropriate procedure of the parliamentary process; my party has no objection to this.”
Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that he has included all the dissent notes after meeting with the Opposition leaders.
“Whatever issues were raised by the members of the Waqf Board who met with me, I have included them in the annexure,” Birla said. The Lok Sabha was subsequently adjourned till 11 am on March 10.
Congress National President and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge had earlier opposed the JPC report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, alleging that dissent notes from Opposition members were removed.
Kharge said that it is not right to remove the dissent notes and views of the Opposition members from the report.
“In the JPC report on the Waqf Board, many members have their dissent report. It is not right to remove those notes and bulldoze our views. This is anti-democratic and condemnable. Stockholders were called from outside and their statements were taken. I condemn any report that has been presented after deleting the dissent reports. We will never accept such fake reports. If the report does not have dissent views, it should be sent back and presented again,” Kharge said.
Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, JP Nadda, hit back at the opposition, calling their protest “irresponsible.”
“Inside the Parliament, there are debates and discussions on various issues, and within a democracy, we agree to disagree, but we must respect traditions. While keeping traditions in mind, the proceedings of the house should be conducted under the provisions of the Constitution,” he said.
“I regret that despite repeated requests from the Chairman, the opposition’s behavior has been extremely irresponsible, and it deserves all the condemnation it receives,” Nadda added.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju also dismissed the Opposition’s claims, saying that nothing was deleted from the report.
“There is no deletion or removal of any part of the report. Everything is tabled on the floor of the House. Don’t mislead the House. I am very pained to say that the Opposition parties are making unnecessary issues by raising issues without facts. The allegation is false. There was no violation of any rules by the JPC. All the dissent notes are also included in the report. This is very unfortunate,” Rijiju said.
The Waqf Act of 1995, enacted to regulate Waqf properties, has long been criticised for issues such as mismanagement, corruption, and encroachments.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to address these challenges by introducing reforms such as digitisation, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties.

Title: Human rights violations ongoing in Bangladesh even during interim government’s tenure: OHCHR Report
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:02:33 +0000
Content: The United Nations’ Human Rights Office (OHCHR) has found that human rights violations in Bangladesh did not occur only during the Awami League era but are also taking place under the interim government’s tenure. This finding was revealed in a fact-finding report made public by the UN agency on Wednesday.
Divided into two broad sections, the report states that human rights violations during the interim government’s tenure include revenge abuses targeting the police, Awami League members, and the media, as well as abuses against religious and indigenous communities.
According to the report, revenge abuses have included lynching of Awami League members, police officials, and journalists during and after the July uprising; burning and looting of police stations; attacks on Awami League offices and the homes of party leaders; arson at the Dhanmondi-32 house belonging to Sheikh Hasina’s family; sexual violence against female members of the Awami League; and attacks on journalists and media houses allegedly associated with Sheikh Hasina’s government.
Additionally, the OHCHR report documents human rights violations against religious and indigenous communities since the interim government under Prof. Muhammad Yunus took over. These include widespread attacks on Hindu homes and establishments, as well as assaults on indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) by Bengali groups accusing them of being loyal to the former Sheikh Hasina government.
To remain in power, the former Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government, along with its political apparatus—including security and intelligence forces—allegedly used systematic and brutal violence against student-led mass protests in July-August last year, the OHCHR report found.
Based on testimony from senior officials and other evidence, the report highlights serious human rights violations by security forces during the protests, including extrajudicial killings, excessive use of force resulting in serious injuries to thousands, mass arbitrary arrests and detentions, and acts of torture and other mistreatment.
These violations raise concerns under international criminal law, warranting further investigations to determine whether they constitute crimes against humanity, torture as a standalone crime, or serious violations under domestic law, according to the report.

Title: Sitharaman tables new Income Tax bill in Lok Sabha, virtual assets like crypto defined under income from other sources
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 09:45:58 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha on Thursday as part of tax reforms aimed at streamlining and simplifying provisions to make them easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The legislation will replace the Income Tax Act, 1961, which has undergone extensive modifications over the past six decades.
The bill will be sent to the Select Committee of Parliament before being presented for final approval. The new law is expected to take effect on April 1, 2026.
The primary objective of the new Income Tax Bill is to simplify tax laws, making them more transparent, easier to interpret, and taxpayer-friendly. By replacing complex provisions with clearer language, it aims to reduce legal disputes and encourage voluntary tax compliance.
The bill may introduce lower penalties for certain offences, making the tax system more accommodating for taxpayers.
The Income Tax Bill has been condensed to 622 pages and contains 536 clauses. It will replace the existing 64-year-old law, which spans 823 pages with 819 sections. The proposed bill seeks to simplify legal language by introducing clearer terms, such as replacing “assessment year” with “tax year.” It also eliminates various convoluted provisions and explanations to enhance readability and reduce legal ambiguities. Additionally, certain archaic clauses are being removed as part of the simplification process.
The new bill also introduces explicit provisions for virtual digital assets and updates beneficial tax rates. This ensures that digital assets, such as cryptocurrency, are covered under a proper tax framework.
The bill will not alter existing tax slabs or revise the tax rebate structure. Instead, it focuses on making the six-decade-old legislation more user-friendly.
“This reform is a significant step toward modernizing India’s tax framework, bringing greater clarity and efficiency. The bill promises a more streamlined, accessible tax system, making it easier for citizens and businesses to fulfill their obligations while fostering trust in the system,” said Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner, Deloitte India.
The first part of the Budget Session of Parliament concluded on Thursday, with the second part scheduled to resume on March 10. The session is being held in two phases—January 31 to February 13 and March 10 to April 4.

Title: Hamas says it does not want Gaza ceasefire to collapse
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 09:43:19 +0000
Content: Hamas does not want the Gaza ceasefire agreement to collapse, the Palestinian militant group said on Thursday, ahead of a Saturday deadline for it to release more Israeli hostages.
Hamas agreed under the deal to free three more hostages on Saturday but said this week that it was suspending the handover over what it said were Israeli violations of the terms.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded by saying all hostages must be freed by noon on Saturday or he would “let hell break out”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would resume “intense fighting” if Hamas did not meet the deadline.
“We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation (Israel) adheres to it fully,” Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said.
“The language of threats and intimidation used by Trump and Netanyahu does not serve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement,” Qanoua said.
A Hamas delegation led by the group’s Gaza chief, Khalil Al-Hayya, met Egyptian security officials on Wednesday to try to break the impasse. A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters that mediators Egypt and Qatar were trying to find solutions to prevent a slide back into fighting.
In a statement, Hamas said the mediators were exerting pressure for the ceasefire deal to be fully implemented, ensure Israel abides by a humanitarian protocol and resume exchanges of Israeli hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel on Saturday.
Israel has called up military reservists to brace for a possible re-eruption of war in Gaza if Hamas fails to meet a Saturday deadline to free further Israeli hostages.

Title: Vivek Ramaswamy calls meeting with PM Modi a ‘pleasure and honour’ after bilateral talks in Washington
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:37:00 +0000
Content: Indian-origin entrepreneur and Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy expressed his delight after a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Blair House in Washington DC, calling it a “pleasure and honour” to welcome the Indian leader to the United States.
“It was a pleasure and honour to welcome Prime Minister Modi here. Hope he has a wonderful visit and it was a great meeting,” Ramaswamy said following the discussions with PM Modi.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, the two leaders engaged in insightful discussions on India-US ties, innovation, biotechnology, and the role of entrepreneurship in shaping the future.
Ramaswamy, who had earlier vied for the Republican presidential nomination before endorsing Donald Trump, has been a vocal advocate for strengthening US-India relations. He had previously served as co-head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Elon Musk but stepped down from the role reportedly due to differences with the Tesla CEO.
PM Modi, who arrived in the US on Wednesday for his first visit since Donald Trump’s re-election, is set to meet the US President at the White House later in the day. Upon his arrival, the Prime Minister reiterated his commitment to enhancing the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, highlighting the visit as an opportunity to build on past successes and foster deeper cooperation.
India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, along with other officials, welcomed PM Modi at the airport, marking the start of a significant diplomatic engagement between the two nations.

Title: PM Modi meets Tesla CEO Elon Musk at Blair House
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:26:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk at Blair House in Washington DC on Thursday during his two-day visit to the United States.
Musk, who also serves as the head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was accompanied by three of his children and presented a special gift to the Prime Minister before their discussions.
The meeting is believed to have touched upon Starlink’s plans for India, with Musk expected to have raised the issue of Starlink’s pending license application currently under review by India’s Department of Telecommunications. The Indian government has reportedly shown a preference for Musk’s proposal of administrative spectrum allocation over competitive auctioning, a move opposed by Indian telecom operators who argue that administrative allocation would undermine fair competition due to the high costs they incurred in spectrum auctions.
Addressing security concerns, Starlink has assured the Indian government that all user data would be stored locally, easing apprehensions about data privacy and national security. Discussions may have also explored potential collaboration between SpaceX and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), paving the way for joint ventures in space technology and exploration.
Musk has been actively lobbying for reduced import tariffs on Tesla’s electric vehicles, proposing to export low-cost EV models to India if tariff reductions are implemented.
This meeting followed Prime Minister Modi’s earlier engagement with US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz at Blair House, where External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Indian NSA Ajit Doval were also present.
Later in the day, PM Modi is scheduled to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House, as well as Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at Blair House.
This marks Prime Minister Modi’s first visit to the United States since President Trump began his second term. Modi arrived in Washington DC on Wednesday, where he was received by India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, and other officials. Upon arrival, Modi expressed his eagerness to strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership during this visit.
In a departure statement before embarking on the US visit, PM Modi highlighted the opportunity to build upon the collaborative successes of his previous term and to develop a robust agenda aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation in technology, trade, defense, energy, and supply chain resilience.

Title: India’s ‘early signals’ received well, Trump official says US aims for trade deal by 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:01:18 +0000
Content: The Donald Trump administration has welcomed India’s “early body signals” on trade, with a senior White House official expressing optimism for a “fair” bilateral trade deal between the two countries by the end of 2025.
Speaking to reporters ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with US President Donald Trump, the official said that while substantial work remains, the initial approach from the Indian government has been well received in Washington. The official anticipated that the discussions between the two leaders would further propel efforts towards solidifying a balanced trade agreement, emphasizing the importance of this collaboration between two dynamic and growing economies.
Highlighting the significance of the US-India partnership, the official described it as potentially the “most critical partnership of the 21st century.” Addressing India’s diplomatic role in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the official stated that the US would welcome India’s involvement in fostering peace in Europe, acknowledging India’s extensive diplomatic relationships.
The White House official also underscored the strong personal rapport between PM Modi and President Trump, noting their history of joint public engagements and the natural warmth that has defined their interactions since Trump’s first term. This camaraderie, the official said, plays a vital role in diplomatic relations.
India’s hosting of the Quad leaders’ summit later this year was also highlighted, with the official emphasizing the strength of the bilateral connection between India and the US within the quadrilateral grouping that also includes Japan and Australia.
On regional cooperation, the official outlined the Trump administration’s vision for a stronger defense partnership with India, increased defense exercises, and strategic technological collaboration. Referring to key regional initiatives like the Quad, I2U2 (extending the Abraham Accords), and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), the official highlighted their potential to foster infrastructure development and regional stability.
When questioned about India’s role in the US strategy towards China, the official affirmed India’s critical position in the Indo-Pacific framework, particularly in light of the border tensions with China. The US-India partnership, the official noted, remains a cornerstone of America’s national security and economic strategies in the region.
PM Modi arrived in Washington DC for a two-day visit at the invitation of President Trump, marking his first visit to the US since Trump’s re-election. Welcomed at the airport by India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, and other officials, PM Modi expressed his eagerness to strengthen the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership between India and the US.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote, “Landed in Washington DC a short while ago. Looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.”
Before departing for the US, PM Modi emphasized that this visit aims to build upon the successes of his previous term’s collaboration with President Trump, with a focus on advancing cooperation in technology, trade, defense, energy, and supply chain resilience for mutual benefit and global betterment.

Title: US NSA Waltz calls on PM Modi in Washington
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:16:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday met with US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz at the Blair House, a US government facility where he is staying ahead of his meeting later in the day with US President Donald Trump.
No readouts were available yet, but this was the second top official of the Trump administration that the Prime Minister had received since arriving here on Wednesday.
Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, had called on the PM Wednesday evening shortly after being administered the oath of office and confirmed by the US Senate.
The Prime Minister’s delegation included External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Ambassador to the US Vinay Kwatra, and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.
Waltz is an old India hand. In his previous role as a Republican member of the US House of Representatives, he was co-chair of the Congressional India Caucus along with Ro Khanna, a Democrat. Waltz has been a strong supporter of the relationship with India.
Gabbard, the new top spy of the US, has also backed India in the past. As a member of the US House of Representatives and as a Democrat, she was co-chair of the India Caucus. In effect, the Trump cabinet now has two former co-chairs of the India Caucus.
“They discussed various aspects of the India-USA friendship,” PMO India said in a post on X about the Gabbard-PM Modi meeting.
The Prime Minister is also expected to receive Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who has emerged as a trusted ally and adviser to President Trump. The US President has entrusted Musk with the task of making the federal government more efficient. Musk has met PM Modi several times before and also escorted the PM during his tour of the Tesla facility in San Jose in 2015.

Title: US to prioritise defence, energy sales to India: White House
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:34:47 +0000
Content: The US will seek to prioritise and boost defence and energy sales to India, senior White House officials said Thursday, previewing a meeting later in the day between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The officials also said the two leaders will build on the accomplishments of the American leader’s first term and focus their conversation on key areas such as defence, trade, energy, infrastructure, and regional partnerships when they meet later in the day.
The two leaders are expected to put back on track talks regarding a trade deal, possibly picking up from where they left off during Trump’s first term. The attempt will be to finalise a deal in 2025, senior Trump administration officials said while previewing the meeting.
This will be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders after President Trump’s return to the White House for a non-consecutive second term; his first term lasted from 2017 to 2021. They have spoken twice over the phone — once in November and again in January.
“We will aim to build on defence sales to India to ensure they are prioritising the use of American technology,” one of the officials said. “The President is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritise India as a key importer of America’s natural resources to power its economy.”
The leaders will also discuss ways to improve the trade relationship, which, one official said, “brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensures an expanded fair trade relationship.”
“There’s been some early body language from the Government of India that’s been well received by the Trump administration, but these are early and modest steps,” one of the officials said, referring to duty cuts announced recently in the annual budget proposals.
“A lot more work needs to be done. I anticipate that what will come out of today’s meeting is further momentum towards a solidified and, I emphasise, fair bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. The hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.”
The President and the Prime Minister will also discuss ways to strengthen the Quad partnership to promote stability and peace across the Indo-Pacific, the officials said.

Title: No women make list of top 100-paid athletes topped by Ronaldo
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:54:45 +0000
Content: Cristiano Ronaldo again topped the list of the world’s highest-paid athletes with total income of $260 million in 2024, according to sports industry news site Sportico, but there were no women in the top 100.
The leading 100, dominated by players from soccer, the NBA, NFL, golf and boxing, earned an estimated $6.2 billion in total income last year. The figure includes $4.8 billion in salary and prize money, plus $1.4 billion in endorsements.
Former U.S. Open tennis champion Coco Gauff was the top-earning female athlete last year at $30.4 million, well short of Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daniel Jones who squeezed in at number 100 with a total income of $37.5 million.
Ronaldo’s lucrative contract with Saudi Arabian soccer team Al-Nassr ensured he retained top spot for a second straight year after he moved to the Saudi Pro League in December 2022.
Sportico said the Portugal forward, who celebrated his 40th birthday last week, earned a hefty $215 million in wages while he also made $45 million in endorsements.
Ronaldo is so far ahead of the other athletes in the world that Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who is second on the list, earned $153.8 million in comparison — more than $100 million short of the five-times Ballon d’Or winner.
British boxer Tyson Fury, who lost to Ukraine’s Oleksandr Usyk in a heavyweight clash in December, is third on the list at $147 million.
The top five are rounded out by Inter Miami’s Argentina captain Lionel Messi ($135 million) and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James ($133.2 million) — the only 40-year-old currently playing in the NBA.
The top 100 is made up of athletes from eight sports and hailing from 27 countries.
While American Gauff, who is only 20, could climb up the list in the years to come, there have been other women athletes who would have cracked the list in the past.
Business magazine Forbes said Japan’s four-times Grand Slam tennis champion Naomi Osaka was the world’s highest-paid female athlete in 2022 after she pulled in $57.3 million in prize money and endorsements.
Retired tennis great Serena Williams, who won 23 singles majors, earned $41.8 million in 2021 according to Forbes. The American retired from the sport in 2022 at the U.S. Open.

Title: President’s Rule imposed in Manipur
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:06:20 +0000
Content: President’s Rule has been imposed in Manipur on Thursday under Article 356 of the Constitution, five days after Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned from his post following directions from central BJP leaders.
A notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Thursday stated that the President had received a report from the Governor of Manipur and, after considering the report and other information received, was satisfied that a situation had arisen in which the government of the state could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
“Now, therefore, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Article 356 of the Constitution, and of all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I hereby proclaim that I (a) assume to myself, as President of India, all functions of the Government of the State of Manipur and all powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor of that State, declare that the powers of the Legislature of the said state shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament, and make the following incidental and consequential provisions which appear to me to be necessary or desirable for giving effect to the objects of this Proclamation,” the notification reads.
Meanwhile, after the resignation of Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, hectic parleys are underway to choose an alternate leader of the ruling BJP legislature party who would lead the new government.
The BJP’s northeast in-charge, Sambit Patra, held a series of meetings with ministers, MLAs, and leaders of the BJP and its allies on Monday to gather their views before the selection of the new legislature party leader.
Manipur has been witnessing ethnic violence for the last two years between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo-Hmar communities, which has devastated the state and ultimately led to Biren Singh’s resignation.
Biren Singh’s resignation comes amid hectic political activity, with the Opposition Congress earlier announcing its intention to move a no-confidence motion against the BJP government in the Assembly session that was set to begin on Monday. However, the Governor declared the session ‘null and void’ hours after Biren Singh quit.

Title: PM Modi’s Washington visit ‘momentous’, will further solidify India-US strategic partnership: Former Foreign Secretary
Publication Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:58:59 +0000
Content: Former Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said that re-establishing the next steps in an already close strategic partnership would be a key element of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.
Shringla said that the very fact that PM Modi’s “momentous visit” to Washington takes place just a few weeks after President Trump assumed office underscores the strength of India-US friendship and strategic ties between the two nations.
“Prime Minister Modi is only the fourth global leader to meet President Trump in his second term. He’s also the first Indian Prime Minister to meet a US President so soon after his assuming office. I would say all of this reflects the importance of the relationship that both sides attach to this. So, this is an important meeting and a reflection of the two leaders and their desire to take that relationship forward, not only in bilateral terms but also in global and regional terms,” the former Foreign Secretary said.
The seasoned diplomat believes that even though there are a few issues that could be classified under the broad rubric of challenges — moving towards a fair bilateral trading relationship, deportation of illegal immigrants, and India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment — they can be deftly resolved by both leaders.
“I believe that the relationship between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump is such that they are able to talk to each other and understand the larger picture when it comes to the relationship. Of course, there are issues in the relationship. Every country, even with its closest partners, has issues, and the closer you are, the more issues you have. But I think the two leaders will find a way to subsume these issues, whether they are on trade, immigration, defence cooperation, or any other matter. You will basically find the convergences in the relationship,” he said.
Shringla, who has also served as India’s Ambassador to the US, foresees “only positive outcomes” from the visit, which once again establishes the strong connection between PM Modi and President Trump.
He lists re-establishing next steps in an already close strategic partnership, focusing on the economics of the relationship, and enhancing people-to-people ties as the three major areas that both leaders are expected to stress during their talks.
“It is time to look at how this partnership can take on a greater salience in economic terms so that we can use that element of trust to increase our bilateral trade and for India to become part of the supply chain to the US and vice versa. Fast-tracking negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement would be key,” he said.
Shringla mentioned that Trump already appreciates the contribution of the Indian American community to the American economy and would be keen to resolve issues related to legal mobility and migration, whether it is access to more H-1B visas or streamlining the issue of Green Cards.
“We have already been willing to take back illegal immigrants who have been documented as being Indian citizens. It also means that there should be a parallel process through which we can discuss legal mobility and migration. Keeping with President Trump’s own vision of manufacturing in America and attracting investments in America, you need talent and human resources. I think India is the best place for that because you have talented individuals, the law-abiding ones who quite easily adjust to new circumstances and do not create problems for both countries,” Shringla stated.
The former Foreign Secretary also advised getting tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump’s closest confidantes right now, to invest in India.
“Elon Musk has emerged as a very, very important player in Trump 2.0. He’s also quite a visionary. So from all points of view, I think India needs to interact with someone like Elon Musk. You have to look at how people like him can get more involved with India. Musk has a lot of investments in China and is quite involved with that country. We must get Musk to look at India, get him to invest in India, and manufacture in India, and we must not put obstacles in his way. In my view, we must welcome him to India and allow him to use Indian talent and facilities for manufacturing to access other markets in Asia and beyond. In that context, Prime Minister Modi’s meeting with Musk is going to be very important. I think that can get us some very positive results, both economically and politically,” he said.

Title: I welcome President Trump’s initiatives to resolve Russia-Ukraine war, hope he succeeds soon: PM Modi

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed US President Donald Trump’s efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reiterated India’s stance that the issue should be settled through negotiations.
The PM emphasized that India is not neutral in the conflict but firmly stands on the side of peace.

“I have always maintained close contact with both Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many believe that India is neutral in this conflict, but I want to make it clear that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that side is peace,” PM Modi said at a joint press conference on Thursday. He emphasized that meaningful resolutions can only emerge when both Russia and Ukraine engage in discussions at an appropriate forum.
“India believes that a solution to this war can be reached only through dialogue between both nations. I welcome and support the efforts made by President Trump and hope he succeeds as soon as possible,” he added.

Title: Trump promises Kyiv involvement in peace talks with Russia
Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:44:43 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Ukraine would be involved in peace talks with Russia, although Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.
Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.
“They’re part of it. We would have Ukraine, and we have Russia, and we’ll have other people involved, a lot of people,” Trump said.
Asked whether he trusts Putin, he said: “I believe that he would like to see something happen. I trust him on this subject.”
Trump said U.S. and Russian officials would meet in Munich on Friday and that Ukraine was also invited.
An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, however, said Kyiv does not expect to hold talks with the Russian side at the annual Munich Security Conference on Friday, and believes the U.S., Europe and Ukraine need a common position before talks with Moscow.
Trump also suggested to reporters there would be a meeting of top officials, although not leaders, from all three countries in Saudi Arabia next week aimed at ending the war.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed “the need for bold diplomacy” to end the war in a call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the State Department said.
Russia’s financial markets soared and the price of Ukraine’s debt rose at the prospect of the first talks in years to end Europe’s deadliest war since World War Two.
Trump’s unilateral overture to Putin on Wednesday, accompanied by apparent concessions on Ukraine’s principal demands, raised alarm for both Kyiv and the European allies in NATO who said they feared the White House might make a deal without them.
“We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelenskiy said.
Ukraine would “of course” participate in peace talks in some way, but there would also be a bilateral negotiation track between the United States and Russia, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.
The United Arab Emirates has told the United States it also wants to host talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.
European officials took an exceptionally firm line in public towards Trump’s peace overture to Putin, saying any agreement would be impossible to implement unless they and the Ukrainians were included in negotiating it.
“Any quick fix is a dirty deal,” European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. She also denounced the apparent concessions offered in advance.
A European diplomatic source said ministers had agreed to engage in a “frank and demanding dialogue” with U.S. officials – some of the strongest language in the diplomatic lexicon – at the Munich conference beginning on Friday.
‘BEST NEGOTIATOR ON THE PLANET’
On Wednesday, Trump made the first publicly acknowledged White House call with Putin since Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion, and then followed it up with a call to Zelenskiy. Trump said he believed both men wanted peace.
The Trump administration also said openly for the first time that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect to return to its 2014 borders or join the NATO alliance as part of any agreement, and that no U.S. troops would join any security force in Ukraine that might be set up to guarantee a ceasefire.
But on Thursday, a senior U.S. official said the United States had not ruled out potential NATO membership for Ukraine or a negotiated return to pre-2014 borders, contradicting the earlier comments.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday the world was fortunate to have Trump, the “best negotiator on the planet, bringing two sides together to find a negotiated peace”.
Kremlin spokesman Peskov said Moscow was “impressed” by Trump’s willingness to seek a settlement.
Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and its proxies captured territory in the east in 2014, before its full-scale invasion in 2022 when it captured more land in the east and south.
Ukraine pushed Russian invaders back from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, but its outmanned and outgunned forces have slowly ceded more land since a failed Ukrainian counter-offensive in 2023.
Relentless fighting has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides and pulverised Ukrainian cities.
There has been no narrowing of positions on either side. Moscow demands Kyiv be rendered permanently neutral in any peace deal; Kyiv says Russian troops must withdraw and it must win security guarantees comparable to NATO membership to prevent future attacks.
Ukrainian officials have acknowledged in the past that full NATO membership may be out of reach in the short term, and that a hypothetical peace deal could leave some occupied land in Russian hands.
But Ukraine’s Sybiha said Kyiv remained committed to joining NATO, which he said was the simplest and least expensive way the West could provide the security guarantees needed to ensure peace.
NATO’s Secretary-General Mark Rutte said it was important Moscow understand the West remained united, noting that Ukraine had never been promised a peace deal would include alliance membership.
Some Ukrainians saw Trump’s moves as a betrayal.
Myroslava Lesko, 23, standing near a sea of flags in downtown Kyiv honouring fallen troops, said: “It truly looks as if they want to surrender Ukraine, because I don’t see any benefits for our country from these negotiations or Trump’s rhetoric.”
However, Ukrainians have been worn out by three years of war, and many say they are prepared to sacrifice some aims to achieve peace.
Many were frustrated by U.S. policy under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, who vowed to help Ukraine win all its land back and provided tens of billions of dollars’ worth of military hardware, but only after delays that Ukrainian commanders say let Russian forces regroup.
Trump, at least, was being forthright about the limits of U.S. support, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics.
“The difference between Biden and Trump is that Trump says out loud what Biden was thinking and doing about Ukraine,” he said on social media.

Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:19:16 +0000
Content: The Government of India has taken several key initiatives to position the country as a premier global tourist destination during the Amrit Kaal. These efforts aim to boost tourism by enhancing infrastructure and delivering an improved travel experience for both domestic and international visitors.
The Ministry of Tourism has been actively promoting India’s diverse tourism destinations and products through a variety of promotional activities. This includes media campaigns, social media promotions, webinars, and participation in promotional events. Indian Missions abroad also contribute by attracting global travellers to various destinations in India.
One of the significant steps taken by the Ministry is the launch of the Incredible India Content Hub on the revamped Incredible India digital portal. This comprehensive digital repository features high-quality images, films, brochures, and newsletters related to tourism in India, catering to a wide range of stakeholders including tour operators, journalists, researchers, and content creators.
To develop tourism infrastructure, the Ministry provides financial assistance to State Governments, Union Territory Administrations, and Central Agencies under schemes such as ‘Swadesh Darshan,’ ‘PRASHAD,’ and ‘Assistance to Central Agencies for Tourism Infrastructure Development.’ Additionally, the Swadesh Darshan Scheme has been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 to promote sustainable and responsible tourism following a destination-centric approach.
The Government has also sanctioned 40 projects worth Rs.3,295.76 crore under the ‘Scheme for Special Assistance to States/Union Territories for Capital Investment (SASCI).’ Further, financial aid is being provided to states and UTs for organizing fairs, festivals, and tourism-related events.
As part of capacity building, the Ministry is conducting programs under the ‘Capacity Building for Service Providers’ (CBSP) Scheme to train and upgrade manpower, ensuring better service standards at tourist sites. The Incredible India Tourist Facilitator (IITF) Certification Programme was launched to create a pool of local, trained professionals to enhance the overall experience for tourists.
Collaborating with other ministries, the Ministry of Tourism is working with the Ministry of Railways to develop tourist amenities at 22 railway stations and with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways/National Highway Authority of India to improve road connectivity to tourist destinations. The Ministry also coordinates with the Ministry of Civil Aviation to enhance air connectivity to important tourist destinations and emerging travel spots.

Title: Kennedy clinches top US health job despite anti-vaccine views
Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:16:24 +0000
Content: Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named U.S. Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
As Kennedy was sworn into the post, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around “radical transparency” and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
“For 20 years, I’ve gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump,” Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
The U.S. Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programs in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
He will now run an HHS department that directs more than $3 trillion in healthcare spending. Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programs that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the U.S. drugs regulator and industry. Opponents argued that he is unfit for the job because of his prominent role in the anti-vaccine movement.
Kennedy’s path to confirmation was fraught and did not always appear to have the necessary votes among Republicans. He had to overcome his past as a life-long Democrat, his previous views in support of abortion, as well as his stance on vaccines. Some prominent members of his own family, including cousin Caroline Kennedy, also urged his rejection.
Ultimately, Senate Republicans closed ranks as they have for every Trump cabinet selection so far.
After the vote, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said putting Kennedy in charge of the nation’s public health was a “huge mistake.”
“When dangerous diseases resurface and people can’t access lifesaving vaccines, all Americans will suffer,” Warren said.
The Trump White House has said it plans to drastically shrink the size of the federal government. Kennedy has said he wants to get rid of many employees at both the FDA and NIH.
Stephen Ubl, CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America – the top industry lobby group – said drugmakers are eager to work with the Trump administration.
KENNEDY COMMITMENTS
Democrats accused Kennedy over two days of contentious confirmation hearings of being financially vested in the anti-vaccine movement and peddling conspiracy theories to sow doubt about lifesaving medicines, assertions he rejected.
Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor with decades of work in community-based health, was seen as a potential swing vote against Kennedy after expressing wariness about the nominee’s vaccine views.
After facing an intense political pressure campaign – including billionaire Elon Musk’s threats to support primary opponents of any Republican who obstructed Trump’s nominees – Cassidy, who is up for reelection next year, said he had gotten the necessary reassurances to vote in line with his party.
Cassidy said he received commitments from Kennedy that he would not remove government health agency statements that vaccines do not cause autism. Kennedy has long espoused a debunked link between vaccines and autism despite scientific evidence to the contrary.
Kennedy also committed to work within the existing vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and to honor decisions by the CDC’s outside panel of experts, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, without changes.
Kennedy has also called for banning hundreds of food additives and chemicals and for getting ultra-processed foods out of school lunches.
His political future seemed uncertain last summer as his independent presidential campaign faltered. In August, he ended the campaign and endorsed Trump in exchange for a role in Trump’s administration.
The deal brought Trump extra support in the presidential election.
After the endorsement, Kennedy supporters flocked to back the Republican, trusting that Kennedy would be given a second political chance if Trump returned to the White House.

Title: ‘He’s a great leader….He is a special man’: What President Trump said about PM Modi during US visit
Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:12:21 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “great leader,” lauding his impactful leadership in India and global stature. He also acknowledged PM Modi’s sharp negotiation skills, admitting that he was a tougher and more effective negotiator than himself.
Welcoming Prime Minister Modi with a warm hug at the White House, President Trump said, “We missed you a lot.” In his book, ‘Our Journey Together’, Trump penned a message for PM Modi, calling him “great” and praising his leadership. He lauded the prime minister’s governance, saying that he was doing a fantastic job in India and that people around the world were talking about him.
Calling him a special man, Trump expressed his excitement about welcoming his friend PM Modi to the White House, emphasizing their long-standing friendship.
As PM Modi arrived at the White House on Thursday, Trump reiterated that the two leaders and their nations shared “great unity and great friendship,” stressing the importance of staying united. During their discussions, Trump highlighted that ties between the two countries would continue to grow stronger.
PM Modi expressed his delight at seeing Trump back at the White House for a second term and conveyed confidence that India and the US would continue advancing their strategic partnership with the same bond, trust, and enthusiasm. He also mentioned that the people of India had given him the opportunity to serve a third consecutive term, a feat that had not happened in 60 years.

Title: US targets diversity, equity, inclusion at United Nations
Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:11:01 +0000
Content: The United States has warned U.N. organizations UNICEF and UN Women against any focus on diversity, equity, inclusion and gender ideology as a U.N. food official sought to avoid Washington’s ire by advising some staff to tone down language.
Since returning to power on January 20, U.S. President Donald Trump as focused on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices and any promotion of “gender ideology” in the federal government, and has encouraged the private sector to follow suit.
Now Washington has the United Nations in its sights, leaving the world body’s agencies nervous that they could lose billions of dollars in voluntary U.S. funding as Trump and billionaire Elon Musk seek ways to slash government spending.
“America provides way too much funding to the U.N. and associated entities,” Musk posted on X on Monday.
In the past three weeks Trump has stopped U.S. engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.
Washington is the U.N.’s largest contributor – followed by China – accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8 billion. These payments are not voluntary.
Over the past week at executive board meetings of the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF and UN Women, which works for gender equality and the empowerment of women, the U.S. laid out its opposition to either body promoting DEI and “gender ideology,” a loose term referencing non-traditional views on sex and gender.
The U.S. forced the first vote in the history of the 36-member executive board of UNICEF, which was created in 1946, over the adoption of routine documents. The U.S. had unsuccessfully tried to amend them to call on UNICEF to scrap DEI or “gender ideology” programming, “so as to promote equal opportunities for all” and “promote and underscore biological reality.”
After that vote last Friday, Eritrea’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Amanuel Giorgio – speaking on behalf of the eight African board members – stressed the importance of DEI in UNICEF programs to “ensure that no child is left behind.”
U.S. diplomat Jonathan Shrier told the board that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs “violate the text and spirit of our laws by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy.”
“In addition, it is U.S. policy to recognize two sexes, male and female, and not to promote gender ideology,” said Shrier. “It is particularly disturbing that this language is being used in UNICEF programming documents; children should be protected from this dangerous ideology and its possible results.”
When asked to respond, UNICEF told Reuters it appreciates the work of the board and takes seriously comments by members, adding: “As highlighted by many members of the board, UNICEF has a mandate to safeguard the rights of all children everywhere.”
UNICEF is headed by Executive Director Catherine Russell, a former senior aide to Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, who has about two years left on her term. According to the latest data available, the United States was UNICEF’s largest donor in 2023, providing more than $1.4 billion.
AVOIDING “SPECIFIC NOMENCLATURE”
Ahead of the executive board meeting of the U.N. World Food Programme next week, WFP’s Gender Protection and Inclusion service sent a note to some colleagues – seen by Reuters – offering advice on how to speak about the diversity of their work “in light of recent communications coming from the White House.”
“Specifically, we recommend proceeding with descriptive language rather than specific nomenclature,” read the note.
“Please avoid controversial language including LGBTQI+ and SOGIESC terminology … let’s avoid combining diversity, equity, inclusion and/or accessibility in one statement or sentence,” it said. SOGIESC is an acronym for sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics.
The WFP – run by American Cindy McCain – did not respond to a request for comment on the note. In 2024, the United States was WFP’s biggest donor, providing more than $4.4 billion.
The U.S. also this week pushed UN Women to avoid a focus on “radical causes such as DEI and gender ideology, neither of which will improve the functioning of UN Women and both of which are demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls.”
UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous thanked the U.S. for its comment at the meeting on Monday, adding: “UN Women always embraces any review of our work.” In 2023 the U.S. gave nearly $19 million to the organization.
When asked for comment on the U.S. opposition to DEI and “gender ideology,” U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the nearly 80-year-old world body strives to uphold the values of the founding U.N. Charter.
He noted that the Charter “strives ‘to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small’.”

Title: Olympic champion Khelif fights back as IBA files lawsuit in gender row
Publication Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:04:38 +0000
Content: Imane Khelif, who won Paris Olympics boxing gold amid a gender-eligibility row, has accused the International Boxing Association of making “false and offensive” accusations after it launched legal action against the IOC for allowing her to compete.
The IBA announced in a statement on Monday it was filing a complaint with Swiss Attorney General Stefan Blatter against the International Olympic Committee, citing safety concerns over gender eligibility. Similar complaints are to be filed in France and the U.S.
The IBA’s complaint specifically mentioned Algeria’s Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting.
The boxing body cited U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender women from female sports as validation of its stance. Trump had called Khelif “a male boxer” in his speech after signing the order last week.
Khelif, who has always competed as a woman, was banned by the IBA from the 2023 world championships after a sex chromosome test that the IBA said rendered her ineligible.
However, after the IBA lost its Olympic recognition over governance issues, the IOC took control of boxing and cleared Khelif to compete in Paris, stating she was born a woman and had a long history in female competitions.
“The IBA, an organization that I am no longer associated with and which is no longer recognised by the IOC, have again made baseless accusations that are false and offensive, using them to further their agenda,” Khelif said in a statement.
“This is a matter that concerns not just me but the broader principles of fairness and due process in sport.”
The IBA said in its statement that the IOC’s decision to permit both boxers to participate in the Olympic qualifiers and win gold in Paris had denied opportunities to “deserving female athletes”.
Khelif said her team were reviewing the situation and would take legal action to protect her rights.
“For two years, I have taken the high road while my name and image have been used, unauthorized, to further personal and political agendas through the spreading and dissemination of baseless lies and misinformation,” she added.
“But silence is no longer an option.”
The IOC has said the IBA statement was just another example of the IBA’s campaign against the IOC.
Switzerland’s Attorney General’s office confirmed receiving the IBA’s complaint and in a statement on Wednesday the boxing body said it welcomed Khelif’s intention to file a lawsuit as it would give it the opportunity to prove in court that she was not allowed to compete in female boxing events.
With boxing’s Olympic future uncertain, the IOC has not included the sport in the Los Angeles 2028 program and has urged national federations to establish a new global boxing body or risk Olympic exclusion.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the session on social media, stating that experts shared “nutrition tips to boost memory, stay energized, and improve concentration during exams.”

Health and nutrition influencer Revant Himatsingka, also known as FoodFarmer, underscored the importance of being mindful of food choices and their impact on health.
Sabherwal advised consuming high-fiber foods to promote good gut bacteria and incorporating nuts into the diet. Experts also stressed the importance of proper hydration and sufficient sleep as essential stress relievers.
Diwekar encouraged maintaining physical activity even during exams, as it helps manage stress and improves posture.
She recommended opting for foods with natural sugars, such as sweet potatoes, beetroot, and carrots, to support overall well-being.
