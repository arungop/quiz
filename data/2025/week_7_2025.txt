Title: New Zealand concerns mount as Cook Islands PM plans to sign agreement with China
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 06:41:59 +0000
Content: Concerns are mounting in New Zealand as the Cook Islands’ Prime Minister travels to China this week to sign agreements without properly consulting with New Zealand, despite the two nations’ constitutional ties.
New Zealand has become increasingly concerned about China’s growing presence in the Pacific region and the threats it poses to the country’s national security.
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday at a press conference New Zealand expected transparency and consultation with Cook Islands after its prime minister, Mark Brown, flagged he was heading to China seeking a partnership in national development including infrastructure, trade and the economy.
The Cook Islands is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand which provides budget support and commits to defend the South Pacific nation whose people are New Zealand citizens.
“Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, in matters of defence and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,” Luxon said.
He added that once New Zealand knew what was in the agreement, the government would decide how to respond.
New Zealand had made repeated requests to the Cook Islands to share or consult on the contents of agreements that Brown plans to sign with China but had not received a proper response, raising significant concern, deputy prime minister Winston Peter’s office said in a statement on Sunday.
“To those who suggest that our engagement with China is somehow secretive, I reject that completely,” Brown said in a video statement on Cook Islands Television News Facebook page on Friday.
“We have always conducted our international affairs with integrity and transparency. Every agreement we enter into will be in the best interest of the Cook Islands,” he said. He did not provide specifics of the agreement.
Cook Islanders have also questioned secrecy around the agreement. Tina Browne, leader of the opposition Democratic party told New Zealand based radio station 531pn that people were concerned about the lack of consultation firstly about the Cook Islands’ passportand not the agreement with China.
“If there is nothing to hide, why are we not consulting with New Zealand?” Browne said.
The Cook Islands lie halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are made up of 15 islands and atolls spread over 700 square miles (1.9 million square kilometres)
The country in 2021 had a population of 15,040.
ONGOING NEW ZEALAND RELATIONSHIP
The Cook Islands was within the New Zealand borders from 1901. In 1965, it became self governing but in free association with New Zealand. It is a realm country of New Zealand, along with Niue and Tokelau.
It has its own government and King Charles III is head of state.
Cook Islanders have New Zealand citizenship and passports. They have the same rights as a New Zealander such as the ability to work, go to school and use the medical system.
There is no Cook Islands passport or citizenship. Cook Island’s Prime Minister Mark Brown had mooted a Cook Islands passport and citizenship but backed down after New Zealand said Cook Islanders could not hold both and any change would need to be decided by referendum.
Around 94,000 Cook Islands Maori live in New Zealand and over 7,000 live in Australia.
Under the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration, the Cook Island’s is able to interact with the international community as an independent state. Any action taken in New Zealand for the foreign affairs of the Cook Islands will be at their request.
However, both New Zealand and the Cook Islands undertook in the declaration to consult regularly on foreign affairs matters, cooperate in pursuit of common foreign relation objectives and advise each other when a proposed foreign policy initiative may affect the rights, obligations and interests of the other.
It also outlines that New Zealand will continue to assist with the defence of the Cook Islands if requested and that the two countries will consult regularly on defence and security agreements.
It does not qualify for United Nations membership. In 2023, the United States recognised the Cook Islands as a sovereign and independent state.

Title: Tirupati laddu row: SIT arrests four in adulteration case
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:36:14 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested four individuals over the alleged adulteration of the sacred Tirumala temple laddu.
The arrested individuals are associated with organizations that supplied ghee, including AR Dairy (Tamil Nadu), Parag Dairy (Uttar Pradesh), Premier Agri Foods, and Alpha Milk Foods. Those arrested are Bipin Jain and Pomil Jain, former directors of Bhole Baba Dairy (Roorkee, Uttarakhand); Vaishnavi Dairy (Poonambakkam) CEO Apoorva Vinay Kant Chawda; and AR Dairy (Dundigal) MD Raju Rajasekharan.
The accused were interrogated for three days in Tirupati but were found to be uncooperative despite primary evidence of their involvement.
The SIT conducted inspections at Tirumala, Tirupati, and AR Dairy’s facility in Tamil Nadu. Investigations revealed that AR Dairy, which had a contract with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), was guilty of multiple irregularities.
According to an official release, representatives of Vaishnavi Dairy secured tenders under the name of AR Dairy for ghee supply. They allegedly fabricated false documents and seals, misusing the AR Dairy name to manipulate the tender process.
Vaishnavi Dairy also created fake records claiming to have sourced ghee from Bhole Baba Dairy in Roorkee. However, authorities found that Bhole Baba Dairy lacked the capacity to supply such large quantities of ghee.
The SIT comprises Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Hyderabad Division Joint Director Viresh Prabhu, Visakha CBI SP Muraliramba, DIG Gopinath Jetty, IG Sarvashrestha Tripathi, and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) officer Satyakumar Panda.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had alleged on September 18 that the ghee used for making Tirupati laddus during the YSR Congress Party’s rule was adulterated with animal fat, triggering outrage among devotees of the famous temple.
The state government initially constituted a SIT to probe the allegations. However, the Supreme Court later replaced it with a SIT comprising both central and state officials.
TTD uses 15,000 kg of cow ghee daily for preparing Tirumala laddus.
According to officials, AR Foods from Tamil Nadu had secured a tender to supply ghee at ₹320 per kg. On July 8, 2024, eight tankers of ghee arrived, and four of them were sent to laboratories for testing.
On July 17, NDDB Lab reports confirmed the presence of adulterants in the ghee.

Title: Paris AI summit draws world leaders and CEOs eager for technology wave
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:31:58 +0000
Content: World leaders and technology executives are convening in Paris on Monday to discuss how to safely embrace artificial intelligence at a time of mounting resistance to heavy-handed red tape that businesses say stifles innovation.
Eagerness to rein in AI has waned since previous AI summits in Britain and South Korea that focused world powers’ attention on technology’s risks after ChatGPT’s viral launch in 2022.
As U.S. President Donald Trump tears up his predecessor’s AI guardrails to promote U.S. competitiveness, pressure has built on EU policymakers to pursue a lighter-touch approach to AI to help keep European firms in the tech race.
Some EU leaders, including summit host French President Emmanuel Macron, and tech companies are hoping flexibility will be applied to the bloc’s new AI Act to help homegrown startups.
“There’s a risk some decide to have no rules and that’s dangerous. But there’s also the opposite risk, if Europe gives itself too many rules,” Macron told regional French newspapers in an interview published on Friday.
“We should not be afraid of innovation,” he said.
Trump’s early moves on AI underscored how far the strategies to regulate AI in the United States, China and EU have diverged.
European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Tech giants and some capitals are pushing for it to be enforced leniently. Brussels is finalising an accompanying code of practice.
Moreover, Trump’s brakes-off approach has emboldened the regulation-cautious U.S. Big Tech groups from which Europe needs to seek investment, said British think-tank Chatham House.
Meanwhile, China’s DeepSeek challenged U.S. and British AI leadership last month by freely distributing a human-like reasoning system, galvanizing geopolitical and industry rivals to race faster still.
“An unpredictable global scramble to develop AI is underway, as the U.S. turns inward and China boasts new capabilities,” Chatham House said.
Trump is not sending the U.S. AI Safety Institute to Paris, in a troubling sign to those hoping for global risk-based rules governing AI.
COMPETITIVENESS
Top political leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and China’s Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the summit. Others on the attendance list are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
Macron is due to meet with Guoqing on Monday and Vance on Tuesday, the Elysee said. The plenary session is on February 11.
Top executives such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are slated to give talks as well. Executives will partake in an invitation-only dinner with political leaders on Monday.
Google Senior Vice President James Manyika said at a press reception on Sunday that the opportunities from AI were now in “much greater focus.”
Delegations are also expected to discuss how to manage AI’s massive energy needs as the planet gets hotter, as well as AI for the developing world. A non-binding communiqué has been in progress.
Macron is eager to promote France’s national industry, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: free, “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.
Ahead of the summit, France struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates for a major AI data center representing investments of up to $50 billion.
Launching a new app with generative AI software, the CEO of Nvidia-backed French startup Mistral told Reuters: “The French and the whole world are realising that European players count and that they provide cutting-edge technology.”

Title: Operation Devil Hunt sees 1,300 arrests in nationwide crackdown on violence in Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:14:48 +0000
Content: More than 1,300 people have been arrested by security forces in Bangladesh as part of a sweeping crackdown that began on Saturday.
The nationwide operation, dubbed “Operation Devil Hunt,” was launched by the interim government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, following a wave of violent attacks on properties linked to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s family and key members of her Awami League party.
The Muhammad Yunus-led interim government ordered ‘Operation Devil Hunt’ on Saturday after the attack on students and civilians in the Gazipur district on Friday night.
Violence broke out after students and civilians were attacked in the Gazipur district on Friday night. The unrest rapidly spread across the country, with mobs targeting symbols of the Awami League, further escalating tensions between political factions.
The joint forces involved in the operation include army personnel, police, and specialised units. To date, the authorities have arrested 1,300 people in connection with the unrest and violence that has gripped the nation over the past four days.
The interim government has vowed to root out “all Devils” that are attempting to destabilise the country, emphasising its resolve to restore order as it completes its six-month tenure in power.
One of the most alarming incidents during the violence occurred when protesters set fire to the historic residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, located in the capital Dhaka. This house holds immense national significance, as it was from here that Rahman declared Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.
In response to the growing unrest, a command centre has been established to monitor and oversee the execution of ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’ The Chief Adviser’s office confirmed that the operation is in full swing, with additional efforts to ensure law and order are maintained.
Meanwhile, the Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has called on the interim government to address the growing “mob culture” and restore peace.
The BNP has warned that failing to do so could allow “fascist” forces to rise again, leading to further instability. The party has announced plans for nationwide rallies starting February 11, demanding stronger measures to address the deteriorating law and order situation, as well as a clear electoral road map.

Title: Stock market trades lower as Trump threatens new tariff on all steel, aluminium imports
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:36:29 +0000

Title: Parliament Budget Session to resume today
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:27:15 +0000
Content: The Budget Session of Parliament will reconvene on Monday, with both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha set to meet. The session will continue discussions on the Union Budget for 2025, along with other significant matters.
One of the key highlights of the session will be the introduction of the new Income Tax Bill, which received approval from the Union Cabinet on Friday.
The Bill aims to simplify India’s direct tax laws without imposing any new tax burdens. Instead, it seeks to streamline existing provisions, removing lengthy clauses and complex language to make the legislation more accessible. The Income Tax Bill is expected to be introduced in the Lok Sabha today.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget for 2025-26 on February 1, announced the government’s intent to introduce a new Direct Tax Code. This was part of a broader commitment to review the Income Tax Act of 1961, which was first outlined in the July 2024 Union Budget.
With budget debates now in full swing, critical issues such as the new tax laws and India’s international relations are expected to dominate the discussions in the upcoming sessions, promising a lively and action-packed day in Parliament.
Earlier last week, the fifth day of the session witnessed intense debates in the Rajya Sabha, where External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar addressed concerns over the deportation of illegal Indian migrants from the United States.
Jaishankar issued a detailed statement on the matter, saying, “We are in talks with the US government to ensure that the deported individuals are not mistreated during their flight. However, it is crucial for the House to understand that our primary focus is on cracking down on the illegal migration industry while simultaneously facilitating visas for legitimate travellers.”
The minister clarified that deportation is not a new procedure and stressed the importance of addressing both legal and illegal migration issues effectively.
Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha experienced repeated adjournments due to disruptions caused by the Opposition, which focused on the deportation issue. Despite these disturbances, proceedings continued with discussions on the Union Budget and deliberations on key legislative proposals expected to be introduced during the session.
As the session progresses, lawmakers are set to tackle several national issues, with tax reform and international relations continuing to take center stage.

Title: Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation
Publication Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:00:38 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
“And very simply, it’s, if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
The largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
By a large margin, hydropower-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the U.S., accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
“Canadian steel and aluminum support key industries in the U.S. from defence, shipbuilding and auto,” Canadian Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne posted on X.
“We will continue to stand up for Canada, our workers, and our industries.”
Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japan’s Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
“Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management,” Trump said of U.S. Steel.
Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump.
QUOTA QUESTIONS
Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy.
Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump’s announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
“Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to (the U.S.), that is, 60% of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China?” Francois Legault, premier of Quebec, said on X.
“All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty.”
Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80% in 2019 after Trump’s initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China’s global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals.
MATCHING RATES
Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure “that we’re treated evenly with other countries.”
The new U.S. president has long complained about the EU’s 10% tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5%. He frequently states that Europe “won’t take our cars” but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year.
The U.S., however, enjoys a 25% tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis’ U.S. operations.
The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2%, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12% for India, 6.7% for Brazil, 5.1% for Vietnam and 2.7% for European Union countries.
BORDER STEPS
In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canada’s and Mexico’s actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline.
Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless America’s two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps.
Asked whether Mexico’s and Canada’s actions were good enough, Trump replied: “No, it’s not good enough,” Trump said. “Something has to happen, it’s not sustainable, and I’m changing it.”
Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1.
