Title: India’s 8-month fiscal deficit at 52.5 pc of full year target for 2024-25
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:15:28 +0000
Content: India’s fiscal deficit for the first 8 months from April to November of the current financial year is estimated at Rs 8.47 lakh crore which works out to 52.5 per cent of the estimate for the financial year, according to official data released on Tuesday.
This reflects a strong macroeconomic financial position as the fiscal deficit is well under control with the government sticking to the consolidation path.
Net tax receipts for the first eight months of the current financial year were at Rs 14.43 lakh crore, or 56 per cent of the annual target, up from Rs 14.36 lakh crore for the same period last year, the data showed.
Total government expenditure for the eight months was Rs 27.41lakh crore which constitutes 57 per cent of the annual target fixed in the Union Budget. The government spent Rs 26.52 lakh crore in the same period last year.
The government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the current financial year from 5.6 per cent in 2023-24. The government aims to contain the fiscal deficit at Rs 16.13 lakh crore during the current fiscal.
India’s net direct tax collections, comprising corporate tax and personal income tax, shot up by a robust 15.4 per cent to Rs 12.1 lakh crore, from April 1 to November 10 during the current financial year, according to the latest figures released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
Similarly, there has been a robust growth in GST collections on the back of rising economic activity.
The buoyancy in tax collections places more funds in the government’s coffers to undertake investments in large infrastructure projects to spur economic growth and take up welfare schemes for the poor. It also helps to keep the fiscal deficit in check and strengthens the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy.
A lower fiscal deficit means the government has to borrow less which leaves more money in the banking system for big companies to borrow and invest. This, in turn, leads to a higher economic growth rate and the creation of more jobs. Besides, a low fiscal deficit keeps the inflation rate in check which strengthens the fundamentals of the economy and ensures growth with stability.

Title: NPCI removes UPI user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:01:00 +0000
Content: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on Tuesday removed the unified payments interface (UPI) user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay with immediate effect.
With this, WhatsApp Pay can now extend UPI services to its entire user base in India, the NPCI said in a statement.
Previously, the NPCI had permitted WhatsApp Pay to expand its UPI user base in a phased manner, lifting the previous cap of 100 million users.
With this notification, the NPCI is removing the limit restrictions on user onboarding on WhatsApp Pay.
“WhatsApp Pay shall continue to comply with all existing UPI guidelines and circulars applicable to existing third-party app providers (TPAPs),” said the corporation.
According to third-party data, the Meta-owned platform has over 500 million users in India. The NPCI move heralds a significant shift in regulatory policy, which had previously limited WhatsApp Payment’s rollout.
Additionally, the NPCI has deferred a proposed rule to cap any single app’s UPI transaction share at 30 per cent until December 31, 2026
UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly, with Google Pay and PhonePe controlling more than 85 per cent of the market.
The UPI achieved 15,547 crore transactions worth Rs 223 lakh crore from January to November this year, ‘showcasing its transformative impact on financial transactions’ in India.
Since its launch in 2016, UPI has transformed financial access in India, enabling 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants to perform seamless digital transactions, according to a study by IIM and ISB professors.
The NPCI said it is focused on bringing innovations in the retail payment systems through the use of technology and is relentlessly working to transform India into a digital economy. It is facilitating secure payment solutions with nationwide accessibility at minimal cost in furtherance of India’s aspiration to be a fully digital society.

Title: Iran rejects involvement in escalating Red Sea tension
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:15:05 +0000
Content: Iran’s envoy to the United Nations (UN) has rejected the accusations by the United States and Britain about Tehran’s role in escalating tensions in the Red Sea, Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s permanent representative to the UN, made the remarks on Monday in letters to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, UN Security Council (UNSC) president for the month of December, while reacting to what he called “baseless and politically-motivated” anti-Tehran claims made by the US and British representatives at a UNSC briefing earlier in the day.
During the briefing, US Deputy Representative to the UN Dorothy Shea accused Iran of “fully funding” Yemen’s Houthis and providing them with “lethal weapons” for attacks on Israel.
In similar remarks, Barbara Woodward, British permanent representative to the UN, also accused Iran of assisting the Yemeni armed forces in their ongoing operations against Israel.
Iravani denounced these accusations as “unfounded” claims intended to escalate tensions and create an excuse to cause further instability in West Asia.
He also slammed Israel as being behind these “baseless” accusations, in a “clear bid” to throw dirt on Iran and to cover its own “illegal actions and destructive activities.”
The Iranian envoy emphasised that it is Israel, not Iran, that has always pursued a policy of “provocation” and has long been a “serious threat” to peace and security in the region and beyond, Xinhua news agency reported.
He said Iran has always been committed to international law, the UN Charter, and UNSC resolutions.
The Houthi group has been launching regular rocket and drone attacks against Israel and disrupting “Israeli-linked” shipping in the Red Sea since November 2023 to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid their conflict with Israelis. In response, Israel and the US-British naval coalition in the region have been conducting intermittent strikes on Houthi targets to deter the group.

Title: Yearender: India’s bittersweet voyage at Paris Olympics
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:21:34 +0000
Content: The Paris Olympics turned out to be a bittersweet journey for the Indian contingent, as they failed to clinch a single gold medal at the recently concluded Summer Games. However, it was a standout year for Manu Bhaker, who rose to fame with her remarkable double Olympic medal haul.  
Team India concluded their Paris Olympics campaign with six medals, including one silver and five bronze. Despite sending 117 athletes to compete across various events, the nation could not secure a gold. India ranked 71st on the Paris Olympics medals tally, while the United States dominated with 126 medals.  
One of the major highlights of the Games was the emergence of shooter Manu Bhaker. The 22-year-old became the first Indian athlete in the post-independence era to win two medals in a single edition of the Olympics, a feat previously achieved by Norman Pritchard at the Paris 1900 Games. Bhaker opened India’s medal tally by securing bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event, becoming the first Indian woman shooter to win an Olympic medal. She, along with Sarabjot Singh, later won another bronze in the mixed team 10m air pistol event, marking India’s first-ever shooting team medal.  
Bhaker narrowly missed a historic grand treble, finishing fourth in the women’s 25m pistol shooting event. She came close to becoming the first Indian to win three medals at the Olympics.  
Swapnil Kusale added to the tally with a bronze in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions Men’s Final, becoming the first Indian shooter to win a medal in this event.  
Neeraj Chopra, India’s “golden boy,” secured silver in the men’s javelin throw with a best throw of 89.45 meters, falling short of retaining his Tokyo gold. Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem claimed gold with a record-breaking 92.97-meter throw, while Grenada’s Anderson Peters earned bronze.  
The Indian men’s hockey team also scripted history by winning back-to-back bronze medals at the Olympics for the first time in 52 years, defeating Spain 2-1.  
Young wrestler Aman Sehrawat brought home India’s first wrestling medal at Paris 2024, securing bronze in the 57 kg freestyle event in his Olympic debut. He became the seventh Indian wrestler to medal at the Olympics.  
Despite these milestones, the Games were marred by near misses. Six athletes, including Lakshya Sen, Mirabai Chanu, and Bhaker, finished fourth in their events, narrowly missing out on medals. The mixed team archery duo of Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat made history by reaching an Olympic medal match but fell short in the bronze medal contest.  
Other setbacks included Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’s semifinal exit in men’s badminton doubles and PV Sindhu’s inability to secure a third consecutive Olympic medal. Veteran archer Deepika Kumari, boxers Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain, and wrestler Vinesh Phogat also fell short of expectations.  
India participated in 69 medal events across 16 sports at Paris 2024, including archery, athletics, badminton, and shooting. To date, India has won 41 Olympic medals, with its best-ever performance coming at Tokyo 2020, where the nation bagged seven medals, including a gold.

Title: Syria’s Spiral: The Rise, Reign, and Ruin of Bashar al-Assad Amid the Arab Spring’s Echoes
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:11:52 +0000
Content: Syria, a country in Southwest Asia on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, was deeply affected by the Arab Spring protests that swept through many nations in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. These were anti-regime, pro-democracy demonstrations aimed at toppling dictatorial governments.
Backed by Iran and Russia, the regime led by Bashar al-Assad survived the revolutionary wave carried out by rebel forces and eventually reclaimed many of the territories they once held. Though not directly related, the survival of his regime was also assisted by the U.S.-led coalition’s action against ISIS, which had once occupied vast territories along the Syria–Iraq border.
A History of Autocracy with the Baath Party
The Baath Party was formed in Damascus, Syria, in 1943. It soon established branches in other Middle Eastern countries. Although it adopted a liberal-sounding appeal, including opposition to colonialism and imperialism and a policy of non-alignment, the party quickly became highly centralised. The single-party, single-leader rules in Syria and Iraq only confirm this fact.
Syria gained independence in 1946 from a joint French and British occupation, but the subsequent political phase was unstable. In 1963, the Baath Party rose to power through a military coup. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, resulting in Israel’s capture of the Golan Heights and the destruction of Syria’s air power. In 1970, then-Defence Minister Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar al-Assad, led an internal coup within the Baath Party, toppling the then-president and ushering in five decades of centralised rule. After Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, Bashar al-Assad succeeded him as president.
Both Bashar al-Assad and his father ruled Syria with an iron fist. In 1973, widespread riots erupted against Hafez al-Assad’s decree amending the Syrian constitution to allow even a non-Muslim to become the country’s president. The army brutally suppressed the protests. In the 1980s, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria sparked uprisings in Aleppo, Homs, and Hama, all of which were violently crushed, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. After taking power in 2000, Bashar al-Assad once again dashed hopes of political reforms in the country, continuing the one-party Baathist rule while arresting activists, citizens, and opposition leaders who demanded change.
The Arab Spring and the Eruption of the Civil War
Pro-democracy protests began in Daraa and quickly spread nationwide. As before, the Syrian regime responded with violence. Initially, the protests were largely peaceful, but the regime took brutal action against them, adopting measures such as killings, disappearances, and arrests. Police, military, and paramilitary forces were deployed to quell dissent.
This time, however, the response to Assad’s crackdown was different. Armed militias emerged, including the Free Syrian Army, formed by defectors from the Assad-led Syrian military. By 2012, peaceful demonstrations had escalated into a full-fledged civil war. Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and U.S.-backed Kurdish rebel groups later became another major challenger for Bashar al-Assad.
Sectarian violence also played a significant role. With a population of about 24 million, Syria is predominantly Muslim, with Sunnis forming the majority, but it was ruled by the minority Alawite sect for more than five decades. The Assad family was Alawite, as were most of the leading figures in the Syrian security forces and bureaucracy.
The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam. Sunni Muslims generally consider Alawite beliefs to deviate from mainstream Islamic traditions. According to the CIA World Factbook, 87 per cent of Syrians are Muslims, with 74 per cent being Sunni. Shia sects like Alawites and Ismailis form about 13 per cent. Christians account for about 10 per cent, and Druze about 3 per cent.
The post–Arab Spring period saw involvement from Sunni-dominated terror groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, exacerbating sectarian strife. The use of chemical weapons by Assad’s forces further fuelled the conflict.
The Rise and Fall of ISIS
In April 2013, the terror group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS or the Islamic State), led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, emerged as a new, significant threat to the Assad regime and the world community. The terror group had a single goal of establishing an Islamic empire across boundaries and continents. It captured Raqqa in eastern Syria as its base and expanded into Iraq, quickly overtaking vast territories. Its ambitions to establish a caliphate across the world by violent means alarmed the international community.
By September 2014, a U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition with Kurdish forces launched air strikes on ISIL-held territories. The coalition’s efforts, along with interventions by Turkey and the Assad regime (backed by Iran and Russia), led to ISIS’s collapse by 2016. This was a major relief for Assad, as his primary challenger on Syrian territory was effectively neutralised. In 2017, Raqqa was liberated by the U.S.-aligned Kurdish force.
Bashar al-Assad – Backed by Iran and Russia
A 2018 Times of Israel report noted that Iran maintained about ten military bases in Syria. Iran-backed Hezbollah, a political party with a powerful militia based in southern Lebanon, joined the Syrian civil war in May 2013 to support Assad. Russia also actively supported Assad’s regime with air strikes targeting rebel camps.
Joint operations helped the regime retake Palmyra from ISIL and Aleppo from other rebels in 2016. By November 2017, Assad’s forces retook control of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria and Eastern Ghouta from various rebel groups. In 2018, the regime targeted southwestern regions to reclaim control from rebels, successfully recapturing Daraa and Quneitra. The rebels surrendered and retreated to Idlib, Syria’s only remaining rebel-held territory.
In May 2023, the Arab League, which had once expelled Syria, reinstated it, acknowledging the regime’s hold over the country. The League recognised Assad’s rule over the country’s vast territory, with no significant threats seen in the last three years.
Since 2018, the rebel forces had not been very active, until this year.
2024: The Turning Point
The Bashar al-Assad regime seemed to be in control of Syria even a month ago, before its collapse in just under two weeks.
Two external events and a host of internal factors led to this fall.
The story of the downfall began in 2022 and accelerated through 2023, severely compounding Assad’s problems. In February 2022, Russia began a full-scale war with Ukraine that is still ongoing. In October 2023, Hamas, another Iran-supported terror group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel retaliated by attacking Gaza.
That was the beginning of the West Asia crisis, with Israel and Iran being the key players.
Hezbollah, an old rival of Israel, also launched strikes on northern Israel, prompting Israeli counter-attacks. The group withdrew its fighters from Syria last year to fight against Israel. The Israeli military operations against Hezbollah were ramped up multiple times in September, eliminating top and second-line Hezbollah commanders, its infrastructural bases, and most of its locations in southern Lebanon.
Syria also saw many air strikes by Israel on Syrian military facilities and Iranian bases that further weakened Assad’s grip over the country.
Rising tensions in West Asia followed a limited conflict between Israel and Iran. On 1 October 2024, Iran attacked Israel with around 200 ballistic missiles, prompting Israel’s bombing of Iranian military sites on 26 October.
With these events unfolding, Syria lost the crucial military support from Russia and Iran it once enjoyed.
The fall of the Assad regime was further fuelled by some additional developments.
The U.S. Caesar Act of June 2020 had already imposed stringent sanctions on the Assad regime, worsening economic conditions. Coupled with a corrupt Syrian army and a sectarian divide, with minority Alawite figures at the top, it was only a matter of time before its fall.
Top-level commanders were found to be involved in various business ventures, going as far as drug-smuggling activities, according to different investigative reports focusing on the Syrian army. At the same time, most of the foot soldiers were conscripts. This meant the current Assad army had no strategy or organisational strength in the event of military emergencies, and his regime could only survive with external military support.
The year 2024 saw these pressure points against Bashar al-Assad converging, signalling rebels to march ahead.
The Syrian Arab Spring
The Arab Spring saw authoritarian regimes toppled in four countries: Tunisia (January 2011), Egypt (February 2011), Libya (October 2011), and Yemen (February 2012). Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, and Sudan also saw widespread protests, demonstrations, and anti-government rallies, but regimes in those countries survived. Many other countries in the Middle East and East Africa also saw pro-democracy protests at minor levels.
The Syrian version of the Arab Spring protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime began in March 2011. Later, it became an anti-government uprising that led to the civil war the Bashar al-Assad regime survived for 13 years before its fall. That makes Syria the fifth country with an authoritarian regime falling due to the revolution that began in 2010.

Title: Year ender: Govt aims to build 2 crore houses under PM’s scheme for rural poor
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:47:13 +0000
Content: The Centre plans to construct additional two crore rural houses during FY2024-25 to FY 2028-29 under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) flagship scheme that is being implemented to provide “housing for all” in the country, according to the year-end review of the Ministry of Rural Development released on Tuesday.
As on December 30, the cumulative target of 3.33 crore houses have been allotted to the states/UTs, out of which 3.22 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.68 crore houses have been completed, according to the official statement.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the first instalment to more than 10 lakh PMAY-G beneficiaries on September 17 through single click in a national event.
An e-KYC app integrated with Aadhaar and equipped with AI-enabled face authentication technology is being used to conduct verification of PMAY-G beneficiaries and prevent fraud, according to the government.
As per the Union Cabinet approval, the scheme has been extended to cover more people with the provisions regarding mechanised two wheelers, mechanised fishing boat, landline phone and refrigerator having been deleted as conditions that barred eligibility.
Further, the income criteria have also been enhanced from Rs 10,000 per month to Rs 15,000, and the land-related criteria have been simplified to make the scheme more inclusive.
The PMAY-G has introduced new technology-based solutions for effective and transparent management of the scheme. With the new phase being implemented the PMAY-G has introduced multiple features to maximise transparency and ensure sanctity in the process right from the identification to completion of the houses.
The scheme is being implemented and monitored through an end-to-end e-governance solution, AwaasSoft and AwaasApp. AwaasSoft provides functionalities for data entry and monitoring of multiple statistics related to implementation aspects of the scheme to ensure transparency. These statistics include, physical progress, financial progress and status of convergence.
‘Awaas+ 2024’ is a unique app specially designed under PMAY-G, having features of assisted survey through pre-registered surveyors, housing technology selection, face authentication, Aadhaar-based e-KYC, data capture of household, conditions of existing house, time stamped, and geo tagged photo capture of existing house proposed site of construction. The app works in online as well as offline mode. “Self-Survey” facility is available for eligible households in Awaas+2024 app Survey for the next phase of PMAYG (2024-29).

Title: South Korea’s leadership crisis in hands of Constitutional Court
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:29:22 +0000
Content: South Korea’s leadership crisis will play out in the Constitutional Court, which will decide the fates of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, both impeached and suspended from power over a short-lived martial law.
Han, who was impeached on Friday, had taken over as acting president from Yoon, impeached on Dec. 14. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mokhas become acting president.
Also on Friday, the court held its first hearing in a case to decide whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from power.
WHAT NEXT?
After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except insurrection or treason.
The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove him from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If it removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.
Yoon’s legal counsel include former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon and former prosecutor Yoon Kab-keun, who appeared at Friday’s hearing.
The court is also expected to hold a trial on whether to remove Han from office or restore him to his role.
HURDLES TO A COURT RULING?
South Korea’s constitution requires six justices to agree on the ouster of an impeached president. The nine-member court has one remaining vacancy, after Choi appointed two new justices on Tuesday.
Choi said on Tuesday that he will fill the last remaining vacancy as well if ruling and opposition parties can agree on the nomination.
There is precedent for an acting president to appoint a Constitutional Court justice, when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in late 2016.
WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.
This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict it may seek to rule before that to minimise uncertainty.
On Friday, Justice Cheong Hyung-sik of the Constitutional Court said it would move swiftly in the case, considering its gravity.
In the past, academics say, the justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, going by their interpretation of the constitution.
Attempts by conservatives to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight protests seeking her removal.
In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.
Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.
If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request by Park.
In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached for falling short of the political neutrality required of a high public official, but finished his five-year term after the court rejected the motion within two months.

Content: Cricket Australia has named India’s premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah as the captain of the Men’s Test Team of the Year 2024. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal is the other Indian in the playing XI, which features cricketers from six countries.
Wicket-keeper-batter Alex Carey and pacer Josh Hazlewood are the two Australians included in the multinational XI.
England’s Joe Root, Ben Duckett, and Harry Brook, along with New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra and Matt Henry, also feature in the team. Keshav Maharaj of South Africa and Kamindu Mendis of Sri Lanka are the sole representatives from their respective nations.
India’s 22-year-old batting prodigy Yashasvi Jaiswal displayed remarkable composure throughout 2024. His back-to-back double centuries in February secured a home Test series win against England, while his brilliant 161 in Perth proved decisive. Jaiswal set records for the most runs by an Indian opener in a calendar year and the most sixes (36) hit globally in a single year.
England’s Duckett impressed with his aggressive approach, scoring hundreds in Rajkot (153) and Multan (114), despite England’s defeats. His strike rate of 87.04 showcased his value in the team’s attacking strategy.
Joe Root added six centuries in 2024, including twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and an unbeaten 262 in Multan, which helped England secure a memorable win over Pakistan. Root also contributed with 11 wickets, underlining another stellar year for the all-rounder.
New Zealand’s Ravindra edged out Kane Williamson for his heroics in a historic series win in India, including a match-winning 134 in the first Test. He also scored a double century against South Africa at home.
Harry Brook dazzled with series-defining hundreds against New Zealand and a stunning 317 in Multan, displaying his brilliance under pressure.
Sri Lanka’s Kamindu Mendis, who began the year as a fringe player, finished with 1,000 runs in just 13 innings, equaling Bradman’s record. His four centuries highlighted a breakout year.
Australia’s Alex Carey excelled behind the stumps with 46 dismissals. His unbeaten 98 in Christchurch was one of the year’s standout fourth-innings performances.
New Zealand’s Matt Henry emerged as a key bowler, with a standout performance of 5-15 against India.
Jasprit Bumrah had a historic 2024, claiming 71 wickets in 13 matches at an average of 14.92, making him the year’s most impactful bowler.
Australia’s Josh Hazlewood maintained his excellence with a sub-14 bowling average, while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj played a pivotal role in back-to-back series victories, earning his place in the XI.
