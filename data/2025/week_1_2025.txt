Title: India’s 8-month fiscal deficit at 52.5 pc of full year target for 2024-25
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:15:28 +0000
Content: India’s fiscal deficit for the first 8 months from April to November of the current financial year is estimated at Rs 8.47 lakh crore which works out to 52.5 per cent of the estimate for the financial year, according to official data released on Tuesday.
This reflects a strong macroeconomic financial position as the fiscal deficit is well under control with the government sticking to the consolidation path.
Net tax receipts for the first eight months of the current financial year were at Rs 14.43 lakh crore, or 56 per cent of the annual target, up from Rs 14.36 lakh crore for the same period last year, the data showed.
Total government expenditure for the eight months was Rs 27.41lakh crore which constitutes 57 per cent of the annual target fixed in the Union Budget. The government spent Rs 26.52 lakh crore in the same period last year.
The government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the current financial year from 5.6 per cent in 2023-24. The government aims to contain the fiscal deficit at Rs 16.13 lakh crore during the current fiscal.
India’s net direct tax collections, comprising corporate tax and personal income tax, shot up by a robust 15.4 per cent to Rs 12.1 lakh crore, from April 1 to November 10 during the current financial year, according to the latest figures released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
Similarly, there has been a robust growth in GST collections on the back of rising economic activity.
The buoyancy in tax collections places more funds in the government’s coffers to undertake investments in large infrastructure projects to spur economic growth and take up welfare schemes for the poor. It also helps to keep the fiscal deficit in check and strengthens the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy.
A lower fiscal deficit means the government has to borrow less which leaves more money in the banking system for big companies to borrow and invest. This, in turn, leads to a higher economic growth rate and the creation of more jobs. Besides, a low fiscal deficit keeps the inflation rate in check which strengthens the fundamentals of the economy and ensures growth with stability.

Title: NPCI removes UPI user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:01:00 +0000
Content: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on Tuesday removed the unified payments interface (UPI) user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay with immediate effect.
With this, WhatsApp Pay can now extend UPI services to its entire user base in India, the NPCI said in a statement.
Previously, the NPCI had permitted WhatsApp Pay to expand its UPI user base in a phased manner, lifting the previous cap of 100 million users.
With this notification, the NPCI is removing the limit restrictions on user onboarding on WhatsApp Pay.
“WhatsApp Pay shall continue to comply with all existing UPI guidelines and circulars applicable to existing third-party app providers (TPAPs),” said the corporation.
According to third-party data, the Meta-owned platform has over 500 million users in India. The NPCI move heralds a significant shift in regulatory policy, which had previously limited WhatsApp Payment’s rollout.
Additionally, the NPCI has deferred a proposed rule to cap any single app’s UPI transaction share at 30 per cent until December 31, 2026
UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly, with Google Pay and PhonePe controlling more than 85 per cent of the market.
The UPI achieved 15,547 crore transactions worth Rs 223 lakh crore from January to November this year, ‘showcasing its transformative impact on financial transactions’ in India.
Since its launch in 2016, UPI has transformed financial access in India, enabling 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants to perform seamless digital transactions, according to a study by IIM and ISB professors.
The NPCI said it is focused on bringing innovations in the retail payment systems through the use of technology and is relentlessly working to transform India into a digital economy. It is facilitating secure payment solutions with nationwide accessibility at minimal cost in furtherance of India’s aspiration to be a fully digital society.

Title: Iran rejects involvement in escalating Red Sea tension
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:15:05 +0000
Content: Iran’s envoy to the United Nations (UN) has rejected the accusations by the United States and Britain about Tehran’s role in escalating tensions in the Red Sea, Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s permanent representative to the UN, made the remarks on Monday in letters to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, UN Security Council (UNSC) president for the month of December, while reacting to what he called “baseless and politically-motivated” anti-Tehran claims made by the US and British representatives at a UNSC briefing earlier in the day.
During the briefing, US Deputy Representative to the UN Dorothy Shea accused Iran of “fully funding” Yemen’s Houthis and providing them with “lethal weapons” for attacks on Israel.
In similar remarks, Barbara Woodward, British permanent representative to the UN, also accused Iran of assisting the Yemeni armed forces in their ongoing operations against Israel.
Iravani denounced these accusations as “unfounded” claims intended to escalate tensions and create an excuse to cause further instability in West Asia.
He also slammed Israel as being behind these “baseless” accusations, in a “clear bid” to throw dirt on Iran and to cover its own “illegal actions and destructive activities.”
The Iranian envoy emphasised that it is Israel, not Iran, that has always pursued a policy of “provocation” and has long been a “serious threat” to peace and security in the region and beyond, Xinhua news agency reported.
He said Iran has always been committed to international law, the UN Charter, and UNSC resolutions.
The Houthi group has been launching regular rocket and drone attacks against Israel and disrupting “Israeli-linked” shipping in the Red Sea since November 2023 to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid their conflict with Israelis. In response, Israel and the US-British naval coalition in the region have been conducting intermittent strikes on Houthi targets to deter the group.

Title: Yearender: India’s bittersweet voyage at Paris Olympics
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:21:34 +0000
Content: The Paris Olympics turned out to be a bittersweet journey for the Indian contingent, as they failed to clinch a single gold medal at the recently concluded Summer Games. However, it was a standout year for Manu Bhaker, who rose to fame with her remarkable double Olympic medal haul.  
Team India concluded their Paris Olympics campaign with six medals, including one silver and five bronze. Despite sending 117 athletes to compete across various events, the nation could not secure a gold. India ranked 71st on the Paris Olympics medals tally, while the United States dominated with 126 medals.  
One of the major highlights of the Games was the emergence of shooter Manu Bhaker. The 22-year-old became the first Indian athlete in the post-independence era to win two medals in a single edition of the Olympics, a feat previously achieved by Norman Pritchard at the Paris 1900 Games. Bhaker opened India’s medal tally by securing bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event, becoming the first Indian woman shooter to win an Olympic medal. She, along with Sarabjot Singh, later won another bronze in the mixed team 10m air pistol event, marking India’s first-ever shooting team medal.  
Bhaker narrowly missed a historic grand treble, finishing fourth in the women’s 25m pistol shooting event. She came close to becoming the first Indian to win three medals at the Olympics.  
Swapnil Kusale added to the tally with a bronze in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions Men’s Final, becoming the first Indian shooter to win a medal in this event.  
Neeraj Chopra, India’s “golden boy,” secured silver in the men’s javelin throw with a best throw of 89.45 meters, falling short of retaining his Tokyo gold. Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem claimed gold with a record-breaking 92.97-meter throw, while Grenada’s Anderson Peters earned bronze.  
The Indian men’s hockey team also scripted history by winning back-to-back bronze medals at the Olympics for the first time in 52 years, defeating Spain 2-1.  
Young wrestler Aman Sehrawat brought home India’s first wrestling medal at Paris 2024, securing bronze in the 57 kg freestyle event in his Olympic debut. He became the seventh Indian wrestler to medal at the Olympics.  
Despite these milestones, the Games were marred by near misses. Six athletes, including Lakshya Sen, Mirabai Chanu, and Bhaker, finished fourth in their events, narrowly missing out on medals. The mixed team archery duo of Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat made history by reaching an Olympic medal match but fell short in the bronze medal contest.  
Other setbacks included Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’s semifinal exit in men’s badminton doubles and PV Sindhu’s inability to secure a third consecutive Olympic medal. Veteran archer Deepika Kumari, boxers Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain, and wrestler Vinesh Phogat also fell short of expectations.  
India participated in 69 medal events across 16 sports at Paris 2024, including archery, athletics, badminton, and shooting. To date, India has won 41 Olympic medals, with its best-ever performance coming at Tokyo 2020, where the nation bagged seven medals, including a gold.

Title: Syria’s Spiral: The Rise, Reign, and Ruin of Bashar al-Assad Amid the Arab Spring’s Echoes
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:11:52 +0000
Content: Syria, a country in Southwest Asia on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, was deeply affected by the Arab Spring protests that swept through many nations in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. These were anti-regime, pro-democracy demonstrations aimed at toppling dictatorial governments.
Backed by Iran and Russia, the regime led by Bashar al-Assad survived the revolutionary wave carried out by rebel forces and eventually reclaimed many of the territories they once held. Though not directly related, the survival of his regime was also assisted by the U.S.-led coalition’s action against ISIS, which had once occupied vast territories along the Syria–Iraq border.
A History of Autocracy with the Baath Party
The Baath Party was formed in Damascus, Syria, in 1943. It soon established branches in other Middle Eastern countries. Although it adopted a liberal-sounding appeal, including opposition to colonialism and imperialism and a policy of non-alignment, the party quickly became highly centralised. The single-party, single-leader rules in Syria and Iraq only confirm this fact.
Syria gained independence in 1946 from a joint French and British occupation, but the subsequent political phase was unstable. In 1963, the Baath Party rose to power through a military coup. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, resulting in Israel’s capture of the Golan Heights and the destruction of Syria’s air power. In 1970, then-Defence Minister Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar al-Assad, led an internal coup within the Baath Party, toppling the then-president and ushering in five decades of centralised rule. After Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, Bashar al-Assad succeeded him as president.
Both Bashar al-Assad and his father ruled Syria with an iron fist. In 1973, widespread riots erupted against Hafez al-Assad’s decree amending the Syrian constitution to allow even a non-Muslim to become the country’s president. The army brutally suppressed the protests. In the 1980s, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria sparked uprisings in Aleppo, Homs, and Hama, all of which were violently crushed, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. After taking power in 2000, Bashar al-Assad once again dashed hopes of political reforms in the country, continuing the one-party Baathist rule while arresting activists, citizens, and opposition leaders who demanded change.
The Arab Spring and the Eruption of the Civil War
Pro-democracy protests began in Daraa and quickly spread nationwide. As before, the Syrian regime responded with violence. Initially, the protests were largely peaceful, but the regime took brutal action against them, adopting measures such as killings, disappearances, and arrests. Police, military, and paramilitary forces were deployed to quell dissent.
This time, however, the response to Assad’s crackdown was different. Armed militias emerged, including the Free Syrian Army, formed by defectors from the Assad-led Syrian military. By 2012, peaceful demonstrations had escalated into a full-fledged civil war. Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and U.S.-backed Kurdish rebel groups later became another major challenger for Bashar al-Assad.
Sectarian violence also played a significant role. With a population of about 24 million, Syria is predominantly Muslim, with Sunnis forming the majority, but it was ruled by the minority Alawite sect for more than five decades. The Assad family was Alawite, as were most of the leading figures in the Syrian security forces and bureaucracy.
The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam. Sunni Muslims generally consider Alawite beliefs to deviate from mainstream Islamic traditions. According to the CIA World Factbook, 87 per cent of Syrians are Muslims, with 74 per cent being Sunni. Shia sects like Alawites and Ismailis form about 13 per cent. Christians account for about 10 per cent, and Druze about 3 per cent.
The post–Arab Spring period saw involvement from Sunni-dominated terror groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, exacerbating sectarian strife. The use of chemical weapons by Assad’s forces further fuelled the conflict.
The Rise and Fall of ISIS
In April 2013, the terror group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS or the Islamic State), led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, emerged as a new, significant threat to the Assad regime and the world community. The terror group had a single goal of establishing an Islamic empire across boundaries and continents. It captured Raqqa in eastern Syria as its base and expanded into Iraq, quickly overtaking vast territories. Its ambitions to establish a caliphate across the world by violent means alarmed the international community.
By September 2014, a U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition with Kurdish forces launched air strikes on ISIL-held territories. The coalition’s efforts, along with interventions by Turkey and the Assad regime (backed by Iran and Russia), led to ISIS’s collapse by 2016. This was a major relief for Assad, as his primary challenger on Syrian territory was effectively neutralised. In 2017, Raqqa was liberated by the U.S.-aligned Kurdish force.
Bashar al-Assad – Backed by Iran and Russia
A 2018 Times of Israel report noted that Iran maintained about ten military bases in Syria. Iran-backed Hezbollah, a political party with a powerful militia based in southern Lebanon, joined the Syrian civil war in May 2013 to support Assad. Russia also actively supported Assad’s regime with air strikes targeting rebel camps.
Joint operations helped the regime retake Palmyra from ISIL and Aleppo from other rebels in 2016. By November 2017, Assad’s forces retook control of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria and Eastern Ghouta from various rebel groups. In 2018, the regime targeted southwestern regions to reclaim control from rebels, successfully recapturing Daraa and Quneitra. The rebels surrendered and retreated to Idlib, Syria’s only remaining rebel-held territory.
In May 2023, the Arab League, which had once expelled Syria, reinstated it, acknowledging the regime’s hold over the country. The League recognised Assad’s rule over the country’s vast territory, with no significant threats seen in the last three years.
Since 2018, the rebel forces had not been very active, until this year.
2024: The Turning Point
The Bashar al-Assad regime seemed to be in control of Syria even a month ago, before its collapse in just under two weeks.
Two external events and a host of internal factors led to this fall.
The story of the downfall began in 2022 and accelerated through 2023, severely compounding Assad’s problems. In February 2022, Russia began a full-scale war with Ukraine that is still ongoing. In October 2023, Hamas, another Iran-supported terror group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel retaliated by attacking Gaza.
That was the beginning of the West Asia crisis, with Israel and Iran being the key players.
Hezbollah, an old rival of Israel, also launched strikes on northern Israel, prompting Israeli counter-attacks. The group withdrew its fighters from Syria last year to fight against Israel. The Israeli military operations against Hezbollah were ramped up multiple times in September, eliminating top and second-line Hezbollah commanders, its infrastructural bases, and most of its locations in southern Lebanon.
Syria also saw many air strikes by Israel on Syrian military facilities and Iranian bases that further weakened Assad’s grip over the country.
Rising tensions in West Asia followed a limited conflict between Israel and Iran. On 1 October 2024, Iran attacked Israel with around 200 ballistic missiles, prompting Israel’s bombing of Iranian military sites on 26 October.
With these events unfolding, Syria lost the crucial military support from Russia and Iran it once enjoyed.
The fall of the Assad regime was further fuelled by some additional developments.
The U.S. Caesar Act of June 2020 had already imposed stringent sanctions on the Assad regime, worsening economic conditions. Coupled with a corrupt Syrian army and a sectarian divide, with minority Alawite figures at the top, it was only a matter of time before its fall.
Top-level commanders were found to be involved in various business ventures, going as far as drug-smuggling activities, according to different investigative reports focusing on the Syrian army. At the same time, most of the foot soldiers were conscripts. This meant the current Assad army had no strategy or organisational strength in the event of military emergencies, and his regime could only survive with external military support.
The year 2024 saw these pressure points against Bashar al-Assad converging, signalling rebels to march ahead.
The Syrian Arab Spring
The Arab Spring saw authoritarian regimes toppled in four countries: Tunisia (January 2011), Egypt (February 2011), Libya (October 2011), and Yemen (February 2012). Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, and Sudan also saw widespread protests, demonstrations, and anti-government rallies, but regimes in those countries survived. Many other countries in the Middle East and East Africa also saw pro-democracy protests at minor levels.
The Syrian version of the Arab Spring protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime began in March 2011. Later, it became an anti-government uprising that led to the civil war the Bashar al-Assad regime survived for 13 years before its fall. That makes Syria the fifth country with an authoritarian regime falling due to the revolution that began in 2010.

Title: Year ender: Govt aims to build 2 crore houses under PM’s scheme for rural poor
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:47:13 +0000
Content: The Centre plans to construct additional two crore rural houses during FY2024-25 to FY 2028-29 under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) flagship scheme that is being implemented to provide “housing for all” in the country, according to the year-end review of the Ministry of Rural Development released on Tuesday.
As on December 30, the cumulative target of 3.33 crore houses have been allotted to the states/UTs, out of which 3.22 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.68 crore houses have been completed, according to the official statement.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the first instalment to more than 10 lakh PMAY-G beneficiaries on September 17 through single click in a national event.
An e-KYC app integrated with Aadhaar and equipped with AI-enabled face authentication technology is being used to conduct verification of PMAY-G beneficiaries and prevent fraud, according to the government.
As per the Union Cabinet approval, the scheme has been extended to cover more people with the provisions regarding mechanised two wheelers, mechanised fishing boat, landline phone and refrigerator having been deleted as conditions that barred eligibility.
Further, the income criteria have also been enhanced from Rs 10,000 per month to Rs 15,000, and the land-related criteria have been simplified to make the scheme more inclusive.
The PMAY-G has introduced new technology-based solutions for effective and transparent management of the scheme. With the new phase being implemented the PMAY-G has introduced multiple features to maximise transparency and ensure sanctity in the process right from the identification to completion of the houses.
The scheme is being implemented and monitored through an end-to-end e-governance solution, AwaasSoft and AwaasApp. AwaasSoft provides functionalities for data entry and monitoring of multiple statistics related to implementation aspects of the scheme to ensure transparency. These statistics include, physical progress, financial progress and status of convergence.
‘Awaas+ 2024’ is a unique app specially designed under PMAY-G, having features of assisted survey through pre-registered surveyors, housing technology selection, face authentication, Aadhaar-based e-KYC, data capture of household, conditions of existing house, time stamped, and geo tagged photo capture of existing house proposed site of construction. The app works in online as well as offline mode. “Self-Survey” facility is available for eligible households in Awaas+2024 app Survey for the next phase of PMAYG (2024-29).

Title: South Korea’s leadership crisis in hands of Constitutional Court
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:29:22 +0000
Content: South Korea’s leadership crisis will play out in the Constitutional Court, which will decide the fates of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, both impeached and suspended from power over a short-lived martial law.
Han, who was impeached on Friday, had taken over as acting president from Yoon, impeached on Dec. 14. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mokhas become acting president.
Also on Friday, the court held its first hearing in a case to decide whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from power.
WHAT NEXT?
After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except insurrection or treason.
The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove him from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If it removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.
Yoon’s legal counsel include former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon and former prosecutor Yoon Kab-keun, who appeared at Friday’s hearing.
The court is also expected to hold a trial on whether to remove Han from office or restore him to his role.
HURDLES TO A COURT RULING?
South Korea’s constitution requires six justices to agree on the ouster of an impeached president. The nine-member court has one remaining vacancy, after Choi appointed two new justices on Tuesday.
Choi said on Tuesday that he will fill the last remaining vacancy as well if ruling and opposition parties can agree on the nomination.
There is precedent for an acting president to appoint a Constitutional Court justice, when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in late 2016.
WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.
This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict it may seek to rule before that to minimise uncertainty.
On Friday, Justice Cheong Hyung-sik of the Constitutional Court said it would move swiftly in the case, considering its gravity.
In the past, academics say, the justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, going by their interpretation of the constitution.
Attempts by conservatives to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight protests seeking her removal.
In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.
Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.
If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request by Park.
In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached for falling short of the political neutrality required of a high public official, but finished his five-year term after the court rejected the motion within two months.

Content: Cricket Australia has named India’s premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah as the captain of the Men’s Test Team of the Year 2024. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal is the other Indian in the playing XI, which features cricketers from six countries.
Wicket-keeper-batter Alex Carey and pacer Josh Hazlewood are the two Australians included in the multinational XI.
England’s Joe Root, Ben Duckett, and Harry Brook, along with New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra and Matt Henry, also feature in the team. Keshav Maharaj of South Africa and Kamindu Mendis of Sri Lanka are the sole representatives from their respective nations.
India’s 22-year-old batting prodigy Yashasvi Jaiswal displayed remarkable composure throughout 2024. His back-to-back double centuries in February secured a home Test series win against England, while his brilliant 161 in Perth proved decisive. Jaiswal set records for the most runs by an Indian opener in a calendar year and the most sixes (36) hit globally in a single year.
England’s Duckett impressed with his aggressive approach, scoring hundreds in Rajkot (153) and Multan (114), despite England’s defeats. His strike rate of 87.04 showcased his value in the team’s attacking strategy.
Joe Root added six centuries in 2024, including twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and an unbeaten 262 in Multan, which helped England secure a memorable win over Pakistan. Root also contributed with 11 wickets, underlining another stellar year for the all-rounder.
New Zealand’s Ravindra edged out Kane Williamson for his heroics in a historic series win in India, including a match-winning 134 in the first Test. He also scored a double century against South Africa at home.
Harry Brook dazzled with series-defining hundreds against New Zealand and a stunning 317 in Multan, displaying his brilliance under pressure.
Sri Lanka’s Kamindu Mendis, who began the year as a fringe player, finished with 1,000 runs in just 13 innings, equaling Bradman’s record. His four centuries highlighted a breakout year.
Australia’s Alex Carey excelled behind the stumps with 46 dismissals. His unbeaten 98 in Christchurch was one of the year’s standout fourth-innings performances.
New Zealand’s Matt Henry emerged as a key bowler, with a standout performance of 5-15 against India.
Jasprit Bumrah had a historic 2024, claiming 71 wickets in 13 matches at an average of 14.92, making him the year’s most impactful bowler.
Australia’s Josh Hazlewood maintained his excellence with a sub-14 bowling average, while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj played a pivotal role in back-to-back series victories, earning his place in the XI.

Title: Pentagon appeals Court upholds plea deals for 9/11 plotters
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 07:13:07 +0000
Content: A Pentagon appeals court has upheld controversial plea deals for three men accused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks, clearing the way for the US government to proceed with the agreements, reported The Washington Post.
The court’s unanimous ruling, delivered late Monday, rejected efforts by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to block the deals. Austin had attempted to nullify the agreements in August, despite a judge’s previous approval of the terms.
The plea deals involve Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and his two co-conspirators, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Under the agreements, the men are set to serve life sentences in exchange for admitting their involvement in the al-Qaeda plot that resulted in the deaths of 2,977 individuals.
The deadly 9/11 attacks saw hijackers crash two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a fourth intended for a federal government building in Washington, D.C., which instead crashed in a Pennsylvania field.
Secretary Austin had argued that the families of 9/11 victims and those impacted by the subsequent wars deserved to see the men face trial. However, the appeals court ruled that Austin could not block plea deals already approved. The court emphasized that the defendants’ admissions of guilt would effectively negate any potential new trials.
A senior Defense Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that both the Defense and Justice Departments are reviewing the ruling and considering their options. On Tuesday, the US government filed a motion to delay the plea agreements until January 27, allowing officials time to determine whether to pursue further legal action. A motions hearing in Mohammed’s case is set for January 6.
The appeals court’s decision upholds a prior ruling by Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, a military commission judge, who concluded in November that the plea deals were valid. McCall further argued that allowing Austin to rescind them would give him an “absolute veto” over decisions made by the officer appointed to oversee the cases.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the most notorious terrorists, was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in March 2003, and subsequently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he has remained since.

Title: ISRO’s SPADEX Mission: A giant leap in space technology, elevating India among global leaders
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:54:51 +0000
Content: ISRO’s Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX) has marked a pivotal achievement in space technology, positioning India among the global leaders in space docking.
Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh hailed the mission as a landmark moment during a press briefing in New Delhi, following the successful launch of PSLV-C60 from Sriharikota on Monday.
Dr. Singh emphasized that SPADEX is a critical ISRO mission focused on developing and demonstrating key technologies for spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking.
Using two small satellites, the mission aims to advance capabilities vital for satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary exploration.
Highlighting the mission’s primary objectives, Dr. Singh noted that SPADEX will demonstrate technology for spacecraft rendezvous and docking, showcase controllability in docked conditions to extend the lifespan of target spacecraft, and test power transfer between docked satellites.
He added that post-docking activities would include independent payload operations by the spacecraft, with docking expected to occur on Tuesday, January 7, 2025.
Dr. Singh also underscored a significant collaboration between ISRO and the Department of Biotechnology, focusing on “space-biology” to study physiological changes in space environments, with India aiming to lead in this emerging field under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.
Reflecting on the evolution of India’s space journey, Dr. Singh credited Prime Minister Modi’s vision for opening the space sector to private industry through the 2023 New Space Policy, which has accelerated innovation and private sector participation.
The policy’s impact has been evident in the rapid growth of space startups, which have surged from just a handful in 2021 to nearly 300 by 2023.
Notable startups like AgniKul Cosmos and Skyroot Aerospace have attracted global attention, establishing private launchpads and executing key missions on ISRO’s premises.
Dr. Singh highlighted India’s burgeoning space economy, valued at $8.4 billion in 2023, with projections to grow to $44 billion by 2033.
Investments in the sector reached ₹1000 crore in 2023 alone, positioning India as a major player on the global stage.
Looking ahead, Dr. Singh outlined a series of ambitious milestones, including advancements in NAVIC satellite technology in January 2025, the launch of a US satellite for mobile communication in February 2025, and Vyommitra, a female humanoid robot, performing astronaut-like tasks for the Gaganyaan mission.
He also mentioned India’s first crewed Gaganyaan mission set for 2026, the launch of India’s own space station, Bharat Antariksh, in 2035, and plans for India to land its first astronaut on the moon by 2047.
Dr. Singh also highlighted significant achievements from 2024, including the successful Aditya L1 solar mission and the launch of satellites for international clients.
He stressed the growing global reliance on ISRO’s satellite launch services, noting that 85% of the €220 million earned through launching foreign satellites over the past eight years came from ISRO’s recent efforts.
Moreover, Dr. Singh emphasised the broad application of space technologies in various sectors such as agriculture, defense, water management, and infrastructure development.
Initiatives like Mission Mausam, aimed at enhancing weather forecasting, further demonstrate India’s growing capabilities in space technology.

Title: Putin tells Russians at New Year that ‘everything will be fine’
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:10:13 +0000
Content: President Vladimir Putin told Russians in a New Year address that the country would move forward with confidence in 2025, though he offered no specific promises on the economy or the war in Ukraine.
At a time when many ordinary people are worried about rising prices and the central bank’s 21% interest rate is squeezing businesses and homebuyers, Putin reassured Russians that their wellbeing was his top priority.
He framed Russia’s challenges as part of a wider historic mission, evoking past victories including its role in the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two.
Russia, he said, had overcome trials, achieved major goals and strengthened its unity in the first quarter of the 21st century – a period coinciding exactly with his time as its paramount leader.
“And now, on the threshold of the new year, we are thinking about the future. We are confident that everything will be fine, we will only move forward. We know for sure that the absolute value for us was, is and will be the fate of Russia, the well-being of its citizens,” he said.
His three-and-a-half-minute seasonal message from the Kremlin was being broadcast at midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones, starting with Kamchatka and Chukotka in the far east.
He was speaking exactly 25 years since he first addressed the nation as its acting president after Boris Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly on the last day of 1999.
Putin, 72, paid tribute to Russian soldiers fighting in the war in Ukraine, describing them as heroes. “We are proud of your courage and bravery. We believe in you,” he said.
He made no specific reference to the situation on the battlefield or the prospects for an end to the conflict after Donald Trump returns as U.S. president on Jan. 20. Trump has said he will swiftly stop the war, without providing details.
LOSSES IN UKRAINE
Russian forces in 2024 advanced in Ukraine at the fastest rate since 2022, the war’s first year, and control about a fifth of the country. But the gains have come at the cost of heavy, though undisclosed, losses in men and equipment.
In 2024, Russia was invaded for the first time since World War Two as Ukraine grabbed a slice of its western Kursk region in a surprise counter-attack on Aug. 6.
Russia has yet to eject Ukrainian forces from Kursk despite bringing in more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, according to Ukrainian, South Korean and U.S. assessments. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence.
“To sustain even the very slow advance in Ukraine, Russia has been forced to ignore the months-long occupation of part of its own territory by Ukrainian forces,” British security expert Ruth Deyermond said.
“Taking a ‘nothing to see here’ attitude to the loss of its own land is not what great powers do, particularly one so preoccupied with the idea of state sovereignty.”
Deyermond, in a long thread posted on X, suggested Putin’s efforts to portray Russia as a leading world power were also undermined by the toppling of its chief Middle East ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and its increasing dependence on China.
Putin, the longest-serving ruler of Russia since Josef Stalin, said on Dec. 19 that under his leadership the country had moved back from “the edge of the abyss” and rebuffed threats to its sovereignty.
With hindsight, he said, he should not have waited until February 2022 before launching his “special military operation” in Ukraine, the term he still uses for the full-scale invasion of Russia’s neighbour.

Title: Russia halts gas exports to Europe via Ukraine
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:06:34 +0000
Content: Russia’s energy giant Gazprom said on Wednesday that gas exports via Ukraine to Europe had been halted from 08:00 Moscow time (0500 GMT) as the transit deal has expired.
The shutdown of Russia’s oldest gas route to Europe ends a decade of fraught relations sparked by Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014.
Russia still exports gas via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea.
The European Union redoubled its efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian energy after the outbreak of the military conflict in Ukraine in 2022 by seeking alternative sources.
The five-year gas transit deal between Russia and Ukraine expired in early hours of Jan. 1, 2025, while Kyiv has repeatedly said it would not extend the agreement amid the war.
“Due to the repeated and clearly expressed refusal of the Ukrainian side to renew these agreements, Gazprom was deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through the territory of Ukraine from January 1, 2025,” Gazprom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.
“Starting from 08:00 Moscow time, the supply of Russian gas for its transportation through the territory of Ukraine is not carried out.”

Title: Vaishno devi shrine welcomes 94.83 lakh devotees in 2024, second-highest footfall in a decade
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:53:36 +0000
Content: Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a significant surge in pilgrim footfall in 2024, with 94.83 lakh devotees visiting the sacred site. This marks the second-highest number of visitors recorded in a decade, according to Anshul Garg, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board (SMVDSB).
Sharing the milestone, Garg said, “94.83 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine in 2024, the second-highest number in a decade.”
This marks the third consecutive year that the shrine has exceeded 90 lakh in annual footfall. On December 12, Garg said that visitor numbers had surpassed 90 lakh for the year, consistent with trends from previous years. “Last year, we crossed 95 lakh, and this year’s yatra has followed a similar pattern,” he said.
Garg emphasized that efforts are underway to enhance facilities for pilgrims, with infrastructure initiatives aimed at improving the overall experience. He highlighted the positive impact of improved connectivity, including projects like the Vande Bharat train and the upcoming Delhi-Katra Express, which are expected to further boost footfall in the region.
“We are continuously working on multiple projects to provide better facilities for devotees. Infrastructure initiatives, such as the New Vaishnavi Bhawan with family rooms, an exit track for smoother crowd movement, and an all-weather queue complex at Darshani Deodi and Banganga, are set to be completed by 2025,” Garg announced in a post on December 8.

Title: South Korea crash investigation ramps up as funeral procedures begin
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:44:39 +0000
Content: The investigation into the crash of a South Korea passenger jet gathered pace on Wednesday as bereaved families began to prepare funerals after authorities finished formally identifying the 179 victims of the country’s worst air disaster.
The transport ministry said South Korean investigators have extracted the data from the plane’s cockpit voice recorder and will convert it into an audio file, critical information to try to explain the few minutes that led up to the crash.
The investigation team is still working to extract the contents of the flight data recorder, which was found missing a key connector, the ministry said.
All 175 passengers and four of the six crew members were killed on Sunday when the Jeju Air 089590.KS jet belly-landed at Muan International Airport in the country’s southwest and slammed into a sand-and-concrete embankment at the end of the runway, where it burst into flames.
Two crew members, located near the tail of the Boeing 737-800, survived the disaster.
The government has declared a national mourning period until Jan. 4 and the country will scale back New Year’s celebrations.
The transport ministry said two more U.S. officials arrived late on Tuesday to join a team of around two dozen investigators including from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration, and aircraft maker Boeing BA.N.
“They’re also planning to start a visual investigation into the wreckage,” deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan told a briefing.
Officials have said investigators were expected to examine whether a bird strike, a failure of the landing gear to drop or if problems with any other control systems played a role in the disaster.
They will also investigate the pilot’s apparent rush to attempt a landing right after he had declared an emergency, officials have said.
Air safety experts have also questioned if the airport embankment designed to prop up navigation equipment was built too close to the end of the runway.
South Korea’s acting President Choi Sang-mok on Wednesday called for a fair and objective investigation, and said funeral procedures have begun after all the victims were formally identified.
“The most urgent matter at present is to return the victims to their families,” Choi told an intra-agency meeting.
Airport authorities set up an altar late on Tuesday and on Wednesday buses carried relatives of victims to the crash site so that they could pay their respects, just metres from the crashed plane’s charred and broken tail – the only relatively intact part of the aircraft following the accident.
The Muan airport was brimming with mourners seeking to pay their tributes at the altar, leading to a queue of several hundred metres.
County officials sent an alert to urge visitors to go instead to a larger memorial set up in a sport complex about 9 km (5 miles) from the crash site.
It could still take several days until all bereaved relatives are able to secure the release of the bodies of their loved ones.

Title: Year-End Review 2024: key achievements by the Ministry of Culture
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:11:54 +0000
Content: In 2024, the Ministry of Culture made significant strides in preserving and promoting India’s rich heritage. 
Hosting the prestigious 46th World Heritage Committee session, inscribing new sites, and launching initiatives like Project PARI marked a vibrant year for Indian culture. 
Among the year’s highlights were major cultural collaborations, including a landmark agreement with the USA to combat antiquities trafficking, the development of the world’s largest museum in New Delhi, and the recognition of five new classical languages. 
From global Buddhist expositions to the Har Ghar Tiranga campaign, India’s cultural and patriotic spirit soared, further reinforcing the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its diverse history for future generations. 
Delhi Hosts 46th World Heritage Committee session
One of the most significant cultural events of 2024 was the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Delhi from July 21 to 31.
Attended by nearly 2,900 delegates from over 140 countries, including UNESCO officials, Ministers of Culture, and Ambassadors, the session saw India’s “Moidams—the Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty” from Assam inscribed on the World Heritage List. This brought India’s total to 43 sites on the prestigious list. 
Project PARI: Celebrating Public Art in India 
Launched during the World Heritage session, Project PARI (Public Art of India) mobilized over 200 artists and 300 students to create murals, sculptures, and wall paintings across Delhi. The initiative represents a major effort to promote public art and heritage conservation. 
India and USA Sign Cultural Property Agreement
A landmark Cultural Property Agreement between India and the USA was signed on July 26, 2024, to curb illicit antiquities trafficking. As part of this agreement, 297 artifacts will be repatriated from the USA to India, marking a major win in preserving India’s cultural history. 
World’s Largest Museum Takes Shape in New Delhi

Recognition of Five New Classical Languages 
In October 2024, Assamese, Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, and Bengali were officially declared classical languages, bringing the total number of recognised classical languages in India to 11.
This step is expected to enhance linguistic research and global recognition. 
Major Buddhist Events and Expositions 
The Ministry played a key role in organizing significant Buddhist events, including the First Asian Buddhist Summit in November and a 26-day exposition of Lord Buddha’s relics in Thailand.
The relics attracted over 4 million devotees, strengthening India’s ties with its Buddhist heritage. 
Indian Literary Works Gain Global Recognition 
In May 2024, three iconic Indian texts—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahrdayāloka-Locana—were added to UNESCO’s MOWCAP (Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific) register, highlighting India’s enduring literary legacy. 
Patriotic spirit soars with Har Ghar Tiranga campaign 
The Har Ghar Tiranga campaign, which took place from August 9 to 15, saw over 5 crore people upload selfies with the national flag.
The initiative, supported by Tiranga runs and rallies, reignited a sense of national pride and unity across the country. 
Cultural Celebrations and Museum Inaugurations 
The Ministry commemorated key milestones, including the 350th anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation and the inauguration of the Humayun’s Tomb World Heritage Site Museum. 
Exhibitions such as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day further emphasized the Ministry’s dedication to preserving India’s historical and cultural legacy. 
Celebrating Icons of India’s Cultural and Spiritual Legacy

Title: Protesters in Bangladesh demand July uprising proclamation by January 15
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:06:51 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Dhaka on Tuesday to demand justice for victims of the July uprising against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. Organized under the banner of “Students Against Discrimination,” the protest saw a massive turnout at the Central Shaheed Minar, where participants observed a minute of silence to honor those who lost their lives during the violent clashes, the Dhaka Tribune reported.
The event, termed the “March for Unity,” began at 4:00 p.m. and was supported by the Jatiya Nagorik Committee. Both groups have announced further demonstrations if the government fails to issue a formal Proclamation of the July Uprising by January 15.
“We still do not have an official proclamation acknowledging the July mass uprising. It must be issued by January 15. That day, we will reunite here with the proclamation in hand,” said Hasnat Abdullah, convener of Students Against Discrimination. He vowed to continue the fight against what he called “fascism” under the Awami League, accusing the government of conspiring against their movement through the Secretariat, police, and judiciary.
Nasiruddin Patwary, convener of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, echoed Abdullah’s sentiments. “We envision a new Bangladesh that rejects intimidation, corruption, and extortion. The Awami League and Sheikh Hasina must be held accountable,” he stated, as quoted by The Daily Star.
Protesters also demanded that the next election pave the way for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. Akhtar Hossain, member secretary of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, emphasized this point, while Arif Sohel of Students Against Discrimination reiterated that the proclamation must uphold the rights of farmers, laborers, and basic human necessities such as food, education, and healthcare.
The July uprising, which began as a student-led movement demanding reforms in the government’s controversial job quota system, escalated into weeks of protests and violent clashes. Over 600 people were reportedly killed, and Sheikh Hasina, 76, was forced to flee to India. An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus has since taken over.
The unrest gained momentum after tens of thousands of students took to the streets, challenging the reservation of 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans from the 1971 war of independence. The Hasina-led government responded by suspending mobile internet services on July 17 and imposing a curfew.
Despite initially peaceful demonstrations, violence erupted when police and pro-government student groups attacked protesters. According to Bangladesh’s Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, at least 147 people were killed in the clashes. However, Students Against Discrimination claimed the death toll exceeded 266.

Title: Indian navy to commission three frontline fleet assets: Nilgiri, Surat, and Vaghsheer
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 12:24:13 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy is set to commission three major fleet assets—Nilgiri, Surat, and Vaghsheer—on January 15, at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. This marks a significant development in India’s maritime capabilities and indigenous shipbuilding initiatives.
The Nilgiri, the lead ship of the Project 17A stealth frigates, represents an upgrade over the Shivalik-class frigates. The vessel features advanced technology designed to reduce radar signatures. Similarly, the Surat is the fourth and final ship in the Project 15B stealth destroyer class, building on the capabilities of the Kolkata-class destroyers. Both ships were designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau and equipped with advanced sensors and weapon systems developed domestically or through international partnerships.
The Nilgiri and Surat are equipped to operate various helicopters, including Chetak, ALH, Sea King, and MH-60R, for day and night operations. These ships include systems such as the Rail-Less Helicopter Traversing System and a Visual Aid and Landing System to enhance aviation efficiency. Accommodations have also been added to support women officers and sailors, reflecting the Navy’s policy of expanding combat roles for women.

Title: India’s tobacco exports surge to a record high of Rs 12,005 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:25:26 +0000
Content: India’s tobacco exports have witnessed a surge of 87 percent over the past five years, reaching a record Rs 12,005.89 crore ($1.45 billion) in the 2023-24 fiscal year, compared to Rs 6,408.15 crore in 2019-20. This remarkable growth has resulted in a more than twofold increase in farmers’ income, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Export volumes also saw a substantial increase, rising from 218.84 million kg to 315.51 million kg during the same period, the ministry said.
“As the Tobacco Board celebrates its formation day, we are proud to highlight that the earnings of Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers have more than doubled between 2019-20 and 2023-24—from Rs 124.00 per kg in 2019-20 to Rs 279.54 per kg in 2023-24,” the ministry added.
The surge in international demand for Indian FCV tobacco has been a key factor driving this historic growth. This not only benefited tobacco farmers but also significantly boosted the nation’s foreign exchange earnings through exports.
India is the world’s second-largest producer of tobacco, following China, and ranks as the fourth-largest producer of FCV tobacco globally, behind China, Brazil, and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, India is the second-largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, in terms of quantity, after Brazil.
“The 2023-24 crop season has been especially remarkable for FCV tobacco farmers across Andhra Pradesh,” the statement said.
The Tobacco Board has implemented a series of strategic measures to ensure the growth and sustainability of India’s tobacco industry. These initiatives include crop planning and regulation of production to meet both domestic and export demands.

Title: Researchers find vital link between inflammation and depression
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:22:50 +0000
Content: Researchers have unveiled transformative insights into the relationship between inflammation and depression, which could fundamentally change our understanding of the biological underpinnings of depression.
The research by neuroscientist Professor Raz Yirmiya from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem extends well beyond the confines of the laboratory.
His discoveries about the role of microglia cells and interleukin-1 in stress-induced depression raise intriguing questions about therapeutic interventions: How might understanding inflammatory processes lead to more targeted treatments? What role do different types of immune responses play in various forms of depression?
“Most depressed patients do not have any overt inflammatory disease. However, we and others found that exposure to stress, which is the most significant trigger of depression in humans and animals, also activates inflammatory processes, particularly in the brain,” Yirmiya explained in a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published in the journal Brain Medicine.
Through innovative approaches combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies, Yirmiya’s team identified several promising therapeutic targets.
Their work on microglial checkpoint mechanisms and stress-related resilience opens new avenues for understanding how the immune system influences mental health. These findings suggest the potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.
“My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes,” said Yirmiya.
His work suggests that both activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches.
Yirmiya’s interview, published in Brain Medicine, is part of a larger series highlighting the visionaries behind some of today’s most influential scientific ideas.
Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future,” said the authors.

Title: Cabinet approves extension of DAP subsidy to support farmers
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:58:13 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet has approved an extension of the One-time Special Package on Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP). This package, providing an additional subsidy of ₹3,500 per metric tonne over the existing Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS), will now continue beyond January 1, 2025, until further notice. The decision aims to ensure the continued availability of DAP at affordable prices for farmers.
Implementation Details
The additional subsidy will be provided over and above the ongoing NBS scheme, which has governed subsidies for 28 grades of phosphorus and potassium (P&K) fertilizers since its inception on April 1, 2010. This decision extends the Cabinet’s July 2024 approval of the subsidy, initially applicable from April 2024 to December 2024, which involved a financial outlay of approximately ₹2,625 crore.
Objective
The extended package will support farmers by ensuring a steady supply of DAP at stable prices, despite global market fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainties. The move is part of the government’s broader strategy to maintain uninterrupted fertilizer supply during key agricultural seasons, including Kharif and Rabi crops for the 2024-25 period.

Title: Cabinet approves continuation of PM Fasal Bima Yojana, weather crop insurance scheme
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:45:37 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) until 2025-26, with an overall outlay of Rs. 69,515 crore for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. The decision aims to provide crucial risk coverage for crops affected by non-preventable natural calamities, benefiting farmers across the country.
The Cabinet has also approved the establishment of the Fund for Innovation and Technology (FIAT) with a corpus of Rs. 824 crore. This fund will support large-scale technological infusion, ensuring greater transparency and improved claim calculation and settlement under the scheme.
Technological advancements for crop insurance
The YES-TECH (Yield Estimation System using Technology) initiative will play a key role in the enhanced implementation of the scheme. YES-TECH utilizes remote sensing technology for yield estimation, giving at least 30% weightage to technology-based yield estimates. At present, nine major states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, have adopted this system, with additional states being onboarded quickly. With the wider rollout of YES-TECH, traditional crop-cutting experiments will be phased out. 
For the 2023-24 season, claim calculation and settlement have already been completed under YES-TECH. Madhya Pradesh has fully adopted technology-based yield estimation.
Focus on northeastern states 
The government is prioritizing the saturation of crop insurance coverage for farmers in the northeastern states. The Centre will continue to share 90% of the premium subsidy for these states. However, due to the voluntary nature of the scheme and the relatively low gross cropped area in these regions, the government has provided flexibility for states to reallocate funds to other development projects and schemes, avoiding the surrender of unused funds.

Content: A driver crashed his pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year’s Day in New Orleans’ French Quarter and opened fire, killing 10 people and injuring more than 35, in an early morning attack the FBI said was a potential act of terrorism.
 
The suspect died after a shootout with police, law enforcement officials said.
 
“This man was trying to run over as many people as he could,” Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said at a televised press conference on Wednesday. “He was hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”
 
The incident occurred at 3:15 a.m. at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets, a historic tourist destination in the city’s French Quarter known for attracting large crowds with its music and bars.
 
Kirkpatrick said the driver, who swerved around barricades, fired at police and struck two police officers from the vehicle after it crashed. The officers were in stable condition, she added.
 
“We know the perpetrator has been killed,” said New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas. “As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of evil.”
 
There was no immediate word on the driver’s identity.
 
More than 300 officers were on duty at the time of the incident, police said. The city hosts the Sugar Bowl, a classic American college football game, each New Year’s Day, and will also be the site of the NFL Super Bowl on Feb. 9.
 
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called the incident a “terrorist attack.”
 
The FBI said in a statement that it was investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Initially, Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, had said it was not a terrorist event.
 
Duncan said a suspected improvised explosive device was found but provided no further details.

Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:26:03 +0000
Content: Bangladesh’s Chief of Army Staff, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has praised the strong ties between Bangladesh and India, calling India an “important neighbour” on which Dhaka relies in many ways.
 In an interview with Prothom Alo, General Zaman highlighted the mutual dependence between the two nations, noting that many Bangladeshis visit India for medical treatment and that a significant amount of goods are imported from India.
He emphasized that the relationship is built on a “give and take” dynamic, where both countries benefit and must maintain fairness and equality in their dealings.
“India is an important neighbour, and we are dependent on India in many ways. But India also benefits from us. Many Indians work here in both formal and informal sectors, and Bangladesh’s stability is crucial to India’s interests. This relationship is one of give and take, and it must be based on fairness,” General Zaman said.
He stressed the importance of ensuring that the people of Bangladesh do not feel dominated by India, calling for relations that respect equality and shared interests.
When asked about ongoing talks between the two nations on unresolved issues, General Zaman affirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to not act against India’s strategic interests and expects the same in return.
He highlighted that stability in areas like the Chittagong Hill Tracts and along the Myanmar border is essential, as is addressing concerns such as border killings and water-sharing. “We must look after each other’s interests with equal importance,” he added.
General Zaman’s remarks came amidst broader diplomatic engagements between India and Bangladesh. Earlier in December, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Dhaka, marking the first high-level visit since Sheikh Hasina was deposed as Prime Minister in August 2024.
Misri expressed India’s desire to work closely with Bangladesh’s Interim Government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, particularly on issues related to the safety and welfare of minorities, including Hindus, in Bangladesh.
During a press conference with Bangladesh’s Foreign Adviser, Md Touhid Hossain, Misri addressed recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties and called for a constructive approach to ensure the safety of all communities.
He reiterated the long-standing people-centric relationship between the two nations, underpinned by cooperation in trade, connectivity, power, and water, among other areas.
The ongoing dialogue between India and Bangladesh continues to focus on fostering stability, mutual respect, and shared growth, reflecting the deep ties that have developed over decades of collaboration.

Title: India’s tobacco exports surge to a record high of Rs 12,005 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:25:26 +0000
Content: India’s tobacco exports have witnessed a surge of 87 percent over the past five years, reaching a record Rs 12,005.89 crore ($1.45 billion) in the 2023-24 fiscal year, compared to Rs 6,408.15 crore in 2019-20. This remarkable growth has resulted in a more than twofold increase in farmers’ income, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Export volumes also saw a substantial increase, rising from 218.84 million kg to 315.51 million kg during the same period, the ministry said.
“As the Tobacco Board celebrates its formation day, we are proud to highlight that the earnings of Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers have more than doubled between 2019-20 and 2023-24—from Rs 124.00 per kg in 2019-20 to Rs 279.54 per kg in 2023-24,” the ministry added.
The surge in international demand for Indian FCV tobacco has been a key factor driving this historic growth. This not only benefited tobacco farmers but also significantly boosted the nation’s foreign exchange earnings through exports.
India is the world’s second-largest producer of tobacco, following China, and ranks as the fourth-largest producer of FCV tobacco globally, behind China, Brazil, and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, India is the second-largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, in terms of quantity, after Brazil.
“The 2023-24 crop season has been especially remarkable for FCV tobacco farmers across Andhra Pradesh,” the statement said.
The Tobacco Board has implemented a series of strategic measures to ensure the growth and sustainability of India’s tobacco industry. These initiatives include crop planning and regulation of production to meet both domestic and export demands.

Title: Researchers find vital link between inflammation and depression
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:22:50 +0000
Content: Researchers have unveiled transformative insights into the relationship between inflammation and depression, which could fundamentally change our understanding of the biological underpinnings of depression.
The research by neuroscientist Professor Raz Yirmiya from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem extends well beyond the confines of the laboratory.
His discoveries about the role of microglia cells and interleukin-1 in stress-induced depression raise intriguing questions about therapeutic interventions: How might understanding inflammatory processes lead to more targeted treatments? What role do different types of immune responses play in various forms of depression?
“Most depressed patients do not have any overt inflammatory disease. However, we and others found that exposure to stress, which is the most significant trigger of depression in humans and animals, also activates inflammatory processes, particularly in the brain,” Yirmiya explained in a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published in the journal Brain Medicine.
Through innovative approaches combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies, Yirmiya’s team identified several promising therapeutic targets.
Their work on microglial checkpoint mechanisms and stress-related resilience opens new avenues for understanding how the immune system influences mental health. These findings suggest the potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.
“My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes,” said Yirmiya.
His work suggests that both activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches.
Yirmiya’s interview, published in Brain Medicine, is part of a larger series highlighting the visionaries behind some of today’s most influential scientific ideas.
Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future,” said the authors.

Title: BGT 2024-25: India heach coach Gautam Gambhir dismisses dressing room leak reports
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 07:19:44 +0000
Content: Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir has dismissed recent reports about dressing room leaks as baseless rumours, saying that they do not reflect the truth.
Addressing the media on Thursday, Gambhir clarified that the alleged incidents, which surfaced online following the Melbourne Test, were exaggerated and did not warrant a response.
Media speculation suggested that Gambhir was unhappy with the players’ performance during the fourth Test against Australia and conveyed his disappointment to the team. India has been struggling in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, particularly in the batting department. Star players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have failed to live up to their reputations, prompting fans to call for both players to reevaluate their roles in the team.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of the Sydney Test, Gambhir highlighted the value of honesty in fostering team growth. “Those are just reports; they are not the truth, and I don’t feel the need to address them,” Gambhir said. “There were some honest words exchanged in the dressing room. Honesty is crucial if we want to achieve something great as a team,” he added.
Australia’s commanding 184-run victory in the Melbourne Test gave them a 2-1 lead in the series and ended India’s hopes of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final at Lord’s next year. The final match of the series will take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, starting January 3, with India aiming to level the series.
The India squad for the Sydney Test is as follows:
Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma (captain), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Sarfaraz Khan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Prasidh Krishna, Shubman Gill, Devdutt Padikkal, Tanush Kotian, Dhruv Jurel, and Harshit Rana.

Title: Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly attacks, Including New Orleans truck incident
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 07:17:32 +0000
Content: The radical Islamic State group, which once imposed a reign of terror over millions of people in Syria and Iraq, has been implicated in the truck attack on a New Orleans crowd, which killed 15 people and injured about 30.
The suspect, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas who once served in Afghanistan, was flying an Islamic State flag during the assault.
U.S. President Joe Biden said that the FBI reported to him that a mere hours before the attack that Jabbar posted videos on social media indicating that he’s inspired by Islamic State.
Following are facts about the movement, considered to be more violent and extremist than Al Qaeda.
RECENT OPERATIONS
The Islamic State group on Wednesday claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland a day earlier, the group posted on its Telegram channel.
In its statement, Islamic State said the attack was conducted by 12 militants and two booby-trapped vehicles, adding that it killed around 22 military personnel from the Puntland forces and injured dozens of others.
Though largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago, IS has managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild.
They include an assault on a Russian concert hall in March 2024, that killed at least 143 people and two explosions in the Iranian city of Kerman in January that killed nearly 100 people.
It also claimed responsibility for an assault by suicide attackers on a mosque in Oman last year that killed at least nine people.
Aside from its bloody operations in the Middle East, Islamic State also inspired lone wolf attacks in the West.
In August of 2024, authorities said a 19-year-old Austrian suspected of masterminding a planned attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had vowed allegiance to the leader of Islamic State.
HISTORY
At the height of its power from 2014-2017, the IS “caliphate” held sway over a wide area of Syria and Iraq, imposing death and torture on opponents of its radical brand of Islam. Its fighters repeatedly defeated both countries’ armies and carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.
Its then leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killed in 2019 by U.S. special forces in northwestern Syria, rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself “caliph” of all Muslims.
The caliphate collapsed in Iraq, where it once had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and in Syria, after a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition.
The new leader, known by a pseudonym Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, remains shrouded in secrecy.
NEW TACTICS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
IS has switched tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.
Once based in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, from which it sought to rule like a centralised government, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.
Its fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, its leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The U.N. estimates it at 10,000 in its heartlands.
The movement went underground with sleeper cells that launch hit-and-run attacks, according to an Iraqi government security adviser who helps track IS.
All key foreign fighters fled Iraq for countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan. Most have joined Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.
It is active along Iran’s borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Sanaullah Ghafari, the 29-year-old leader of the Afghan branch of IS, has overseen its transformation into one of the most fearsome branches of the global Islamist network, capable of operations far from its bases in the borderlands of Afghanistan.
AFRICA
Islamic State – often called ISIS, ISIL, or the pejorative Daesh – has also made its mark in parts of Africa.
In Uganda, militants from IS-connected rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), staged a series of attacks including a massacre at a boarding school, the murder of a honeymooning couple and a raid on a village that killed at least three people.
The group, which started as an uprising in Uganda, has largely moved its operations to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where it has staged multiple attacks.
Several other groups have pledged allegiance to IS in West Africa and across the Sahel. Affiliates have control of large areas of rural Mali, Niger and northern Burkina Faso and into North Africa.
In January 2023, the U.S. military carried out an operation that killed a senior IS leader in northern Somalia. The U.N. fears militant groups could exploit the political instability in Sudan, which is gripped by a civil war.
OVERALL STRENGTH
The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center has said the threat posed by IS and another militant group al Qaeda “is at a low point with the suppression of the most dangerous elements”.
But it went on to warn that half of IS’s branches are now active in insurgencies across Africa and “may be poised for further expansion”.
It said the group had lost three overall leaders and at least 13 other senior operatives in Iraq and Syria since early 2022 “contributing to a loss of expertise and a decline in ISIS attacks in the Middle East”.

Title: Bangladesh: Court rejects bail plea of spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:59:41 +0000
Content: A court in Chattogram has denied bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das, the former ISKCON leader, after a hearing today marked by heightened security, The Daily Star reported.
Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Saiful Islam turned down the bail request following a 30-minute hearing of both parties’ arguments, according to Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Advocate Mofizur Haque Bhuiyan.
Earlier, 11 Supreme Court lawyers had arrived to participate in the bail hearing for Chinmoy Krishna Das. Lawyer Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee confirmed the group’s participation, stating, “We have come to Chattogram under the banner of Ainjibi Oikya Parishad, and we will move for Chinmoy in the court for his bail. I already got the Vakalatnama from Chinmoy.
As a member of both the Supreme Court and Chattogram Bar associations, I do not need authorization from any local lawyer to move the case.”
On December 3, 2024, the Chattogram court had set January 2 for the bail hearing after the prosecution requested additional time and there were no lawyers present to represent Chinmoy.
The controversy stems from the sedition charges filed against Chinmoy Krishna Das, who allegedly raised a saffron flag above Bangladesh’s national flag in Chittagong on October 25.
His subsequent arrest on November 25 sparked widespread protests, which led to violent clashes between his supporters and law enforcement outside the Chattogram Court Building on November 27, resulting in the death of a lawyer.
The situation escalated after additional arrests, including two monks—Adipurush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das Brahmachari—who were detained on November 29 after visiting Chinmoy Krishna Das in custody. ISKCON’s Vice President, Radha Raman, also reported that rioters vandalized an ISKCON center in Bangladesh during the unrest.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has expressed concern over the increasing violence and extremist rhetoric in Bangladesh, highlighting its ongoing efforts to raise the issue of targeted attacks on minorities with the government in Dhaka.

Title: Loan against gold on the rise; RBI flags concerns over irregular practices in gold lending
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:57:37 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported a sharp surge in gold loans across the country, reflecting an increasing dependence on gold as collateral to meet financial needs. According to the RBI’s report, gold loans saw significant growth in the period ending September 2024 compared to the same period a year earlier.
“Gold loans have clocked rapid growth in the period ending September 2024 as compared to a year ago,” the RBI said, underscoring the growing popularity of this financial instrument.
However, the central bank also raised concerns over irregular practices observed among certain supervised entities (SEs) involved in gold lending. To address these issues, the RBI issued comprehensive guidelines on September 30, 2024, directing SEs to review their policies, processes, and practices.
The report identified several gaps, including deficiencies in outsourcing practices, discrepancies in gold valuation, inadequate due diligence, and insufficient monitoring of the end use of loan funds. These measures aim to ensure that the rapid growth in gold loan portfolios remains sustainable and free from malpractice.
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) continue to dominate the gold loan segment, holding a substantial 59.9% share of total gold loans disbursed by both banks and NBFCs as of March 2024. This underscores their critical role in catering to borrowers who rely on gold jewelry and ornaments for securing loans.
“NBFCs maintained their dominance in loans against the pledge of gold ornaments and jewelry, with a share of 59.9% of total gold loans (banks and NBFCs together) at end-March 2024,” the RBI highlighted in its report.
In contrast, the report noted a slowdown in credit growth in other retail lending categories. Growth in unsecured personal loans has slowed significantly since September 2023, while microfinance and self-help group (SHG) loans saw their growth rates drop by over two-thirds in the past year.

Title: PM Modi praises Maharashtra’s efforts in developing Maoist affected areas
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 05:47:12 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday praised the Maharashtra government for its initiatives in driving development in Maoist-affected areas of the state.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister wrote, “I laud the Maharashtra Government’s efforts to ensure all-round development in remote and Maoist-affected areas. This will certainly boost the ‘Ease of Living’ and pave the way for even more progress. A special congratulations to my sisters and brothers of Gadchiroli and the surrounding areas!”
The statement comes after 11 Maoists, including a senior leader, surrendered on Wednesday in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who spent New Year’s Day in Gadchiroli district.
Among the surrendered Maoists were eight women and three men, including two couples. They carried rewards amounting to over Rs 1 crore in Maharashtra, with additional bounties from the Chhattisgarh government.
The group included Tarakka, the head of the Dandakaranya Zonal Committee and the wife of Bhupati, a prominent Maoist leader. Tarakka had been part of the Naxalite movement for 34 years.
The surrendered individuals also included three division committee members, one deputy commander, and two area committee members. They were provided financial assistance totalling Rs 86 lakh to support their rehabilitation.
In the last year, 24 Maoists have been killed and 18 arrested in Maharashtra. Over the past six months, 27 hardcore Maoists have joined the mainstream. CM Fadnavis highlighted that the northern part of Gadchiroli has been freed from Maoism, and efforts are ongoing to eliminate it from the southern region as well.
“In the last four years, not a single youth has joined the Maoist movement. As many as 11 villages have banned Naxalites, and the C-60 soldiers have earned the trust of the people,” said Fadnavis, stressing that residents now believe in achieving justice through the Indian Constitution rather than Maoist ideology.
CM Fadnavis announced that Gadchiroli is on the path to becoming a “Steel City” with support from PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. He assured that surrendered Maoists would be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.
The chief minister inaugurated various development projects during his visit, including a bus service from Aheri to Gardewada, a green mining project, and several initiatives by Lloyds Metals. These projects involve significant investments — Rs 400 crore worth DII Plant at Konsari will provide 700 jobs; Rs 3,000 crore worth Pellet Plant and Slurry Pipeline will provide 1,000 jobs; Rs 2,700 crore Iron Ore Grinding Plant at Hedri, Etapalli will provide 1,500 jobs; and Rs 20 crore Vanya Garment Unit which will provide 600 jobs.
Fadnavis also launched the Lloyds Kali Ammal Hospital and Lloyds Raj Vidyaniketan CBSE School, which will educate 1,200 students. He inaugurated residences for police, a gymkhana, and a kindergarten.

Karachi, another major city in Pakistan, ranks 13th on the list, with an AQI of 164, categorizing it as “Unhealthy.”
The dire air quality poses significant public health risks for the residents of both cities, with Lahore, home to over 11 million people, bearing the brunt of the crisis. Factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning have long contributed to Lahore’s poor air quality, intensifying during winter when smog envelops the region.
The health impact has been severe. In the past month alone, nearly 1.9 million people in Lahore have fallen ill due to smog-related issues, with over 129,000 seeking hospital treatment for respiratory ailments. Additionally, more than six million people have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions linked to air pollution, while an average of 69,000 individuals report daily symptoms such as chest pain, strokes, and other respiratory problems.
Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, faces similar challenges. Its busy port, heavy traffic, and sprawling industrial zones contribute significantly to its deteriorating air quality.

Through centers at the Consulate and Al Awir, the mission extended comprehensive support to over 15,000 Indian citizens seeking to regularize their visa status in the UAE.
During the four-month program, the Consulate issued 2,117 passports and 3,589 emergency certificates, while facilitating more than 3,700 exit permits. Conducted in collaboration with Indian diaspora organizations, the initiative also enabled numerous individuals to obtain fee and penalty waivers from UAE authorities.
The emergency certificates, also known as outpasses, served as one-time travel documents for individuals lacking valid passports. Short-validity passports were issued to those intending to continue their legal stay in the UAE. The Consulate’s services also encompassed lost passport reporting, labor cancellations, and immigration-related matters, with significant support from community organizations.
As the program concluded, the Consulate expressed gratitude to the UAE government for its cooperation and urged Indian citizens to adhere to local regulations concerning entry, work, and residency. The mission reaffirmed its commitment to serving the Indian community in the UAE.

Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 05:16:21 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) has concluded 2024 on a high note, with the PM Vishwakarma Scheme emerging as a standout initiative.
Besides, several other schemes have also been launched by the MSME Ministry in the year 2024.
Launched in 2023, the scheme has significantly empowered artisans and craftspeople across 18 traditional trades. In 2024 alone, 24.77 lakh artisans registered under the scheme, receiving crucial support in skill development, credit, and market access.
This and other initiatives by the MSME Ministry have contributed to the sector’s vibrant growth, fostering entrepreneurship and employment across India.
A total of ₹2,197.72 crore was disbursed as collateral-free loans, giving a substantial boost to artisans in expanding their businesses. A national event on 20th September 2024 in Wardha, Maharashtra, commemorated the scheme’s success.
Boosting MSME Formalization: The government’s focus on formalizing enterprises has been instrumental in giving MSMEs a formal identity and easing the process of doing business. By the end of December 2024, 5.70 crore MSMEs had registered on the Udyam platform, creating employment for over 24.14 crore people.
Enhanced Credit Support: The revamped Credit Guarantee Scheme has seen 19.90 lakh guarantees amounting to ₹2.44 lakh crore approved in 2024.
The scheme particularly benefits women entrepreneurs, with guarantee coverage increased to 90% for women-owned enterprises.
MSME-TEAM Initiative: Launched in June 2024, this initiative has digitally empowered 5 lakh MSMEs, half of which are owned by women entrepreneurs. It helps micro and small enterprises enter the e-commerce space by offering services like catalog preparation, account management, logistics, and packaging.
Yashasvini Campaign: Focused on gender parity, the Yashasvini Campaign was launched to formalize, mentor, and enhance the capacity of women entrepreneurs. Collaborating with NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Rural Development, the campaign has made significant strides towards empowering women.
International Collaboration: In 2024, the Ministry of MSME signed several significant Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with countries like the U.S. and Egypt, promoting bilateral cooperation and boosting the MSME sector through knowledge sharing and technology adoption.
Khadi and Village Industries: The Khadi and Village Industries sector has seen a dramatic rise in sales, from ₹33,135.90 crore in 2014-15 to ₹1,55,673.13 crore in 2023-24, driving socio-economic development in rural India.
These achievements underscore the Ministry’s efforts in making MSMEs a dynamic sector that plays a crucial role in India’s economic growth.
With continuous support for skill development, technological adoption, and innovation, the MSME sector is set to reach new heights in the coming years.

Title: Suicide rate drops by 40% in CISF, falls below national average for first time in 5 years
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:55:30 +0000
Content: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has made significant progress in reducing its suicide rate among its personnel, achieving a 40% drop in 2024. The rate decreased to 9.87 suicides per lakh, compared to 16.98 per lakh in 2023.
This marks the first time in five years that the CISF personnel’s suicide rate has fallen below the national average of 12.4 per lakh, which was recorded in 2022.
The CISF, one of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is tasked with securing critical infrastructure across India, including airports, nuclear installations, power plants, space establishments, and the Delhi Metro.
In 2024, the CISF reported 15 suicide cases, a sharp decrease from 25 in 2023 and 26 in 2022. This decline reflects the effectiveness of the mental health initiatives and stress management programs the CISF has implemented for its personnel.
These initiatives include an online grievance portal, a mental health study in partnership with AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), and a new posting policy aimed at reducing stress.
The CISF has emphasised that the improvement is part of its ongoing commitment to addressing the mental health challenges within its ranks, with a focus on the well-being of its personnel.
Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai, in a response to Parliament, revealed that across various CAPFs, the total number of suicides in the past five years was 730, with the number fluctuating between 134 and 157 suicides each year.
The study conducted in collaboration with AIIMS identified several factors contributing to suicides, including poor emotional support, marital issues, financial problems, and the isolation caused by modern family structures and communication technology.

Title: Maldives foreign minister arrives in India for bilateral discussions
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:54:11 +0000
Content: Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel is set to arrive in New Delhi on Thursday evening for a three-day visit to India. During his trip, Khaleel will meet with External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Friday at Hyderabad House to discuss key areas of bilateral cooperation.
Appointed as the Maldives’ Foreign Minister on September 30, 2024, by President Mohamed Muizzu, Khaleel previously served as the Minister of Health. He has consistently recognized India’s “significant contribution” to the Maldives’ recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a point he reiterated during past engagements.
This visit follows the landmark five-day state visit by President Muizzu to India in October 2024, during which Khaleel accompanied him. That trip, marked by insightful discussions and milestones in India-Maldives relations, set the stage for further collaboration. Both nations adopted a “Vision for Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership,” guiding their relationship across various sectors.
During President Muizzu’s visit, he met with President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other senior officials. Discussions covered the strengthening of the development partnership, financial assistance, and avenues for deeper collaboration. Muizzu expressed gratitude for India’s financial support, including a one-year interest-free extension of T-bills and a currency swap agreement amounting to $400 million.
In business forums held in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, Muizzu highlighted investment opportunities in the Maldives. These included special economic zones, luxury private islands, eco-friendly resorts, and integrated tourism projects, all part of the Maldives’ vision for sustainable growth and economic diversification.
As Khaleel meets EAM Jaishankar, discussions are expected to focus on progress across areas such as social housing, infrastructure, agriculture, trade, investment, healthcare, renewable energy, maritime security, women’s empowerment, and human resource development.

Title: Govt unveils Rs 1 lakh crore plan to transform Delhi’s infrastructure, reduce pollution: Gadkari
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:50:59 +0000
Content: The Union government is set to implement infrastructure projects worth Rs 1 lakh crore to transform Delhi, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari announced on Thursday.
Gadkari said, “I promise you that works worth Rs 1 lakh crore will be completed in the coming two years, which will change the face of entire Delhi. Under the Namami Gange scheme, we have launched initiatives to clean the Yamuna River and prevent sewage water from entering it. However, due to the Delhi government not providing their share of funds for the projects, some works remain pending.”
Gadkari highlighted that the Ministry of Road Transport is currently working on projects valued at Rs 65,000 crore, with Rs 33,000 crore worth of work already completed. He assured that the remaining Rs 32,000 crore worth of projects would be completed in the near future.
“Delhi is heavily burdened by air pollution and traffic congestion. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Road Transport has undertaken multiple projects to address these issues and decongest the city,” he added.
The Union Minister emphasized the government’s commitment to reducing pollution in the capital. “Our government has introduced electric buses, cars, and scooters to tackle the 40 percent of Delhi’s pollution caused by fossil fuels. We also promoted CNG vehicles, and we aim to free Delhi from pollution within five years,” Gadkari said.
Addressing the issue of stubble burning, Gadkari added that it has reduced by 20 percent, attributing this decline to efforts in converting stubble into compressed natural gas (CNG). He revealed that 60 plants are now operational out of the 400 planned for processing stubble into energy resources.
“These plants will convert waste into wealth, producing CNG to power trucks and buses. Additionally, we have launched a project in Panipat to produce 1 lakh liters of ethanol, 150 tonnes of bio-vitamin, and 78,000 tonnes of aviation fuel from stubble. This initiative will not only help reduce pollution but also lower imports, create jobs, and enhance the welfare of farmers,” Gadkari said.

Title: Indian economy in robust spot globally in 2025 with high frequency indicators picking up growth
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:42:28 +0000
Content: As 2025 begins amidst heightened global uncertainties, India continues to be in a much stronger position with high-frequency indicators showing a pick-up in the pace of growth in the third quarter of the current fiscal (Q3 FY25), according to a report on Thursday.
GST collections, services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), air passenger growth, and vehicle registrations saw a notable improvement in Q3 versus Q2, according to a Bank of Baroda (BoB) report.
On the other hand, in China, while the manufacturing sector is expanding slowly, lifting domestic consumption and reviving the real estate sector is proving to be a task for the administration.
The US economy is giving mixed signals regarding growth. While the labour market appears to be softening and manufacturing activity is weak, retail sales, pending home sales, and the service sector seem to be doing well. In Europe, manufacturing activity is unable to pick up pace so far, while the service sector is regaining ground.
In India, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25 from 1.3 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY24.
“While the trade deficit was higher, buoyant services exports as well as continued strength in remittances underscored the lower CAD. Our year-end market analysis shows that both Sensex and Nifty 50 surged by 8.7 per cent and 9 per cent in CY24. Sensex touched an all-time high this year as it breached the mark of 85,500,” said Sonal Badhan, economist, Bank of Baroda.
Sectors including real estate, consumer durables, and IT were amongst the best-performing stocks in CY24. The Indian rupee depreciated by 2.8 per cent in 2024, but remained one of the better-performing currencies among its peers.
The pressure on yields was lower and boosted demand flow as the market witnessed the bond inclusion in the JP Morgan emerging market index, Bloomberg, and FTSE Russel.
According to the report, high-frequency indicators have shown notable improvement in the October-December 2024 period. GST collections have jumped by 8.3 per cent (YoY) in Q3 to Rs 5.5 lakh crore, and are also up from Rs 5.3 lakh crore in Q2, signalling further improvement in consumption patterns.
Apart from this, helped by festive demand, other indicators of urban consumption have also improved. Air passenger air traffic registered 11.6 per cent growth in Q3, compared with 7.8 per cent growth registered in Q2. Services PMI averaged 59.2 in Q3 versus 58.1 in the same period last year.
“We expect quarterly corporate results to also show improved performance in Q3,” said Badhan.
On the central bank actions, the report said growth is expected to recover in H2 FY25 and inflation abating, “we see a scope of 25 bps rate cut in February 2025. We expect a cumulative easing of 50-75bps in the current cycle.”
Furthermore, with the expectation of a pick-up in government spending followed by improvement in both government and private investment in H2, the IIP growth will perform a lot better in H2 FY25 from H1 FY25, it added.

Title: In Norway, nearly all new cars sold in 2024 were fully electric
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:20:17 +0000
Content: Nine out of ten new cars sold in Norway last year were powered by battery only, registration data showed on Thursday, placing the country within reach of its target of only adding cars that are electric on the road by 2025.
Fully electric vehicles accounted for 88.9% of new cars sold in 2024, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed. Top-selling brands were Tesla, followed by Volkswagen and Toyota.
“Norway will be the first country in the world to pretty much erase petrol and diesel engine cars from the new car market,” said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian EV association.

CARROT AND STICK APPROACH
Oil-producing Norway penalises petrol and diesel cars with high taxes, while exempting EVs from import and value-added taxes to make them more attractive, although some levies were reintroduced in 2023.
The policy has worked because it has been consistent over time, maintained by governments of various political persuasion, experts said.
“Very often we see in other countries that someone puts tax incentives or exemptions and then they pull back again,” Bu said.
Also helpful is the fact that Norway does not have an automaker lobby.
“We are not a car-producing country … so taxing cars highly in the past was simple,” said Ulf Tore Hekneby, head of Norway’s biggest car importer, Harald A. Moeller.
Having incentives, rather than banning petrol and diesel cars, was crucial too, said Bu. “That would (have) made people angry. People don’t like being told what to do,” she said.
The European Union has decided to ban sales of carbon-dioxide-emitting cars by 2035, but it may allow sales of cars that run on fuels made from captured CO2.

Norway’s policies mean that fully electric cars last year overtook pure petrol cars on Norwegian roads. They accounted for more than 28% of all cars driven in the Nordic country as of December, according to Public Road Administration data.
“That’s the big lesson: put together a broad package (of incentives) and make it predictable for (the) long-term,” said deputy transport minister Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.

IMPACT
To be sure, while nearly all new buyers of cars in Norway have gone electric, some hold-outs remain.
“The main buyers of ICE (internal combustion engine) cars in Norway are rental companies because many tourists are not familiar with EVs,” said Hekneby.
Still, the rising share of EVs on Norwegian roads means other sectors have to adapt. At fuel stations, more and more petrol pumps are replaced with fast electric chargers.
“Within the next three years we will have at least as many charging stalls as we have pumps for fuel,” said Anders Kleve Svela, a senior manager at Circle K, Norway’s largest fuel retailer.
“In just a couple of years more than 50% of all the cars in Norway will be electric … We have to ramp up our charging park according to that,” he added.
For drivers, switching to an EV means it can take a little longer to charge a car in winter due to the cold weather.
“Sometimes I miss that I just can pump it full and drive off five minutes later,” said Desire Andresen, 28, an in-home caregiver, charging her car at a Circle K station outside Oslo.
“But I’m more comfortable with an electric car … It’s better for the environment and the diesel cars produce so much smell.”

Title: Murlikant Petkar to receive Arjuna award for lifetime achievement, 52 years after winning India’s first Paralympic gold
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:01:42 +0000
Content: The sports ministry on Thursday announced that Murlikant Rajaram Petkar, India’s first Paralympic gold medalist, will receive the Arjuna Award (Lifetime) 52 years after his achievement.
A soldier in the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) of the Indian Army, Petkar suffered a debilitating injury that left him paraplegic. Despite this, he won the gold medal in the men’s 50m freestyle swimming event at the 1972 Paralympic Games in Heidelberg, becoming the first Indian to secure an individual gold medal at the Olympics or Paralympics.
Petkar, who sustained severe injuries during an attack on an army camp in Srinagar during the 1965 war with Pakistan, set three world records while clinching the gold medal. However, he went unrecognized with the Arjuna Award for nearly half a century, as para-sports were not widely acknowledged in those times.
Now, the 80-year-old Petkar will receive the award from President Droupadi Murmu at a specially organized ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 17, 2025. He was previously honored with the Padma Shri in 2018.
The legendary para-swimmer’s achievements remained underappreciated for decades due to the lack of recognition for para-sports from the public and government. Despite minimal facilities and support, Petkar persevered to achieve historic success.
An all-rounder in sports, Petkar competed in multiple disciplines before excelling in para-swimming. He was an aspiring boxer and had won a gold medal in boxing at the Military Games in Japan shortly before his injury.
Petkar represented India at the 1968 and 1972 Paralympic Games. In the 1968 Games in Mexico, he participated in para-table tennis, reaching the second round. In 1972, alongside swimming, he also competed in javelin throw, precision javelin throw, and slalom, reaching the finals in all three events.
After retiring from TELCO, Petkar now leads a quiet life in Pune, where his son, Arjun Murlikant Petkar, is employed in the Army.

She claimed bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event and teamed up with Sarabjot Singh to secure another bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event, marking India’s maiden shooting team medal at the Olympics.
Gukesh Dommaraju was a standout performer in Indian sports in 2024. In December, he defeated China’s Ding Liren in the decisive 14th game of the FIDE World Chess Championship in Singapore. Gukesh’s victory, with a final score of 7.5-6.5, not only crowned him the youngest world chess champion at 18 but also made him the second Indian to achieve this feat after Viswanathan Anand.
Para-athlete Praveen Kumar captured gold in the Men’s High Jump T64 event at the 2024 Paralympics. Meanwhile, Harmanpreet Singh led the Indian men’s hockey team to a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics. Having previously been part of the bronze-winning team at the Tokyo Olympics, Harmanpreet is also nominated for the FIH Player of the Year award.
The Arjuna Award, which recognizes exceptional contributions to sports, was awarded to several athletes. Honorees included Indian men’s hockey players Jarmanpreet Singh, Sanjay, Abhishek, and Sukhjeet Singh, as well as women’s hockey team captain Salima Tete. Chess grandmaster Vantika Agrawal and sprinter Jyothi Yarraji were also recognized.
A host of para-athletes were celebrated with Arjuna Awards for their accomplishments, including Preeti Pal, Jeevanji Deepthi, Ajeet Singh, Sachin Sarjerao Khilari, Dharambir, Pranav Soorma, Hokato Sema, Simran, and Navdeep. Additionally, Olympic medalists Swapnil Suresh Kusale and Sarabjot Singh, along with para-shooters Mona Agarwal and Rubina Francis, were among the awardees.
The Dronacharya Award for lifetime achievement was bestowed upon former Dempo FC and East Bengal head coach Armando Agnelo Colaco for his contributions to Indian football.
The awards will be presented by President Droupadi Murmu in a special ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 17, 2025.

Title: World Introvert Day celebrates the unique strengths of introverts
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 10:27:08 +0000
Content: Introversion is one of humanity’s greatest virtues, allowing individuals to strengthen themselves, cultivate creativity, and nurture personal growth.
World Introvert Day, celebrated annually on January 2, honours this often-underappreciated quality. The day highlights the power of introverts, whose talents often flourish through quiet reflection and meaningful connections with family and friends.
World Introvert Day offers an opportunity to challenge society’s misconceptions about introversion.
While introverts may not always express themselves verbally, their creativity and accomplishments speak volumes. Their ability to remain calm, engage in deep thinking, and tune out distractions helps them excel in various fields, making them diverse and remarkable personalities.
It’s important to distinguish introversion from shyness. Introversion is the preference for solitude, a positive trait that fosters creativity and self-awareness. Shyness, on the other hand, is characterized by anxiety and fear of social situations, often keeping one from engaging with others.
Examples of Famous Introverts 
Many world-renowned figures have achieved greatness, despite or perhaps because of their introverted nature.
Albert Einstein, one of the most eminent scientists in history, attributed his creative genius to the quietness of introversion. He once said, “The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulate the creative mind.” These qualities helped him win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
Sir Isaac Newton, another introverted scientist, developed the laws of motion and gravity. Reserved by nature, Newton played a pivotal role in the Scientific Revolution with his pioneering work in optics.
Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is not only a successful entrepreneur but also a philanthropist. Despite his introverted nature, Gates revolutionized the tech industry during the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1987, he has been consistently featured on Forbes’ billionaire list, but remains a great donor and introspective individual.
Eleanor Roosevelt broke barriers as a leading figure in American politics, diplomacy, and activism. Despite personal struggles, she became a champion for human rights and served as a vital representative at the United Nations.
Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder of Facebook and its parent company Meta, is a giant in both business and philanthropy. Named Time’s Person of the Year in 2010, his life story was immortalized in the award-winning film The Social Network.
Notable Quotes About Introversion 
“Even in strange and unfamiliar situations, your solitude will serve as both a foundation and a place of comfort.” — Rainer Maria Rilke, Austrian poet and novelist
“Don’t misjudge me because of my quietness. I understand more than I express, think more than I speak, and observe more than you realize.” — Michaela Chung, contemporary author and speaker known for her work on introversion
“The true journey of discovery lies not in finding new places, but in seeing with fresh eyes.” — Marcel Proust, French writer
“Not all introverts are shy; some of us simply enjoy the peace of our own company.” — Susan Cain, American author and lecturer
“The more you recognise and celebrate your life, the more reasons you will find to celebrate.” — Oprah Winfrey, talk show host, actress, and philanthropist
History of World Introvert Day 
The origin of World Introvert Day is credited to Felicitas Heyne, a German psychologist and author of the free e-book Happily Introverted Ever After.
In her blog post titled “Here’s Why We Need a World Introvert Day” on her website iPersonic, Heyne highlighted the importance of recognizing the unique strengths of introversion.
She proposed January 2 as the perfect date for this celebration, as introverts often seek a moment of calm after the bustling holiday season that stretches from Christmas to New Year’s Day.

Title: India accounts for 3.9% of global textiles and apparel trade
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 10:25:06 +0000
Content: India has solidified its position as the sixth-largest exporter of textiles and apparel worldwide, holding a 3.9% share in global trade. This sector also makes up 8.21% of India’s total exports, highlighting its crucial role in the global textile supply chain.
During the first half of FY 2024-25, India’s textile and apparel exports reached USD 21,358 million, reflecting a 7% year-on-year growth, according to the Ministry of Textiles. Ready-Made Garments (RMG) led the export categories, contributing 41% with a value of USD 8,733 million. Cotton textiles followed, accounting for 33% (USD 7,082 million), and man-made textiles made up 15% (USD 3,105 million).
The United States and the European Union are key markets for Indian textiles, accounting for around 47% of total exports. Despite global challenges such as geopolitical tensions, including the Red Sea and Bangladesh crises, Indian textile exports rebounded as demand increased in major markets during 2024.
Between April and October 2024, RMG exports grew by 12%, cotton textiles by 1%, and man-made textiles by 5%. On the other hand, exports of wool and handloom products declined by 19% and 6%, respectively. Certain categories saw notable growth, including silk products (up by 40%) and carpets (up by 12%).
India’s textile and apparel imports declined by about 15% in FY 2023-24, dropping from USD 10,481 million in the previous fiscal year to USD 8,946 million. This reduction underscores the country’s growing self-reliance in meeting domestic raw material needs for both local consumption and re-exports.
In the first half of FY 2024-25, imports slightly decreased by 1% to USD 5,425 million compared to the same period last year. Man-made textiles remained the largest import category, making up 34% of total imports with a value of USD 1,859 million, driven by a demand-supply gap in the domestic market. Meanwhile, imports of cotton textiles rose by 13% due to the increasing need for long-staple cotton fibres, signifying growing domestic production and consumption.

Title: After ending terror, we will reclaim what has been lost: HM Amit Shah
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:06:29 +0000
Content: Calling Kashmir an inseparable part of India and its soul, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government has not only eliminated the ecosystem of terrorism from the Kashmir Valley but is determined to reclaim what has been lost, a veiled reference to the territory occupied by Pakistan and the cultural glory of the region.
He was speaking after releasing the book, ‘Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh: Through the Ages – A Visual Narrative of Continuities &amp; Linkages’ that seeks to present the story of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The book by Indian Council of Historical Research has been edited by Raghuvendra Tanwar.
“Kashmir has always been an inseparable part of India, is so today and will remain in future also and we shall soon see Kashmir regain its cultural glory,” said HM Shah.
He recalled a statement of Syama Prasad Mookerjee, “Jammu and Kashmir is not only a part of India but an inseparable part of the country’s soul.”
This book has proven that Kashmir and Ladakh are also an inseparable part of our culture and heritage, he said.
“Article 370, which was an attempt to separate Kashmir from the nation, was also pulled down,” he said.
“In the Constituent Assembly, the majority did not want Article 370 to be a part of the Constitution.
However, it became a part. But there were some people who, when it became a part, felt that it was necessary to write it as a temporary provision,” he said.
“What is artificial, what is not natural or organic, does not have a long-lasting existence. And it was with the strong determination of PM Modi that on August 5, 2019, Article 370 was abrogated. It ended a tainted chapter of our post-Independence history. And from there, a new chapter of Kashmir’s development alongside the rest of India began,” he said.
Highlighting the government’s focus on Kashmir, HM Shah said: “We have not only gained control over terrorism, but we have also succeeded in stopping it. Narendra Modi government has also worked to eliminate the ecosystem of terrorism from the Valley.
“And all of this has happened for this land, which has made a significant contribution to the civilisations of the country and the world. The scholars of Kashmir have enriched our country’s languages, grammar, and various forms of knowledge.”
“In 2024, there have been no incidents of stone-pelting in Jammu and Kashmir. Over 25,000 Panchayat members, Sarpanch, Tehsil Panchayat members, and District Panchayat members won elections and are now running their villages, Tehsils, and districts. Panchayati Raj and democracy have deepened at the grassroots level. The highest voter turnout in the past 33 years was recorded recently,” he said.
Talking about the book, the Home Minister said about 3,000-year-old scriptures were scanned and the editor highlighted the historic reference of Kashmir in the book.
The ruins of temple and the culture reflected in the pictures and the journey of Buddhism from India towards Afghanistan and Western Asia recorded in the book also reconfirm that Kashmir has always been a part of India, he said.
The use of photos of temples damaged by raiders, use of Sanskrit in Kashmir, Dogra dynasty’s progressive rule, Maharaja Ranjit Singh valor, and the mistakes committed after 1947 and their rectification have presented 3,000 years of history of Kashmir in the book, said HM Shah.
“History cannot be limited or recorded by remaining confined between Lutyens’ Delhi to Gymkhana Club or Dariba Kalan to Ballimaran. History must be understood by mixing with people, understanding the culture and language of people,” he said, slamming a phase of 150 years during with historians adopted a very narrow view.
The book attempts to document the story of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh from a perspective and format that enables an overview for both the subject specialist and those less conversant.
It is presented in seven sections that cover over three thousand years of the region’s history.
Each illustration selected for inclusion has been done with care, being representative of an age, its importance and contribution to the larger historical canvas of Indian history.
Published in Hindi and English, this book is the result of collaborative efforts of the National Book Trust, India, and the Indian Council of Historical Research.

Title: Maldives foreign minister embarks 3-day visit to India for bilateral talks
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 15:54:11 +0000
Content: Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a three-day visit aimed at strengthening bilateral relations in key areas, including maritime security, trade, and investment. This visit comes nearly three months after Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu’s state visit to India.
On Friday, Khaleel is set to hold wide-ranging discussions with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. The talks will focus on enhancing the India-Maldives partnership across various domains.
“Working towards India-Maldives joint vision of a ‘Comprehensive Economic & Maritime Security Partnership.’ Warm welcome to FM @abkhaleel of Maldives on his first official visit to India,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on X (formerly Twitter).
Khaleel, who previously served as the Maldives’ Health Minister, has consistently acknowledged India’s pivotal role in supporting the Maldives, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This trip further builds on the rapport established during President Muizzu’s October 2024 visit, where Khaleel was part of the delegation.
President Muizzu’s visit was a landmark event, underscored by his meetings with President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other senior officials. Discussions focused on bolstering the development partnership, expanding financial assistance, and exploring opportunities for deeper collaboration. India’s continued financial support, including a one-year interest-free extension of T-bills and a $400 million currency swap agreement, was met with gratitude from the Maldivian side.
The visit also included business forums in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, where President Muizzu presented investment opportunities in special economic zones, luxury private islands, eco-friendly resorts, and integrated tourism projects. 
Khaleel’s current visit is expected to follow up on those discussions, addressing progress in sectors like social housing, infrastructure, agriculture, trade, healthcare, renewable energy, women’s empowerment, and human resource development. Both nations continue to prioritize their shared vision for a “Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership” as they deepen their ties.

Title: Blinkit introduces quick ambulance service in Gurugram
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 15:33:12 +0000
Content: Blinkit has launched a new initiative to provide ambulance services within 10 minutes, expanding its range of services beyond daily essentials, food, and personal care products. The service began in Gurugram with five ambulances and was announced by Blinkit’s Founder and CEO, Albinder Dhindsa, through a post on X.
The new offering aims to address the challenge of providing reliable ambulance services in urban areas. Users will soon be able to book a Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulance directly through the Blinkit app as the service expands to more cities.
According to Dhindsa, each ambulance is equipped with necessary medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, an automated external defibrillator (AED), a stretcher, a monitor, a suction machine, and emergency medicines. Each ambulance team includes a paramedic, an assistant, and a trained driver to ensure effective service.
Dhindsa clarified that the initiative is not profit-driven. The service will be available at an affordable cost, and the company plans to invest in expanding it to all major cities over the next two years.
The CEO also urged people to prioritize giving way to ambulances on the road. Blinkit’s foray into quick-response ambulance services comes as rapid delivery platforms continue to diversify their offerings in response to changing consumer needs and societal demands.

Title: India’s job creation accelerates with 4.67 crore jobs in 2023-24
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 13:54:35 +0000
Content: The Indian economy added an impressive 4.67 crore jobs in the financial year ending March 2024, and the pace of job creation has continued into 2024-25, with growth observed in both formal and informal sectors, according to official data.
The total estimated employment in India’s Unincorporated Sector recorded a robust growth of 10.01% during the period from October 2023 to September 2024, compared to the previous year, as revealed by the Annual Survey of the Ministry of Statistics, released on Thursday.
The Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) indicates that the “Other Services” sector alone employed more than 12 crore additional workers between October 2023 and September 2024. This marks an increase of over one crore workers from the previous year, highlighting significant labour market growth.
Among the various sectors, the “Other Services” sector showed the highest annual growth at 17.86%, followed by the manufacturing sector at 10.03%.
The unincorporated non-agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in India’s economy, contributing significantly to employment, GDP, and the broader socio-economic framework. This sector sustains the livelihoods of millions and acts as a backbone for the incorporated sector by supplying goods and services, further strengthening its position in the domestic value chain.
In parallel, India’s formal sector, which offers higher-quality jobs, has also sustained its growth momentum during the first half of the current financial year. New enrollments across the three major social security schemes have seen an increase compared to the same period last year, according to figures released in November.
New enrollments in the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) scheme, which is applicable to larger organizations and better-paid employees, rose by 2.3%, reaching 6.1 million in the first half of 2024-25 (April-September), compared to the previous year.
Subscriptions to the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), which covers smaller organizations, saw a faster increase of 5.2%, with 9.3 million new enrollments during the first half of the current financial year. Similarly, enrollments in the National Pension System (NPS) grew by 6.8%, reflecting the growing number of employees joining better job streams.
This overall improvement in job quality has also been noted in the latest monthly economic review by the Finance Ministry.

Title: Sitharaman engages stakeholders in pre-budget consultations for 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 13:50:56 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met key stakeholders from the financial sector and capital markets on Thursday as part of her pre-budget consultations for the Union Budget 2025-26. The meeting was attended by senior officials, including the Finance Secretary, the secretaries of DIPAM, the Department of Economic Affairs, and the Department of Financial Services, as well as the Chief Economic Adviser.
This consultation marked the seventh in her ongoing series of pre-budget meetings. The Finance Ministry organizes these discussions annually, inviting inputs from experts, industry leaders, economists, and state representatives as part of the formal budget preparation process. This year, Sitharaman has already engaged with a diverse range of stakeholders, including representatives from MSMEs, farmers’ associations, and leading economists.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been actively involved in pre-budget deliberations. Last week, he held discussions with eminent economists and thought leaders at NITI Aayog, focusing on shaping the economic roadmap for the Union Budget 2025-26.
The Union Budget for the financial year 2025-26 is scheduled to be tabled on February 1, 2025, and will be Sitharaman’s eighth. Given the current economic backdrop, the upcoming budget is expected to be closely watched for its key announcements and long-term guidance, as the Modi government enters the latter part of its third term.
India’s economic performance has been under scrutiny due to recent weak GDP data and subdued consumption. The economy grew by 5.4% in real terms during the July-September quarter of FY 2024-25, significantly below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast of 7%. The April-June quarter also saw slower-than-expected growth. Consequently, the RBI revised its growth projection for FY 2024-25 from 7.2% to 6.6% during its latest monetary policy review.
The Economic Survey tabled earlier this year projected a cautious GDP growth rate of 6.5-7% for FY 2024-25. The Survey acknowledged the market’s higher expectations but tempered optimism by highlighting inflation-adjusted metrics. However, high-frequency indicators for the October-December quarter signal a gradual recovery, spurred by strong festival-driven activity and improving rural demand, according to the RBI’s recent bulletin.
India’s economic narrative remains robust in the long term. The country registered an impressive 8.2% growth during FY 2023-24, retaining its position as the fastest-growing major economy. This follows growth rates of 7.2% in 2022-23 and 8.7% in 2021-22.

Title: Suicide rate drops by 40% in CISF, falls below national average for first time in 5 years
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:55:30 +0000
Content: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has made significant progress in reducing its suicide rate among its personnel, achieving a 40% drop in 2024. The rate decreased to 9.87 suicides per lakh, compared to 16.98 per lakh in 2023.
This marks the first time in five years that the CISF personnel’s suicide rate has fallen below the national average of 12.4 per lakh, which was recorded in 2022.
The CISF, one of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is tasked with securing critical infrastructure across India, including airports, nuclear installations, power plants, space establishments, and the Delhi Metro.
In 2024, the CISF reported 15 suicide cases, a sharp decrease from 25 in 2023 and 26 in 2022. This decline reflects the effectiveness of the mental health initiatives and stress management programs the CISF has implemented for its personnel.
These initiatives include an online grievance portal, a mental health study in partnership with AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), and a new posting policy aimed at reducing stress.
The CISF has emphasised that the improvement is part of its ongoing commitment to addressing the mental health challenges within its ranks, with a focus on the well-being of its personnel.
Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai, in a response to Parliament, revealed that across various CAPFs, the total number of suicides in the past five years was 730, with the number fluctuating between 134 and 157 suicides each year.
The study conducted in collaboration with AIIMS identified several factors contributing to suicides, including poor emotional support, marital issues, financial problems, and the isolation caused by modern family structures and communication technology.

Title: Govt unveils Rs 1 lakh crore plan to transform Delhi’s infrastructure, reduce pollution: Gadkari
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:50:59 +0000
Content: The Union government is set to implement infrastructure projects worth Rs 1 lakh crore to transform Delhi, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari announced on Thursday.
Gadkari said, “I promise you that works worth Rs 1 lakh crore will be completed in the coming two years, which will change the face of entire Delhi. Under the Namami Gange scheme, we have launched initiatives to clean the Yamuna River and prevent sewage water from entering it. However, due to the Delhi government not providing their share of funds for the projects, some works remain pending.”
Gadkari highlighted that the Ministry of Road Transport is currently working on projects valued at Rs 65,000 crore, with Rs 33,000 crore worth of work already completed. He assured that the remaining Rs 32,000 crore worth of projects would be completed in the near future.
“Delhi is heavily burdened by air pollution and traffic congestion. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Road Transport has undertaken multiple projects to address these issues and decongest the city,” he added.
The Union Minister emphasized the government’s commitment to reducing pollution in the capital. “Our government has introduced electric buses, cars, and scooters to tackle the 40 percent of Delhi’s pollution caused by fossil fuels. We also promoted CNG vehicles, and we aim to free Delhi from pollution within five years,” Gadkari said.
Addressing the issue of stubble burning, Gadkari added that it has reduced by 20 percent, attributing this decline to efforts in converting stubble into compressed natural gas (CNG). He revealed that 60 plants are now operational out of the 400 planned for processing stubble into energy resources.
“These plants will convert waste into wealth, producing CNG to power trucks and buses. Additionally, we have launched a project in Panipat to produce 1 lakh liters of ethanol, 150 tonnes of bio-vitamin, and 78,000 tonnes of aviation fuel from stubble. This initiative will not only help reduce pollution but also lower imports, create jobs, and enhance the welfare of farmers,” Gadkari said.

Title: Indian economy in robust spot globally in 2025 with high frequency indicators picking up growth
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:42:28 +0000
Content: As 2025 begins amidst heightened global uncertainties, India continues to be in a much stronger position with high-frequency indicators showing a pick-up in the pace of growth in the third quarter of the current fiscal (Q3 FY25), according to a report on Thursday.
GST collections, services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), air passenger growth, and vehicle registrations saw a notable improvement in Q3 versus Q2, according to a Bank of Baroda (BoB) report.
On the other hand, in China, while the manufacturing sector is expanding slowly, lifting domestic consumption and reviving the real estate sector is proving to be a task for the administration.
The US economy is giving mixed signals regarding growth. While the labour market appears to be softening and manufacturing activity is weak, retail sales, pending home sales, and the service sector seem to be doing well. In Europe, manufacturing activity is unable to pick up pace so far, while the service sector is regaining ground.
In India, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25 from 1.3 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY24.
“While the trade deficit was higher, buoyant services exports as well as continued strength in remittances underscored the lower CAD. Our year-end market analysis shows that both Sensex and Nifty 50 surged by 8.7 per cent and 9 per cent in CY24. Sensex touched an all-time high this year as it breached the mark of 85,500,” said Sonal Badhan, economist, Bank of Baroda.
Sectors including real estate, consumer durables, and IT were amongst the best-performing stocks in CY24. The Indian rupee depreciated by 2.8 per cent in 2024, but remained one of the better-performing currencies among its peers.
The pressure on yields was lower and boosted demand flow as the market witnessed the bond inclusion in the JP Morgan emerging market index, Bloomberg, and FTSE Russel.
According to the report, high-frequency indicators have shown notable improvement in the October-December 2024 period. GST collections have jumped by 8.3 per cent (YoY) in Q3 to Rs 5.5 lakh crore, and are also up from Rs 5.3 lakh crore in Q2, signalling further improvement in consumption patterns.
Apart from this, helped by festive demand, other indicators of urban consumption have also improved. Air passenger air traffic registered 11.6 per cent growth in Q3, compared with 7.8 per cent growth registered in Q2. Services PMI averaged 59.2 in Q3 versus 58.1 in the same period last year.
“We expect quarterly corporate results to also show improved performance in Q3,” said Badhan.
On the central bank actions, the report said growth is expected to recover in H2 FY25 and inflation abating, “we see a scope of 25 bps rate cut in February 2025. We expect a cumulative easing of 50-75bps in the current cycle.”
Furthermore, with the expectation of a pick-up in government spending followed by improvement in both government and private investment in H2, the IIP growth will perform a lot better in H2 FY25 from H1 FY25, it added.

Title: German, French foreign ministers to meet Syria’s new rulers in Damascus
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 07:31:06 +0000
Content: German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is travelling to Syria for a one-day trip with her French counterpart on behalf of the EU, where she will meet Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of Syria’s new rulers, the German foreign ministry said on Friday.
“My trip today – together with my French counterpart and on behalf of the EU – is a clear signal to the Syrians: A new political beginning between Europe and Syria, between Germany and Syria, is possible,” Baerbock said, according to a ministry statement issued before she left for Damascus.
Baerbock and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot are the first top diplomats from the European Union to visit Syria since rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family’s decades-long rule.
“In Syria, we want to promote a peaceful and demanding transition in the service of the Syrians and for regional stability,” Barrot said on social media platform X.
Since ousting Assad, Islamist rebels led by Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have sought to reassure Arab countries and the international community that they will govern on behalf of all Syrians and not export Islamist revolution.
Western governments have begun to gradually open channels with Sharaa and HTS, a Sunni Muslim group previously affiliated with Al Qaeda, and are starting to debate whether to remove the group’s terrorist designation.
Baerbock said she was travelling to Syria with an “outstretched hand” as well as “clear expectations” of the new rulers, who she said would be judged by their actions.
“We know where the HTS comes from ideologically, what it has done in the past,” said Baerbock.
“But we also hear and see the desire for moderation and for understanding with other important actors,” she added, citing talks with U.S.-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
The goal now is for Syria to once again become a respected member of the international community, she added.

Title: Oman resumes copper exports after three-decade pause with historic shipment from Lasail mine
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 06:48:11 +0000
Content: In a major development for Oman’s mining sector, the sultanate has recommenced copper exports after a 30-year break with its first shipment of 900 tonnes of copper concentrates from the Lasail mine in Sohar.
The project, overseen by Minerals Development Oman marks a crucial step in the nation’s economic diversification efforts.
The milestone carries particular historical weight, as the region boasts a 3,000-year legacy of copper mining, including operations by the Oman Mining Company since 1983.
The Lasail mine is projected to produce high-grade copper concentrates with 18% to 22% purity levels, with an estimated annual production capacity of 500,000 tonnes of copper ore.
This operation represents just the beginning of MDO’s broader vision for copper mining in the region. Looking ahead, MDO plans to expand operations with the launch of the Al-Baydha mine in Liwa by 2025-2026.
The two mines combined hold reserves of approximately 2.78 million tons of copper ore, with the initial redevelopment phase expected to last four to five years.
The company is also conducting exploratory studies in surrounding areas to increase copper reserves and is developing the Mazoon project, which is set to become Oman’s largest integrated copper concentrate production initiative.

Title: Heart attacks and heart failure surge in winter, warns Dr. Tarun Sahni
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 06:09:50 +0000
Content: With the onset of winter, cases of heart attacks and heart failure are on the rise, warns Dr. Tarun Sahni, a general physician and internal medicine specialist at Apollo Hospital in Delhi.
Dr. Sahni explained that cold temperatures cause blood vessels in the extremities to contract, leading to increased blood pressure. This heightened pressure strains the heart and can also affect vulnerable areas of the brain, increasing the risk of strokes.
“In winter, the blood vessels in the periphery contract due to the cold, causing blood pressure to rise,” said Dr. Sahni. “This elevated pressure can damage vulnerable areas in the brain, leading to strokes. Similarly, the heart has to pump harder through the narrowed vessels, increasing the risk of heart attacks and heart failure.”
He also advised individuals with lung conditions to exercise caution when going outdoors, recommending daytime activities when sunlight is present, and pollution levels are relatively lower. Dr. Sahni emphasized the importance of minimizing exposure to both cold and pollution, especially for those with pre-existing health issues.
“We advise patients with lung diseases to step out during the day when the sun is out and pollution levels are lower. Exercise and precautions should be taken to avoid cold exposure and pollution,” he said.

Title: Worked assiduously to secure release of Indian fishermen from Bangladesh: MEA
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:30:14 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday said that the Indian government has “worked assiduously” to secure the release of Indian fishermen detained by Bangladesh for crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line.
On Thursday, 95 Indian fishermen were handed over by Bangladesh authorities to the Bangladesh Coast Guard for repatriation to India.
In a gesture of reciprocity, India was also expected to release 90 Bangladeshi fishermen on the same day.
“In recent months, several Indian fishermen have been arrested by Bangladesh authorities when they happened to inadvertently cross the International Maritime Boundary Line and entered Bangladesh waters. Several Bangladesh fishermen have also been apprehended by Indian authorities in similar circumstances,” read a statement issued by the MEA.
“The Government of India attaches the highest importance to the safety, security and welfare of Indian fishermen. To this end, it has worked assiduously to secure the release of our fishermen from Bangladesh custody. The mutual exchange of fishermen and their vessels has been worked out keeping in mind the primarily humanitarian and livelihood concerns of fishing communities on both sides,” the statement added.
According to the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, all 95 Indian fishermen and crew members were held in Bagerhat and Patuakhali district jails.
The entire process is expected to be completed on January 5 following the Bangladesh Coast Guard’s handing over of Indian fishermen and crew members to the Indian Coast Guard and receiving Bangladeshi fishermen and crew members.
“This repatriation process is being facilitated through the joint efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Bangladesh Coast Guard, Bangladesh Police, local administration, and other relevant agencies. After the handing over on 05 January 2025 at the International Maritime Border, the Bangladeshi fishermen/crew, along with their fishing vessels, are expected to return to Chattogram in the afternoon of 06 January 2025,” a statement issued by the Bangladesh MFA mentioned.
Bangladeshi authorities had detained a total of 95 Indian fishermen and six fishing boats during October and November 2024.

Title: India struggle after early losses in fifth test against Australia at SCG
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:23:43 +0000
Content: India’s batting woes persisted after skipper Rohit Sharma was dropped, as they were bowled out for a modest 185 runs on Friday at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In reply, Australia was 9 for 1 at stumps, with new Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah dismissing Usman Khawaja on the last ball of the day.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant top-scored for India with 40, followed by Ravindra Jadeja’s 26 and captain Bumrah’s brisk 22 off 16 balls, which included three boundaries and a six.
India’s openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell cheaply, and Rohit’s batting replacement, Shubman Gill, was dismissed before lunch. Virat Kohli, who scored 17, was the only middle-order player to offer some resistance before being caught after the break.
For Australia, Scott Boland was the pick of the bowlers, taking 4 wickets for 31 runs, while Mitchell Starc claimed 3 wickets to dismantle India’s fragile batting lineup.
India needs a win to keep their hopes alive for the World Test Championship final in June, as Australia leads the series 2-1. A victory would allow India to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but they appeared on the back foot after Bumrah, filling in for Rohit, won the toss and chose to bat.
Australian captain Pat Cummins admitted he would have made the same decision but was clearly pleased with the green-tinged wicket and overcast skies at the iconic ground.
India lost Rahul for four with just 11 runs on the board, and Jaiswal followed soon after, dismissed by Boland for 10. Boland almost had Kohli out for a golden duck, but replays showed that Steve Smith’s slip catch had touched the ground.
Nathan Lyon claimed the wicket of Gill just before lunch with a thick edge to the slips, while Boland returned to dismiss Kohli after the break with another well-directed delivery caught by debutant Beau Webster.
Rumors of tension in the Indian camp were addressed earlier in the day, with Bumrah clarifying that Rohit’s absence was the 37-year-old’s own decision.

Title: Dense fog disrupts flights and trains in Delhi as mercury plummets
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:16:51 +0000
Content: A thick blanket of fog covered Delhi on Friday, causing widespread disruption as temperatures plummeted and the city faced a cold wave.
The dense fog significantly reduced visibility, slowing down traffic in the early hours and causing delays for commuters and motorists alike.
Flight and train services were heavily impacted. The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) issued an advisory warning that flights not equipped with CAT III technology would be affected. In a post on X, DIAL said: “While landing and take-offs continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected.” Passengers were urged to check with their airlines for updated flight information.
Train services were also delayed, with at least 24 departures from Delhi affected. The Ayodhya Express was four hours late, the Gorakhdham Express, delayed by over two hours, and the Bihar Kranti Express and Shram Shakti Express, which were both running more than three hours behind schedule.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi recorded a temperature of 9.6°C at 5:30 AM. The city is expected to experience foggy conditions until January 8, with light rain forecasted for January 6.
Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality worsened from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor.’ The Central Pollution Control Board recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 348 at 6 am. AQI levels between 301 and 400 fall into the ‘very poor’ category, posing health risks, especially for vulnerable groups.
To mitigate the effects of the cold, the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) set up 235 pagoda tents for the homeless. Night shelters were also set up at several key locations, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and the Nizamuddin flyover.
The cold wave has affected regions beyond Delhi, with temperatures dipping across North India. Lucknow recorded 8°C at 3:30 AM, while Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir saw temperatures drop to -1.3°C. The heavy snowfall in the region has further disrupted flight operations, with Indigo Airlines issuing a travel advisory for Srinagar-bound flights, urging passengers to stay informed about delays.
“We wish the snowfall could take a brief pause, allowing us to ensure smooth travels for you once again. Stay warm and stay informed,” Indigo said in a statement.

Title: Nifty, Sensex open flat as Asian shares rally; experts cautious on FII momentum
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:12:39 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices started Friday on a muted note, despite a rally in broader Asian markets.
The Nifty gained 7.75 points, or 0.03 percent, opening at 24,196.40, while the Sensex rose by 129.28 points, or 0.16 percent, to open at 80,072.99.
Market experts attributed Thursday’s rally to Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) buying, but they cautioned that this momentum may not last due to the strengthening dollar, which could hinder sustained FII investment.
V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The uncanny ability of the market to surprise was evident in yesterday’s massive 445 point rally in Nifty. Largecaps outperforming smallcaps is a positive signal and may continue. However, it is too early to conclude that FIIs will continue to buy. With dollar index at 109.25 and the U.S. 10-year yield at 4.56 per cent, the macro construct is not favourable for sustained FII buying. Impressive pick up in deposit growth augurs well for banking stocks which are fairly priced.”
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Media led the gains with a 1.4 percent surge, while the auto, IT, and healthcare sectors opened under pressure.
In the Nifty 50, 29 stocks rose, while 21 declined at the time of this report. The top gainers included ONGC, HCLTech, SBI, Trent, and Mahindra & Mahindra. Hero MotoCorp, Infosys, TCS, Asian Paints, and Wipro were among the major laggards.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said, “Nifty had its best day since Nov. 22 and also managed a close above the Nov 19 gap-down level of 24150 in a shot-in-the-arm for tactical bulls. For the second successive time, the mid-December break of the 200-day average turned out to be a bear trap. That said, follow through here is key, with an immediate hurdle at 24250 and critical resistance at 24306. Support lies at 24000 with an extension at 23830. Seasonally speaking, based on the last one year of data, Friday has been the best day of the week for the Nifty – the index has gained 0.2 per cent on average with a 60 per cent win-rate over this period.”
In the Asian markets, Japan remained closed for the New Year. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged more than 1 percent, Taiwan’s Weighted index gained 0.96 percent, and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite saw a decline.

Title: Rising Ajit, Backing Youth: What We Learned From U Mumba’s Pro Kabaddi League Season 11 Campaign
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 13:06:55 +0000
Content: For U Mumba, Pro Kabaddi League Season 11 signaled a change in approach and, consequently, in fortunes. The Mumbai-based franchise is a legacy team in PKL, participating in every edition since the very first in 2014. In the time elapsed, U Mumba have won one title and reached three finals, all in the first three years of PKL.
 
Having braced a slump over the past three editions, U Mumba returned to their near-best in PKL Season 11 and secured a playoff berth for the first time since 2019. The Mumbai side won 12 games, their most since Season 7, and stormed through to the latter stages of the tournament on the back of a strong core and standout individual performances. Despite falling in the playoffs, here is what we learned from U Mumba’s campaign: 
 
1. The Rise of Ajit Chouhan 
 
One of the fresh faces of Pro Kabaddi League Season 11, 19-year-old Ajit Chouhan made an instant impact. Hailing from Pune and idolising Indian legend Anup Kumar, who was a part of the U Mumba outfit that won PKL in 2015, Ajit enjoyed a stellar season, announcing himself as one to watch for the present and the future. 
 
Ajit was scouted following his excellent performances in the Yuva Kabaddi Series, where he showcased his readiness for the bigger stage that is PKL. He emerged as one of the league’s top raiders, topping the charts for Super Raids with nine in 23 games. He also scored the fifth-most points overall (186) and ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in Super Raids and Successful Raids categories. His ability to execute match-winning raids under pressure was instrumental in U Mumba’s playoff run.
 
2. Backing Youth Bears Fruit
 
Since the appointment of Suhail Chandhok as CEO in 2023, U Mumba’s approach to PKL auctions has marked a strategic shift, prioritising young talent over marquee signings. This was evident in their pre-season recruitment ahead of Season 11, which introduced promising 19-year-olds like Ajit Chouhan and Lokesh Ghosliya while retaining the likes of 24-year-old Rinku and 20-year-old Iranian All-Rounder Amirmohammad Zafardanesh. These players rapidly grew into pivotal contributors, becoming the backbone of the team as the season unfolded.
 
The mix of emerging stars like Ajit and Amirmohammad with experienced players like Sunil Kumar, Parvesh Bhainswal, and Manjeet created a balanced and dynamic squad. U Mumba’s focus on nurturing potential supercharged their campaign and positioned them as a team to watch in the coming seasons, with the groundwork for sustained success now in place.
 
3. Captain Sunil Leads the Way
 
Acknowledging the need for leadership on and off the mat, U Mumba made a significant investment by signing Sunil Kumar for over ₹1 crore in the PKL Season 11 auction. Sunil was immediately entrusted with the captaincy and rose to the occasion spectacularly.
 
Under his leadership, not only did U Mumba reach their first playoffs since 2019 but Sunil himself set personal milestones, becoming the most successful captain in PKL history. His ability to lead from the front and inspire teammates was a cornerstone of U Mumba’s resurgence.
 
4. Peaking at the Right Time
 
U Mumba’s start and finish to the regular season were identical in their symmetry, yet they told vastly differing tales. The Mumbai-based franchise started slow, winning two, losing two, and tying one of their first five games–doing enough to stay close to the playoff spots. Towards the end of the season, U Mumba showed grit and determination to eke out wins and cross the finish line, winning three, losing three, and tying one of their seven games. 
 
PKL, however, witnessed the best of U Mumba in between those two spells. Peaking at the right time, the team won seven and lost just three of their ten games between November 3 and December 3, building a robust platform for the season ahead, which culminated in a playoff run. 
 
5. Strong Core Key to Success
 
U Mumba’s rejuvenation this season was driven by a well-balanced squad that combined youthful energy with seasoned experience. Key new signings like Ajit Chouhan, Parvesh Bhainswal, and Manjeet led the charge, while retained players like Rinku and Amirmohammad Zafardanesh ensured consistency and depth. 
 
Guided by head coach Gholamreza Mazandarani and assistant coach Anil Chaprana, U Mumba focused on building not just a starting seven but a bench that could impact games at crucial moments. Captain Sunil Kumar, star raider Ajit Chouhan, and experienced heads Parvesh Bhainswal and Manjeet played in all 23 games; Rinku participated in 22 matches, while Amirmohammad Zafardanesh in 21. Rohit Raghav, who joined as an injury replacement, delivered strong performances whenever given the chance. This mix of energy and experience proved vital in close contests and highlighted the team’s depth and planning.
 
U Mumba’s PKL Season 11 campaign may not have ended with a title, but it marked the start of an exciting new chapter for the franchise. By embracing youth, investing in strong leadership, and developing a resilient core, the team has laid a solid foundation for future success.

Title: India says US H1B visas benefit both countries after Trump, Musk backing
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:47:23 +0000
Content: The movement of skilled professionals is an important part of India-U.S. ties and benefits both countries, New Delhi said on Friday amid a debate over H-1B visas on which President-elect Donald Trump and his backer Elon Musk commented recently.
India, known for its massive pool of IT professionals, many of whom work across the world, accounts for the bulk of such visas issued by the United States.
Late last month, Trump said he fully backed the H1B programme for foreign workers opposed by some of his supporters after Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, vowed to go to “war” to defend it.
India said such visas provided mutual benefits.
“Our countries have a strong and growing economic and technological partnership and within this ambit, mobility of skilled professionals is an important component,” India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, told a press conference when asked about the H1B visa discussions in the U.S.
“India-U.S economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-U.S economic ties which are to our mutual benefit.”
India received about 78% of the 265,777 H1B visas issued by the United States in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2023.
The country is keen to strengthen ties under Trump, Jaiswal said, noting that India’s foreign minister and foreign secretary recently visited the United States and held meetings with Trump’s transition team.

Title: India aims to strengthen economic ties with US, engage with Trump administration
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:08:45 +0000
Content: India is looking forward to strengthening its economic relationship with the United States by engaging with the incoming Trump administration, India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in New Delhi on Friday.
“We are looking forward to a very deep and substantive engagement with the new US administration,” the trade minister said, noting that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has bolstered bilateral relations with successive U.S. administrations, including those led by Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
Bilateral trade between India and the United States, India’s largest trading partner, exceeded $118 billion in 2023/24, with India registering a trade surplus of $32 billion.
Industry estimates suggest that trade could grow by an additional $50 billion within two to three years, underscoring significant potential for stronger economic cooperation.
The government and industry groups favour a broader trade and investment pact with the United States to help Indian manufacturers integrate into global supply chains while retaining policy flexibility to safeguard national interests.
Goyal said that India’s goods and services trade is projected to surpass $800 billion in the 2024/25 fiscal year, ending March.
While aiming to protect its manufacturers from potential U.S. tariff hikes on its exports, India is exploring ways to strengthen ties with Washington as Trump has threatened tariffs of 60% and other curbs on imports from China.

Title: PM Modi criticizes AAP govt, slams Delhi’s education system and pollution crisis
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:44:19 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, accusing them of damaging the education system in the city over the last 10 years. Addressing a public meeting at Ashok Vihar’s Ramlila Ground, PM Modi criticized the AAP-led government for not properly utilizing funds allocated by the central government for education.
“A new college in the name of Veer Savarkar is going to be built in Najafgarh,” PM Modi said. “But those who have been in power in Delhi for the last 10 years have harmed school education. The money that the central government has given to Delhi – the current government has not even spent half of that money on education.”
PM Modi also highlighted the achievements of the New Education Policy (NEP), saying, “Such initiatives were never undertaken even after Independence, but it is your servant who has made it happen.”
PM Modi took aim at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, accusing the party of leading the city into a state of crisis. “In the last 10 years, Delhi has been surrounded by a disaster. By keeping Anna Hazare at the front, a few dishonest people have pushed Delhi towards this disaster. The AAP has become a disaster for Delhi,” he said.
PM Modi further emphasized the growing frustration among the people of Delhi, stating that voters are determined to free the city from the grip of AAP’s governance. “This disaster has taken over Delhi, and the people of Delhi have waged a war against it. Voters of Delhi have made up their minds to free Delhi from this disaster. Every voter of Delhi is saying, ‘We will not tolerate this disaster, we will bring change.’”
The Prime Minister also criticized AAP for its handling of pollution in the Yamuna River, accusing the party of neglecting the environmental crisis. “Every resident of Delhi can see the situation of the Yamuna. Look at their (AAP’s) shamelessness. They say cleaning the Yamuna won’t get them votes. Will you leave the Yamuna in this condition just because it doesn’t get you votes? This disaster has handed over the lives of the people of Delhi to the tanker mafia,” he said.
In response, Delhi’s Chief Minister Atishi hit back, accusing the BJP of lacking any clear agenda for the upcoming assembly elections. “BJP has no agenda for the elections. They have been in power at the center for 10 years, with a budget of lakhs of crores. They should tell us one thing they have done for the people of Delhi. They have done nothing. Today, they have no vision for Delhi and no CM candidate. AAP has worked for the people of Delhi for 10 years,” Atishi told reporters.

The 268 successful IPOs across mainboard (90) and SME (178) raised Rs 1.67 lakh crore, and were also the highest number of IPOs within Asia.

While 90 mainboard companies (excluding REiTS, InVITS, and FPOs) raised over Rs 1.59 lakh crore, 178 SMEs collectively raised around Rs 7,349 crore, the report stated.
“The record number of IPOs during 2024 highlights the resilience and potential of the Indian economy. Companies across various sectors are recognising the value of public markets to support their growth strategies,” said Sriram Krishnan, Chief Business Development Officer (CBDO), NSE.
In fact, the data suggests that NSE has alone done more IPOs than other top exchanges in Asia which includes the IPOs Japan’s (Japan Exchange Group), Hong Kong’s (Hong Kong Stock Exchange), and China’s (Shanghai Stock Exchange) have done cumulatively.
The capital raised by the companies via the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was $15.9 billion and the Shanghai Stock Exchange was $8.8 billion.
China’s Shangai Stock Exchange recorded 101 public issues while Japan and Hong Kong’s stock exchanges witnessed 93 and 66 IPOs, respectively.

To promote a balance between mental and physical health, International Mind and Body Wellness Day is celebrated on January 3rd every year, a global initiative first observed in 2019.
This day reminds us that health isn’t just about physical fitness—it’s about mental wellness too.
Psychosomatic Diseases and Mental Health
Many health problems today are classified as psychosomatic diseases, which are triggered by poor lifestyle choices, unresolved emotions, or stress. The increasing pressure on individuals, whether at work, in relationships, or in social settings, has led to an alarming rise in mental health issues.
To combat this, International Mind and Body Wellness Day emphasizes adopting strategies that improve mental and physical well-being, like yoga, meditation, and self-care practices. It’s a reminder to take proactive steps toward a healthier and more balanced life.
Understanding the Mind-Body Connection
Philosophers and spiritual leaders have long discussed the strong link between the mind and body. Ancient approaches, such as Ayurveda in India and traditional Chinese medicine, advocate for holistic health by treating both mental and physical aspects of well-being.
Engaging in physical activities while also focusing on mental health practices like spending time with loved ones, reading motivational books, and practicing meditation can lead to better overall health. These habits can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, promote sound sleep, and help maintain a balanced lifestyle.
Famous Quotes on Wellness
Several renowned personalities have spoken about the importance of mental and physical health. Here are a few motivational quotes:
1. “People are just as happy as they make up their minds to be.” – Abraham Lincoln
2. “If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.” – Albert Einstein
3. “Happiness is the highest form of health.” – Dalai Lama
4. “A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought; they must be earned.” – Naval Ravikant
5. “Self-care is not selfish. You cannot serve from an empty vessel.” – Eleanor Brown
Five Best Ways to Attain Holistic Health
Here are five key strategies to achieve holistic health for a better balance between mind and body:
1. Do a SWOT Analysis: Assess your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This can help you turn challenges into opportunities and manage stress effectively.
2. Reflect and Reconnect: Take time to reflect on positive solutions to your problems. This will help you regain control over stressful situations.
3. Engage in Your Favorite Activities: When things don’t go as planned, shift your focus to activities you enjoy. Whether it’s composing a poem, singing, or doing charity work, these activities boost happiness.
4. Adopt a Healthy Lifestyle: Regular exercise, a nutritious diet, proper sleep patterns, and meditation can improve your decision-making power and overall health.
5. Seek Social Support: Meaningful interactions with friends, family, or colleagues can combat stress and enhance mental well-being.
On this International Day for Mind and Body Wellness, let us commit to prioritizing not only our physical fitness but also our mental health, to lead a life of balance and fulfillment.

Title: Maldives a “concrete expression” of India’s Neighbourhood First Policy: EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:35:59 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday held a meeting with Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Khaleel and emphasised the strong bilateral ties between India and the Maldives.
Speaking in New Delhi during Khaleel’s first official visit to India, Jaishankar highlighted recent developments aimed at strengthening ties, including a new framework to facilitate local currency use for cross-border transactions.
Welcoming Khaleel and his delegation, Jaishankar remarked on the symbolic significance of the visit, noting it marked the first diplomatic meeting of the new year. “I am delighted to welcome you and your delegation. It is heartening to share positive developments in our relationship, such as the agreement to use local currencies for trade,” he said.
Jaishankar further reaffirmed India’s commitment to the Maldives, and described the country as a “concrete expression” of India’s Neighborhood First policy.
“We have increased our engagements in various sectors. I do want to say that India has always stood by Maldives. For us, you are a very concrete expression of our neighbourhood’s first policy,” Jaishankar said.
Jaishankar reaffirmed India’s long-standing support for the Maldives, calling the nation a “true example” of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. “India has consistently stood by the Maldives. Our partnership is a reflection of our commitment to this principle,” he added, referencing efforts to supply essential commodities and foster broader cooperation.
The ministers discussed various areas of collaboration, emphasizing maritime security, economic cooperation, and capacity building. Khaleel’s visit follows an earlier meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in October 2024, where the leaders resolved to deepen economic and security ties in the Indian Ocean region.
During those talks, both nations committed to tackling shared maritime challenges, including piracy, illegal fishing, drug trafficking, and terrorism. India also pledged to assist in completing the Maldives National Defence Force’s ‘Ekatha’ harbour project at Uthuru Thila Falhu (UTF), which will bolster Maldives’ maritime capabilities.
Foreign Minister Khaleel’s three-day visit reinforces these goals, aiming to enhance collaboration between the two nations as they navigate regional and global challenges together.

Title: India’s Economic Surge: A Decade of Transformation
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:17:41 +0000
Content: India has undergone significant policy changes since 2014, emerging as a credible alternative for global businesses to establish operations. With the world seeking a manufacturing base beyond China, India has become a preferred destination thanks to reforms introduced over the past decade.
These policy measures are reflected in the country’s positive economic indicators. Since 2015, India has implemented significant changes in its gross domestic product (GDP), manufacturing expansion, market capitalisation, and foreign investments, four broad dimensions of a large economy’s expansion.
In a globalised world with interconnected economies, attracting foreign investment, nurturing domestic companies, boosting market capitalisation, and expanding manufacturing remain key growth drivers. When these factors work together, they become a powerful engine for increasing a country’s GDP.
Over the past decade, India’s reforms have fostered a supportive framework for industries, confirmed by improved standings on various global ranking platforms.
A Competitive Economy: India’s global rankings in key indices have risen. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, India advanced from 71st in 2015 to 40th currently. The World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ report ranked India 142 in 2014, improving sharply to 63 in 2019. Publication of the report, the World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR), was discontinued after that. A competitive economy also demands a strong research focus to spur innovation. The Global Innovation Index, released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), placed India 39th among 133 economies, up from 76th in 2014.
Strong GDP Growth: Rising competitiveness, grounded in research and innovation, has propelled India’s GDP significantly. According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), GDP at constant prices (base year 2011–12) increased from ₹10,527,674 crore in 2014–15 to ₹17,381,722 crore in 2023–24, a 65% jump.
In current US dollar terms, as per World Bank data, GDP rose from US$2.04 trillion in 2014 to US$3.57 trillion in 2023, marking a 75% surge. When measured in constant US dollars, the economy expanded from US$1.95 trillion to US$3.22 trillion, a 65% rise. Meanwhile, GDP per capita in current US dollars moved from US$1,554 to US$2,481, a 60% increase, while in constant dollars it climbed from US$1,484 to US$2,236, a 51% boost.
Projected Third-Largest Economy: Government data show India’s global economic position rose from 10th in 2014 to 5th by 2024 in nominal GDP. It overtook the UK in September 2022 to become the fifth-largest economy. According to the Finance Ministry, India could reach the third spot by 2027 with a GDP of US$5 trillion.
EY projects India will surpass Japan and Germany by 2028, reaching US$5.2 trillion. Meanwhile, NITI Aayog’s ‘Vision for Viksit Bharat @ 2047: An Approach Paper’ aims for India to be a developed economy by 2047, targeting US$30 trillion in GDP and a per capita income of US$18,000.
In purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, India is already the third-largest economy globally, and by 2028, the US economy is projected to be only 1.7 times larger than India’s.
FDI Inflows on the Rise: Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows totalled US$709.84 billion between April 2014 and September 2024, or 68.69% of total FDI inflows in India since April 2000, according to the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. Cumulative FDI from April 2000 to September 2024 surpassed US$1 trillion. Over the same period, FDI equity inflows into manufacturing rose from US$98 billion between 2004–14 to US$165 billion between 2014–24, a 69% upswing. These rising inflows demonstrate multinational companies’ increasing trust in India’s business model.
Vigorous Capital Markets: India’s capital markets have also seen robust expansion. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex surged from 27,507.54 points on 1 January 2015 to 78,507.41 on 1 January 2025, a 185% increase. All-India market capitalisation on the same date was ₹4,43,47,670.86 crore.
In US dollar terms, the Sensex’s market capitalisation grew from US$1.56 trillion in December 2014 to US$5.00 trillion by May 2024. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) market capitalisation reached US$5.13 trillion (₹438.9 lakh crore) in 2024, up from US$4.34 trillion (₹361.05 lakh crore) the previous year.
Signs of Success: One of the best indicators of India’s growing prowess in the manufacturing sector is its mobile phone production capacity. A decade ago, it depended heavily on mobile handset imports; now, it is the world’s second-largest mobile phone manufacturer, according to the Ministry of Commerce & Industry.
Startup promotion policies have paid off, with India emerging as the third-largest startup hub globally. From just four Unicorns in 2014, the count now exceeds 100, backed by government support for over 1,57,066 start-ups. According to a May 2024 Forbes analysis, India’s start-up ecosystem was valued at US$349.67 billion.
A sign of industrial maturity lies in reducing gross non-performing assets (GNPA) of commercial banks. Bank credit fuels industries and, in a growing economy, healthy loan returns reflect positive developments for both lenders and businesses. GNPAs of Scheduled Commercial Banks stood at 2.60% in September 2024, their lowest level in 12 years, as per the Reserve Bank of India.
These developments, spanning 2014–15 to 2024–25, illustrate a decade of consistent growth and transformative policy changes across multiple sectors. From a surge in GDP to strong stock market gains and improving international rankings, India has shown remarkable resilience and the ability to adapt amid rapid global shifts.

Title: Greenland’s leader steps up push for independence from Denmark
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:14:34 +0000
Content: Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Egede emphasised his desire to pursue independence from Denmark, its former colonial ruler, during his New Year speech, marking a significant change in the rhetoric surrounding the Arctic island’s future.
Egede’s speech, which comes on the heels of comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressing his wish for “ownership and control” of Greenland, also expressed a desire to strengthen Greenland’s cooperation with other countries.
“It is about time that we ourselves take a step and shape our future, also with regard to who we will cooperate closely with, and who our trading partners will be,” he said.
An independence movement has gained traction in Greenland in recent years in part due to revelations of misconduct by Danish authorities during the 20th century, including an involuntary birth control campaign launched in the 1960s.
Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 but is now a self-governing territory of Denmark and in 2009 achieved the right to claim independence through a vote. In 2023, Greenland’s government presented its first draft constitution.
“The history and current conditions have shown that our cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark has not succeeded in creating full equality,” Egede said.
“It is now time for our country to take the next step. Like other countries in the world, we must work to remove the obstacles to cooperation – which we can describe as the shackles of colonialism – and move forward,” he said.
He added that it was up to the people of Greenland to decide on independence but did not say when a vote could be held.
While a majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants support independence, there is division over the timing and potential impact on living standards.
Greenland’s government has twice rejected offers by Trump to purchase the island, in 2019 and again last year, with Egede asserting that “Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale.”
The speech did not mention Trump or the United States. Greenland’s capital Nuuk is closer to New York than the Danish capital Copenhagen.
Despite the wealth of mineral, oil, and natural gas resources, Greenland’s economy remains fragile, heavily dependent on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.
Greenland is due to hold parliamentary elections before April 6.

Title: Indian stock market declines as cautious sentiment prevails
Publication Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:04:40 +0000
Content: After a strong start to the New Year, the Indian stock market stumbled on Friday, weighed down by losses in key sectors like IT, financial services, and pharmaceuticals. Weak global cues added to investor unease, halting the recent upward momentum.
The Sensex dropped 720.60 points, or 0.90%, to close at 79,223.11, while the Nifty ended at 24,004.75, down 183.90 points or 0.76%.
The Nifty Bank index fell by 1.20%, finishing at 50,988.8. Midcaps and small caps also faced pressure, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index down 0.30% at 57,931.05 and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index slipping 0.24% to close at 19,033.70.
Market analysts attributed the downturn to investor caution amid uncertainties about upcoming earnings and weaker-than-expected economic data. IT, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and banking stocks were among the hardest hit.
Despite broad declines, some sectors showed resilience. PSU Banks, FMCG, Metals, Media, Energy, and Commodities sectors posted gains.
Among Sensex stocks, major losers included HDFC Bank, Zomato, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech, and Bharti Airtel. Meanwhile, Tata Motors, Titan, Hindustan Unilever, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC, Nestle India, IndusInd Bank, and Tata Steel emerged as gainers.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the market breadth was slightly positive, with 2,115 stocks advancing, 1,871 declining, and 117 remaining unchanged.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,506.75 crore on January 2, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought ₹22.14 crore worth of stocks, indicating continued interest in Indian markets despite the dip.
According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, Nifty failed to break above its 50-day exponential moving average, leading to the correction.
“On the upside, if Nifty manages to breach the 24,220 mark, it could rise further towards 24,500. Conversely, a fall below 24,000 may pull the index down to 23,700,” he said.
