Title: India’s 8-month fiscal deficit at 52.5 pc of full year target for 2024-25
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:15:28 +0000
Content: India’s fiscal deficit for the first 8 months from April to November of the current financial year is estimated at Rs 8.47 lakh crore which works out to 52.5 per cent of the estimate for the financial year, according to official data released on Tuesday.
This reflects a strong macroeconomic financial position as the fiscal deficit is well under control with the government sticking to the consolidation path.
Net tax receipts for the first eight months of the current financial year were at Rs 14.43 lakh crore, or 56 per cent of the annual target, up from Rs 14.36 lakh crore for the same period last year, the data showed.
Total government expenditure for the eight months was Rs 27.41lakh crore which constitutes 57 per cent of the annual target fixed in the Union Budget. The government spent Rs 26.52 lakh crore in the same period last year.
The government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the current financial year from 5.6 per cent in 2023-24. The government aims to contain the fiscal deficit at Rs 16.13 lakh crore during the current fiscal.
India’s net direct tax collections, comprising corporate tax and personal income tax, shot up by a robust 15.4 per cent to Rs 12.1 lakh crore, from April 1 to November 10 during the current financial year, according to the latest figures released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
Similarly, there has been a robust growth in GST collections on the back of rising economic activity.
The buoyancy in tax collections places more funds in the government’s coffers to undertake investments in large infrastructure projects to spur economic growth and take up welfare schemes for the poor. It also helps to keep the fiscal deficit in check and strengthens the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy.
A lower fiscal deficit means the government has to borrow less which leaves more money in the banking system for big companies to borrow and invest. This, in turn, leads to a higher economic growth rate and the creation of more jobs. Besides, a low fiscal deficit keeps the inflation rate in check which strengthens the fundamentals of the economy and ensures growth with stability.

Title: NPCI removes UPI user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:01:00 +0000
Content: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on Tuesday removed the unified payments interface (UPI) user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay with immediate effect.
With this, WhatsApp Pay can now extend UPI services to its entire user base in India, the NPCI said in a statement.
Previously, the NPCI had permitted WhatsApp Pay to expand its UPI user base in a phased manner, lifting the previous cap of 100 million users.
With this notification, the NPCI is removing the limit restrictions on user onboarding on WhatsApp Pay.
“WhatsApp Pay shall continue to comply with all existing UPI guidelines and circulars applicable to existing third-party app providers (TPAPs),” said the corporation.
According to third-party data, the Meta-owned platform has over 500 million users in India. The NPCI move heralds a significant shift in regulatory policy, which had previously limited WhatsApp Payment’s rollout.
Additionally, the NPCI has deferred a proposed rule to cap any single app’s UPI transaction share at 30 per cent until December 31, 2026
UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly, with Google Pay and PhonePe controlling more than 85 per cent of the market.
The UPI achieved 15,547 crore transactions worth Rs 223 lakh crore from January to November this year, ‘showcasing its transformative impact on financial transactions’ in India.
Since its launch in 2016, UPI has transformed financial access in India, enabling 300 million individuals and 50 million merchants to perform seamless digital transactions, according to a study by IIM and ISB professors.
The NPCI said it is focused on bringing innovations in the retail payment systems through the use of technology and is relentlessly working to transform India into a digital economy. It is facilitating secure payment solutions with nationwide accessibility at minimal cost in furtherance of India’s aspiration to be a fully digital society.

Title: Iran rejects involvement in escalating Red Sea tension
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:15:05 +0000
Content: Iran’s envoy to the United Nations (UN) has rejected the accusations by the United States and Britain about Tehran’s role in escalating tensions in the Red Sea, Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s permanent representative to the UN, made the remarks on Monday in letters to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, UN Security Council (UNSC) president for the month of December, while reacting to what he called “baseless and politically-motivated” anti-Tehran claims made by the US and British representatives at a UNSC briefing earlier in the day.
During the briefing, US Deputy Representative to the UN Dorothy Shea accused Iran of “fully funding” Yemen’s Houthis and providing them with “lethal weapons” for attacks on Israel.
In similar remarks, Barbara Woodward, British permanent representative to the UN, also accused Iran of assisting the Yemeni armed forces in their ongoing operations against Israel.
Iravani denounced these accusations as “unfounded” claims intended to escalate tensions and create an excuse to cause further instability in West Asia.
He also slammed Israel as being behind these “baseless” accusations, in a “clear bid” to throw dirt on Iran and to cover its own “illegal actions and destructive activities.”
The Iranian envoy emphasised that it is Israel, not Iran, that has always pursued a policy of “provocation” and has long been a “serious threat” to peace and security in the region and beyond, Xinhua news agency reported.
He said Iran has always been committed to international law, the UN Charter, and UNSC resolutions.
The Houthi group has been launching regular rocket and drone attacks against Israel and disrupting “Israeli-linked” shipping in the Red Sea since November 2023 to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid their conflict with Israelis. In response, Israel and the US-British naval coalition in the region have been conducting intermittent strikes on Houthi targets to deter the group.

Title: Yearender: India’s bittersweet voyage at Paris Olympics
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:21:34 +0000
Content: The Paris Olympics turned out to be a bittersweet journey for the Indian contingent, as they failed to clinch a single gold medal at the recently concluded Summer Games. However, it was a standout year for Manu Bhaker, who rose to fame with her remarkable double Olympic medal haul.  
Team India concluded their Paris Olympics campaign with six medals, including one silver and five bronze. Despite sending 117 athletes to compete across various events, the nation could not secure a gold. India ranked 71st on the Paris Olympics medals tally, while the United States dominated with 126 medals.  
One of the major highlights of the Games was the emergence of shooter Manu Bhaker. The 22-year-old became the first Indian athlete in the post-independence era to win two medals in a single edition of the Olympics, a feat previously achieved by Norman Pritchard at the Paris 1900 Games. Bhaker opened India’s medal tally by securing bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event, becoming the first Indian woman shooter to win an Olympic medal. She, along with Sarabjot Singh, later won another bronze in the mixed team 10m air pistol event, marking India’s first-ever shooting team medal.  
Bhaker narrowly missed a historic grand treble, finishing fourth in the women’s 25m pistol shooting event. She came close to becoming the first Indian to win three medals at the Olympics.  
Swapnil Kusale added to the tally with a bronze in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions Men’s Final, becoming the first Indian shooter to win a medal in this event.  
Neeraj Chopra, India’s “golden boy,” secured silver in the men’s javelin throw with a best throw of 89.45 meters, falling short of retaining his Tokyo gold. Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem claimed gold with a record-breaking 92.97-meter throw, while Grenada’s Anderson Peters earned bronze.  
The Indian men’s hockey team also scripted history by winning back-to-back bronze medals at the Olympics for the first time in 52 years, defeating Spain 2-1.  
Young wrestler Aman Sehrawat brought home India’s first wrestling medal at Paris 2024, securing bronze in the 57 kg freestyle event in his Olympic debut. He became the seventh Indian wrestler to medal at the Olympics.  
Despite these milestones, the Games were marred by near misses. Six athletes, including Lakshya Sen, Mirabai Chanu, and Bhaker, finished fourth in their events, narrowly missing out on medals. The mixed team archery duo of Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat made history by reaching an Olympic medal match but fell short in the bronze medal contest.  
Other setbacks included Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’s semifinal exit in men’s badminton doubles and PV Sindhu’s inability to secure a third consecutive Olympic medal. Veteran archer Deepika Kumari, boxers Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain, and wrestler Vinesh Phogat also fell short of expectations.  
India participated in 69 medal events across 16 sports at Paris 2024, including archery, athletics, badminton, and shooting. To date, India has won 41 Olympic medals, with its best-ever performance coming at Tokyo 2020, where the nation bagged seven medals, including a gold.

Title: Syria’s Spiral: The Rise, Reign, and Ruin of Bashar al-Assad Amid the Arab Spring’s Echoes
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 13:11:52 +0000
Content: Syria, a country in Southwest Asia on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, was deeply affected by the Arab Spring protests that swept through many nations in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. These were anti-regime, pro-democracy demonstrations aimed at toppling dictatorial governments.
Backed by Iran and Russia, the regime led by Bashar al-Assad survived the revolutionary wave carried out by rebel forces and eventually reclaimed many of the territories they once held. Though not directly related, the survival of his regime was also assisted by the U.S.-led coalition’s action against ISIS, which had once occupied vast territories along the Syria–Iraq border.
A History of Autocracy with the Baath Party
The Baath Party was formed in Damascus, Syria, in 1943. It soon established branches in other Middle Eastern countries. Although it adopted a liberal-sounding appeal, including opposition to colonialism and imperialism and a policy of non-alignment, the party quickly became highly centralised. The single-party, single-leader rules in Syria and Iraq only confirm this fact.
Syria gained independence in 1946 from a joint French and British occupation, but the subsequent political phase was unstable. In 1963, the Baath Party rose to power through a military coup. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, resulting in Israel’s capture of the Golan Heights and the destruction of Syria’s air power. In 1970, then-Defence Minister Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar al-Assad, led an internal coup within the Baath Party, toppling the then-president and ushering in five decades of centralised rule. After Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, Bashar al-Assad succeeded him as president.
Both Bashar al-Assad and his father ruled Syria with an iron fist. In 1973, widespread riots erupted against Hafez al-Assad’s decree amending the Syrian constitution to allow even a non-Muslim to become the country’s president. The army brutally suppressed the protests. In the 1980s, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria sparked uprisings in Aleppo, Homs, and Hama, all of which were violently crushed, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. After taking power in 2000, Bashar al-Assad once again dashed hopes of political reforms in the country, continuing the one-party Baathist rule while arresting activists, citizens, and opposition leaders who demanded change.
The Arab Spring and the Eruption of the Civil War
Pro-democracy protests began in Daraa and quickly spread nationwide. As before, the Syrian regime responded with violence. Initially, the protests were largely peaceful, but the regime took brutal action against them, adopting measures such as killings, disappearances, and arrests. Police, military, and paramilitary forces were deployed to quell dissent.
This time, however, the response to Assad’s crackdown was different. Armed militias emerged, including the Free Syrian Army, formed by defectors from the Assad-led Syrian military. By 2012, peaceful demonstrations had escalated into a full-fledged civil war. Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and U.S.-backed Kurdish rebel groups later became another major challenger for Bashar al-Assad.
Sectarian violence also played a significant role. With a population of about 24 million, Syria is predominantly Muslim, with Sunnis forming the majority, but it was ruled by the minority Alawite sect for more than five decades. The Assad family was Alawite, as were most of the leading figures in the Syrian security forces and bureaucracy.
The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam. Sunni Muslims generally consider Alawite beliefs to deviate from mainstream Islamic traditions. According to the CIA World Factbook, 87 per cent of Syrians are Muslims, with 74 per cent being Sunni. Shia sects like Alawites and Ismailis form about 13 per cent. Christians account for about 10 per cent, and Druze about 3 per cent.
The post–Arab Spring period saw involvement from Sunni-dominated terror groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, exacerbating sectarian strife. The use of chemical weapons by Assad’s forces further fuelled the conflict.
The Rise and Fall of ISIS
In April 2013, the terror group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS or the Islamic State), led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, emerged as a new, significant threat to the Assad regime and the world community. The terror group had a single goal of establishing an Islamic empire across boundaries and continents. It captured Raqqa in eastern Syria as its base and expanded into Iraq, quickly overtaking vast territories. Its ambitions to establish a caliphate across the world by violent means alarmed the international community.
By September 2014, a U.S.-led anti-ISIL coalition with Kurdish forces launched air strikes on ISIL-held territories. The coalition’s efforts, along with interventions by Turkey and the Assad regime (backed by Iran and Russia), led to ISIS’s collapse by 2016. This was a major relief for Assad, as his primary challenger on Syrian territory was effectively neutralised. In 2017, Raqqa was liberated by the U.S.-aligned Kurdish force.
Bashar al-Assad – Backed by Iran and Russia
A 2018 Times of Israel report noted that Iran maintained about ten military bases in Syria. Iran-backed Hezbollah, a political party with a powerful militia based in southern Lebanon, joined the Syrian civil war in May 2013 to support Assad. Russia also actively supported Assad’s regime with air strikes targeting rebel camps.
Joint operations helped the regime retake Palmyra from ISIL and Aleppo from other rebels in 2016. By November 2017, Assad’s forces retook control of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria and Eastern Ghouta from various rebel groups. In 2018, the regime targeted southwestern regions to reclaim control from rebels, successfully recapturing Daraa and Quneitra. The rebels surrendered and retreated to Idlib, Syria’s only remaining rebel-held territory.
In May 2023, the Arab League, which had once expelled Syria, reinstated it, acknowledging the regime’s hold over the country. The League recognised Assad’s rule over the country’s vast territory, with no significant threats seen in the last three years.
Since 2018, the rebel forces had not been very active, until this year.
2024: The Turning Point
The Bashar al-Assad regime seemed to be in control of Syria even a month ago, before its collapse in just under two weeks.
Two external events and a host of internal factors led to this fall.
The story of the downfall began in 2022 and accelerated through 2023, severely compounding Assad’s problems. In February 2022, Russia began a full-scale war with Ukraine that is still ongoing. In October 2023, Hamas, another Iran-supported terror group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel retaliated by attacking Gaza.
That was the beginning of the West Asia crisis, with Israel and Iran being the key players.
Hezbollah, an old rival of Israel, also launched strikes on northern Israel, prompting Israeli counter-attacks. The group withdrew its fighters from Syria last year to fight against Israel. The Israeli military operations against Hezbollah were ramped up multiple times in September, eliminating top and second-line Hezbollah commanders, its infrastructural bases, and most of its locations in southern Lebanon.
Syria also saw many air strikes by Israel on Syrian military facilities and Iranian bases that further weakened Assad’s grip over the country.
Rising tensions in West Asia followed a limited conflict between Israel and Iran. On 1 October 2024, Iran attacked Israel with around 200 ballistic missiles, prompting Israel’s bombing of Iranian military sites on 26 October.
With these events unfolding, Syria lost the crucial military support from Russia and Iran it once enjoyed.
The fall of the Assad regime was further fuelled by some additional developments.
The U.S. Caesar Act of June 2020 had already imposed stringent sanctions on the Assad regime, worsening economic conditions. Coupled with a corrupt Syrian army and a sectarian divide, with minority Alawite figures at the top, it was only a matter of time before its fall.
Top-level commanders were found to be involved in various business ventures, going as far as drug-smuggling activities, according to different investigative reports focusing on the Syrian army. At the same time, most of the foot soldiers were conscripts. This meant the current Assad army had no strategy or organisational strength in the event of military emergencies, and his regime could only survive with external military support.
The year 2024 saw these pressure points against Bashar al-Assad converging, signalling rebels to march ahead.
The Syrian Arab Spring
The Arab Spring saw authoritarian regimes toppled in four countries: Tunisia (January 2011), Egypt (February 2011), Libya (October 2011), and Yemen (February 2012). Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, and Sudan also saw widespread protests, demonstrations, and anti-government rallies, but regimes in those countries survived. Many other countries in the Middle East and East Africa also saw pro-democracy protests at minor levels.
The Syrian version of the Arab Spring protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime began in March 2011. Later, it became an anti-government uprising that led to the civil war the Bashar al-Assad regime survived for 13 years before its fall. That makes Syria the fifth country with an authoritarian regime falling due to the revolution that began in 2010.

Title: Year ender: Govt aims to build 2 crore houses under PM’s scheme for rural poor
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:47:13 +0000
Content: The Centre plans to construct additional two crore rural houses during FY2024-25 to FY 2028-29 under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) flagship scheme that is being implemented to provide “housing for all” in the country, according to the year-end review of the Ministry of Rural Development released on Tuesday.
As on December 30, the cumulative target of 3.33 crore houses have been allotted to the states/UTs, out of which 3.22 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.68 crore houses have been completed, according to the official statement.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the first instalment to more than 10 lakh PMAY-G beneficiaries on September 17 through single click in a national event.
An e-KYC app integrated with Aadhaar and equipped with AI-enabled face authentication technology is being used to conduct verification of PMAY-G beneficiaries and prevent fraud, according to the government.
As per the Union Cabinet approval, the scheme has been extended to cover more people with the provisions regarding mechanised two wheelers, mechanised fishing boat, landline phone and refrigerator having been deleted as conditions that barred eligibility.
Further, the income criteria have also been enhanced from Rs 10,000 per month to Rs 15,000, and the land-related criteria have been simplified to make the scheme more inclusive.
The PMAY-G has introduced new technology-based solutions for effective and transparent management of the scheme. With the new phase being implemented the PMAY-G has introduced multiple features to maximise transparency and ensure sanctity in the process right from the identification to completion of the houses.
The scheme is being implemented and monitored through an end-to-end e-governance solution, AwaasSoft and AwaasApp. AwaasSoft provides functionalities for data entry and monitoring of multiple statistics related to implementation aspects of the scheme to ensure transparency. These statistics include, physical progress, financial progress and status of convergence.
‘Awaas+ 2024’ is a unique app specially designed under PMAY-G, having features of assisted survey through pre-registered surveyors, housing technology selection, face authentication, Aadhaar-based e-KYC, data capture of household, conditions of existing house, time stamped, and geo tagged photo capture of existing house proposed site of construction. The app works in online as well as offline mode. “Self-Survey” facility is available for eligible households in Awaas+2024 app Survey for the next phase of PMAYG (2024-29).

Title: South Korea’s leadership crisis in hands of Constitutional Court
Publication Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:29:22 +0000
Content: South Korea’s leadership crisis will play out in the Constitutional Court, which will decide the fates of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, both impeached and suspended from power over a short-lived martial law.
Han, who was impeached on Friday, had taken over as acting president from Yoon, impeached on Dec. 14. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mokhas become acting president.
Also on Friday, the court held its first hearing in a case to decide whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from power.
WHAT NEXT?
After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except insurrection or treason.
The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove him from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If it removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.
Yoon’s legal counsel include former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon and former prosecutor Yoon Kab-keun, who appeared at Friday’s hearing.
The court is also expected to hold a trial on whether to remove Han from office or restore him to his role.
HURDLES TO A COURT RULING?
South Korea’s constitution requires six justices to agree on the ouster of an impeached president. The nine-member court has one remaining vacancy, after Choi appointed two new justices on Tuesday.
Choi said on Tuesday that he will fill the last remaining vacancy as well if ruling and opposition parties can agree on the nomination.
There is precedent for an acting president to appoint a Constitutional Court justice, when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in late 2016.
WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.
This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict it may seek to rule before that to minimise uncertainty.
On Friday, Justice Cheong Hyung-sik of the Constitutional Court said it would move swiftly in the case, considering its gravity.
In the past, academics say, the justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, going by their interpretation of the constitution.
Attempts by conservatives to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight protests seeking her removal.
In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.
Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.
If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request by Park.
In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached for falling short of the political neutrality required of a high public official, but finished his five-year term after the court rejected the motion within two months.

Content: Cricket Australia has named India’s premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah as the captain of the Men’s Test Team of the Year 2024. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal is the other Indian in the playing XI, which features cricketers from six countries.
Wicket-keeper-batter Alex Carey and pacer Josh Hazlewood are the two Australians included in the multinational XI.
England’s Joe Root, Ben Duckett, and Harry Brook, along with New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra and Matt Henry, also feature in the team. Keshav Maharaj of South Africa and Kamindu Mendis of Sri Lanka are the sole representatives from their respective nations.
India’s 22-year-old batting prodigy Yashasvi Jaiswal displayed remarkable composure throughout 2024. His back-to-back double centuries in February secured a home Test series win against England, while his brilliant 161 in Perth proved decisive. Jaiswal set records for the most runs by an Indian opener in a calendar year and the most sixes (36) hit globally in a single year.
England’s Duckett impressed with his aggressive approach, scoring hundreds in Rajkot (153) and Multan (114), despite England’s defeats. His strike rate of 87.04 showcased his value in the team’s attacking strategy.
Joe Root added six centuries in 2024, including twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and an unbeaten 262 in Multan, which helped England secure a memorable win over Pakistan. Root also contributed with 11 wickets, underlining another stellar year for the all-rounder.
New Zealand’s Ravindra edged out Kane Williamson for his heroics in a historic series win in India, including a match-winning 134 in the first Test. He also scored a double century against South Africa at home.
Harry Brook dazzled with series-defining hundreds against New Zealand and a stunning 317 in Multan, displaying his brilliance under pressure.
Sri Lanka’s Kamindu Mendis, who began the year as a fringe player, finished with 1,000 runs in just 13 innings, equaling Bradman’s record. His four centuries highlighted a breakout year.
Australia’s Alex Carey excelled behind the stumps with 46 dismissals. His unbeaten 98 in Christchurch was one of the year’s standout fourth-innings performances.
New Zealand’s Matt Henry emerged as a key bowler, with a standout performance of 5-15 against India.
Jasprit Bumrah had a historic 2024, claiming 71 wickets in 13 matches at an average of 14.92, making him the year’s most impactful bowler.
Australia’s Josh Hazlewood maintained his excellence with a sub-14 bowling average, while South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj played a pivotal role in back-to-back series victories, earning his place in the XI.

Title: Pentagon appeals Court upholds plea deals for 9/11 plotters
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 07:13:07 +0000
Content: A Pentagon appeals court has upheld controversial plea deals for three men accused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks, clearing the way for the US government to proceed with the agreements, reported The Washington Post.
The court’s unanimous ruling, delivered late Monday, rejected efforts by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to block the deals. Austin had attempted to nullify the agreements in August, despite a judge’s previous approval of the terms.
The plea deals involve Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and his two co-conspirators, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Under the agreements, the men are set to serve life sentences in exchange for admitting their involvement in the al-Qaeda plot that resulted in the deaths of 2,977 individuals.
The deadly 9/11 attacks saw hijackers crash two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a fourth intended for a federal government building in Washington, D.C., which instead crashed in a Pennsylvania field.
Secretary Austin had argued that the families of 9/11 victims and those impacted by the subsequent wars deserved to see the men face trial. However, the appeals court ruled that Austin could not block plea deals already approved. The court emphasized that the defendants’ admissions of guilt would effectively negate any potential new trials.
A senior Defense Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that both the Defense and Justice Departments are reviewing the ruling and considering their options. On Tuesday, the US government filed a motion to delay the plea agreements until January 27, allowing officials time to determine whether to pursue further legal action. A motions hearing in Mohammed’s case is set for January 6.
The appeals court’s decision upholds a prior ruling by Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, a military commission judge, who concluded in November that the plea deals were valid. McCall further argued that allowing Austin to rescind them would give him an “absolute veto” over decisions made by the officer appointed to oversee the cases.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the most notorious terrorists, was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in March 2003, and subsequently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he has remained since.

Title: ISRO’s SPADEX Mission: A giant leap in space technology, elevating India among global leaders
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:54:51 +0000
Content: ISRO’s Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX) has marked a pivotal achievement in space technology, positioning India among the global leaders in space docking.
Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh hailed the mission as a landmark moment during a press briefing in New Delhi, following the successful launch of PSLV-C60 from Sriharikota on Monday.
Dr. Singh emphasized that SPADEX is a critical ISRO mission focused on developing and demonstrating key technologies for spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking.
Using two small satellites, the mission aims to advance capabilities vital for satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary exploration.
Highlighting the mission’s primary objectives, Dr. Singh noted that SPADEX will demonstrate technology for spacecraft rendezvous and docking, showcase controllability in docked conditions to extend the lifespan of target spacecraft, and test power transfer between docked satellites.
He added that post-docking activities would include independent payload operations by the spacecraft, with docking expected to occur on Tuesday, January 7, 2025.
Dr. Singh also underscored a significant collaboration between ISRO and the Department of Biotechnology, focusing on “space-biology” to study physiological changes in space environments, with India aiming to lead in this emerging field under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.
Reflecting on the evolution of India’s space journey, Dr. Singh credited Prime Minister Modi’s vision for opening the space sector to private industry through the 2023 New Space Policy, which has accelerated innovation and private sector participation.
The policy’s impact has been evident in the rapid growth of space startups, which have surged from just a handful in 2021 to nearly 300 by 2023.
Notable startups like AgniKul Cosmos and Skyroot Aerospace have attracted global attention, establishing private launchpads and executing key missions on ISRO’s premises.
Dr. Singh highlighted India’s burgeoning space economy, valued at $8.4 billion in 2023, with projections to grow to $44 billion by 2033.
Investments in the sector reached ₹1000 crore in 2023 alone, positioning India as a major player on the global stage.
Looking ahead, Dr. Singh outlined a series of ambitious milestones, including advancements in NAVIC satellite technology in January 2025, the launch of a US satellite for mobile communication in February 2025, and Vyommitra, a female humanoid robot, performing astronaut-like tasks for the Gaganyaan mission.
He also mentioned India’s first crewed Gaganyaan mission set for 2026, the launch of India’s own space station, Bharat Antariksh, in 2035, and plans for India to land its first astronaut on the moon by 2047.
Dr. Singh also highlighted significant achievements from 2024, including the successful Aditya L1 solar mission and the launch of satellites for international clients.
He stressed the growing global reliance on ISRO’s satellite launch services, noting that 85% of the €220 million earned through launching foreign satellites over the past eight years came from ISRO’s recent efforts.
Moreover, Dr. Singh emphasised the broad application of space technologies in various sectors such as agriculture, defense, water management, and infrastructure development.
Initiatives like Mission Mausam, aimed at enhancing weather forecasting, further demonstrate India’s growing capabilities in space technology.

Title: Putin tells Russians at New Year that ‘everything will be fine’
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:10:13 +0000
Content: President Vladimir Putin told Russians in a New Year address that the country would move forward with confidence in 2025, though he offered no specific promises on the economy or the war in Ukraine.
At a time when many ordinary people are worried about rising prices and the central bank’s 21% interest rate is squeezing businesses and homebuyers, Putin reassured Russians that their wellbeing was his top priority.
He framed Russia’s challenges as part of a wider historic mission, evoking past victories including its role in the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two.
Russia, he said, had overcome trials, achieved major goals and strengthened its unity in the first quarter of the 21st century – a period coinciding exactly with his time as its paramount leader.
“And now, on the threshold of the new year, we are thinking about the future. We are confident that everything will be fine, we will only move forward. We know for sure that the absolute value for us was, is and will be the fate of Russia, the well-being of its citizens,” he said.
His three-and-a-half-minute seasonal message from the Kremlin was being broadcast at midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones, starting with Kamchatka and Chukotka in the far east.
He was speaking exactly 25 years since he first addressed the nation as its acting president after Boris Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly on the last day of 1999.
Putin, 72, paid tribute to Russian soldiers fighting in the war in Ukraine, describing them as heroes. “We are proud of your courage and bravery. We believe in you,” he said.
He made no specific reference to the situation on the battlefield or the prospects for an end to the conflict after Donald Trump returns as U.S. president on Jan. 20. Trump has said he will swiftly stop the war, without providing details.
LOSSES IN UKRAINE
Russian forces in 2024 advanced in Ukraine at the fastest rate since 2022, the war’s first year, and control about a fifth of the country. But the gains have come at the cost of heavy, though undisclosed, losses in men and equipment.
In 2024, Russia was invaded for the first time since World War Two as Ukraine grabbed a slice of its western Kursk region in a surprise counter-attack on Aug. 6.
Russia has yet to eject Ukrainian forces from Kursk despite bringing in more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, according to Ukrainian, South Korean and U.S. assessments. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence.
“To sustain even the very slow advance in Ukraine, Russia has been forced to ignore the months-long occupation of part of its own territory by Ukrainian forces,” British security expert Ruth Deyermond said.
“Taking a ‘nothing to see here’ attitude to the loss of its own land is not what great powers do, particularly one so preoccupied with the idea of state sovereignty.”
Deyermond, in a long thread posted on X, suggested Putin’s efforts to portray Russia as a leading world power were also undermined by the toppling of its chief Middle East ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and its increasing dependence on China.
Putin, the longest-serving ruler of Russia since Josef Stalin, said on Dec. 19 that under his leadership the country had moved back from “the edge of the abyss” and rebuffed threats to its sovereignty.
With hindsight, he said, he should not have waited until February 2022 before launching his “special military operation” in Ukraine, the term he still uses for the full-scale invasion of Russia’s neighbour.

Title: Russia halts gas exports to Europe via Ukraine
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 06:06:34 +0000
Content: Russia’s energy giant Gazprom said on Wednesday that gas exports via Ukraine to Europe had been halted from 08:00 Moscow time (0500 GMT) as the transit deal has expired.
The shutdown of Russia’s oldest gas route to Europe ends a decade of fraught relations sparked by Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014.
Russia still exports gas via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea.
The European Union redoubled its efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian energy after the outbreak of the military conflict in Ukraine in 2022 by seeking alternative sources.
The five-year gas transit deal between Russia and Ukraine expired in early hours of Jan. 1, 2025, while Kyiv has repeatedly said it would not extend the agreement amid the war.
“Due to the repeated and clearly expressed refusal of the Ukrainian side to renew these agreements, Gazprom was deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through the territory of Ukraine from January 1, 2025,” Gazprom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.
“Starting from 08:00 Moscow time, the supply of Russian gas for its transportation through the territory of Ukraine is not carried out.”

Title: Vaishno devi shrine welcomes 94.83 lakh devotees in 2024, second-highest footfall in a decade
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:53:36 +0000
Content: Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a significant surge in pilgrim footfall in 2024, with 94.83 lakh devotees visiting the sacred site. This marks the second-highest number of visitors recorded in a decade, according to Anshul Garg, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board (SMVDSB).
Sharing the milestone, Garg said, “94.83 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine in 2024, the second-highest number in a decade.”
This marks the third consecutive year that the shrine has exceeded 90 lakh in annual footfall. On December 12, Garg said that visitor numbers had surpassed 90 lakh for the year, consistent with trends from previous years. “Last year, we crossed 95 lakh, and this year’s yatra has followed a similar pattern,” he said.
Garg emphasized that efforts are underway to enhance facilities for pilgrims, with infrastructure initiatives aimed at improving the overall experience. He highlighted the positive impact of improved connectivity, including projects like the Vande Bharat train and the upcoming Delhi-Katra Express, which are expected to further boost footfall in the region.
“We are continuously working on multiple projects to provide better facilities for devotees. Infrastructure initiatives, such as the New Vaishnavi Bhawan with family rooms, an exit track for smoother crowd movement, and an all-weather queue complex at Darshani Deodi and Banganga, are set to be completed by 2025,” Garg announced in a post on December 8.

Title: South Korea crash investigation ramps up as funeral procedures begin
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:44:39 +0000
Content: The investigation into the crash of a South Korea passenger jet gathered pace on Wednesday as bereaved families began to prepare funerals after authorities finished formally identifying the 179 victims of the country’s worst air disaster.
The transport ministry said South Korean investigators have extracted the data from the plane’s cockpit voice recorder and will convert it into an audio file, critical information to try to explain the few minutes that led up to the crash.
The investigation team is still working to extract the contents of the flight data recorder, which was found missing a key connector, the ministry said.
All 175 passengers and four of the six crew members were killed on Sunday when the Jeju Air 089590.KS jet belly-landed at Muan International Airport in the country’s southwest and slammed into a sand-and-concrete embankment at the end of the runway, where it burst into flames.
Two crew members, located near the tail of the Boeing 737-800, survived the disaster.
The government has declared a national mourning period until Jan. 4 and the country will scale back New Year’s celebrations.
The transport ministry said two more U.S. officials arrived late on Tuesday to join a team of around two dozen investigators including from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration, and aircraft maker Boeing BA.N.
“They’re also planning to start a visual investigation into the wreckage,” deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan told a briefing.
Officials have said investigators were expected to examine whether a bird strike, a failure of the landing gear to drop or if problems with any other control systems played a role in the disaster.
They will also investigate the pilot’s apparent rush to attempt a landing right after he had declared an emergency, officials have said.
Air safety experts have also questioned if the airport embankment designed to prop up navigation equipment was built too close to the end of the runway.
South Korea’s acting President Choi Sang-mok on Wednesday called for a fair and objective investigation, and said funeral procedures have begun after all the victims were formally identified.
“The most urgent matter at present is to return the victims to their families,” Choi told an intra-agency meeting.
Airport authorities set up an altar late on Tuesday and on Wednesday buses carried relatives of victims to the crash site so that they could pay their respects, just metres from the crashed plane’s charred and broken tail – the only relatively intact part of the aircraft following the accident.
The Muan airport was brimming with mourners seeking to pay their tributes at the altar, leading to a queue of several hundred metres.
County officials sent an alert to urge visitors to go instead to a larger memorial set up in a sport complex about 9 km (5 miles) from the crash site.
It could still take several days until all bereaved relatives are able to secure the release of the bodies of their loved ones.

Title: Year-End Review 2024: key achievements by the Ministry of Culture
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:11:54 +0000
Content: In 2024, the Ministry of Culture made significant strides in preserving and promoting India’s rich heritage. 
Hosting the prestigious 46th World Heritage Committee session, inscribing new sites, and launching initiatives like Project PARI marked a vibrant year for Indian culture. 
Among the year’s highlights were major cultural collaborations, including a landmark agreement with the USA to combat antiquities trafficking, the development of the world’s largest museum in New Delhi, and the recognition of five new classical languages. 
From global Buddhist expositions to the Har Ghar Tiranga campaign, India’s cultural and patriotic spirit soared, further reinforcing the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its diverse history for future generations. 
Delhi Hosts 46th World Heritage Committee session
One of the most significant cultural events of 2024 was the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Delhi from July 21 to 31.
Attended by nearly 2,900 delegates from over 140 countries, including UNESCO officials, Ministers of Culture, and Ambassadors, the session saw India’s “Moidams—the Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty” from Assam inscribed on the World Heritage List. This brought India’s total to 43 sites on the prestigious list. 
Project PARI: Celebrating Public Art in India 
Launched during the World Heritage session, Project PARI (Public Art of India) mobilized over 200 artists and 300 students to create murals, sculptures, and wall paintings across Delhi. The initiative represents a major effort to promote public art and heritage conservation. 
India and USA Sign Cultural Property Agreement
A landmark Cultural Property Agreement between India and the USA was signed on July 26, 2024, to curb illicit antiquities trafficking. As part of this agreement, 297 artifacts will be repatriated from the USA to India, marking a major win in preserving India’s cultural history. 
World’s Largest Museum Takes Shape in New Delhi

Recognition of Five New Classical Languages 
In October 2024, Assamese, Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, and Bengali were officially declared classical languages, bringing the total number of recognised classical languages in India to 11.
This step is expected to enhance linguistic research and global recognition. 
Major Buddhist Events and Expositions 
The Ministry played a key role in organizing significant Buddhist events, including the First Asian Buddhist Summit in November and a 26-day exposition of Lord Buddha’s relics in Thailand.
The relics attracted over 4 million devotees, strengthening India’s ties with its Buddhist heritage. 
Indian Literary Works Gain Global Recognition 
In May 2024, three iconic Indian texts—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahrdayāloka-Locana—were added to UNESCO’s MOWCAP (Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific) register, highlighting India’s enduring literary legacy. 
Patriotic spirit soars with Har Ghar Tiranga campaign 
The Har Ghar Tiranga campaign, which took place from August 9 to 15, saw over 5 crore people upload selfies with the national flag.
The initiative, supported by Tiranga runs and rallies, reignited a sense of national pride and unity across the country. 
Cultural Celebrations and Museum Inaugurations 
The Ministry commemorated key milestones, including the 350th anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation and the inauguration of the Humayun’s Tomb World Heritage Site Museum. 
Exhibitions such as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day further emphasized the Ministry’s dedication to preserving India’s historical and cultural legacy. 
Celebrating Icons of India’s Cultural and Spiritual Legacy

Title: Protesters in Bangladesh demand July uprising proclamation by January 15
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 05:06:51 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Dhaka on Tuesday to demand justice for victims of the July uprising against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. Organized under the banner of “Students Against Discrimination,” the protest saw a massive turnout at the Central Shaheed Minar, where participants observed a minute of silence to honor those who lost their lives during the violent clashes, the Dhaka Tribune reported.
The event, termed the “March for Unity,” began at 4:00 p.m. and was supported by the Jatiya Nagorik Committee. Both groups have announced further demonstrations if the government fails to issue a formal Proclamation of the July Uprising by January 15.
“We still do not have an official proclamation acknowledging the July mass uprising. It must be issued by January 15. That day, we will reunite here with the proclamation in hand,” said Hasnat Abdullah, convener of Students Against Discrimination. He vowed to continue the fight against what he called “fascism” under the Awami League, accusing the government of conspiring against their movement through the Secretariat, police, and judiciary.
Nasiruddin Patwary, convener of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, echoed Abdullah’s sentiments. “We envision a new Bangladesh that rejects intimidation, corruption, and extortion. The Awami League and Sheikh Hasina must be held accountable,” he stated, as quoted by The Daily Star.
Protesters also demanded that the next election pave the way for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. Akhtar Hossain, member secretary of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, emphasized this point, while Arif Sohel of Students Against Discrimination reiterated that the proclamation must uphold the rights of farmers, laborers, and basic human necessities such as food, education, and healthcare.
The July uprising, which began as a student-led movement demanding reforms in the government’s controversial job quota system, escalated into weeks of protests and violent clashes. Over 600 people were reportedly killed, and Sheikh Hasina, 76, was forced to flee to India. An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus has since taken over.
The unrest gained momentum after tens of thousands of students took to the streets, challenging the reservation of 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans from the 1971 war of independence. The Hasina-led government responded by suspending mobile internet services on July 17 and imposing a curfew.
Despite initially peaceful demonstrations, violence erupted when police and pro-government student groups attacked protesters. According to Bangladesh’s Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, at least 147 people were killed in the clashes. However, Students Against Discrimination claimed the death toll exceeded 266.

Title: Indian navy to commission three frontline fleet assets: Nilgiri, Surat, and Vaghsheer
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 12:24:13 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy is set to commission three major fleet assets—Nilgiri, Surat, and Vaghsheer—on January 15, at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. This marks a significant development in India’s maritime capabilities and indigenous shipbuilding initiatives.
The Nilgiri, the lead ship of the Project 17A stealth frigates, represents an upgrade over the Shivalik-class frigates. The vessel features advanced technology designed to reduce radar signatures. Similarly, the Surat is the fourth and final ship in the Project 15B stealth destroyer class, building on the capabilities of the Kolkata-class destroyers. Both ships were designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau and equipped with advanced sensors and weapon systems developed domestically or through international partnerships.
The Nilgiri and Surat are equipped to operate various helicopters, including Chetak, ALH, Sea King, and MH-60R, for day and night operations. These ships include systems such as the Rail-Less Helicopter Traversing System and a Visual Aid and Landing System to enhance aviation efficiency. Accommodations have also been added to support women officers and sailors, reflecting the Navy’s policy of expanding combat roles for women.

Title: India’s tobacco exports surge to a record high of Rs 12,005 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:25:26 +0000
Content: India’s tobacco exports have witnessed a surge of 87 percent over the past five years, reaching a record Rs 12,005.89 crore ($1.45 billion) in the 2023-24 fiscal year, compared to Rs 6,408.15 crore in 2019-20. This remarkable growth has resulted in a more than twofold increase in farmers’ income, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Export volumes also saw a substantial increase, rising from 218.84 million kg to 315.51 million kg during the same period, the ministry said.
“As the Tobacco Board celebrates its formation day, we are proud to highlight that the earnings of Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers have more than doubled between 2019-20 and 2023-24—from Rs 124.00 per kg in 2019-20 to Rs 279.54 per kg in 2023-24,” the ministry added.
The surge in international demand for Indian FCV tobacco has been a key factor driving this historic growth. This not only benefited tobacco farmers but also significantly boosted the nation’s foreign exchange earnings through exports.
India is the world’s second-largest producer of tobacco, following China, and ranks as the fourth-largest producer of FCV tobacco globally, behind China, Brazil, and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, India is the second-largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, in terms of quantity, after Brazil.
“The 2023-24 crop season has been especially remarkable for FCV tobacco farmers across Andhra Pradesh,” the statement said.
The Tobacco Board has implemented a series of strategic measures to ensure the growth and sustainability of India’s tobacco industry. These initiatives include crop planning and regulation of production to meet both domestic and export demands.

Title: Researchers find vital link between inflammation and depression
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:22:50 +0000
Content: Researchers have unveiled transformative insights into the relationship between inflammation and depression, which could fundamentally change our understanding of the biological underpinnings of depression.
The research by neuroscientist Professor Raz Yirmiya from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem extends well beyond the confines of the laboratory.
His discoveries about the role of microglia cells and interleukin-1 in stress-induced depression raise intriguing questions about therapeutic interventions: How might understanding inflammatory processes lead to more targeted treatments? What role do different types of immune responses play in various forms of depression?
“Most depressed patients do not have any overt inflammatory disease. However, we and others found that exposure to stress, which is the most significant trigger of depression in humans and animals, also activates inflammatory processes, particularly in the brain,” Yirmiya explained in a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published in the journal Brain Medicine.
Through innovative approaches combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies, Yirmiya’s team identified several promising therapeutic targets.
Their work on microglial checkpoint mechanisms and stress-related resilience opens new avenues for understanding how the immune system influences mental health. These findings suggest the potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.
“My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes,” said Yirmiya.
His work suggests that both activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches.
Yirmiya’s interview, published in Brain Medicine, is part of a larger series highlighting the visionaries behind some of today’s most influential scientific ideas.
Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future,” said the authors.

Title: Cabinet approves extension of DAP subsidy to support farmers
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:58:13 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet has approved an extension of the One-time Special Package on Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP). This package, providing an additional subsidy of ₹3,500 per metric tonne over the existing Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS), will now continue beyond January 1, 2025, until further notice. The decision aims to ensure the continued availability of DAP at affordable prices for farmers.
Implementation Details
The additional subsidy will be provided over and above the ongoing NBS scheme, which has governed subsidies for 28 grades of phosphorus and potassium (P&K) fertilizers since its inception on April 1, 2010. This decision extends the Cabinet’s July 2024 approval of the subsidy, initially applicable from April 2024 to December 2024, which involved a financial outlay of approximately ₹2,625 crore.
Objective
The extended package will support farmers by ensuring a steady supply of DAP at stable prices, despite global market fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainties. The move is part of the government’s broader strategy to maintain uninterrupted fertilizer supply during key agricultural seasons, including Kharif and Rabi crops for the 2024-25 period.

Title: Cabinet approves continuation of PM Fasal Bima Yojana, weather crop insurance scheme
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:45:37 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) until 2025-26, with an overall outlay of Rs. 69,515 crore for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. The decision aims to provide crucial risk coverage for crops affected by non-preventable natural calamities, benefiting farmers across the country.
The Cabinet has also approved the establishment of the Fund for Innovation and Technology (FIAT) with a corpus of Rs. 824 crore. This fund will support large-scale technological infusion, ensuring greater transparency and improved claim calculation and settlement under the scheme.
Technological advancements for crop insurance
The YES-TECH (Yield Estimation System using Technology) initiative will play a key role in the enhanced implementation of the scheme. YES-TECH utilizes remote sensing technology for yield estimation, giving at least 30% weightage to technology-based yield estimates. At present, nine major states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, have adopted this system, with additional states being onboarded quickly. With the wider rollout of YES-TECH, traditional crop-cutting experiments will be phased out. 
For the 2023-24 season, claim calculation and settlement have already been completed under YES-TECH. Madhya Pradesh has fully adopted technology-based yield estimation.
Focus on northeastern states 
The government is prioritizing the saturation of crop insurance coverage for farmers in the northeastern states. The Centre will continue to share 90% of the premium subsidy for these states. However, due to the voluntary nature of the scheme and the relatively low gross cropped area in these regions, the government has provided flexibility for states to reallocate funds to other development projects and schemes, avoiding the surrender of unused funds.

Content: A driver crashed his pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year’s Day in New Orleans’ French Quarter and opened fire, killing 10 people and injuring more than 35, in an early morning attack the FBI said was a potential act of terrorism.
 
The suspect died after a shootout with police, law enforcement officials said.
 
“This man was trying to run over as many people as he could,” Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said at a televised press conference on Wednesday. “He was hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”
 
The incident occurred at 3:15 a.m. at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets, a historic tourist destination in the city’s French Quarter known for attracting large crowds with its music and bars.
 
Kirkpatrick said the driver, who swerved around barricades, fired at police and struck two police officers from the vehicle after it crashed. The officers were in stable condition, she added.
 
“We know the perpetrator has been killed,” said New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas. “As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of evil.”
 
There was no immediate word on the driver’s identity.
 
More than 300 officers were on duty at the time of the incident, police said. The city hosts the Sugar Bowl, a classic American college football game, each New Year’s Day, and will also be the site of the NFL Super Bowl on Feb. 9.
 
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called the incident a “terrorist attack.”
 
The FBI said in a statement that it was investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Initially, Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, had said it was not a terrorist event.
 
Duncan said a suspected improvised explosive device was found but provided no further details.

Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:26:03 +0000
Content: Bangladesh’s Chief of Army Staff, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has praised the strong ties between Bangladesh and India, calling India an “important neighbour” on which Dhaka relies in many ways.
 In an interview with Prothom Alo, General Zaman highlighted the mutual dependence between the two nations, noting that many Bangladeshis visit India for medical treatment and that a significant amount of goods are imported from India.
He emphasized that the relationship is built on a “give and take” dynamic, where both countries benefit and must maintain fairness and equality in their dealings.
“India is an important neighbour, and we are dependent on India in many ways. But India also benefits from us. Many Indians work here in both formal and informal sectors, and Bangladesh’s stability is crucial to India’s interests. This relationship is one of give and take, and it must be based on fairness,” General Zaman said.
He stressed the importance of ensuring that the people of Bangladesh do not feel dominated by India, calling for relations that respect equality and shared interests.
When asked about ongoing talks between the two nations on unresolved issues, General Zaman affirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to not act against India’s strategic interests and expects the same in return.
He highlighted that stability in areas like the Chittagong Hill Tracts and along the Myanmar border is essential, as is addressing concerns such as border killings and water-sharing. “We must look after each other’s interests with equal importance,” he added.
General Zaman’s remarks came amidst broader diplomatic engagements between India and Bangladesh. Earlier in December, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Dhaka, marking the first high-level visit since Sheikh Hasina was deposed as Prime Minister in August 2024.
Misri expressed India’s desire to work closely with Bangladesh’s Interim Government, led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, particularly on issues related to the safety and welfare of minorities, including Hindus, in Bangladesh.
During a press conference with Bangladesh’s Foreign Adviser, Md Touhid Hossain, Misri addressed recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties and called for a constructive approach to ensure the safety of all communities.
He reiterated the long-standing people-centric relationship between the two nations, underpinned by cooperation in trade, connectivity, power, and water, among other areas.
The ongoing dialogue between India and Bangladesh continues to focus on fostering stability, mutual respect, and shared growth, reflecting the deep ties that have developed over decades of collaboration.

Title: India’s tobacco exports surge to a record high of Rs 12,005 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:25:26 +0000
Content: India’s tobacco exports have witnessed a surge of 87 percent over the past five years, reaching a record Rs 12,005.89 crore ($1.45 billion) in the 2023-24 fiscal year, compared to Rs 6,408.15 crore in 2019-20. This remarkable growth has resulted in a more than twofold increase in farmers’ income, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Export volumes also saw a substantial increase, rising from 218.84 million kg to 315.51 million kg during the same period, the ministry said.
“As the Tobacco Board celebrates its formation day, we are proud to highlight that the earnings of Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers have more than doubled between 2019-20 and 2023-24—from Rs 124.00 per kg in 2019-20 to Rs 279.54 per kg in 2023-24,” the ministry added.
The surge in international demand for Indian FCV tobacco has been a key factor driving this historic growth. This not only benefited tobacco farmers but also significantly boosted the nation’s foreign exchange earnings through exports.
India is the world’s second-largest producer of tobacco, following China, and ranks as the fourth-largest producer of FCV tobacco globally, behind China, Brazil, and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, India is the second-largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, in terms of quantity, after Brazil.
“The 2023-24 crop season has been especially remarkable for FCV tobacco farmers across Andhra Pradesh,” the statement said.
The Tobacco Board has implemented a series of strategic measures to ensure the growth and sustainability of India’s tobacco industry. These initiatives include crop planning and regulation of production to meet both domestic and export demands.

Title: Researchers find vital link between inflammation and depression
Publication Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:22:50 +0000
Content: Researchers have unveiled transformative insights into the relationship between inflammation and depression, which could fundamentally change our understanding of the biological underpinnings of depression.
The research by neuroscientist Professor Raz Yirmiya from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem extends well beyond the confines of the laboratory.
His discoveries about the role of microglia cells and interleukin-1 in stress-induced depression raise intriguing questions about therapeutic interventions: How might understanding inflammatory processes lead to more targeted treatments? What role do different types of immune responses play in various forms of depression?
“Most depressed patients do not have any overt inflammatory disease. However, we and others found that exposure to stress, which is the most significant trigger of depression in humans and animals, also activates inflammatory processes, particularly in the brain,” Yirmiya explained in a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published in the journal Brain Medicine.
Through innovative approaches combining molecular techniques with behavioral studies, Yirmiya’s team identified several promising therapeutic targets.
Their work on microglial checkpoint mechanisms and stress-related resilience opens new avenues for understanding how the immune system influences mental health. These findings suggest the potential for developing personalized treatments based on individual inflammatory profiles.
“My overarching aim is to harness the extensive knowledge from my research and others to accelerate the development of novel antidepressant therapeutics targeting inflammatory processes,” said Yirmiya.
His work suggests that both activation and suppression of the immune system can trigger depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches.
Yirmiya’s interview, published in Brain Medicine, is part of a larger series highlighting the visionaries behind some of today’s most influential scientific ideas.
Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future,” said the authors.

Title: BGT 2024-25: India heach coach Gautam Gambhir dismisses dressing room leak reports
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 07:19:44 +0000
Content: Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir has dismissed recent reports about dressing room leaks as baseless rumours, saying that they do not reflect the truth.
Addressing the media on Thursday, Gambhir clarified that the alleged incidents, which surfaced online following the Melbourne Test, were exaggerated and did not warrant a response.
Media speculation suggested that Gambhir was unhappy with the players’ performance during the fourth Test against Australia and conveyed his disappointment to the team. India has been struggling in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, particularly in the batting department. Star players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have failed to live up to their reputations, prompting fans to call for both players to reevaluate their roles in the team.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of the Sydney Test, Gambhir highlighted the value of honesty in fostering team growth. “Those are just reports; they are not the truth, and I don’t feel the need to address them,” Gambhir said. “There were some honest words exchanged in the dressing room. Honesty is crucial if we want to achieve something great as a team,” he added.
Australia’s commanding 184-run victory in the Melbourne Test gave them a 2-1 lead in the series and ended India’s hopes of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final at Lord’s next year. The final match of the series will take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, starting January 3, with India aiming to level the series.
The India squad for the Sydney Test is as follows:
Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma (captain), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Sarfaraz Khan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Prasidh Krishna, Shubman Gill, Devdutt Padikkal, Tanush Kotian, Dhruv Jurel, and Harshit Rana.

Title: Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly attacks, Including New Orleans truck incident
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 07:17:32 +0000
Content: The radical Islamic State group, which once imposed a reign of terror over millions of people in Syria and Iraq, has been implicated in the truck attack on a New Orleans crowd, which killed 15 people and injured about 30.
The suspect, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas who once served in Afghanistan, was flying an Islamic State flag during the assault.
U.S. President Joe Biden said that the FBI reported to him that a mere hours before the attack that Jabbar posted videos on social media indicating that he’s inspired by Islamic State.
Following are facts about the movement, considered to be more violent and extremist than Al Qaeda.
RECENT OPERATIONS
The Islamic State group on Wednesday claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland a day earlier, the group posted on its Telegram channel.
In its statement, Islamic State said the attack was conducted by 12 militants and two booby-trapped vehicles, adding that it killed around 22 military personnel from the Puntland forces and injured dozens of others.
Though largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago, IS has managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild.
They include an assault on a Russian concert hall in March 2024, that killed at least 143 people and two explosions in the Iranian city of Kerman in January that killed nearly 100 people.
It also claimed responsibility for an assault by suicide attackers on a mosque in Oman last year that killed at least nine people.
Aside from its bloody operations in the Middle East, Islamic State also inspired lone wolf attacks in the West.
In August of 2024, authorities said a 19-year-old Austrian suspected of masterminding a planned attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had vowed allegiance to the leader of Islamic State.
HISTORY
At the height of its power from 2014-2017, the IS “caliphate” held sway over a wide area of Syria and Iraq, imposing death and torture on opponents of its radical brand of Islam. Its fighters repeatedly defeated both countries’ armies and carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.
Its then leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killed in 2019 by U.S. special forces in northwestern Syria, rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself “caliph” of all Muslims.
The caliphate collapsed in Iraq, where it once had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and in Syria, after a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition.
The new leader, known by a pseudonym Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, remains shrouded in secrecy.
NEW TACTICS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
IS has switched tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.
Once based in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, from which it sought to rule like a centralised government, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.
Its fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, its leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The U.N. estimates it at 10,000 in its heartlands.
The movement went underground with sleeper cells that launch hit-and-run attacks, according to an Iraqi government security adviser who helps track IS.
All key foreign fighters fled Iraq for countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan. Most have joined Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.
It is active along Iran’s borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Sanaullah Ghafari, the 29-year-old leader of the Afghan branch of IS, has overseen its transformation into one of the most fearsome branches of the global Islamist network, capable of operations far from its bases in the borderlands of Afghanistan.
AFRICA
Islamic State – often called ISIS, ISIL, or the pejorative Daesh – has also made its mark in parts of Africa.
In Uganda, militants from IS-connected rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), staged a series of attacks including a massacre at a boarding school, the murder of a honeymooning couple and a raid on a village that killed at least three people.
The group, which started as an uprising in Uganda, has largely moved its operations to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where it has staged multiple attacks.
Several other groups have pledged allegiance to IS in West Africa and across the Sahel. Affiliates have control of large areas of rural Mali, Niger and northern Burkina Faso and into North Africa.
In January 2023, the U.S. military carried out an operation that killed a senior IS leader in northern Somalia. The U.N. fears militant groups could exploit the political instability in Sudan, which is gripped by a civil war.
OVERALL STRENGTH
The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center has said the threat posed by IS and another militant group al Qaeda “is at a low point with the suppression of the most dangerous elements”.
But it went on to warn that half of IS’s branches are now active in insurgencies across Africa and “may be poised for further expansion”.
It said the group had lost three overall leaders and at least 13 other senior operatives in Iraq and Syria since early 2022 “contributing to a loss of expertise and a decline in ISIS attacks in the Middle East”.

Title: Bangladesh: Court rejects bail plea of spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:59:41 +0000
Content: A court in Chattogram has denied bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das, the former ISKCON leader, after a hearing today marked by heightened security, The Daily Star reported.
Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Saiful Islam turned down the bail request following a 30-minute hearing of both parties’ arguments, according to Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Advocate Mofizur Haque Bhuiyan.
Earlier, 11 Supreme Court lawyers had arrived to participate in the bail hearing for Chinmoy Krishna Das. Lawyer Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee confirmed the group’s participation, stating, “We have come to Chattogram under the banner of Ainjibi Oikya Parishad, and we will move for Chinmoy in the court for his bail. I already got the Vakalatnama from Chinmoy.
As a member of both the Supreme Court and Chattogram Bar associations, I do not need authorization from any local lawyer to move the case.”
On December 3, 2024, the Chattogram court had set January 2 for the bail hearing after the prosecution requested additional time and there were no lawyers present to represent Chinmoy.
The controversy stems from the sedition charges filed against Chinmoy Krishna Das, who allegedly raised a saffron flag above Bangladesh’s national flag in Chittagong on October 25.
His subsequent arrest on November 25 sparked widespread protests, which led to violent clashes between his supporters and law enforcement outside the Chattogram Court Building on November 27, resulting in the death of a lawyer.
The situation escalated after additional arrests, including two monks—Adipurush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das Brahmachari—who were detained on November 29 after visiting Chinmoy Krishna Das in custody. ISKCON’s Vice President, Radha Raman, also reported that rioters vandalized an ISKCON center in Bangladesh during the unrest.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has expressed concern over the increasing violence and extremist rhetoric in Bangladesh, highlighting its ongoing efforts to raise the issue of targeted attacks on minorities with the government in Dhaka.

Title: Loan against gold on the rise; RBI flags concerns over irregular practices in gold lending
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:57:37 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported a sharp surge in gold loans across the country, reflecting an increasing dependence on gold as collateral to meet financial needs. According to the RBI’s report, gold loans saw significant growth in the period ending September 2024 compared to the same period a year earlier.
“Gold loans have clocked rapid growth in the period ending September 2024 as compared to a year ago,” the RBI said, underscoring the growing popularity of this financial instrument.
However, the central bank also raised concerns over irregular practices observed among certain supervised entities (SEs) involved in gold lending. To address these issues, the RBI issued comprehensive guidelines on September 30, 2024, directing SEs to review their policies, processes, and practices.
The report identified several gaps, including deficiencies in outsourcing practices, discrepancies in gold valuation, inadequate due diligence, and insufficient monitoring of the end use of loan funds. These measures aim to ensure that the rapid growth in gold loan portfolios remains sustainable and free from malpractice.
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) continue to dominate the gold loan segment, holding a substantial 59.9% share of total gold loans disbursed by both banks and NBFCs as of March 2024. This underscores their critical role in catering to borrowers who rely on gold jewelry and ornaments for securing loans.
“NBFCs maintained their dominance in loans against the pledge of gold ornaments and jewelry, with a share of 59.9% of total gold loans (banks and NBFCs together) at end-March 2024,” the RBI highlighted in its report.
In contrast, the report noted a slowdown in credit growth in other retail lending categories. Growth in unsecured personal loans has slowed significantly since September 2023, while microfinance and self-help group (SHG) loans saw their growth rates drop by over two-thirds in the past year.

Title: PM Modi praises Maharashtra’s efforts in developing Maoist affected areas
Publication Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2025 05:47:12 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday praised the Maharashtra government for its initiatives in driving development in Maoist-affected areas of the state.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister wrote, “I laud the Maharashtra Government’s efforts to ensure all-round development in remote and Maoist-affected areas. This will certainly boost the ‘Ease of Living’ and pave the way for even more progress. A special congratulations to my sisters and brothers of Gadchiroli and the surrounding areas!”
The statement comes after 11 Maoists, including a senior leader, surrendered on Wednesday in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who spent New Year’s Day in Gadchiroli district.
Among the surrendered Maoists were eight women and three men, including two couples. They carried rewards amounting to over Rs 1 crore in Maharashtra, with additional bounties from the Chhattisgarh government.
The group included Tarakka, the head of the Dandakaranya Zonal Committee and the wife of Bhupati, a prominent Maoist leader. Tarakka had been part of the Naxalite movement for 34 years.
The surrendered individuals also included three division committee members, one deputy commander, and two area committee members. They were provided financial assistance totalling Rs 86 lakh to support their rehabilitation.
In the last year, 24 Maoists have been killed and 18 arrested in Maharashtra. Over the past six months, 27 hardcore Maoists have joined the mainstream. CM Fadnavis highlighted that the northern part of Gadchiroli has been freed from Maoism, and efforts are ongoing to eliminate it from the southern region as well.
“In the last four years, not a single youth has joined the Maoist movement. As many as 11 villages have banned Naxalites, and the C-60 soldiers have earned the trust of the people,” said Fadnavis, stressing that residents now believe in achieving justice through the Indian Constitution rather than Maoist ideology.
CM Fadnavis announced that Gadchiroli is on the path to becoming a “Steel City” with support from PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. He assured that surrendered Maoists would be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.
The chief minister inaugurated various development projects during his visit, including a bus service from Aheri to Gardewada, a green mining project, and several initiatives by Lloyds Metals. These projects involve significant investments — Rs 400 crore worth DII Plant at Konsari will provide 700 jobs; Rs 3,000 crore worth Pellet Plant and Slurry Pipeline will provide 1,000 jobs; Rs 2,700 crore Iron Ore Grinding Plant at Hedri, Etapalli will provide 1,500 jobs; and Rs 20 crore Vanya Garment Unit which will provide 600 jobs.
Fadnavis also launched the Lloyds Kali Ammal Hospital and Lloyds Raj Vidyaniketan CBSE School, which will educate 1,200 students. He inaugurated residences for police, a gymkhana, and a kindergarten.

Karachi, another major city in Pakistan, ranks 13th on the list, with an AQI of 164, categorizing it as “Unhealthy.”
The dire air quality poses significant public health risks for the residents of both cities, with Lahore, home to over 11 million people, bearing the brunt of the crisis. Factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning have long contributed to Lahore’s poor air quality, intensifying during winter when smog envelops the region.
The health impact has been severe. In the past month alone, nearly 1.9 million people in Lahore have fallen ill due to smog-related issues, with over 129,000 seeking hospital treatment for respiratory ailments. Additionally, more than six million people have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions linked to air pollution, while an average of 69,000 individuals report daily symptoms such as chest pain, strokes, and other respiratory problems.
Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, faces similar challenges. Its busy port, heavy traffic, and sprawling industrial zones contribute significantly to its deteriorating air quality.

Short-validity passports were issued to those intending to continue their legal stay in the UAE. The Consulate’s services also encompassed lost passport reporting, labor cancellations, and immigration-related matters, with significant support from community organizations.

Launched in 2023, the scheme has significantly empowered artisans and craftspeople across 18 traditional trades. In 2024 alone, 24.77 lakh artisans registered under the scheme, receiving crucial support in skill development, credit, and market access.
This and other initiatives by the MSME Ministry have contributed to the sector’s vibrant growth, fostering entrepreneurship and employment across India.

Boosting MSME Formalization: The government’s focus on formalizing enterprises has been instrumental in giving MSMEs a formal identity and easing the process of doing business. By the end of December 2024, 5.70 crore MSMEs had registered on the Udyam platform, creating employment for over 24.14 crore people.
Enhanced Credit Support: The revamped Credit Guarantee Scheme has seen 19.90 lakh guarantees amounting to ₹2.44 lakh crore approved in 2024.
The scheme particularly benefits women entrepreneurs, with guarantee coverage increased to 90% for women-owned enterprises.
MSME-TEAM Initiative: Launched in June 2024, this initiative has digitally empowered 5 lakh MSMEs, half of which are owned by women entrepreneurs. It helps micro and small enterprises enter the e-commerce space by offering services like catalog preparation, account management, logistics, and packaging.
Yashasvini Campaign: Focused on gender parity, the Yashasvini Campaign was launched to formalize, mentor, and enhance the capacity of women entrepreneurs. Collaborating with NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Rural Development, the campaign has made significant strides towards empowering women.
International Collaboration: In 2024, the Ministry of MSME signed several significant Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with countries like the U.S. and Egypt, promoting bilateral cooperation and boosting the MSME sector through knowledge sharing and technology adoption.
Khadi and Village Industries: The Khadi and Village Industries sector has seen a dramatic rise in sales, from ₹33,135.90 crore in 2014-15 to ₹1,55,673.13 crore in 2023-24, driving socio-economic development in rural India.
These achievements underscore the Ministry’s efforts in making MSMEs a dynamic sector that plays a crucial role in India’s economic growth.
With continuous support for skill development, technological adoption, and innovation, the MSME sector is set to reach new heights in the coming years.
