Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Research examines better screening methods for statin use
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:29:10 +0000
Content: A new study in the United States is exploring the most effective method to screen and assess patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease and to determine who would benefit from statin medication to lower cholesterol.
Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have introduced a new approach that relies on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess risk and guide statin prescriptions. The CAC score is determined through a low-radiation computed tomography (CT) scan, which detects calcium deposits in plaques within the coronary arteries of the heart.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, the study’s principal investigator and a distinguished clinical and cardiovascular research physician at Intermountain Health, explained that the research aims to improve the selection process for patients who need statins. Instead of relying solely on coronary risk factor equations, the study examines whether direct imaging of plaque burden is a more effective indicator of risk.
The study, which has now enrolled over 5,600 patients, was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago on Saturday. As part of the research, patients’ risk assessment scores were shared with their physicians through letters, indicating whether a statin was recommended based on high-risk findings.
Initial findings revealed that while the two groups in the study had similar baseline characteristics, the rate of statin prescription recommendations varied significantly. The study is expected to conclude in early 2026, after which researchers will compare outcomes such as deaths, heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations over a follow-up period of up to seven years, with an average follow-up of over four years.
Understanding the most effective approach to statin prescription is crucial, given that these medications come with costs and potential side effects, including muscle aches and an increased risk of diabetes. The study’s findings could help refine treatment strategies for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

Title: ChatGPT can be used in sensory evaluation of foods, specifically brownies: study
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A recent study suggests that ChatGPT can be utilized in the sensory evaluation of foods, particularly brownies, offering insights that may streamline new product development and even enhance recipes.
Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US examined 15 different brownie recipes, ranging from traditional ingredient combinations to unconventional ones, such as mealworm powder and fish oil. Study author Damir Torrico, an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provided ChatGPT with these recipe formulas and asked it to describe the sensory characteristics of each brownie, including taste, texture, and overall appeal. He then categorized ChatGPT’s responses to determine whether they were positive, negative, or neutral.
Torrico noted that relying on human testers can sometimes slow down the evaluation process, especially when multiple product prototypes need assessment simultaneously. Sensory panels require time, coordination, and, in some cases, certain ingredients may not be food-grade, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This is why large language models like ChatGPT are being explored for sensory evaluation, as they have the potential to replicate certain human responses.
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s responses were overwhelmingly positive, even for brownies containing unusual ingredients. This aligns with a psychological concept known as “hedonic asymmetry,” which suggests that both humans and AI tend to describe beneficial experiences in more positive terms. Torrico explained that food plays a fundamental role in nourishment and energy, leading humans to respond positively to it. In attempting to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT appeared to exhibit the same tendency, always focusing on the positive aspects of the recipes.
The study suggests that AI can provide general insights into which products are worth further testing and which might not be suitable for a lengthy evaluation process. Torrico believes that ChatGPT could be further developed for sensory evaluation to assist the food industry. Moving forward, he plans to refine the experiment by training ChatGPT to use a vocabulary similar to that of a human descriptive panel.

Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:36:12 +0000
Content: The market outlook for the coming week will be shaped by a combination of domestic and global economic factors, including key indicators such as PMI data, foreign institutional investments (FIIs), auto sales figures, and major US economic data releases. Among the most closely watched developments will be the HSBC Composite PMI data for India, set to be released on Friday, while auto companies will begin reporting their sales figures from Monday.
On the global front, market sentiment will be influenced by policy developments related to India-US tariffs and the potential impact of former US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on finished vehicle imports, which is set to take effect from April 3. Additionally, investors will closely track the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a series of crucial US economic data releases, including job openings, non-farm payrolls, and the unemployment rate.
Last week, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with both the Nifty and Sensex posting gains of approximately 0.70%, closing at 23,519.35 and 77,414.92, respectively. Banking stocks played a key role in driving the rally, with Bank Nifty rising nearly 2% to settle at 51,564.81. Among sectoral indices, Nifty PSE and FMCG emerged as the top performers, whereas media and pharma stocks lagged behind.
Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree, infusing Rs 17,426 crore into equities between March 24 and 28, while domestic institutional investors contributed Rs 6,797 crore during the same period. This consistent inflow of foreign capital helped the Nifty post a 6.3% gain in March, reversing losses from the previous month and closing on a strong note.
The Indian stock market will remain closed on March 31 in observance of Eid.
According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, Nifty has strong support at 23,300, and if breached, it could decline towards 23,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could push the index towards 24,100, potentially extending the ongoing rally.

Title: GRAP-I restrictions revoked in Delhi-NCR as air quality improves
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 02:45:32 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Graded Response Action Plan – Stage I (GRAP-I) in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect after air quality improved in the city.
The decision came after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday clocked 153 as per the daily bulletin provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
The CAQM said that the AQI of the national capital showed significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR.
“AQI of Delhi has shown significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR. The AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 153 for 29.03.2025 (in ‘Moderate’ category). Further, the forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts AQI to mainly remain in the ‘Moderate’ category in the coming days,” CAQM said in a statement.
“Therefore, keeping in view this trend of improvement in the overall AQI of Delhi, the CAQM Sub-Committee unanimously decided to revoke Stage-I of the extant schedule of GRAP in the entire NCR, with immediate effect,” it added.
“All the agencies concerned are also required to take note of various actions and the targeted timelines as envisaged in the comprehensive policy issued by the Commission to curb air pollution in the NCR and take appropriate actions accordingly in the field, particularly the dust mitigation measures for C&amp;D activities &amp; Roads/Open areas, which becomes a pre-dominant factor in the coming months determining the air quality in Delhi-NCR,” CAQM further said.
“The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and review the situation from time to time for further appropriate decision depending upon the air quality in Delhi and the forecast made by IMD/ IITM,” CAQM stated in the statement.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Title: People across country celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with joy and unity
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:13:10 +0000
Content: Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations have begun across the country, with an outpouring of joy and unity as families and communities come together to mark the end of Ramadan.  
The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.  
A child celebrating Eid spoke to ANI after offering his morning prayers and said, “We are celebrating Eid with parents and friends, and all are happy… Whatever people give us (in Eidi), we take it happily.”  
Children embraced each other and wished greetings of Eid-ul-Fitr.  
BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain offered namaz at the Parliament Street mosque in Delhi on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Speaking to ANI, he said, “I extend my best wishes to the people of the country on the occasion of Eid. Today, people have peacefully offered Namaz everywhere. Eid is the day to forget everything and hug each other. I pray that there should be unity in the country and that our country progresses.”  
Shakeel Ahmed, a Pakistani citizen originally from India, said, “I am happy that I came to Delhi, my birthplace, with my relatives to celebrate Eid.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a foreign student of GD Goenka University from Mozambique said, “It was my first time here, and it was one of the best experiences that I had in India… India is very rich in this way. We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”  
On security arrangements for Eid-ul-Fitr, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Central Delhi, M Harsha Vardhan, said, “Today, a huge crowd is observed at the mosques. All the security arrangements have been made in central Delhi. Till now, no case has been reported. We have deployed adequate forces… Arrangements for Navratri have also been made. A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the PM said, “Greetings on Eid-ul-Fitr. May this festival enhance the spirit of hope, harmony, and kindness in our society. May there be joy and success in all your endeavors. Eid Mubarak!”  
President Droupadi Murmu also extended her best wishes on the occasion.  
“Greetings to all countrymen, especially Muslim brothers and sisters, on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This festival strengthens the feeling of brotherhood and conveys the message of compassion and charity. I wish that this festival brings peace, prosperity, and happiness to everyone’s life and strengthens the spirit of moving forward on the path of goodness,” she said in a post on X, in Urdu.  
Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also extended his wishes.  
“Eid Mubarak! May this joyous occasion bring peace, happiness, prosperity, and good health to you and your loved ones.”  
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also shared his warm greetings.  
“On this joyous occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, I extend my warmest greetings to fellow citizens. Eid profoundly evokes feelings of fraternity, compassion, and the spirit of sharing amongst us all, strengthening the pluralistic bonds that unite our people. May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.  
Eid upholds the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. Along with giving Zakat, many also provide meals, clothing, and support to the less fortunate, reflecting Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.

A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Title: 6th BIMSTEC Summit to convene in Bangkok on April 4, focusing on trade, security and regional cooperation
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:46:48 +0000
Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”

The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: SpaceX launches private astronaut crew in Fram2 polar-orbiting mission
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:23:58 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Monday launched a crew of four private astronauts led by a crypto entrepreneur on a mission to orbit Earth from pole to pole, a novel trajectory in which no humans have traveled before.
Maltese investor Chun Wang, a Chinese-born magnate who founded a bitcoin mining company, is the bankroller and commander of the SpaceX mission, named Fram2, a reference to the Norwegian “Fram” ship that pioneered Arctic exploration at the turn of the 20th century.
Wang and three associates launched aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule at 9:47 p.m. EDT on Monday (0147 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, setting off for a free-flying mission for three to five days, during which they will partake in 22 research experiments largely centered on how spaceflight and microgravity affect the human body.
The four crew members on Monday afternoon were driven to the launchpad in a caravan of Teslas – the electric cars of Musk’s other company – winding through the roads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a police escort, as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched overhead in an unrelated Starlink mission.
“We’re gonna watch a rocket launch while on our way to a rocket launch,” Wang wrote on X, the social media site owned by Musk, alongside a video of a Falcon 9 climbing the skies to space during their drive.
The mission, SpaceX’s sixth private astronaut flight, is the company’s latest novel effort that expands its dominance in the global human spaceflight arena. It comes as Musk’s power as SpaceX CEO and the world’s richest man soars as he works as a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, a role that has given him extraordinary influence for a businessman over an array of U.S. policy matters.
Fram2 is the 16th crewed mission overall using the reusable Crew Dragon, a gumdrop-shaped spacecraft that SpaceX developed with NASA funding to provide the U.S. space agency a ride for its astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
SpaceX and its Dragon craft have dominated the nascent market for private orbital spaceflight, an area in which a key source of demand originally came from a small field of wealthy tourists. Dragon is the world’s only privately built capsule routinely flying missions in orbit, as Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule is held up in development.
In recent years, with Dragon flights costing roughly $55 million per seat, the spaceflight market – involving companies such as Axiom Space that contract Crew Dragon missions – has fixated more on astronauts from governments willing to pay the sum mainly for national prestige and bolstering domestic spaceflight experience.
But the Fram2 crew is untethered from government backing. Wang’s friends include Norwegian film director Jannicke Mikkelsen, who specializes in virtual-reality cinematography; German robotics researcher and polar scientist Rabea Rogge, and Australian adventurer Eric Philips, who has taken up ambitious skiing expeditions in Earth’s harsh polar regions.

Title: South Korea Constitutional Court to rule on Yoon’s impeachment on April 4
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:12:36 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court, which is reviewing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment, will announce its decision on whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him on April 4, the court said in a statement on Tuesday.
The court said the ruling will be delivered at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) and live broadcast of the session will be permitted.
Yoon was impeached by parliament on December 14 after being accused of violating his constitutional duty by declaring martial law in early December with no justifiable grounds.
The suspended leader has said he never intended to fully impose military rule but instead meant to sound the alarm over the opposition Democratic Party’s abuse of its parliamentary majority that he argued was threatening to destroy the country.
In his final statement before the court ended arguments on February 25, Yoon also said his decision to declare martial law was an appeal to the people to overcome “anti-state forces”, pro-North Korea sympathisers, and opposition gridlock.
The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the dollar after the announcement of the ruling date. The stock market’s benchmark was up 1.5% after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5%.
The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when 6 or more judges agree, according to South Korea’s constitution.
The wait of more than a month for the time of the ruling has fuelled a bitter clash between the ruling party, with many of its members calling for Yoon’s reinstatement, and the opposition, which has said his return would deal a serious blow to the country’s constitutional order.
The looming decision has also deepened division among the public, with large crowds packing downtown streets in rallies for and against Yoon’s removal, with rhetoric becoming increasingly heated. Police are bracing for potential violence once the ruling is announced.
The People Power Party’s floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, welcomed the announcement and said the ruling party will accept the court’s decision but warned “social conflict will become stronger whatever the decision is”.
The Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said he was confident the court will rule unanimously against Yoon.
The majority of the public backs Yoon’s removal, according to opinion polls, although support has ebbed since the initial days after the martial law declaration last December.
A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed 60% of the respondents saying Yoon should be ousted.
NEW ELECTION WITHIN 60 DAYS IF YOON OUSTED
Parliamentary lawyers seeking his removal compared Yoon to a dictator during their final arguments at his impeachment trial.
Yoon, a former prosecutor who has seen his popularity dive, could face removal from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if his impeachment is upheld, marking a tumultuous end to a tenure marred by political turmoil.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon is also on a separate criminal trial on charges of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law and faces the death penalty or life in prison if convicted although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997.
His shock martial law announcement, which banned political and parliamentary activity, triggered a constitutional crisis that also led to the impeachment of the prime minister who became acting president.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was reinstated on March 24 by the Constitutional Court and resumed his role as acting president.
In an impeachment trial in 2017, eight justices of the court at the time unanimously backed a decision to oust the then President Park Geun-hye for violating her constitutional duty.

Title: India nears Naxalism-free goal as most affected districts drop to six: Home Minister Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced a significant reduction in the number of districts most affected by Left-Wing Extremism (LWE), also known as Naxalism, stating that the number has dropped from 12 to just 6. This reduction marks a key milestone in the ongoing efforts to create a Naxalism-free India.
In a post on X, Shah highlighted the Modi government’s “ruthless approach” towards eradicating Naxalism and emphasized the country’s commitment to fostering development across all regions. “The Modi government is determined to build a Sashakt, Surakshit, and Samriddh Bharat with relentless efforts for all-encompassing development and a firm stance against Naxalism. We are committed to uprooting Naxalism completely by 31st March 2026,” he stated.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of districts affected by Naxalism in India had previously been 38. Out of these, the number of “most affected” districts has now decreased to 6, with a parallel reduction in the number of “Districts of Concern” and “Other LWE-affected Districts.”
The six districts most affected by Naxalism now include four from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli).
Additionally, the number of “Districts of Concern,” which require intensified resources and attention, has been reduced from 9 to 6. These districts are located in Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem).
The number of “Other LWE-affected Districts,” which are also experiencing Naxal activity but to a lesser degree, has dropped from 17 to 6. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariaband, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu).
To support these districts in their recovery and development, central govt provides financial assistance under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme. The most affected districts receive Rs. 30 crore, while Districts of Concern are allocated Rs. 10 crore to fill gaps in public infrastructure. Special projects tailored to the needs of these areas are also funded by the government.

Title: US, Denmark to hold first high-level talks since Trump’s win
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:45:00 +0000
Content: Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen is set to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week in the first high-level talks since President Donald Trump’s re-election and his vow to “take control” of Greenland, the Financial Times said.
The prospect of such talks comes amid simmering tension between the two nations over U.S. interest in taking control of Greenland, the Arctic island controlled by Denmark since 1721.
The meeting is planned for the sidelines of a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels set to begin on Thursday, the paper said on Tuesday, citing two officials briefed on the preparations.
However, the officials warned the event could be cancelled because of tense relations between Copenhagen and Washington, it added.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland from April 2 to 4 for talks with the new government of the semi-autonomous territory just days after a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.
On his trip, Vance accused Denmark of not doing a good job of keeping the island safe and suggested the United States would better protect the strategically located island.

Title: India’s most-capped women’s player Vandana Katariya bids farewell to international hockey
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:04:41 +0000
Content: Indian women’s hockey stalwart Vandana Katariya has officially announced her retirement from international hockey, bringing an end to an illustrious career spanning over 15 years.
With 320 international appearances and 158 goals to her name, Vandana departs as the most-capped player in the history of Indian women’s hockey. Beyond the numbers, she leaves behind an inspiring legacy—one of resilience, quiet determination, and an unwavering commitment to elevating Indian women’s hockey.
The 32-year-old forward, who made her senior team debut in 2009, was an integral part of several defining moments in the sport, including India’s historic fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where she became the first and only Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Games.
Announcing her retirement, Vandana, who played her last match for India during the Bhubaneswar leg of the FIH Pro League 2024-25 in February, reflected on her journey with mixed emotions.
“This decision wasn’t easy, but I know it’s the right time. Hockey has been my life for as long as I can remember, and wearing the Indian jersey was the greatest honour. But every journey has its course, and I leave with immense pride, gratitude, and love for the sport. Indian hockey is in great hands, and I will always be its biggest supporter.”
She extended heartfelt appreciation to everyone who played a role in her career. “I want to thank my coaches, teammates, support staff, Hockey India, my family, and all the fans who have supported me over the years. Every cheer, every message, every word of encouragement meant the world to me.”
Hailing from Roshnabad, Haridwar, Vandana’s journey began like that of many young girls in India—on dusty fields with dreams far bigger than her circumstances. Over the years, she represented India on the grandest stages, including two Olympic Games (Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020), two FIH Hockey Women’s World Cups (2018, 2022), three Commonwealth Games (2014, 2018, 2022), and three Asian Games (2014, 2018, 2022).
Her contributions were instrumental in India’s rise in world hockey. She played a pivotal role in securing gold medals at the Women’s Asian Champions Trophy (2016, 2023) and the FIH Hockey Women’s Nations Cup (2022), silver medals at the 2018 Asian Games, the 2013 and 2018 Women’s Asian Champions Trophy, and bronze medals at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the 2014 and 2022 Asian Games, and the FIH Hockey Pro League 2021-22.
Hockey India President Dilip Tirkey paid tribute to Vandana’s contributions, saying, “Vandana was not just a goal scorer; she was the heartbeat of the Indian attack, a tireless worker, and a leader by example. Her presence in the forward line gave India an edge, especially in high-pressure situations. She has set a benchmark for future generations, and we at Hockey India are immensely proud of her achievements. We wish her the very best in her future endeavours.”
Vandana was also a key member of India’s bronze medal-winning squad at the 2013 Junior World Cup, finishing as the team’s top scorer and the tournament’s third-highest goal scorer.
Apart from representing India in multiple global tournaments, Vandana featured in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Hockey India League in 2025, playing for Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers.
Among her many achievements, Vandana’s Tokyo Olympics heroics remain unforgettable. Her hat-trick in a crucial 4-3 victory over South Africa helped India reach the quarterfinals and secure their best-ever Olympic finish.
Speaking about that defining moment, Vandana said, “I still get goosebumps thinking about Tokyo. The Olympics are special, and that match against South Africa was one of the most emotional games of my life. I just wanted to give everything for my team, for my country. The hattrick was special, but more than that, it was about proving that we belonged on that stage.”
For her immense contributions, Vandana was honoured with some of India’s most prestigious awards, including the Arjuna Award (2021) and the Padma Shri (2022). She also received the Hockey India Balbir Singh Sr. Award for Player of the Year (Women) in 2014, the Hockey India President’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2021, and the Hockey India Dhanraj Pillay Award for Forward of the Year in 2021 and 2022, cementing her status as one of India’s finest forwards.
Hockey India Secretary General Bhola Nath Singh lauded her remarkable journey, stating, “Vandana’s journey is nothing short of inspirational. From her early days to becoming a stalwart of Indian hockey, she has shown exceptional skill, resilience, and commitment. Her performances in crucial matches, especially at the Tokyo Olympics, will be remembered for years to come. As she takes her final bow, she leaves behind a legacy of resilience, excellence, and inspiration—one that will continue to guide the next generation of Indian hockey stars.”

Title: Mumbai scouts find another IPL gem in paceman Ashwani
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:46:08 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya heaped praise on his team’s scouting department for unearthing another gem in Ashwani Kumar, after the pace bowler produced the best figures by an Indian on his Indian Premier League debut.
The 23-year-old Ashwani bagged 4-24 in three overs on Monday to help dismiss reigning champions Kolkata Knight Riders for 116 in 16.2 overs before Mumbai secured an eight-wicket victory to open their account in this year’s tournament.
Ashwani’s heroics came after spinner Vignesh Puthur claimed 3-32 on his debut in Mumbai’s defeat by Chennai Super Kings last week, and Pandya was delighted with the team’s latest find.
“I’m really happy for the young kid,” said Pandya.
“It’s all the scouts, they picked him. They’ve gone to all places and picked these young kids. We played a practice game, he had that zip, that late swing, something off the wicket, a different action and he was a lefty.”
Mumbai batsman Ryan Rickelton also played a big role in the win with an unbeaten 62, but said Ashwani had laid the foundation with his deceptive pace and swing.
“He’s a lot quicker than people recognise at first. I think that’s a great attribute he has, and he can swing the new ball,” South African Rickelton added.
“I know it’s quite tough, we’ve got two specialist swing bowlers with the new ball as well, but to have that second plan without that swing factor was really impressive … He rushes you a little bit as well.
“He’s a great addition to the group and the wicket can suit him. Looking forward to seeing, if he gets the opportunity, his other set of skills come through. He’s a nice find for Mumbai.”

Content: Teenage batting prodigy Sam Konstas has been added to Australia’s list of contracted players in a huge vote of confidence for the two-test opener.
The 19-year-old was named among 23 contracted players on Tuesday, three months on from making a memorable 60 in his international debut in the Melbourne test against India.
Konstas was one of three players to earn their first national contracts, joining spinner Matt Kuhnemann and all-rounder Beau Webster.
White-ball all-rounders Sean Abbott and Aaron Hardie, and seven-test spinner Todd Murphy made way for the new trio.
“In Sam, we see promising upside in a young player who will continue to develop at the first-class level and in the international environment,” selector George Bailey said in a statement.
Kuhnemann’s contract is another boost for the left-arm spinner who was recently cleared of having a suspect bowling action following his prolific tour of Sri Lanka.
Kuhnemann was reported for his bowling action after he was Player of the Series with 16 wickets in Sri Lanka.
Tasmania all-rounder Webster has had a strong entry into test cricket since his Sydney debut against India, scoring 150 runs at an average of 50.00 from his three matches along with three wickets with his medium pace.
“Matt was outstanding once again in Sri Lanka and we believe he can play a key role across the next 18 months,” said Bailey.
“In Beau’s case, he proved more than comfortable at Test level with bat and ball, adds an additional dimension in the field and to the balance of the side.”
With 20 out of 23 players retaining their contracts, selectors have opted for continuity over change for an aging Australian squad.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh may feel fortunate to be included after the 33-year-old was dropped during the test series against India after a dreadful run of scores.
Pace bowler Jhye Richardson was retained despite nearly three years passing since his last international match.
Fringe pace bowlers Lance Morris and Xavier Bartlett also kept their contracts after barely featuring for Australia in the 2024/25 season.

Title: China launches military drills around Taiwan, calls its president a ‘parasite’
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:26:48 +0000
Content: China began joint army, navy and rocket force exercises around Taiwan on Tuesday as a “stern warning” against separatism and called Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te a “parasite”, as Taiwan sent warships to respond to China’s navy approaching its coast.
The exercises around the democratically governed island, which China views as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring under its control, come after Lai called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” last month.
China detests Lai as a “separatist,” and in a video accompanying the Eastern Theatre Command’s announcement of the drills depicted him as cartoon bug held by a pair of chopsticks above a burning Taiwan, calling him in English a “parasite”.
“The focus is on exercises such as combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets, and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes,” the Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills, with the presidential office saying China was “widely recognised by the international community as a troublemaker” and that the government has the confidence and ability to defend itself.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.
Two senior Taiwan officials told Reuters that more than 10 Chinese military ships had approached close to Taiwan’s 24 nautical mile (44 km) contiguous zone and Taiwan sent its own warships to respond.
However, Taiwan has not detected any live fire by the Chinese military, one of the officials said.
TAIWAN DISPATCHES WARSHIPS
Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered the island’s response area on Monday, adding that it had dispatched military aircraft and ships and activated land-based missile systems in response.
The drills took place after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth left the region following visits to Japan and the Philippines, where he criticised China and said Japan was “indispensable” for tackling Chinese aggression.
A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters, citing internal assessments, that Beijing needed to avoid any “perceived confrontation” with Washington prior to the U.S.-China trade talks, and thus Taiwan has become a pretext.
“Taiwan is their best excuse. That’s why they chose to launch such military drills as soon as the U.S. defence secretary left Asia,” the official said.
The de facto U.S. embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, said the United States will continue to support the island.
“Once again, China has shown that it is not a responsible actor and has no problem putting the region’s security and prosperity at risk,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
“CLOSING IN”
China’s military released a series of propaganda videos in quick succession after the drill announcement, depicting Chinese warships and fighter jets encircling Taiwan, Taipei being aimed at from above, and military vehicles patrolling city streets.
A video of a poster accompanying the drills titled “Closing In,” and showing Chinese forces surrounding the island, was released on the Eastern Theatre Command’s Weibo.
This was followed by a video titled “Shell”, depicting president Lai as a green cartoon bug spawning parasites across the island, on the Eastern Theatre Command’s WeChat page.
“Parasite poisoning Taiwan island. Parasite hollowing Island out. Parasite courting ultimate destruction,” the animation said.
Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said such rhetoric was not conducive to peace and “shows their provocative character,” when asked about Lai’s cartoon depiction.
A third video, “Subdue Demons and Vanquish Evils”, featured Sun Wukong, the magical monkey king from the Ming Dynasty epic “Journey to the West” as he is depicted in the “Black Myth: Wukong” hit video game.
It opens with the video’s title flashing across the screen and the Chinese mythical warrior riding on clouds before cutting to footage of Chinese fighter jets.
“The joint exercise and training conducted by the Eastern Theatre of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the vicinity of Taiwan Island is a resolute punishment for the Lai Ching-Te authorities’ rampant ‘independence’ provocations,” said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.
Taiwan’s Koo told reporters the PLA should focus first on resolving its issues with corruption instead of destroying peace and stability in the region.
China’s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge over the past few years, which saw former Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu ousted in October 2024.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Koo’s remarks.
The Taiwan security source, citing internal intelligence assessments, said China was trying to busy its military with exercises as a way of distracting and stopping its soldiers from discussing the corruption crackdown amongst themselves on base.
China’s coast guard said it was also taking part in the drills, saying it was simulating “inspection and capture, interception and detention operations against unwarranted vessels” to show its exercise of “legitimate jurisdiction” over Taiwan.
The Global Times, which is owned by the People’s Daily newspaper of the governing Chinese Communist Party, said the drill had not been given a code name to show that Chinese military forces surrounding the island “has become a normal practice,” citing Zhang Chi of National Defence University.
“Through a series of exercises held in the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the PLA has strongly enhanced its ability to prepare for war and fight battles,” the article on the paper’s Weixin social media page added.
China has staged several rounds of war games around Taiwan since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in 2022.

Title: The next UPI? How an India energy stack can lead the digital energy revolution
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:06:39 +0000
Content: At the United Nations’ first International Conference on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in April 2024, held under India’s leadership, the global discussion centered on how this framework can accelerate sustainable development and promote inclusivity.
As a participant in these discussions, it was evident that India’s success in building open, interoperable, and citizen-centric DPIs has set a global benchmark.
While Aadhaar has transformed delivery of public services, social security and welfare measure for a large target audience, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has disrupted traditional banking and finance to make it inclusive and universally available to all.
These DPIs have demonstrated how technology can bridge accessibility gaps, improve governance, enhance efficiency, and unlock economic opportunities at scale.
India’s DPI revolution has proved that open digital infrastructure can accelerate social and economic development across sectors. This same digital-first approach also holds immense potential to address one of the country’s most complex challenges—energy transition.
The case for an India energy stack 
With a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and a net-zero commitment by 2070, India is moving forward to modernize its aging power grid, integrate large-scale renewable energy, and ensure affordability and accessibility for all.
However, several systemic barriers hinder this transition. Intermittent renewable supply, inefficient grid management, and a lack of real-time energy data make large-scale clean energy integration challenging. Financially struggling distribution companies, land acquisition hurdles, and storage constraints add further roadblocks. Fragmented policy implementation and regulatory misalignment between central and state governments hinder efficiency and slow progress.
To overcome these challenges, India needs a digitally integrated energy ecosystem—an ‘India Energy Stack’—that enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, much like the India UPI Stack transformed financial services.
Benefits of an energy stack 
India’s energy governance must transition from a fragmented, legacy energy system to a digitally integrated, intelligent, and citizen-centric model.
A unified digital energy architecture could unlock efficiencies that today remain out of reach. Grid reliability could be transformed through real-time intelligence, markets could become more transparent and competitive, and decentralized renewable energy could be scaled more effectively.
Moreover, the convergence of AI, blockchain, and IoT in the energy sector has the potential to create a self-regulating, demand-responsive system, reducing inefficiencies and ensuring that energy flows dynamically when and where it is needed most.
A digital-first approach could also make India’s energy transition more equitable. By embedding granular data tracking and real-time analytics, clean energy can be expanded without placing additional strain on grid networks.
What can India do? 

India must establish a Digital Energy Identity (DEID) for every consumer, prosumer, and energy producer to enable seamless participation in energy markets, targeted subsidy distribution, and decentralized renewable energy trading. While Aadhaar can serve as a foundational identity layer, DEID should be designed specifically to track energy consumption, facilitate dynamic pricing, and integrate with real-time market mechanisms.
A UPI-linked digital payment system for electricity can streamline transactions, allowing consumers to pay bills, trade surplus solar energy, and receive instant credits, eliminating inefficiencies in billing and settlement while improving financial inclusion. This could accelerate the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, enabling seamless payments for households selling excess rooftop solar power to the grid, ensuring faster crediting and wider adoption of decentralized renewable energy.
India must leverage the National Smart Grid Mission, which focuses on automation, communication, and IT systems to enhance real-time grid reliability. AI-driven forecasting and IoT-enabled smart meters should be deployed to predict demand fluctuations, prevent outages, and enable dynamic pricing. These technologies will help utilities optimize energy distribution, reduce peak load stress, and lower costs while ensuring better integration of renewables into the grid.
India must develop a National Energy Data Platform (NEDP), building on NITI Aayog’s India Energy Dashboards (IED), to serve as a real-time, open energy data exchange. This platform should provide utilities, regulators, and startups with access to granular consumption patterns, grid load forecasts, and decentralized energy trading insights. A sandbox for innovation can help startups develop new use cases to improve demand-supply planning, optimize pricing, and enhance service efficiency, while standardized data drives market innovation, strengthens grid reliability, and supports AI-powered decision-making for a more adaptive energy ecosystem.
India must integrate blockchain technology into its newly launched Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) to ensure real-time verification, prevent fraud, and enhance market transparency. A decentralized, tamper-proof system can streamline carbon credit transactions, boosting investor confidence and attracting climate finance. This will position the country as a leader in global carbon markets, fostering a robust green investment ecosystem.

A well-executed India Energy Stack will not only accelerate India’s clean energy transition but also position the country as a global leader in digital energy innovation. However, its success will depend on addressing key challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and the infrastructure costs of digital adoption. A robust regulatory framework and targeted incentives will be crucial to drive industry participation and ensure seamless integration.
This is India’s moment to set the standard for a future where energy is smarter, greener, and fully aligned with our vision of Viksit Bharat.

Title: UPI transaction volume up 13.5% in March, value at record Rs 24.77 lakh crore
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:54:13 +0000
Content: The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) saw a 13.59% increase in transaction volume in March, reaching 18.3 billion transactions, compared to 16.11 billion in February, according to data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
March recorded a record Rs 24.77 lakh crore worth of UPI-based transactions, marking a 12.79% increase from Rs 21.96 lakh crore in February.
On a daily basis, the UPI network saw more than 590 million average transactions, totaling Rs 79,910 crore in daily transaction value, according to NPCI data.
On a year-on-year basis, the record-breaking UPI transactions in March amounted to Rs 24.77 lakh crore, representing a 25% surge in value and an impressive 36% growth in volume. This highlights the unstoppable momentum of India’s digital payments revolution.
With daily transactions averaging Rs 79,910 crore (up 1.9% from February), and volumes rising by 2.6%, these numbers underscore the rapid adoption and trust in digital financial solutions.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, digital payment users experienced issues processing transactions on UPI. The NPCI attributed the problem to the closing of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).
“Today, due to the financial year closing, some banks are facing intermittent transaction declines. The UPI system is working fine, and we are working with the concerned banks for necessary redressal,” the NPCI said in a statement.
Starting April 1, it will be mandatory for UPI member banks, UPI apps, and third-party providers to follow new guidelines.
According to the new norms, the UPI ID linked to an inactive mobile number will become inactive. That is, if the mobile number registered with a bank is inactive for an extended period, the UPI ID of the user will also be unlinked, and the user will no longer be able to use the UPI service.
As a result, every UPI user must ensure that the mobile number registered with their bank is active.
Under the new guidelines, the user’s bank-verified mobile number will act as the UPI identifier. Additionally, banks and UPI applications must update their mobile number records every week to prevent issues arising from recycled or modified numbers.

Title: A focused article on the essential traits, tools, and strategies required for leadership in a rapidly evolving, tech-driven world
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:22:52 +0000
Content: In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of technology, leadership is undergoing a radical transformation. What was once a role focused primarily on managing IT systems has evolved into a multifaceted position centered around driving strategic innovation, fostering business growth, and enabling cross-functional collaboration. Digital leaders today must navigate the complexities of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing, all of which are reshaping industries. As these innovations bring about new opportunities, they also require a new set of leadership traits and strategies to harness their potential responsibly.
As a leading advocate for responsible digital leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the AI Summit in Paris, emphasized the need for AI systems free from biases. “AI is writing the codes of humanity in this century, but we must ensure that these codes are free from biases,” he stated. Modi’s remarks highlight the crucial responsibility of digital leaders—not only to harness cutting-edge technology but to do so in an ethical, transparent, and inclusive manner. Open-source systems and high-quality, unbiased datasets play a vital role in this effort. As digital leaders, we must ensure that the technologies we implement benefit society as a whole, advancing progress while avoiding the perpetuation of harmful biases or inequalities.
India’s own journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse provides a shining example of visionary leadership. Through initiatives like Digital India, the country has transformed itself into a global leader in the digital space. The initiative has focused on improving digital governance, building digital infrastructure, and enhancing digital literacy. With over 950 million internet users, India is proving that technology is a powerful tool for economic growth and better public service delivery. However, as India’s experience illustrates, true digital leadership is not about simply mastering the latest technologies; it is about using these tools to create meaningful impact and drive societal progress.
At the heart of successful digital leadership are certain essential traits. Adaptability and agility are paramount in a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed. Digital leaders must not only keep up with technological disruptions but also anticipate changes and lead their organizations through transitions. Whether it’s adopting AI, blockchain, or automation, leaders must remain flexible, open to change, and able to pivot when necessary.
Data-driven decision-making is another crucial trait for digital leaders. In the digital age, data is one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. Effective leaders must leverage data analytics to make informed decisions, guide strategic initiatives, and drive innovation. But data’s power comes with responsibility. Our Prime Minister’s call for unbiased AI systems highlights the vital role leaders play in ensuring that data is accurate, inclusive, and free from bias to create a fair future. Data should serve to improve fairness and transparency, and leaders must prioritize ethical considerations in their decision-making.
Yet, the ability to navigate technology and data is only part of what makes a great digital leader. Ethical leadership plays a critical role in ensuring that technology is used for the benefit of society. As AI, automation, and other advanced technologies reshape industries, leaders must be proactive in addressing privacy concerns, mitigating biases, and promoting transparency. Trust and accountability are essential elements of ethical leadership, and it is up to leaders to guide their organizations in a way that benefits all stakeholders. AI, for example, offers immense potential for improving lives and businesses, but it also raises questions around privacy, fairness, and discrimination. It is the responsibility of digital leaders to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly, without causing harm.
Another fundamental aspect of effective leadership in the digital era is emotional intelligence (EQ). While technical expertise is essential, the ability to navigate human relationships is equally important. Self-awareness, empathy, and communication skills are essential for leaders to build trust, foster collaboration, and resolve conflicts effectively. In an increasingly remote and hybrid work environment, clear and empathetic communication becomes even more crucial. The ability to connect with teams, stakeholders, and customers on a personal level is what ultimately makes a leader effective, especially when navigating the complexities of digital transformation.
Visionary thinking is also a defining trait of digital leadership. The digital world is constantly changing, and leaders must be able to anticipate the next big trend, identify opportunities, and guide their organizations toward success. Leaders who think long-term, who can envision the future of their industries and align technology with strategic goals, will lead the way in shaping the future. India’s Digital India initiative is a prime example of visionary leadership, where the country’s leadership proactively anticipated the digital revolution and took steps to ensure India could lead in this space.
To effectively lead in the digital era, digital leaders must also embrace the right tools and strategies. Cloud computing and data analytics are indispensable in helping organizations make real-time decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation. The ability to store, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data is transforming the way businesses operate and engage with customers. AI and automation are also revolutionizing industries by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. However, as these technologies evolve, leaders must strike a balance between efficiency and ethics. Automation, for example, can result in significant improvements in productivity, but it can also displace jobs if not implemented thoughtfully.
Fostering innovation is a critical component of successful digital leadership. Leaders must create environments where experimentation is encouraged, risks are taken, and learning is continuous. To remain competitive in the digital economy, organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforces. As technology evolves, so too must the skills of employees. Those who fail to keep pace with digital advancements risk becoming obsolete. By investing in continuous learning, leaders ensure that their teams remain agile and ready to tackle new challenges.
Looking to the future, the digital leader of tomorrow will need to embody a blend of technical expertise, ethical responsibility, emotional intelligence, and visionary thinking. The pace of technological change shows no sign of slowing, and the leaders who succeed will be those who can adapt quickly, make informed decisions based on data, and champion ethical and inclusive technology practices. India’s journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse offers valuable insights into how visionary leadership can drive national transformation, and the world is watching closely. In this new era, the digital leader is not just a technologist but a champion of responsible, impactful technology use—one who recognizes the power of technology to shape the future and uses it to build a better, more inclusive world.

Title: Indian Prime Minister leading the men for women vision, calling for a change in the gender imbalance in personal, social and professional lives
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:16:49 +0000
Content: The Mahabharata celebrates the presence of Krishna, a symbol for the antar-atma or inner wisdom, supporting queen Draupadi when she was wronged but none of her dear ones came to help. The ancient culture of India is replete with such stories when men and women stood by each other and created a good life together by sharing strengths. Krishna and Draupadi’s relationship was that of friendship and care, representing the core moral compass for any bond on earth. The story also emphasizes on the responsibilities of a ‘friend’ who must be there for each other in times of need. Friends may or may not be able to fight our battles on our behalf, but they are available to sharpen our arms and wash our wounds.

Women’s emancipation, globally, has been a concern for centuries. The movements have been slow, but firm and steady. Many men had come forward partnering the women in their struggles to unshackle from regressive traditions that made their worlds smaller. Such men have appeared in conservative families and narrow-minded societies, soldiering against women’s exploitations, irrespective of their personal equations with them. They stood the ground as true friends, attempting to change perspectives in favour of a fair and equal society. Men’s growing support over the years have enhanced the voices of women in raising awareness and challenging deep-rooted biases. From the fathers educating their daughters for an independent and respectful future, brothers sharing household chores, to the colleagues imparting tough training to prepare women employees for corporate growth or enforcing a safe and positive working environment – men’s cooperation normalizes women’s participation in all spheres, making it a shared responsibility rather than a women-only cause. Also, men who actively promote gender equality set strong examples for future generations.

Throughout history, several male leaders across the world have played a crucial role in championing women’s emancipation, challenging patriarchal norms, and advocating for gender equality. In India, Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a pioneering social reformer who fought against the inhumane practice of sati and worked towards women’s rights in education and inheritance. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was instrumental in advocating for girls’ education and widow remarriage, which led to the enactment of the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first Vice President and second President of India, was a proponent of women’s education. In August 1848, Jyotirao Phule, and his wife, Savitribai opened the first girls’ school in Pune with nine girls from different social backgrounds, soon expanding to 18 schools for girls and children from Dalit families, between 1848 and 1852. Authors like Rabindranath Tagore, Vishnu Prabhakar, Premchand, Mulk Raj Anand, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and others included strong women characters in their novels which made people think. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher and politician, strongly advocated for gender equality. In the United States, Abraham Lincoln, though primarily known for abolishing slavery, believed in the fundamental equality of all individuals, supporting women’s rights movements. Theodore Roosevelt pushed for women’s right to vote. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela actively promoted women’s rights, recognizing that true freedom could not be achieved without gender equality. He appointed women to key government positions and worked to dismantle discriminatory practices. Ban Ki-moon, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, launched initiatives like HeForShe, encouraging men to participate in the fight for gender equality.

Studies show that economies with higher female workforce participation experience sustained economic growth and improved living standards. Political leaders across the world are redefining the norms to include women in all social functions, governance and business. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for women’s liberation is deeply rooted in the fact that India’s growth is incomplete without the progress of its women. One of our biggest opportunities is that India is a country with over 1.4 billion people, where women make up nearly half the population. Their full participation is key to economic prosperity. By 2036, India’s population is expected to reach 1.522 billion, with approximately 750 million women. When women have equal access to education, employment, and leadership roles, the GDP rises, poverty declines, and systems strengthen. According to an International Monetary Fund report, women’s workforce participation on par with men could boost India’s GDP by 27 per cent. If 50 percent of skilled women join the workforce, the growth rate could rise 1.5 per cent to 9 percent per year. One of the biggest challenges is India’s demographic divide. Unlike many Western nations, where the majority of people live in urban centers, India’s rural and semi-urban population remains dominant. Women in these areas, especially from lower castes and tribal backgrounds, have historically faced limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
The Modi government has aggressively pushed for grassroot-level leadership, ensuring that women from the most marginalized communities receive education and training to become local leaders, business owners, and policymakers. By educating these women and giving them a platform, the government is fostering self-reliance, ensuring that they do not remain dependent on male family members for their financial and personal decisions. PM Modi has been vocal about his focus, especially on raising the marginalized women’s position in India, attempting to transform silent contributors into informed decision-makers.

In July 2018, PM Modi, addressing over one crore women, emphasized youth skill development and women empowerment under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana. In Chhattisgarh, 122 Bihan Bazaar outlets across 22 districts sell over 200 Self-Help Group (SHG) products. Since 2014, 20 lakh SHGs have been formed, benefiting 2.25 crore families, adding an earning member to five crore rural households by 2018. Since 2014, women-centric policies have fostered Nari Shakti-led development as a pillar of New India. Initiatives like Self-Help Groups, Lakhpati Didi, and Drone Didi have boosted rural women’s economic empowerment. By December 2024, ₹9.74 lakh crore had been provided to women-led SHGs. India has 25,385 women welfare cooperatives and 1,44,396 dairy cooperatives employing rural women. As of March 2025, 90.87 lakh SHGs support 10.05 crore rural families. Under Lakhpati Didi, women in SHGs receive interest-free loans of ₹5 lakh. India’s development story today is spearheaded by grassroot entrepreneurs and leaders across gender, caste and locations. The remote locations have been especially monitored, ensuring that the huge potentials of the country are being increasingly realized. 
One of the most symbolic acknowledgments of women’s power has been their increasing representation in the Padma Awards, India’s highest civilian honors. Under the Modi government, a large number of grassroots women leaders, social workers, and change-makers—many from humble backgrounds—have been recognized for their contributions. This has sent a strong message to patriarchal societies in rural and remote areas, forcing men to acknowledge and respect women’s achievements. When a tribal woman, a rural teacher, or a female scientist receives a national honor, it compels the men in their communities to rethink traditional gender roles.

When the Prime Minister of a country actively champions women’s empowerment, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring men across all sections of society to adopt a similar outlook. India is a country of diverse cultures and practices, spread over a large rural and remote landscape, neck deep in superstitions and ill practices because of lack of exposure and infrastructure. PM Narendra Modi’s consistent emphasis on women’s dignity, inclusion, and success is targeting a national mindset shift, encouraging men to respect, support, and uplift women in their own families, workplaces, and communities. His speeches often highlight the contributions of women in various fields. With significant infrastructural developments and rewarding women achievers from remote communities, a strong message is constantly being passed to the men of the backward communities to build the life-frame together by sharing responsibilities instead of looking down at women as the weaker sections. PM Modi has frequently spoken about women achievers in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ program, he has personally met and honored women like Nari Shakti Puraskar awardees, grassroots leaders, and athletes. He acknowledged the critical contributions of the women scientists during his interactions with ISRO’s women engineers for Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 missions.
Events like Pariksha Pe Charcha found him motivating girls to excel in academics and overcome societal pressures. He also met young female innovators, such as those from Atal Tinkering Labs, praising their scientific achievements. In 2023, he met Purnima Devi Barman, an award-winning conservationist, praising her work in protecting the greater adjutant stork. He has also appreciated Tulsi Gowda, a Padma Shri awardee known as the “Encyclopedia of Forests,” for her lifelong dedication to afforestation. During global summits like COP26 and G20, he has highlighted the contributions of women in climate action. In 2023, he also interacted with schoolgirls at the G20 Summit’s “Mission LiFE” event, urging them to take leadership in climate action. His encouragement of female students, especially in STEM fields, has reinforced the importance of education in empowering young women to shape India’s future.

By consistently advocating for women’s progress, PM Modi has set an example for millions of men. It shows, in the way the society is opening up for women, fostering an environment of trust and sharing. Each successful woman inspires a thousand more to believe in their competence. Every supporting man inspires ten others to believe in social justice. The ratio is obviously not parallel, and hence it will take a long time for a holistic change. The good news is that things have started turning with the Prime Minister of the country taking the lead and openly discussing women’s success and the importance of such progress. The mountains that must be brought down and the dark prisons to be shattered have been identified. Business leaders ensuring equal pay, houses where a girl-child is not someone to be married off and fathers treating women as equals becoming the male role model for boys, a society that leaves stereotypes and discriminations behind – the path is long and demanding. A large number of men and women today are committed to fostering a healthy and competitive environment, targeting exponential growth in terms of learning and output. They are dedicated and are even fighting the mind-blocks of self and others, to protect, upheld and empower the collective Indian dream.

Title: Sensex plunges nearly 2 percent amid US tariff concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:15:51 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets plunged on Tuesday, the first trading session of the new financial year, as investors reacted to global trade tensions ahead of the US reciprocal tariff announcement on Wednesday.
The Sensex tumbled 1,390.41 points, or 1.80 percent, closing at 76,024.51, after swinging between an intra-day high of 77,487.05 and a low of 75,912.18. The Nifty 50 also slumped 353.65 points, or 1.50 percent, to settle at 23,165.70, with an intra-day range of 23,565.15 to 23,136.40.
The selloff was broad-based, with most Sensex stocks ending in the red, except Zomato, IndusInd Bank, and State Bank of India (SBI).
Top losers included HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, and Infosys, which declined up to 3.66 percent.
Midcap and smallcap stocks also faced pressure. Nifty Midcap100 lost 0.86 percent, while Nifty Smallcap100 dipped 0.70 percent.
The BSE Midcap index dropped 0.9 percent, whereas the Smallcap index edged up 0.2 percent.
Sectorally, IT, real estate, and consumer durables fell nearly 2 percent each, while media, oil & gas, and telecom stocks managed to stay positive.
Investor sentiment turned jittery, with India VIX—known as the fear index—surging 8.37 percent to 13.78, indicating increased market uncertainty.
“Amid heightened global volatility ahead of the anticipated US reciprocal tariff announcement tomorrow (US time), the domestic market witnessed a significant sell-off today. Investors are eagerly awaiting the specifics of these tariffs while also keeping a close eye on ongoing negotiations for a potential Indo-US trade agreement,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited.
The IT sector bore the brunt of the selloff due to its heavy exposure to the US market, while real estate stocks tumbled after Maharashtra raised ready reckoner rates, impacting property valuations.

Title: Women-Government partnership is communicating and chartering the Indian growth story for global audience
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:06:48 +0000
Content: Women possess innate leadership qualities like resilience, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, which enable them to manage households, finances, and communities even in the lowest economic strata. Their emotional intelligence helps build strong relationships, mediate conflicts, and foster collaboration, making them effective leaders in both grassroots and corporate settings. Women bring fresh perspectives, drive ethical decision-making, and enhance organizational productivity, with diverse leadership teams often proving to be more innovative and financially successful. Their success as entrepreneurs, particularly in microfinance and self-help groups, further demonstrates that leadership thrives in determination and vision, regardless of socio-economic background.
As per a McKinsey Global Institute report, India could achieve an 18 percent increase over business-as-usual GDP (USD 770 billion) by 2025 if the full potential of women in the workforce are unlocked. This would create a multiplier effect with time, and would ensure that India would be able to keep up our growth trajectory we have had since 1991, and would play a key role in ensuring that India would transform into a high income developed country by 2047, in the 100th year of our Independence.
Women in India have played a crucial role in grassroots leadership, contributing to social movements, local governance, and community development, despite facing systemic barriers. From leadership during the freedom struggle with figures like Rani Lakshmibai and Sarojini Naidu, to post-independence contributions through the Panchayati Raj system, women have significantly influenced political and social change. Women leaders like Chhavi Rajawat and Gaura Devi have brought innovation to rural governance, while organizations like SEWA have empowered women in the informal sector, driving social and economic progress. Women’s progress in their personal, social and professional lives have often been a journey of immense grit, through unthinkable adversities, because patriarchal mindsets do not treat women’s success with kindness and pride. Be it a domestic set-up or a boardroom, women’s achievements are often suppressed which is an extra hurdle that needs to be overcome for their voices to be heard. It is unfortunate though when the very leadership of a country would be reluctant to offer the desired push to break the mind-blocks.
Historically, the inclusion of women in the Padma awards was minimal, with their representation often hovering around 5-10% of the total recipients each year. However, after the Modi government came to power in 2014, there has been a significant increase in the recognition of women, reflecting broader societal changes towards gender equality and increased attention to women’s contributions across various fields. The numbers were, only 7 women were honored out of 80 recipients in 2013, 6 women among 88 awardees in 2012, 8 women out of 109 recipients in 2011 and 9 women out of 130 awardees in 2010. In 2018, out of 85 awardees, 14 were women, recognizing their contributions across various fields. In 2019, for the first time, the Sports Ministry recommended only women for the Padma Awards, highlighting a significant shift towards acknowledging women’s achievements in sports. The trend continued in 2021, with 29 women and one transgender individual among the 119 awardees. In 2022, 34 women were honored among 128 recipients, marking a consistent effort to recognize women’s contributions. The count of women were 19 out of 106 in 2023, 30 out of 132 in 2024 and 23 out of 139 in 2025. This upward trend reflects a broader societal acknowledgment of women’s roles and achievements in diverse sectors, promoting gender inclusivity and inspiring future generations.
Improving the women’s count of the recipients of Padma Awards was not a mere show of statistics. This was a genuine attempt to acknowledge the untold stories of resilience and leadership that exist in India’s heartlands and its hinterlands alike, by celebrating the paths that women were creating for themselves and their communities. Everyone has great women surrounding them, who give them the overview of life and livelihood. When a few among them are recognized at the highest levels of national awards, a society rises from its slumber and takes notice of things that it had earlier neglected.
In recent years, the Padma awards have felicitated truly deserving women with exemplary track records in the field of art, education, science, environment and more. The inclusion of successful women from grassroots, lower socio-economic, and geographically marginalized sectors in the Padma Awards list signals a powerful message to both the Indian population and the global community about India’s changing social and political landscape where women are breaking barriers to recreate history, and the government is supporting their vision to nurture an inclusive society, where everyone—regardless of their social, economic, or geographical status—has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s growth. The glorious partnership between women-force and the government marks India’s repositioning as a strong, forward-thinking and progressive nation for global observers.

Such a feat however, was not achieved overnight by random addition of women in the nomination lists. A lot of work has gone into the background to introduce infrastructural developments that help the visionaries create their success stories. For the government, there is a two-fold task. One, to facilitate the existing talents and two, to prepare the grounds for the next line of talents. The Indian government is working hard to erase the challenges that remain in the form of societal norms, patriarchal attitudes, and limited access to common resources, that hinder women’s growth. With increasing education, government initiatives, and awareness campaigns, more women are stepping into professional roles to gain financial independence.
Programs like the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and Mahila Samakhya have further strengthened women’s leadership by providing training and economic opportunities. Launched in 2015, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) campaign aimed to ensure the survival, protection, and education of girls, leading to increased school enrollment, a decline in female foeticide, improved sex ratios, and greater promotion of women’s rights. It has notably improved the child sex ratio, with states like Haryana and Rajasthan seeing significant changes, such as Haryana’s gender ratio rising from 850 girls per 1,000 boys in 2015 to 933 girls per 1,000 boys in 2021.
India has implemented several initiatives to ensure equal access to quality education for girls, including the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and programs like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), which have improved school enrollment, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has improved school infrastructure for girls, while the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes gender equity in education. Addressing sanitation issues, the Swachh Bharat Mission, launched in 2014, prioritized women-friendly toilets, with vending machines for sanitary pads and other facilities, improving female enrollment and safety. To empower women economically, initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and Stand Up India Scheme support women entrepreneurs, with the number of women-driven ideas increasing from 10% in 2014 to 30% in 2018. Rapid digitization in India, built on the India Stack and the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity, is driving financial inclusivity and ensuring that support schemes reach even the remotest areas.
The digital revolution has empowered women by facilitating access to technology and digital literacy, with programs like PMGDISHA training 60 million rural citizens and 67,000 women entrepreneurs running Common Service Centres (CSCs). The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is enhancing healthcare accessibility, while SANKALP Hubs for Women Empowerment operate across 742 districts. Additionally, initiatives like digital banking and Aadhaar-linked services are providing women with increased financial security.

Such reforms are actively dedicated for the rising presence of women in India’s national recognition platforms. They serve a subtle yet powerful response to external critics and media outlets, which have often painted India in a negative light. For years, international media have highlighted India’s challenges with gender violence, social exclusion, and the marginalization of women. Critics have used these issues to defame India’s progress, often portraying the country as a place where women are systematically oppressed. The increasing acknowledgment of grassroots women leaders in the Padma Awards narrative is a sophisticated counter-narrative. It challenges the simplistic portrayal of Indian women as victims of societal and cultural constraints and instead showcases them as resilient, capable, and integral contributors to national development. Each of these women are instrumental in writing the New India narrative as envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. India is evolving, and women are at the forefront of this transformation. The increasing recognition of women in prestigious national awards like the Padma Awards is an assertion of the women’s agency in shaping her own story of progress and empowerment, one that is defined by India and its people, not its critics.

Title: A concise exploration of India’s digital transformation journey, detailing key successes and learnings to guide international audiences
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:57:29 +0000
Content: In the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in digital transformation, revolutionizing the way its citizens interact with technology. From pioneering digital payments to building one of the world’s largest biometric identification systems, India’s digital economy has reshaped industries, empowered millions, and set new global benchmarks. As the country moves toward its ambitious goal of a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028, its journey offers valuable lessons for nations seeking to build inclusive, scalable, and sustainable digital ecosystems. India’s story is one of unprecedented growth, bold policies, and an unwavering focus on inclusivity, serving as a testament to the power of technology to drive socioeconomic change.
India’s digital economy has witnessed exponential growth, propelled by rapid internet penetration, affordable data, and widespread smartphone adoption. With over 950 million internet users and 650 million smartphone users, the nation has embraced connectivity at an unprecedented scale. This digital boom has reshaped the country’s economic landscape, creating new opportunities and industries while closing long-standing divides, particularly between urban and rural areas. Historically, rural India has been underserved by technology, but as internet access has expanded, these areas have become significant contributors to the digital revolution. The widespread availability of affordable internet and mobile data has brought new economic opportunities to rural India, where previously digital access was a luxury. By breaking down geographical barriers, digital transformation has helped millions gain access to services such as education, healthcare, and financial inclusion, areas where technology had once struggled to reach.
At the forefront of this transformation is India’s financial technology sector, which has redefined the way people transact, save, and invest. In 2016, the introduction of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) catalyzed a cashless revolution, enabling real-time digital payments via mobile apps and QR codes. UPI has allowed India to leapfrog traditional banking systems, moving directly to mobile and internet-based financial services. The success of UPI, an open, interoperable model designed for financial inclusion, offers valuable lessons on how digital payment platforms can drive large-scale adoption and economic integration. Unlike WeChat Pay in China, which operates within an all-encompassing ecosystem, UPI focuses on public access and empowerment. Today, India processes more than 10 billion UPI transactions every month, a staggering figure that highlights the scale of adoption and India’s growing influence in the global financial landscape. Countries like Singapore and the UAE have adopted similar models, recognizing UPI’s ability to facilitate efficient, inclusive, and scalable financial systems.
The success of UPI is not just a national achievement; it has become a global benchmark for digital payments. Countries around the world, particularly in emerging markets, have recognized UPI as a model for building a secure and inclusive digital payments ecosystem. The platform’s interoperability allows users to access and transfer funds across multiple banks and payment platforms seamlessly, making it an ideal tool for financial inclusion. Moreover, UPI’s focus on empowering individuals with accessible, low-cost financial services has proved critical in fostering economic integration, particularly among low-income and marginalized populations.
Alongside UPI, India’s digital transformation is also closely tied to the Aadhaar system, the world’s largest biometric identification program. Aadhaar has helped over 1.3 billion people access critical services such as banking, subsidies, and healthcare. Much like Estonia’s digital identity system, Aadhaar serves as a model for biometric-based identification, although with a focus on financial inclusion rather than e-governance. Estonia’s digital ID system is designed primarily to enable secure transactions and online governance, while Aadhaar’s primary focus is on ensuring that all citizens, especially the underserved, can access essential services and benefits. Aadhaar’s role in promoting financial inclusion is unparalleled—enabling Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) that have saved the Indian government billions of dollars by reducing fraud and inefficiencies in welfare distribution.
India’s emphasis on affordability and accessibility has been pivotal to the success of its digital revolution. The telecom sector has played a crucial role in this by offering low-cost mobile data, making internet access available to millions of people, including in rural areas. With mobile data prices as low as $0.09 per GB, India has witnessed one of the most significant surges in data consumption globally, with the average user consuming 14GB of data per month. The availability of affordable mobile data has democratized access to information and services, opening new possibilities in education, healthcare, and business. The expansion of 5G services will further accelerate this growth, bridging the digital divide between urban and rural India and enabling innovations that will transform every sector, from telemedicine to e-commerce.
The growth of e-commerce in India has been another testament to the power of digital transformation. Between 2017 and 2023, digital payments in India’s e-commerce sector grew by 50.8%, reflecting the rapid adoption of online shopping. Major global players like Amazon and Flipkart have capitalized on this trend, shaping consumer behavior and pushing the boundaries of online retail. However, it is India’s homegrown platforms, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), that are redefining the landscape of digital commerce. ONDC aims to empower small businesses by providing them with the infrastructure to participate in the digital economy, creating a more level playing field. In this way, ONDC helps small businesses compete with larger corporations, ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation reach all sectors of society.
India’s success in building an inclusive digital ecosystem has been underpinned by its government’s strategic policies and initiatives. Programs such as Digital India, launched in 2015, laid the foundation for a strong digital infrastructure, expanding broadband connectivity, promoting e-governance, and ensuring that public services are available online. Initiatives like Startup India and Make in India have further nurtured the country’s tech ecosystem, positioning India as the third-largest startup hub globally, with over 100 unicorns. These programs have helped India build a thriving digital economy that spans across sectors, including finance, healthcare, education, and agriculture. The Digital India initiative has played a crucial role in ensuring that the country’s vast population can participate in the digital economy, bridging the gap between urban and rural regions and empowering citizens to access vital services.
While India’s digital transformation has been a success story, it has not been without challenges. As the digital economy grows, so too does the need for strong data protection and cybersecurity measures. The digital landscape is continually evolving, and the challenge for policymakers will be to balance rapid technological advancements with ensuring user privacy and security. India is working to strengthen its regulatory frameworks to ensure that innovation continues while safeguarding citizens’ rights. India’s approach to data protection will be crucial in maintaining public trust and fostering further digital adoption.
Looking ahead, India’s digital economy is poised to continue its growth trajectory, with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) set to drive the next wave of innovation. AI alone is expected to contribute nearly $957 billion to India’s GDP by 2035, with transformative impacts on sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. Blockchain, cloud computing, and IoT are already being integrated across industries to improve efficiency, security, and data-driven decision-making. As these technologies evolve, they will further position India as a global leader in digital transformation.
India’s digital revolution has demonstrated that transformation is not just about technology—it’s about people. By prioritizing inclusivity, affordability, and accessibility, India has shown that a well-planned digital economy can empower millions, bridge socioeconomic gaps, and drive sustainable growth. The success of UPI, Aadhaar, and other key initiatives serves as a model for other nations looking to modernize their own digital economies. India’s focus on financial inclusion, accessibility, and open, interoperable platforms provides valuable insights for countries around the world seeking to replicate its success. India’s journey offers both inspiration and a roadmap, proving that with the right policies, partnerships, and people-centric approaches, a thriving digital future is within reach.

Content: The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has emerged as a powerful tool for women’s financial empowerment, with women accounting for 68% of the scheme’s 52 crore beneficiaries, according to a report by the State Bank of India’s (SBI) Economic Research Department released on Wednesday.
Over the last nine fiscals (FY16 to FY25), the per-woman PMMY loan disbursement grew at a CAGR of 13%, reaching Rs. 62,679, while incremental deposits per woman rose by 14% CAGR to Rs. 95,269, highlighting the scheme’s impact in fostering financial independence.
The report praised PMMY for bringing entrepreneurially underrepresented social groups into the financial mainstream. Notably, nearly 50% of PMMY accounts belong to SC/ST and OBC categories, with 11% from minority groups.
Among states, Bihar leads in the number of women PMMY entrepreneurs (4.2 crore), followed by Tamil Nadu (4.0 crore) and West Bengal (3.7 crore). Meanwhile, Maharashtra has the highest share of women account holders (79%), followed by Jharkhand (75%) and West Bengal (73%).
The average loan ticket size has seen significant growth, nearly tripling from Rs. 38,000 in FY16 to Rs. 1.02 lakh in FY25. Since its inception, PMMY has sanctioned 52.07 crore loans worth Rs. 33.19 lakh crore (as of February 28).
PMMY, launched under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA), facilitates collateral-free loans up to Rs. 20 lakh through Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs).
The loan category mix has also evolved, with the share of Shishu loans (smallest loan category) dropping from 93% in FY16 to 51.7% in FY25, while Kishor loans (mid-range category) grew from 5.9% to 44.7%. This shift indicates that many Shishu borrowers have expanded their businesses and moved to higher loan brackets, reflecting growth in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
The SBI report underscores PMMY’s transformative role in fostering entrepreneurship and economic inclusion among women and marginalized communities, strengthening their financial standing and business potential.

Title: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju says Waqf Amendment Bill is for the benefit of the country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday said that the Waqf Amendment Bill, set to be introduced in the Lok Sabha, serves the nation’s best interests. Dismissing opposition to the bill as politically motivated, Rijiju emphasized that any objections should be rooted in logic and assured that the government is prepared to address all concerns.
Speaking to the media, Rijiju highlighted the significance of the bill, calling it a “historic day” and underscoring its importance not only for Muslims but for the entire nation. “This bill is being introduced in the interest of the country, and crores of Muslims, along with the whole country, will support it,” he said. He also addressed the political opposition, asserting that those opposing the bill were doing so out of political motives. “If someone opposes, they should oppose on the basis of logic, and we will also answer them,” Rijiju added.
The Union Minister noted that the bill was the result of extensive thought and preparation, indicating that it had been carefully considered before its introduction.
In a show of support for the bill, Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) President Jayant Chaudhary expressed his backing, stating, “We are with the NDA. We’ve issued a whip.” Similarly, Union Minister George Kurian voiced his approval, stating that all communities, including poor Muslims and the middle class, supported the amendment. Kurian further argued that the opposition to the bill was primarily coming from large landowners. “Only big landlords are opposing this Bill,” he said, stressing that the bill was transparent and directly linked to land and property.
Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Minister OP Rajbhar criticized opposition parties, accusing them of engaging in “vote politics.” He specifically targeted the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and Congress, alleging that their supporters were opposing the bill for political gains. Rajbhar also pointed out that the Waqf Board rules had been amended three times previously, with any shortcomings addressed to ensure that the benefits reached those under the Waqf Board’s jurisdiction. “I would like to ask those who are opposing to tell me the name of one poor person who has benefited from Waqf Board land,” he said. Rajbhar reiterated that the government’s goal was to ensure the benefit of Waqf land for the underprivileged, accusing the opposition of opposing the bill solely for votes.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is set to be tabled in Parliament today, and both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have issued whips to ensure the presence of their MPs in the House. With no signs of bipartisan consensus between the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition INDIA bloc, the outcome of the bill’s introduction is expected to be determined by the majority numbers present in the Lok Sabha.

Title: NHAI hikes toll charges on highways and expressways across country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:56:13 +0000
Content: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has raised toll charges for motorists driving through highways and expressways across the country by an average of 4 to 5 per cent as part of the annual exercise of factoring in inflation costs.
The adjustment is part of NHAI’s annual review, which aligns toll rates with inflation based on the wholesale price index, and the additional revenue will support highway upkeep and expansion projects, a senior official said.
According to the NHAI notification, the one-way toll on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for cars and jeeps travelling from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut will rise from Rs 165 to Rs 170, while the commute from Ghaziabad to Meerut will increase from Rs 70 to Rs 75.
Light commercial vehicles and buses on this route will have to shell out Rs 275 per trip, while trucks will be charged Rs 580. At the Chhijarsi toll plaza on NH-9, tolls for cars will go up from Rs 170 to Rs 175. Light commercial vehicles will pay Rs 280, while buses and trucks will have to cough up Rs 590.
Motorists travelling on highways running through Lucknow, including those linking the state capital to Kanpur, Ayodhya, Raebareli, and Barabanki, will have to pay an additional Rs 5 to 10 per trip for light vehicles, while heavy vehicles will have to shell out an extra Rs 20 to 25.
The monthly pass for cars will go up from Rs 930 to Rs 950, while for cabs the amount will increase from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
On the Delhi-Jaipur Highway, at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, tolls for private cars and jeeps will stay the same, but larger vehicles will see an increase of Rs 5 per trip. The monthly pass for cars will rise from Rs 930 to Rs 950, and for commercial cars and jeeps, it will go from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
There are around 855 plazas on India’s national highway network, of which 675 are government-funded, while another 180 or so are managed by private operators.

Title: Ghibli effect: ChatGPT usage hits record after rollout of viral feature
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:34:36 +0000
Content: The frenzy to create Ghibli-style AI art using ChatGPT’s image-generation tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI’s chatbot last week, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature’s usage.
The viral trend saw users from across the globe flood social media with images based on the hand-drawn style of the famed Japanese animation outfit, Studio Ghibli, founded by renowned director Hayao Miyazaki and known for movies such as “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro”.
Average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time this year, according to data from market research firm Similarweb.
“We added one million users in the last hour,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an X post on Monday, comparing it with the addition of one million users in five days following ChatGPT’s red-hot launch more than two years ago.
Active users, in-app subscription revenue and app downloads reached an all-time high last week, according to SensorTower data, after the AI company launched updates to its GPT-4o model, enabling advanced image generation capabilities.
Global app downloads and weekly active users on the ChatGPT app grew 11% and 5%, respectively, from the prior week, while in-app purchase revenue increased 6%, the market intelligence firm said.
However, the chatbot has been hit with a series of glitches and low-scale outages over the past week as it deals with a spike in traffic due to the popularity of its image-generating tool.
“We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” the OpenAI co-founder said on Tuesday.

LEGAL UNCERTAINTY
The extensive use of the AI tool for the Ghibli effect has also led to questions about potential copyright violations.
“The legal landscape of AI-generated images mimicking Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style is an uncertain terrain. Copyright law has generally protected only specific expressions rather than artistic styles themselves,” said Evan Brown, partner at law firm Neal & McDevitt.
OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data used to train its AI models and the legality surrounding its latest feature.
Studio Ghibli co-founder Miyazaki’s comments from 2016 on AI-generated images resurfaced after the trend blew up last week.
“I am utterly disgusted,” Miyazaki had said after being shown an early render of an AI-generated.
“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”

Title: Myanmar junta should expand access for earthquake rescuers, aid and rights groups say as death toll nears 3,000
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:31:32 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s ruling junta should free up movement by international aid workers to help survivors of a devastating earthquake, even in areas controlled by groups battling it, aid and human rights groups said, as the death toll looks set to cross 3,000.
The military has struggled to run Myanmar since overthrowing the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, reducing to tatters the economy and basic services including healthcare.
With thousands injured and infrastructure crippled following Friday’s quake of magnitude 7.7, regional authorities were struggling to cope and desperately needed support, the groups said.
“The situation remains critical, with disrupted communications and road access hampering response efforts, particularly in Sagaing,” the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said, referring to one hard-hit area.
More than 28 million people live in the six regions affected by the quake, it added in a statement, saying it had $12 million in emergency funding for food, shelter, water, sanitation, mental health support, and other services.
China’s official Xinhua news agency said the death toll rose to 2,886 on Wednesday, with 4,639 injured, citing the junta.
The rural parts of hard-hit Sagaing were mostly under the control of armed resistance groups fighting the military government, the International Crisis Group said.
“They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict,” it added in a statement.
Even before the quake, the ICG said, information had been hard to gather from such areas, because of a junta blackout of internet and mobile phone networks as part of the conflict. The military has dismissed as misinformation accusations that it committed widespread atrocities as it fought against a multi-pronged rebellion that followed the coup.
UNFETTERED ACCESS
Human Rights Watch urged the junta to allow unfettered access for humanitarian aid and lift curbs impeding aid agencies, saying donors should channel aid through independent groups rather than only junta authorities.
“Myanmar’s junta cannot be trusted to respond to a disaster of this scale,” Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report.
“Concerned governments and international agencies need to press the junta to allow full and immediate access to survivors, wherever they are.”
Australia announced a further A$6.5 million ($4.1 million) in humanitarian support for Myanmar, supplied “through thoroughly vetted international and local partners.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, “We take proactive steps to ensure our assistance does not legitimise the military regime in Myanmar.”
The military council has rejected requests from international journalists to cover the quake devastation, citing the lack of water, electricity, and hotels.
In neighbouring Thailand, the death toll from the quake rose to 22 on Wednesday, with hundreds of buildings damaged.
Rescuers scoured for survivors in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, where the death toll is 15, with 72 missing.
The government is investigating the collapse and initial tests showed some steel samples from the site were substandard.

Title: Soccer: Wolves ease relegation worries with 1-0 win over West Ham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:48:08 +0000
Content: Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal of the game as they beat visitors West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday to make it two wins in a row and put some more daylight between them and the Premier League relegation places.
The win leaves Wolves in 17th spot on 29 points, 12 ahead of Ipswich Town in 18th and 19th-placed Leicester City, who are both in action on Wednesday against Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively. West Ham are 16th on 34 points.
The visitors almost took an early lead when Jarrod Bowen made his way down the right before putting in a low cross in the 13th minute, but the ball went just behind striker Evan Ferguson and he couldn’t get a clean shot away.
Wolves defender Toti Gomes also went close to breaking the deadlock three minutes later as he met a near-post free kick with a header that flashed towards goal and forced a great save from Alphonse Areola.
Strand Larsen finally broke the deadlock in the 21st minute, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and drilling a deflected effort past Areola for his 10th goal of the season, and six minutes later Marshall Munetsi should have made it two, but his shot came crashing back off the crossbar.
Hammers manager Graham Potter sent on striker Niclas Fuellkrug after the break, and though he gave a much-needed focal point to the visitors’ attack, the game descended into a bad-tempered affair punctuated by pushing, shoving and arguing for much of the second half.
The Hammers went on to dominate but they failed to create good goal-scoring chances, and the closest they came to an equaliser were a header off the crossbar by Fuellkrug and a late shot that Tomas Soucek fired just wide.
Strand Larsen, who had another good effort fly just wide in the second half, said he was delighted to reach double figures for the season, despite needing the help of a deflection to get on the scoresheet.
“I don’t care, the ball went in. It doesn’t matter how. I’m happy anyway,” he told Sky Sports.
“10 is always the goal for a striker, and we have eight games to go. People have been doubting me a bit so I think it’s nice to show them. Today I was a bit lucky, but that’s how it is,” he added.

Title: Soccer: Saka seals comeback with goal as Arsenal beat Fulham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:32:48 +0000
Content: Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 in the Premier League on Tuesday thanks to another goal from stand-in striker Mikel Merino while Bukayo Saka struck a few minutes into his return from nearly four months out with injury.
Arsenal went ahead eight minutes before halftime when a cute ball from Jurrien Timber put Ethan Nwaneri round the back of the Fulham defence. He found Merino whose shot deflected beyond the reach of goalkeeper Bernd Leno into the corner.
The second half was a blizzard of chances for both sides.
Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard blazed over from a Gabriel Martinelli cross. Fulham then nearly equalised when Raul Jimenez had a breakaway chance well saved by goalkeeper David Raya with Leno doing the same at the other end from Timber.
Saka’s return brought the biggest roar from the Arsenal supporters when the 23-year-old nodded in a flicked-on cross in the 73rd minute not long after coming on.
Arsenal’s manager Mikel Arteta described it as “a beautiful moment” that showed how much “our people love, respect, and admire Bukayo.”
“It’s not a surprise to any of us… It lifted the stadium, the energy. It’s great to have him back.”
It wasn’t a perfect evening for the home side though. Rodrigo Muniz got a late consolation goal for Fulham, while Arsenal defenders Gabriel and Timber both went off with injuries, the former after just 15 minutes.
Arteta told reporters that both players would be assessed on Wednesday to see the extent of their problems.
“Gabby felt something in his hamstring, we don’t know how big that is,” Arteta said. “Jurrien was struggling very early in the game, he managed to continue but at some point, he couldn’t.”
Arsenal’s victory means they trail league leaders Liverpool by nine points with eight games remaining. Arne Slot’s side could widen the gap again when they play local rivals Everton on Wednesday.
Arsenal also play Everton in the Premier League on Saturday before hosting Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final next week.
Fulham manager Marco Silva said his team had not been aggressive enough to win the game and push towards a European competition qualification place, although they did have a string of chances in the second half.
“What decided the game was that we conceded two soft goals,” Silva said.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches ‘NITI NCAER states Economic Forum’ portal to strengthen fiscal data access
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:03:36 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday unveiled the “NITI NCAER States Economic Forum” portal in New Delhi. Developed by NITI Aayog in collaboration with the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), the portal serves as a comprehensive repository of State finances, providing data on social, economic, and fiscal parameters from 1990-91 to 2022-23, according to NITI Aayog.
Speaking at the launch event, Sitharaman highlighted the portal’s role in ensuring authentic and accessible financial data for states. She stated that the platform would enable states to make informed policy interventions, improve revenue management, and learn from peer experiences. She also stressed the need for balance in public finances, ensuring revenue generation without imposing excessive burdens on citizens.
Dr. Poonam Gupta, Director General of NCAER, underscored the significance of the portal in understanding the diverse fiscal trajectories of states. She noted that a centralized platform would allow policymakers to compare financial strategies and make well-informed decisions.
NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam described the initiative as a valuable public knowledge resource, promoting fiscal awareness and learning across states. He further termed the forum a “permanent asset for the nation”, aiding in data-driven economic policymaking.
Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Suman K Bery, emphasized that the forum represents a significant step toward data-driven research, particularly in public finance management.

Title: As Iran tensions build, US military moves warplanes to reinforce Middle East
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 04:58:57 +0000
Content: U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reinforced U.S. military capability in the Middle East with more warplanes, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, amid a more than two-week-old U.S. bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran.
The Pentagon’s brief statement did not specify which aircraft were being deployed or where precisely they were sent.
However, as many as six B-2 bombers have relocated in the past week or so to a U.S.-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, according to U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Experts say that puts the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest U.S. bombs and nuclear weapons, in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.
“Should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to defend our people,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.
The U.S. military’s Strategic Command has declined to say how many B-2s have reached Diego Garcia and noted that it does not comment on exercises or operations involving the B-2.
There is already considerable firepower in the Middle East and the U.S. military will soon have two aircraft carriers in the region.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran on Sunday with bombing and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.
While B-2 bombers have been employed to strike buried Houthi targets in Yemen, most experts say use of the stealthy bomber is overkill there and the targets aren’t buried so deeply.
However, the B-2 is equipped to carry America’s most potent bomb — the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator. That is the weapon that experts say could be used to strike Iran’s nuclear program.
There are only 20 B-2 bombers in the Air Force’s inventory so they are usually used sparingly.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the U.S. would receive a strong blow if Trump followed through with his threats.
Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Commander Amirali Hajizadeh threatened U.S. forces in the Middle East, noting American bases in the Middle East and adding: “They are in a glass house and should not throw stones.”
One official told Reuters that the U.S. military was also moving some air defense capabilities from Asia to the Middle East.
In his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions.
Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal’s limits on uranium enrichment.
Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian energy purposes.

Title: May god shower blessings upon India and its leadership: Myanmar locals hail Operation Brahma
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:30:25 +0000
Content: India’s Operation Brahma is in full swing, providing critical rescue and relief efforts in Myanmar following a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The local community has expressed deep gratitude for India’s swift aid and support during this crisis.
A Myanmar local, Hussain, spoke to ANI and expressed gratitude for India’s efforts in Myanmar. He said, “We felt great relief when you arrived. You (Indians) are very hardworking people. We are very happy and at peace. We have benefited greatly from the arrival of the NDRF. May God shower blessings upon India and its leadership.”  
NDRF crew member Kavita Singh told ANI, “There is little possibility of finding survivors as several days have passed, and the weather is extremely hot. So far, we have only retrieved dead bodies.”  
She emphasized the NDRF’s commitment, stating that despite infrastructural challenges and risks, the team remains dedicated to the operation. Singh also mentioned that the NDRF has received immense support from the locals. She shared an incident in which a family approached the NDRF team, expressing relief and gratitude for their rescue efforts. “We are very proud and thankful that you have come to help us,” the locals told them.  
Another NDRF crew member, Manju Bhati, stated that a team of 57 NDRF personnel had arrived in Myanmar. She explained that they had been assigned 13 locations to work in. “It is very difficult to retrieve the dead bodies. The intense heat makes survival nearly impossible. In such narrow streets, neither excavators nor cranes can operate… Everyone is in God’s hands now,” she said.  
In response to the earthquake, an NDRF team, along with essential relief supplies, has been deployed to support rescue operations. According to an NDRF statement on Tuesday, “An Urban Search & Rescue (USAR) team of 80 skilled rescuers from the 8th Battalion NDRF, Ghaziabad, along with four trained canines, was airlifted in two sorties by the Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130 Hercules aircraft.”  
The scale of devastation in Myanmar is enormous, and the swift actions taken by the Indian government are helping to alleviate the suffering of the affected population.  
India has delivered 625 metric tonnes (MT) of Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) material to Myanmar as part of Operation Brahma, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Tuesday.  
Operation Brahma was launched to provide essential support, including Search and Rescue (SAR), humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and medical assistance, following the earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28.  
As the First Responder in times of crisis in the region, Operation Brahma is a whole-of-government effort by India to address the widespread destruction in Myanmar.  
India has extended support on multiple fronts. According to the Indian Army, surgeons at the Indian medical facility in Myanmar have successfully performed two life-saving surgeries. On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Myo Moe Aung, who is overseeing relief operations in Mandalay Division, visited the hospital unexpectedly. He praised the efficiency of the medical setup and appreciated India’s extraordinary efforts in supporting Myanmar during this tragic crisis.  
Indian Naval ships INS Satpura and INS Savitri, from the Eastern Naval Command, sailed for Yangon on March 29, carrying 40 tonnes of HADR material, which was handed over to the Chief Minister of Yangon on Monday. INS Karmuk and LCU 52, from the Andaman and Nicobar Command, sailed for Yangon on March 30, carrying 30 tonnes of relief materials, including clothing, drinking water, food, medicines, and emergency supplies. These were handed over at Yangon Port on Tuesday, the MEA confirmed.  
The MEA further stated that India stands ready to deploy additional material assistance and resources based on the evolving ground-level needs.  
India’s ongoing efforts under Operation Brahma highlight its commitment to providing swift and substantial responses to natural disasters in its neighborhood.

Title: Pak troops cross LoC in J&K’s Poonch; effectively responded, says Indian Army
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:17:28 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Wednesday that the Pakistan Army intruded into Indian territory and violated the ceasefire by opening fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.
“The violation took place at 1:10 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Indian troops responded with controlled and calibrated retaliation,” the spokesperson said.
The defence spokesperson did not mention any casualties on the Pakistani side due to the Indian retaliation. However, official sources said five enemy soldiers were injured in the explosion and the subsequent exchange of fire between the two sides.
Lt. Colonel Suneel Bartwal, MoD spokesperson, said in a statement: “On April 1, 2025, a mine blast occurred in the Krishna Ghati sector due to a Pakistan Army intrusion across the LoC. This was followed by unprovoked firing and a ceasefire violation by the Pakistan Army. Our troops responded effectively in a controlled and calibrated manner. The situation is under control and is being closely monitored.”
“The Indian Army reiterates the importance of upholding the tenets of the Director Generals Military Operations (DGsMO) understanding of 2021 to maintain peace along the LoC,” he added.
Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on February 25, 2021, between the two sides, ceasefire violations have been rare, and local issues have usually been resolved through flag meetings at the brigade commander’s level.
The Indian Army and security forces have been maintaining heightened vigilance along the border and the LoC due to the presence of foreign mercenaries in the border districts of Poonch, Rajouri, and Kathua, as well as in some areas of the Jammu division hinterland.
Currently, an extended ‘seek and destroy’ operation has been underway since March 23, when five Pakistani terrorists were spotted in the Kathua district, 4 km inside the International Border.
So far, two of the five terrorists have been gunned down by security forces, while efforts are ongoing to trace and eliminate the remaining three.
Four local policemen were killed in the initial gunfight between the police and the hiding terrorists.

Title: Israel to seize parts of Gaza as military operation expands
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:12:35 +0000
Content: Israel announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza on Wednesday, saying large areas of the enclave would be seized and added to its security zones, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
In a statement, Defence Minister Israel Katz said evacuations would take place from areas where there was fighting, while urging Gazans to eliminate Hamas and return Israeli hostages as the only way to end the war.
He said the operation would clear out militants and infrastructure “and seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.
The Israeli military had already issued evacuation warnings to Gazans living around the southern city of Rafah and towards the city of Khan Younis, telling them to move to the Al-Mawasi area on the shore, previously designated a humanitarian zone.
The Palestinian civil defence agency said at least 12 bodies had been recovered by its teams in Khan Younis after a wave of airstrikes was reported overnight, and Palestinian radio reported that the area around Rafah was almost completely empty following the evacuation orders.
At the site of a strike in Khan Younis, Rida al-Jabbour held up a tiny shoe and pointed at a blood-spattered wall as she related how a neighbour had been killed along with her three-month-old baby, their bodies dismembered by the blast.
“From the moment the strike occurred we have not been able to sit or sleep or anything,” she said, describing how rescue workers were unable to separate the remains of those killed.
BUFFER ZONE
Katz’s statement did not make clear how much land Israel intended to seize or whether the move represented a permanent annexation of territory, which would add further pressure on a population in Gaza already living in one of the most crowded areas in the world.
According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometres or around 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave.
Seizing the buffer zone, which contains infrastructure including wells, sewage pumping stations, and wastewater treatment facilities as well as a significant part of Gaza’s agricultural land, would also increase pressure on the enclave’s ability to sustain itself.
At the same time, Israeli leaders have said they plan to facilitate voluntary departure of Palestinians from the enclave, after U.S. President Donald Trump called for it to be permanently evacuated and redeveloped as a coastal resort under U.S. control.
Katz’s remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated calls for Hamas to disarm and said the application of military pressure was the best way to get back the remaining 59 hostages.
Israeli leaders have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, the militant group which has controlled the enclave since 2007, and the expanded operation appeared at least partly aimed at increasing civilian pressure on its leaders.
“I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped,” Katz said in his statement. “This is the only way to end the war.”
WAR EXPANDS
Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza last month and sent ground troops back in, after two months of relative calm following the conclusion of a U.S.-backed truce to allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the strikes and Israel has also cut off aid to the enclave, saying much of it was taken by Hamas.
Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to get talks aimed at ending the war back on track have so far failed to make progress and the military’s return to Gaza has fuelled protests in Israel by families and supporters of some of the hostages.
On Wednesday, the Hostage Families’ Forum said it was “horrified” to wake up to news of the expanded operation.
As the operation in Gaza has escalated, Israel has also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, with a strike on a Hezbollah commander in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday that further strained fraying ceasefire agreements which largely halted fighting in January.
In addition, Israeli troops are still carrying out a major operation in the occupied West Bank.
Israel invaded Gaza following the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel by thousands of Hamas-led gunmen that killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and ravaged the Gaza Strip, forcing almost the entire population of 2.3 million from their homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in tents and improvised shelters.

Title: Hungary deploys military to contain foot-and-mouth outbreak
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:52:27 +0000
Content: Hungary has deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a northwestern area bordering Slovakia and Austria, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday.
Hungary reported its first case in more than 50 years of the disease, which often leads to trade restrictions, on a cattle farm early last month.
Since then, neighbouring Slovakia has detected outbreaks at five locations after reporting its first cases in March. It has also stepped up measures to contain the disease’s spread.
Hungarian Agriculture Minister Istvan Nagy said foot-and-mouth disease was found at two additional farms in Gyor-Moson-Sopron county by Wednesday morning, affecting 3,500 cattle in total.
“We are making every effort to prevent any additional outbreaks,” Nagy said in a Facebook video.
The defence ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions regarding the number of soldiers deployed to assist the containment effort.
Hungary’s cattle stock numbered 861,000 heads based on a livestock census in December, little changed from levels a year earlier. That constituted 1.2% of the European Union’s total cattle stocks, official statistics showed.
Data on the website of Hungary’s National Food Chain Safety Office showed foot-and-mouth disease affecting a total of four farms in Hungary, all of them located in the country’s northwest, while checks at more than 600 other farms returned negative results.
Nagy said Hungarian authorities have launched additional measures, including disinfection points at border crossings and highway exits in the northwest to prevent the disease from spreading beyond the affected county.
Foot-and-mouth disease poses no danger to humans but causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats.

Title: World Autism Awareness Day: a call for understanding and inclusion
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:44:27 +0000
Content: World Autism Awareness Day was established by the United Nations in 2007 to spread awareness about various autism spectrum disorders among its member nations. Autism is a neurological condition that primarily affects children, requiring special attention from parents and caregivers. Understanding, acceptance, and inclusion are crucial to ensuring that autistic individuals feel valued and supported.
The theme for this year’s World Autism Awareness Day is “Advancing Neurodiversity and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” This theme emphasizes that autism is a part of neurodiversity and should be addressed through global sustainability initiatives. The day serves as a reminder for parents to closely observe their children’s behaviour and seek timely diagnosis and intervention if any psychological concerns arise. Early action can significantly enhance the quality of life for those with autism.
Observance of World Autism Awareness Day
The Institute of Neurodiversity (ION), in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Global Communications, plays a significant role in observing this day. As a neuro-minority-founded organization, ION actively works towards strengthening neuro-minorities worldwide. Headquartered in Switzerland, it has members from over 40 countries who strive to create equal opportunities, foster acceptance, and promote education about autism.
To achieve the objectives outlined in this year’s theme, parents, teachers, and society at large must take proactive measures to support autistic individuals. Some key initiatives include:

Encouraging a Positive Mindset – Maintaining a supportive environment helps autistic children develop confidence and optimism. Regardless of the severity of their condition, parents should continually encourage and appreciate their small achievements.
Building Trust and Open Communication – Children with autism should feel safe sharing their concerns with family members and seeking guidance whenever needed.
Establishing a Routine – Parents should help their autistic children develop a structured daily routine that minimizes anxiety and enhances their sense of security.
Promoting Self-Worth – Both parents and teachers should instill confidence in autistic children by reinforcing that they are not different but unique. As the famous Bollywood movie Taare Zameen Par highlights, “Every child is special.” Their hidden creativity must be recognized and nurtured.
Spending Quality Time – Parents should dedicate ample time to engage with their autistic children through meaningful conversations and activities.
Avoiding Unnecessary Pressure – Comparing children or pressuring them to meet unrealistic expectations can lead to inferiority complexes, which can be highly detrimental to their mental health.

Causes and Early Intervention
Parents must recognize that each child has individual capabilities and aspirations. Unrealistic parental expectations can lead to undue stress for children, particularly those with autism. Strict parenting styles, excessive restrictions, and lack of emotional connection may hinder a child’s willingness to express their feelings. Research suggests that autism may also be linked to factors such as prenatal medication use, viral infections, or pregnancy complications.
If autism symptoms go unnoticed during childhood, they can persist into adulthood, making early diagnosis and intervention crucial. World Autism Awareness Day serves as a reminder to be proactive in recognizing, accepting, and addressing autism through education and open dialogue.
Impact of Travel on Autistic Individuals
According to the World Population Review 2025, nearly 715 out of every 100,000 people in India are affected by autism. While travel poses challenges for everyone, it can be particularly overwhelming for autistic individuals due to disruptions in routine, unpredictability, crowded spaces, and unfamiliar sights and sounds.
Government Initiatives for Autistic Individuals
The Government of India, in collaboration with various organizations, has launched several initiatives to support individuals with autism. One such initiative is the Tata E-Sanidhya Neuro-Diversity Platform, developed by the Tata Power Community Development Trust in partnership with the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NIEPID), under the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). This specialized online and offline service assists individuals with neurodiverse conditions, particularly those with autism.
Moving Beyond Awareness to Acceptance
With the increasing prevalence of autism, it is not enough to merely observe World Autism Awareness Day—we must celebrate the unique strengths of autistic individuals. Society should work towards creating an inclusive environment where autistic people can thrive without unnecessary restrictions. Through education, research, and open communication, we can dispel myths, combat stigma, and promote a culture of acceptance and empowerment.

Title: Govt pushes for defence indigenisation with naval engine development
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:29:38 +0000
Content: In a major step towards self-reliance in defence manufacturing, the Indian Navy has signed a Project Sanction Order with Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited for the design and development of a 6MW Medium Speed Marine Diesel Engine. The agreement, signed under the Make-I category, marks a significant milestone in India’s push for indigenous defence production.
The initiative will see the prototype diesel engine developed with over 50% indigenous content at a cost of Rs 270 crore, with 70% of the funding provided by the government.
India has traditionally relied on foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for high-capacity diesel engines. This project aims to break that dependency by fostering domestic capabilities in marine engine development. The sanctioned order also includes the design and development of diesel engines ranging from 3MW to 10MW. Once completed, these engines will be deployed for both main propulsion and power generation on ships operated by the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard.
This project will also serve as a catalyst for the growth of the domestic defence industrial ecosystem, encouraging innovation and fostering technological advancements in the sector.
Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has been actively promoting the indigenisation of critical defence technologies. The collaboration between the Indian Navy and Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited marks a crucial step in this direction, reinforcing India’s commitment to self-reliance and strengthening its defence capabilities for the future.

Title: Russia and Ukraine trade new accusations on breaches of energy ceasefire
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:18:57 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine accused each other on Wednesday of launching new attacks against each other’s energy facilities, in violation of a U.S.-brokered moratorium.
Both sides said they were providing details of the alleged violations to the United States, which got Moscow and Kyiv to agree the limited truce last month as a hoped-for stepping stone towards a full ceasefire.
Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had conducted drone and shelling attacks in the western Kursk region that cut off power to over 1,500 households.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a Russian drone hit an energy substation in Sumy region and artillery fire damaged a power line in Dnipropetrovsk, cutting off electricity to nearly 4,000 consumers.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is impatient with both sides to move faster towards ending the three-year war.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the fact that President Vladimir Putin had agreed the energy truce was evidence he was serious about engaging in a peace process – something that Kyiv and some of its European allies dispute.
Peskov said that Moscow would keep working with the Americans despite what he called daily Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.
Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Russia was breaking the energy truce and called on the U.S. to boost sanctions against Moscow, as Trump has threatened to do.
Ukraine said last month it was willing to accept a full 30-day ceasefire but Putin declined to agree to that, raising a series of questions about how it would be monitored and concerns that Ukraine would use the breathing space to mobilise more soldiers and acquire more weapons from the West.

Title: SpaceX rocket cargo project puts Pacific seabirds in jeopardy
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:48:09 +0000
Content: A project proposed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the U.S. Air Force to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from a remote Pacific atoll could harm the many seabirds that nest at the wildlife refuge, according to biologists and experts who have spent more than a decade working to protect them.
It would not be the first time that SpaceX’s activities have affected protected birds. A SpaceX launch of its Starship rocket in Boca Chica, Texas, last year involved a blast that destroyed nests and eggs of plover shorebirds, landing the billionaire Musk’s company in legal trouble and leading him to remark jokingly that he would refrain from eating omelets for a week to compensate.
The Air Force announced in March that it has selected Johnston Atoll, a U.S. territory in the central Pacific Ocean located nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) southwest of the state of Hawaii, as the site to test the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program it is developing with SpaceX.
The project involves test landing rocket re-entry vehicles designed to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo to anywhere on Earth within about 90 minutes. It would be a breakthrough for military logistics by making it easier to move supplies quickly into distant locations.
According to biologists and experts who have worked on the one-square-mile (2.6 square km) atoll – designated as a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge and part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument – the project could be too much for the island’s 14 species of tropical birds to withstand.
Roughly a million seabirds use the atoll, home to a variety of wildlife, throughout the year, up from just a few thousand in the 1980s. The bird species include red-tailed tropicbirds, red-footed boobies and great frigatebirds, which have eight-foot (2-1/2 meter) wingspans.
“Any sort of aviation that happens to the island is going to have an impact at this point,” said Hawaii-based biologist Steven Minamishin, who works for the National Wildlife Refuge System, part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“The biggest issue this will bring is the sound of the rocket flushing birds off of their nests and having them so anxious and unsure as to not return to their nest, resulting in a loss of generation,” said University of Texas wildlife biologist Ryan Rash, who spent nearly a year on Johnston.
The project would involve construction of two landing pads and the relanding of 10 rockets over four years.
The Air Force and SpaceX are preparing an environmental assessment of the project in the coming weeks for public comment. The assessment is a requirement under a law called the National Environmental Policy Act before the Air Force can proceed with the project, which it wants to start this year.
The Air Force in a Federal Register notice in March said the project was unlikely to have a significant environmental impact but noted it could harm migratory birds.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Air Force said it is closely consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Fisheries Service, “to assess impacts and develop necessary measures for avoiding, minimizing and/or mitigating potential environmental impacts.”
Musk is serving as an adviser to President Donald Trump as they work to downsize and remake the federal government and eliminate thousands of employees.
‘ALL THAT’S LEFT’
In the Pacific, where unpopulated land is scarce and threatened by sea level rise, the birds depend on Johnston for their nesting and survival, according to the biologists interviewed by Reuters.
This makes the protection of these birds essential, said Desirée Sorenson-Groves, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association, a nonprofit group focused on protecting U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System.
“These little remote oceanic islands are all that’s left for them,” Sorenson-Groves said. “We’ve invested a lot of money as a country to bring back wildlife to these places.”
Johnston Atoll, closed to the public, is administered by the Air Force and managed by Fish and Wildlife Service. The island was used for nuclear testing from the late 1950s to 1962, and to stockpile chemical munitions including Agent Orange from 1972 to 1975.
The Air Force completed a clean-up of the atoll in 2004, and it has served as a haven for nesting seabirds and migrating shore birds since. Visits by people to the island have been highly controlled to avoid disturbing the birds.
The Fish and Wildlife Service led an effort to eradicate yellow-crazy ants, an invasive species, on the atoll after it was declared a refuge, sending crews for six-month stints starting in 2010 and ending in 2021. Crews brought their clothing in sealed bags, had their equipment frozen and sanitized, and used separate island shoes to prevent new species from invading the atoll, said Eric Baker, a Fish and Wildlife Service volunteer and wildlife photographer who spent a year on Johnston.
“The basic rule was cause no or as little disturbance as possible,” Baker said.
Baker said he is worried that the SpaceX project will undo all the painstaking conservation efforts over the years.
“The nests and the birds there are just going to be kind of vaporized,” Baker said.

Title: “Now Waqf money will reach common and poor”: Sufi Leader expresses hope for positive impact of Waqf Bill
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:41:40 +0000
Content: Chairman of the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, Syed Naseruddin Chishty, on Wednesday expressed optimism about the Waqf Bill, stating that it addresses opposition concerns and will ensure Waqf funds reach underprivileged Muslims.
“People have been waiting for this for a long time. There is hope that a good bill will come. In a democracy, everyone has the right to protest, but I have learned that the government has considered the key objections raised by the opposition. This will be a very good bill,” Chishty said.
He emphasized that the bill aims to ensure the fair distribution of Waqf funds, directly benefiting economically disadvantaged Muslims in India.
“Now, Waqf money will reach the common and poor Muslims,” he stated, highlighting the bill’s potential to bring greater transparency and accountability in managing Waqf resources.
While Chishty expressed support for the bill, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has strongly opposed it, with prominent leaders warning of legal action and a nationwide protest if the bill is passed.
AIMPLB spokesperson Dr. Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas condemned the bill, stating, “If this bill is passed in Parliament, we will start a nationwide movement against it. We won’t sit quietly. We will make use of all legal and constitutional provisions available to us. We will run a peaceful agitation until the proposed amendments are withdrawn.”
Calling the bill discriminatory and communally motivated, Ilyas further added, “Sadly, the points raised by opposition members were also not considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC).”
The opposition to the bill primarily stems from fears that it could undermine the autonomy of Waqf institutions, which manage properties meant for the welfare of the Muslim community.
AIMPLB leaders have voiced concerns that the bill could negatively impact the management of Waqf properties and limit their intended benefits.
Maulana Mohammed Fazlur Rahim Mujaddidi, General Secretary of AIMPLB, also criticized the bill, stating, “With the amendments approved by the JPC, the matter has become more complicated. JPC mahaz ek fareb hai aur ek dhokha hai (JPC is just a hoax and a fraud).”

Title: India, Australia mark three years of ECTA, pledge to strengthen economic partnership
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:56:14 +0000
Content: India and Australia have commemorated the third anniversary of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA), reaffirming their commitment to deepening economic ties and fostering mutual prosperity. Since the agreement’s implementation, bilateral trade between the two nations has reached USD 24 billion.
A statement from India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry highlighted the growing trade relations, noting a 14 percent increase in India’s exports to Australia in 2023-24 compared to the previous year. This momentum has continued in the current fiscal year, with exports rising by 4.4 percent between April 2024 and February 2025.
The ECTA has opened new avenues for trade and investment, benefiting key sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. Additionally, India’s imports of essential raw materials, including metalliferous ores, cotton, and wood products, have contributed to industrial growth, reinforcing the complementary nature of the partnership.
The Ministry also emphasized the emergence of new export categories, including Calcined Petroleum Coke, High-Capacity Diesel Generating Sets, and Air Liquefaction Machinery, which demonstrate expanding trade opportunities. Looking ahead, sectors such as electronics and engineering hold significant potential for further growth.
In a separate development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott during Abbott’s visit to India in March. Modi described Abbott as “a long-time friend of India” and shared a moment from his visit to Dilli Haat, where Abbott was seen enjoying millets.
Sharing a picture with Abbott on X, PM Modi said, “Delighted to meet my good friend and former Australian PM, Mr. Tony Abbott. He has always been a friend of India. We have all seen him enjoy millets during his current visit.”
Abbott, who served as Australia’s Prime Minister from 2013 to 2015 and was a member of the House of Representatives until 2019, has played a key role in strengthening India-Australia relations.

Title: UK travel ban on ‘violent’ Man City, Chelsea fans during Club World Cup
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 14:26:48 +0000
Content: Around 150 Manchester City and Chelsea fans who have a history of violent conduct will be banned from travelling during the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States this summer, Britain’s interior ministry said on Wednesday.
To help prevent soccer-related disorder at the tournament, fans of the clubs who are already subject to a football banning order for previous thuggish behaviour will be forced to surrender their passports to the police from June 9-July 13.
“Many Manchester City and Chelsea fans will want to travel to support their teams in this summer’s tournament and we want them all to do so safely and enjoyably,” Policing Minister Diana Johnson said in a statement.
“But for the tiny minority of troublemakers who use football as an excuse for criminality, we will be applying the same proven preventative measures that we have successfully done for other overseas tournaments.”
The fans in question will be contacted by the Football Banning Orders Authority, the statement said, adding that failure to comply with the rule could result in an unlimited fine or a possible six-month prison sentence.
There were 2,172 football banning orders in force in England and Wales, according to data from last year.

Title: Waqf Amendment Bill will not be implemented retrospectively, misconceptions being spread for vote bank politics: Amit Shah in Lok Sabha
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:53:54 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected opposition members’ criticism that the government wants to interfere in the religious conduct of Muslims through the Waqf Amendment Bill and said the provisions in the legislation aim at better management of Waqf properties.
“I stand in support of the Bill introduced by my ministerial colleague. I have been carefully listening to the discussion since 12 noon… I feel that there are several misconceptions among several Members, either genuinely or politically. Also, through this House, attempts are being made to spread those misconceptions across the country,” he said.
Shah emphasized that there is no provision in the bill for the appointment of non-Muslims in processes related to the religion.
“The Waqf Act and Board came into effect in 1995. All the arguments about the inclusion of non-Muslims are about interference in the Waqf. First of all, no non-Muslim will be part of the Waqf. Let this be clear… There is no such provision to include any non-Muslim among those who manage the religious institutions; we do not want to do this. This is a major misconception that this Act will interfere with the religious practices of Muslims or the property they have donated. This misconception is being spread to instill fear among minorities for their vote bank,” he said.
“Where will non-Muslim members be included? In the Council and Waqf Board. What would they do? They won’t run any religious activity. They would only look after the administration of property donated by someone under Waqf Law, ensuring it is being used as per the law and the donor’s intent,” he added.
The home minister clarified that a person can donate only property that belongs to them and cannot donate property belonging to the government or any other individual.
He said changes have been made only in provisions related to the Council and Board in the 1995 Act, which deal with administrative tasks.
Moving the bill for passage in the House, Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said that the bill will not be applicable retrospectively and that the Centre is not seeking more powers.
“Despite having the largest Waqf property in the world, why has it not been utilized for education, medical care, skill development, and income generation for underprivileged Muslims? Why has no progress been made in this regard so far?” Rijiju questioned.
Along with the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Rijiju also moved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, for consideration and passage in the Lok Sabha.
The bill was first presented in the Lok Sabha in August of last year and was examined by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, headed by BJP member Jagdambika Pal.
The bill seeks to amend the Act of 1995. It aims to improve the administration and management of Waqf properties in India by overcoming the shortcomings of the previous act, enhancing the efficiency of Waqf boards, improving the registration process, and increasing the role of technology in managing Waqf records.

Title: May god shower blessings upon India and its leadership: Myanmar locals hail Operation Brahma
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:30:25 +0000
Content: India’s Operation Brahma is in full swing, providing critical rescue and relief efforts in Myanmar following a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The local community has expressed deep gratitude for India’s swift aid and support during this crisis.
A Myanmar local, Hussain, spoke to ANI and expressed gratitude for India’s efforts in Myanmar. He said, “We felt great relief when you arrived. You (Indians) are very hardworking people. We are very happy and at peace. We have benefited greatly from the arrival of the NDRF. May God shower blessings upon India and its leadership.”  
NDRF crew member Kavita Singh told ANI, “There is little possibility of finding survivors as several days have passed, and the weather is extremely hot. So far, we have only retrieved dead bodies.”  
She emphasized the NDRF’s commitment, stating that despite infrastructural challenges and risks, the team remains dedicated to the operation. Singh also mentioned that the NDRF has received immense support from the locals. She shared an incident in which a family approached the NDRF team, expressing relief and gratitude for their rescue efforts. “We are very proud and thankful that you have come to help us,” the locals told them.  
Another NDRF crew member, Manju Bhati, stated that a team of 57 NDRF personnel had arrived in Myanmar. She explained that they had been assigned 13 locations to work in. “It is very difficult to retrieve the dead bodies. The intense heat makes survival nearly impossible. In such narrow streets, neither excavators nor cranes can operate… Everyone is in God’s hands now,” she said.  
In response to the earthquake, an NDRF team, along with essential relief supplies, has been deployed to support rescue operations. According to an NDRF statement on Tuesday, “An Urban Search & Rescue (USAR) team of 80 skilled rescuers from the 8th Battalion NDRF, Ghaziabad, along with four trained canines, was airlifted in two sorties by the Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130 Hercules aircraft.”  
The scale of devastation in Myanmar is enormous, and the swift actions taken by the Indian government are helping to alleviate the suffering of the affected population.  
India has delivered 625 metric tonnes (MT) of Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) material to Myanmar as part of Operation Brahma, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Tuesday.  
Operation Brahma was launched to provide essential support, including Search and Rescue (SAR), humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and medical assistance, following the earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28.  
As the First Responder in times of crisis in the region, Operation Brahma is a whole-of-government effort by India to address the widespread destruction in Myanmar.  
India has extended support on multiple fronts. According to the Indian Army, surgeons at the Indian medical facility in Myanmar have successfully performed two life-saving surgeries. On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Myo Moe Aung, who is overseeing relief operations in Mandalay Division, visited the hospital unexpectedly. He praised the efficiency of the medical setup and appreciated India’s extraordinary efforts in supporting Myanmar during this tragic crisis.  
Indian Naval ships INS Satpura and INS Savitri, from the Eastern Naval Command, sailed for Yangon on March 29, carrying 40 tonnes of HADR material, which was handed over to the Chief Minister of Yangon on Monday. INS Karmuk and LCU 52, from the Andaman and Nicobar Command, sailed for Yangon on March 30, carrying 30 tonnes of relief materials, including clothing, drinking water, food, medicines, and emergency supplies. These were handed over at Yangon Port on Tuesday, the MEA confirmed.  
The MEA further stated that India stands ready to deploy additional material assistance and resources based on the evolving ground-level needs.  
India’s ongoing efforts under Operation Brahma highlight its commitment to providing swift and substantial responses to natural disasters in its neighborhood.

Title: Pak troops cross LoC in J&K’s Poonch; effectively responded, says Indian Army
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:17:28 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Wednesday that the Pakistan Army intruded into Indian territory and violated the ceasefire by opening fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.
“The violation took place at 1:10 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Indian troops responded with controlled and calibrated retaliation,” the spokesperson said.
The defence spokesperson did not mention any casualties on the Pakistani side due to the Indian retaliation. However, official sources said five enemy soldiers were injured in the explosion and the subsequent exchange of fire between the two sides.
Lt. Colonel Suneel Bartwal, MoD spokesperson, said in a statement: “On April 1, 2025, a mine blast occurred in the Krishna Ghati sector due to a Pakistan Army intrusion across the LoC. This was followed by unprovoked firing and a ceasefire violation by the Pakistan Army. Our troops responded effectively in a controlled and calibrated manner. The situation is under control and is being closely monitored.”
“The Indian Army reiterates the importance of upholding the tenets of the Director Generals Military Operations (DGsMO) understanding of 2021 to maintain peace along the LoC,” he added.
Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on February 25, 2021, between the two sides, ceasefire violations have been rare, and local issues have usually been resolved through flag meetings at the brigade commander’s level.
The Indian Army and security forces have been maintaining heightened vigilance along the border and the LoC due to the presence of foreign mercenaries in the border districts of Poonch, Rajouri, and Kathua, as well as in some areas of the Jammu division hinterland.
Currently, an extended ‘seek and destroy’ operation has been underway since March 23, when five Pakistani terrorists were spotted in the Kathua district, 4 km inside the International Border.
So far, two of the five terrorists have been gunned down by security forces, while efforts are ongoing to trace and eliminate the remaining three.
Four local policemen were killed in the initial gunfight between the police and the hiding terrorists.

Title: Israel to seize parts of Gaza as military operation expands
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:12:35 +0000
Content: Israel announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza on Wednesday, saying large areas of the enclave would be seized and added to its security zones, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
In a statement, Defence Minister Israel Katz said evacuations would take place from areas where there was fighting, while urging Gazans to eliminate Hamas and return Israeli hostages as the only way to end the war.
He said the operation would clear out militants and infrastructure “and seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.
The Israeli military had already issued evacuation warnings to Gazans living around the southern city of Rafah and towards the city of Khan Younis, telling them to move to the Al-Mawasi area on the shore, previously designated a humanitarian zone.
The Palestinian civil defence agency said at least 12 bodies had been recovered by its teams in Khan Younis after a wave of airstrikes was reported overnight, and Palestinian radio reported that the area around Rafah was almost completely empty following the evacuation orders.
At the site of a strike in Khan Younis, Rida al-Jabbour held up a tiny shoe and pointed at a blood-spattered wall as she related how a neighbour had been killed along with her three-month-old baby, their bodies dismembered by the blast.
“From the moment the strike occurred we have not been able to sit or sleep or anything,” she said, describing how rescue workers were unable to separate the remains of those killed.
BUFFER ZONE
Katz’s statement did not make clear how much land Israel intended to seize or whether the move represented a permanent annexation of territory, which would add further pressure on a population in Gaza already living in one of the most crowded areas in the world.
According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometres or around 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave.
Seizing the buffer zone, which contains infrastructure including wells, sewage pumping stations, and wastewater treatment facilities as well as a significant part of Gaza’s agricultural land, would also increase pressure on the enclave’s ability to sustain itself.
At the same time, Israeli leaders have said they plan to facilitate voluntary departure of Palestinians from the enclave, after U.S. President Donald Trump called for it to be permanently evacuated and redeveloped as a coastal resort under U.S. control.
Katz’s remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated calls for Hamas to disarm and said the application of military pressure was the best way to get back the remaining 59 hostages.
Israeli leaders have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, the militant group which has controlled the enclave since 2007, and the expanded operation appeared at least partly aimed at increasing civilian pressure on its leaders.
“I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped,” Katz said in his statement. “This is the only way to end the war.”
WAR EXPANDS
Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza last month and sent ground troops back in, after two months of relative calm following the conclusion of a U.S.-backed truce to allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the strikes and Israel has also cut off aid to the enclave, saying much of it was taken by Hamas.
Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to get talks aimed at ending the war back on track have so far failed to make progress and the military’s return to Gaza has fuelled protests in Israel by families and supporters of some of the hostages.
On Wednesday, the Hostage Families’ Forum said it was “horrified” to wake up to news of the expanded operation.
As the operation in Gaza has escalated, Israel has also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, with a strike on a Hezbollah commander in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday that further strained fraying ceasefire agreements which largely halted fighting in January.
In addition, Israeli troops are still carrying out a major operation in the occupied West Bank.
Israel invaded Gaza following the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel by thousands of Hamas-led gunmen that killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and ravaged the Gaza Strip, forcing almost the entire population of 2.3 million from their homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in tents and improvised shelters.

Title: Hungary deploys military to contain foot-and-mouth outbreak
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:52:27 +0000
Content: Hungary has deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a northwestern area bordering Slovakia and Austria, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday.
Hungary reported its first case in more than 50 years of the disease, which often leads to trade restrictions, on a cattle farm early last month.
Since then, neighbouring Slovakia has detected outbreaks at five locations after reporting its first cases in March. It has also stepped up measures to contain the disease’s spread.
Hungarian Agriculture Minister Istvan Nagy said foot-and-mouth disease was found at two additional farms in Gyor-Moson-Sopron county by Wednesday morning, affecting 3,500 cattle in total.
“We are making every effort to prevent any additional outbreaks,” Nagy said in a Facebook video.
The defence ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions regarding the number of soldiers deployed to assist the containment effort.
Hungary’s cattle stock numbered 861,000 heads based on a livestock census in December, little changed from levels a year earlier. That constituted 1.2% of the European Union’s total cattle stocks, official statistics showed.
Data on the website of Hungary’s National Food Chain Safety Office showed foot-and-mouth disease affecting a total of four farms in Hungary, all of them located in the country’s northwest, while checks at more than 600 other farms returned negative results.
Nagy said Hungarian authorities have launched additional measures, including disinfection points at border crossings and highway exits in the northwest to prevent the disease from spreading beyond the affected county.
Foot-and-mouth disease poses no danger to humans but causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats.

Title: DoT cracks down on spam calls, disconnects 1.75 lakh landline numbers
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:30:24 +0000
Content: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has disconnected approximately 1.75 lakh Direct Inward Dialing (DID) and landline telephone numbers found to be engaged in unauthorized promotional and illegal activities.
Authorities have observed a surge in spam calls originating from telecom identifiers such as 0731, 079, and 080, often exploiting Primary Rate Interfaces (PRIs), Lease Lines, Internet Lease Lines, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and International Private Leased Circuits (IPLC). Citizens, under the Jan Bhagidari initiative, have been actively reporting incidents of Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), spam, and fraudulent calls via the Chakshu module of Sanchar Saathi.
The DoT analyzes this crowdsourced data and forwards identified cases to its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) field offices for further investigation. Upon confirmation of violations, telecom services linked to such activities are immediately suspended.
Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have been directed to enforce strict compliance with Unified License conditions to prevent the misuse of telecom resources, including PRIs, SIP trunks, Lease Lines, and IPLC connections. TSPs are required to conduct regular checks to ensure that these services are used for legitimate purposes only.
The DoT urges enterprises, bulk customers, and consumers to ensure their telecom services comply with regulations and are not misused for spam or unauthorized commercial communication. Violations could lead to strict penalties, including service disconnections.
Additionally, citizens are encouraged to continue reporting spam calls through the Chakshu module of Sanchar Saathi ([www.sancharsaathi.gov.in](http://www.sancharsaathi.gov.in)). This collaborative initiative aims to enhance telecom security and user protection.

Title: ICC announces match officials for Women’s ODI World Cup qualifiers in Pakistan
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:29:36 +0000
Content: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has named a panel of 10 umpires and three match referees to officiate the upcoming ICC Women’s ODI World Cup Qualifiers, set to take place from April 9 to 19 in Lahore, Pakistan.
Ali Naqvi, Shandre Fritz, and Trudy Anderson have been appointed as match referees, while the umpiring panel includes Faisal Khan Afridi, Saleema Imtiaz, Sarah Dambanevana, Masudur Rahman Mukul, Shatira Jakir Jesy, Donovan Koch, Babs Gcuma, Candace La Borde, Dedunu de Silva, and Shaun Haig.
Saleema Imtiaz, the mother of Pakistan women’s all-rounder Kainat Imtiaz, made history last year as the first Pakistani woman to join an ICC panel of umpires after her nomination to the ICC International Panel of Development Umpires. “This isn’t just a win for me, it’s a win for every aspiring female cricketer and umpire in Pakistan. I hope my success motivates countless women who dream of making their mark in the sport,” she said.
Sarah Dambanevana became the first female Zimbabwean umpire to officiate in a Cricket World Cup final during the ICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup 2023 and was also the first female umpire to stand in a Zimbabwean domestic men’s fixture.
Masudur Rahman Mukul has been a regular official at ICC events, including the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cups in 2020 and 2024. Meanwhile, Shatira Jakir Jesy, a former Bangladesh women’s international cricketer, is set to make her umpiring debut in the tournament.
Donovan Koch, encouraged by elite umpire Richard Kettleborough during his playing stint in England, has also been selected for the panel.
“This is an exciting opportunity for our appointed match officials as they oversee this crucial tournament—the final step for teams on their path to the World Cup. Our officials are experienced and well-prepared, and we look forward to their participation in this event,” said Sean Easey, ICC Senior Manager – Umpires and Referees, in a statement on Thursday.
The sixth edition of the Women’s ODI World Cup Qualifiers will feature four full-member teams—Bangladesh, Ireland, Pakistan, and the West Indies—competing alongside associate nations Scotland and Thailand in a 15-match tournament. The top two teams will secure a spot in the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place later this year in India.

Title: Political storm erupts in West Bengal over Supreme Court’s decision on WBSSC appointments
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:25:48 +0000
Content: A political controversy has erupted in West Bengal following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Calcutta High Court’s ruling that annulled over 25,000 appointments made by the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) in 2016. The decision, which affects secondary and higher secondary teachers as well as non-teaching staff in Group-C and Group-D categories, has sparked widespread debate and criticism from various political quarters.
On April 22, 2024, the Calcutta High Court’s division bench, led by Justice Debangsu Basak and Justice Shabbar Rashidi, had cancelled 25,753 appointments made by WBSSC. The ruling came after it was found that many of these appointments were tainted by corruption, with candidates allegedly securing jobs by paying money, making it impossible to distinguish between legitimate and ineligible applicants.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court, in a division bench led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, upheld the Calcutta High Court’s decision. This ruling has triggered a political uproar, with both the ruling and opposition parties in West Bengal reacting strongly to the judgment.
Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharya, a senior advocate in the Calcutta High Court and Rajya Sabha member from CPI(M), expressed regret that some “eligible” candidates would suffer due to the ruling. He stated that the scale of corruption in the recruitment process made it impossible to separate genuine candidates from ineligible ones. “The nature of institutional corruption in the entire selection process was so rampant that it became impossible to segregate the ‘genuine’ candidates from ‘ineligible’ candidates. The apex court repeatedly questioned WBSSC on whether such segregation was possible or not, but the commission was unable to come up with any definite answer,” Bhattacharya said.
The BJP’s state president, Dr. Sukanta Majumdar, who is also the Union Minister of State, accused the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government of shielding corrupt practices. “The genuine candidates will now have to suffer because of the sustained efforts of the Mamata Banerjee-led state government to protect ineligible candidates who secured jobs by paying money to TMC leaders,” Majumdar said. He called for the resignation of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, demanding she take full responsibility for what he described as a “huge corruption.”
Meanwhile, Biswajit Deb, a senior Trinamool Congress leader and the advocate general of Mizoram, suggested that the state government should file a review petition in the Supreme Court to address the impact on genuine candidates. “The basic principle of the legal system is that 1,000 culprits can escape, but not even one innocent should be punished. But following the verdict, now the genuine candidates will have to suffer. So I think that the state government should immediately file a review petition at the apex court,” Deb argued.
However, Bhattacharya opposed the idea of filing a review petition, citing the potential for further delays and the unnecessary expenditure of public funds. He pointed out that such a move would prolong the legal process and burden the state’s finances.
At the time of filing the report, there was no official reaction from CM Mamata Banerjee regarding the Supreme Court’s decision or the ongoing political fallout. The state government has yet to confirm whether it will pursue a review petition in the matter.

Title: Indian exporters to face fewer challenges as US tariffs take effect, say economists
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:22:26 +0000
Content: As U.S. President Donald Trump mandates a 26 percent tariff on Indian goods, economists and industry experts believe that Indian exporters will face relatively fewer challenges compared to other major emerging markets in Asia. Among these economies, India’s tariffs remain the lowest, barring the Philippines.
According to economic experts, India is expected to be less impacted by the tariffs due to its inward-focused economy, unlike export-driven nations such as China, Japan, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.
“This is expected to have a significant impact on U.S. inflation and global trade dynamics. Exporters from India are likely to face relatively less trouble, as among major emerging markets in Asia, tariffs on U.S. imports from India remain the lowest, barring the Philippines,” said Sonal Badhan, Economics Specialist at Bank of Baroda.
Reacting to the tariff announcements, industry body ASSOCHAM highlighted that the policy shift would trigger a major realignment in global trade and supply chains.
“Tariffs unveiled by President Trump last night will lead to a significant restructuring of global trade and manufacturing value chains. India has been placed somewhere in the middle, with tariffs set at 26 percent, in addition to a 10 percent baseline duty. The actual impact of these tariffs needs thorough assessment,” said ASSOCHAM President Sanjay Nayar.
Amid these changes, economists stress that India must strengthen domestic bank liquidity to support local businesses and consumers.
“Inward-focused economies like India should ensure strong bank liquidity so that financial institutions can lend freely to domestic retail borrowers and small business owners, helping sustain domestic consumption,” said Debopam Chaudhuri, Chief Economist at Piramal Group.
Kunal Chaudhary, Tax Partner at EY India, pointed out that the new tariffs create a dual-edged scenario for India’s manufacturing sector.
“On the one hand, India benefits from relatively lower tariffs compared to China, Thailand, and Vietnam, which could offer an arbitrage opportunity for Indian exports. However, on the other hand, Indian manufacturers might face intensified competition in other markets, as countries that traditionally focus on the U.S. market may now redirect exports to other nations to compensate for the losses,” said Chaudhary.
Under the new tariff policy, steel, aluminium, and auto-related goods from India will face a 25 percent tariff. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, and energy products will remain tariff-free. All other goods from India will be taxed at 26 percent.

Title: Liverpool restore 12-point lead as Jota seals win over Everton
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:00:27 +0000
Content: Liverpool continued their march towards the Premier League title with a 1-0 victory over Everton in a scrappy Merseyside derby as Diogo Jota slotted home the winner in the second half on Wednesday.
The champions elect, with 73 points after 30 games, restored their 12-point lead over second-placed Arsenal while Everton, whose nine-game league unbeaten ended, are 15th on 34 points.
Everton’s Beto had an early goal chalked off for offside and missed a sitter before Jota broke the deadlock in the 57th minute with his first goal in two-and-a-half months. Anfield erupted when Luis Diaz back-heeled the ball into Jota’s path and the Portuguese forward beat a tackle before firing into the net.
“Massive, of course,” Jota said summing up the win. “Not only because it is a derby, but because of the (first game since the) international break. It was important to start with three points and hopefully that gives us momentum for the rest of the season.”
Liverpool fans thought Everton should have been reduced to 10 men after 11 minutes following a fierce tackle by defender James Tarkowski on Alexis Mac Allister, but Everton’s captain was only shown a yellow card.
The teams had met in an explosive derby in February that ended 2-2, with Tarkowski equalising deep in stoppage time in a chaotic game that featured four red cards, including one to Liverpool manager Arne Slot.
While Liverpool are unbeaten in 26 league games, they went into last month’s international break on a negative note after being eliminated by Paris St Germain in the Champions League and losing to Newcastle United in the League Cup final.
Slot’s men looked sluggish and disjointed on Wednesday and Everton could have gone ahead when Beto raced away from defender Virgil van Dijk and beat goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher before hitting his shot against the post.
Kelleher started in goal for Liverpool, with regular starter Alisson recovering from a concussion suffered on international duty with Brazil.
The heated mood in Anfield was cranked-up another notch with the contentious early tackle. Tarkowski won the ball but his studs-up follow-through caught Mac Allister square in the calf. VAR confirmed the decision of a yellow card, which gave the centre back the joint most yellow cards without being sent off in Premier League history, with 63.
“I thought at the time that it was a brilliant tackle for a derby game,” Everton boss David Moyes said.
Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on the Sky Sports commentary that Tarkowski was very lucky to escape a red card for a tackle that was a “potential leg breaker”.
“We were playing against Everton, they make it very difficult for you,” Van Dijk said. The games we have played against each other over the years have always been tough.
“They have a certain way of playing and you have to be ready for it. The first half wasn’t our greatest but we kept a clean sheet and obviously, Jota made a fantastic goal. Three points and we move on.”
Moyes remained without a victory at Anfield in 22 games leading Manchester United, Sunderland, and West Ham United as well as his current team.
“Liverpool were the better team, there’s no doubt about that,” Moyes said.
“But I don’t like the goal, I think the goal was offside. I’m really surprised it wasn’t given. Or maybe I’m not surprised. I don’t think many managers come here and think that they get loads of decisions at Anfield generally.”

Title: Mansukh Mandaviya inaugurates Viksit Bharat youth parliament 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:47:55 +0000
Content: Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya inaugurated the National Round of the Viksit Bharat Youth Parliament Festival 2025 in New Delhi on Wednesday. The two-day event aims to empower young minds and foster leadership through parliamentary discussions.
The festival began with the District Youth Parliament, held from March 16 to 27, followed by the State Youth Parliament, which took place from March 23 to 31 across various state legislative assemblies.
A total of 105 finalists, who excelled at both the district and state levels, are now competing in the national round.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports, Raksha Khadse, was also present at the inauguration.
In his inaugural speech, Mandaviya highlighted the integration of the Youth Parliament with the vision of Viksit Bharat, emphasizing that over 75,000 young individuals submitted one-minute videos to be part of this initiative. After rigorous selection at the district and state levels, the finalists are now debating in the Parliament, where India’s leaders have shaped the nation’s course. He urged the youth to adopt a ‘Nation First’ mindset, emphasizing that democracy thrives on constructive discussions rather than arguments. He praised India’s democratic strength, stating that Parliament symbolizes unity in diversity and offers opportunities for all, where even individuals from humble backgrounds can rise to the highest offices.
The event featured two Question Hour sessions, where participants engaged in meaningful discussions. The first session debated One Nation, One Election (ONOE), covering governance, political stability, and legal challenges. The second session focused on youth empowerment, education, skill development, and sustainability under the vision of Viksit Bharat. Each session featured teams representing MPs and Ministers, with their debates judged by a panel of Members of Parliament and senior government officials.
Additionally, Sudhanshu Trivedi, MP, conducted a master class on oratory skills, providing valuable insights into effective public speaking, a crucial skill for leadership and parliamentary debates.
On the second day, participants will visit the new Parliament building to witness live proceedings and experience the legislative process firsthand. They will engage in a focused discussion on ONOE, examining implementation models and Centre-State implications. A deliberation session led by the Ministry of Law and Justice will introduce a motion for voting. The day will conclude with the National Youth Awards ceremony (2021-22 & 2022-23), recognizing exceptional contributions to youth leadership, followed by the Viksit Bharat Youth Parliament Awards 2025, celebrating the most impactful participants.

Title: PM Modi arrives in Bangkok to warm reception ahead of BIMSTEC summit
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:43:43 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Bangkok on Thursday to a vibrant and enthusiastic welcome from the Indian diaspora, who greeted him with chants of “Modi Modi” and “Vande Mataram.”
Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Suriya Jungrungreangkit, along with several senior officials, welcomed PM Modi at the airport. His arrival marks the beginning of his official visit to Thailand, where he is set to attend the 6th BIMSTEC Summit, scheduled for April 4.
During his visit, PM Modi will engage with regional leaders to discuss key areas of cooperation within the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). The summit will serve as a platform to strengthen collaboration among member countries, addressing issues such as regional development, connectivity, and economic progress.
The Prime Minister is also scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Thai leadership to further enhance the robust India-Thailand relationship, which is grounded in shared culture, history, and economic ties. Following his arrival, PM Modi is set to interact with the Indian diaspora in Thailand, emphasizing the deep cultural and economic connections between the two nations.
In his departure statement, PM Modi highlighted the growing importance of BIMSTEC as a forum for promoting regional development. “At the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, I am departing today for Thailand on an official visit and to attend the 6th BIMSTEC Summit,” PM Modi said. He further noted, “Over the past decade, BIMSTEC has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity, and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region.”
The Prime Minister also expressed his eagerness to engage with leaders of BIMSTEC countries, adding, “I look forward to meeting the leaders of the BIMSTEC countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interests of our people in mind.”
On his official engagements in Thailand, PM Modi emphasized the importance of strengthening India-Thailand ties, particularly in the context of their shared history and culture. “During my visit, I will have the opportunity to engage with Prime Minister Shinawatra and the Thai leadership, with a common desire to elevate our age-old historical ties, which are based on the strong foundations of shared culture, philosophy, and spiritual thought,” he said.
PM Modi’s visit to Thailand is part of a two-nation tour that will also take him to Sri Lanka from April 4-6. “From Thailand, I will pay a two-day visit to Sri Lanka from April 4-6. This follows the highly successful visit of President [Ranil] Wickremesinghe to India last December. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realize our shared objectives,” PM Modi added.
Expressing optimism about his visits, the Prime Minister said, “I am confident that these visits will build on the foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening our close relationships for the benefit of our people and the wider region.”
As India takes a leading role in BIMSTEC, its involvement in the summit is poised to reinforce its commitment to regional cooperation. BIMSTEC, a regional grouping of seven countries, includes five South Asian nations—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka—and two Southeast Asian countries, Myanmar and Thailand. The grouping serves as a bridge between South Asia and Southeast Asia, with India playing a central role in shaping its agenda and promoting collaboration across sectors.

Title: Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance welcomes exclusion from US tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:21:10 +0000
Content: The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) on Thursday welcomed the exclusion of pharmaceuticals from the new import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, emphasizing the growing bilateral trade ties between India and the United States.
Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the IPA, expressed appreciation for the decision and highlighted the vital role that India plays in global healthcare, particularly in supplying affordable medicines to the US market. In a statement, Jain stated, “India and the US share a strong and growing bilateral trade relationship, with a shared vision to double trade to USD 500 billion under the Mission 500 initiative. Pharmaceuticals remain a cornerstone of this partnership, as India plays a vital role in global and US healthcare by ensuring a steady supply of affordable medicines.”
Jain also underscored the significance of the tariff exemption, noting that it highlights the importance of cost-effective, life-saving generic medicines in public health, economic stability, and national security. He reaffirmed the Indian pharmaceutical industry’s commitment to bolstering supply chain resilience and ensuring continued access to affordable medicines, which aligns with the shared priorities of both nations.
Trump’s tariff announcement, made during a speech at the Make America Wealthy Again Event on Wednesday, included new import tariffs on countries across the globe, with India facing a 26% tariff. During his address, Trump referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “great friend” but criticized India’s tariff policies, saying, “India charges the US 52 percent, and we charge them almost nothing.” He further elaborated on the discrepancy in tariff rates, adding, “The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 percent tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much higher prices like 60 percent, India charges 70 percent, Vietnam charges 75 percent and others are even higher than that.”
Trump also mentioned that a 25% tariff would be imposed on all foreign-made automobiles. The US President’s remarks come as part of a broader effort to address what he views as unfair trade practices, particularly in key sectors such as agriculture, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals.
Earlier reports indicated that any potential trade agreement between India and the US might focus on these sectors, given their political and economic sensitivity for India, especially due to high tariff rates.
In addition to India’s 26% tariff, the import tariffs imposed by Trump on other major trading partners include China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, Vietnam at 46%, Taiwan at 32%, Japan at 24%, the United Kingdom at 10%, Bangladesh at 37%, Pakistan at 29%, Sri Lanka at 44%, and Israel at 17%.

Title: CAQM invokes stage I of GRAP in Delhi-NCR as air quality declines
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:01:18 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage I of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR with immediate effect after the region’s Air Quality Index (AQI) slipped into the ‘poor’ category on Wednesday.
The decision was based on the daily average AQI provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the CAQM stated. Under Stage I of GRAP, which is activated when AQI ranges between 201-300, 27 preventive actions are to be strictly implemented by all relevant agencies across NCR.
Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) of NCR states and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have been directed to ensure strict enforcement of Stage I measures. Meanwhile, the Sub-Committee on GRAP has urged citizens to cooperate and follow the Citizen Charter guidelines for improving air quality.
Earlier, on March 29, CAQM had revoked Stage I of GRAP after Delhi’s AQI improved to 153 (moderate category). However, the recent deterioration has prompted its reimplementation.
Authorities will continue to monitor air quality levels and take further action as needed to mitigate pollution in the region.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower as Trump tariffs trigger global sell-off
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 05:44:56 +0000
Content: Indian equity indices opened lower on Thursday following a sharp sell-off in global markets after U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs.
At around 9:20 AM, the Sensex was down 470 points or 0.61 percent at 76,197, while the Nifty was down 105 points or 0.45 percent, at 23,227.
In the early trading hours, midcaps and smallcaps were trading with minor gains compared to largecaps. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 125 points or 0.24 percent at 52,183, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was up 121 points or 0.75 percent at 16,283.
On the sectoral front, auto, IT, PSU banks, FMCG, metals, and media were among the top laggards, while pharma, realty, and energy were the major gainers.
In the Sensex pack, Infosys, HCL Tech, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Tata Motors, M&M, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki, and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the major losers. On the other hand, Sun Pharma, Power Grid, NTPC, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, and UltraTech Cement were the top gainers.
Vikram Kasat, Head of Advisory at PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, stated, “Large tariff shocks threaten the U.S. and global economy. If these policies are sustained, they could likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.”
“In general terms, Canada and Mexico have been impacted less severely, while Asian countries, particularly China and Vietnam, have been hit the hardest. The European Union and Japan fall somewhere in between. The hope is that no one retaliates, because if retaliation occurs, there will be an escalation. If no retaliation happens, this might be the high-water mark,” he added.
Most Asian markets witnessed heavy selling due to U.S. tariffs, with Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Seoul trading in the red. However, U.S. markets closed in the green during Wednesday’s trading session.
On the institutional front, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling streak for the third consecutive session on April 2, offloading equities worth Rs 1,538 crore. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers for the fourth consecutive day, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,800 crore.

Title: Southeast Asian nations, among hardest-hit by Trump tariffs, seek talks
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 13:24:00 +0000
Content: Southeast Asian nations reeled on Thursday as they were hit with some of President Donald Trump’s heftiest tariffs, which now threaten the economies that have benefited from investment since he imposed levies on China during his first term.
Vietnam, slapped with 46% tariffs, said it would set up a task force and Thailand’s prime minister said she would pursue negotiations to try to reduce the 37% rate her country faces – far greater than the 11% it had expected.
Both countries are heavy exporters to the U.S., having gained from the so-called China+1 strategy, whereby manufacturers, seeking to escape tariffs on China, shifted some of their Chinese production to nearby countries in the region.
“We have to negotiate and get into details,” Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said. “We can’t let it get to where we miss our GDP target.”
Six of the nine Southeast Asian countries listed by Trump were slapped with much bigger-than-expected tariffs of between 32% and 49%. By comparison, the level for the European Union was 20%, Japan’s was 24% and India’s 27%.
So far, none of the Southeast Asian nations have spoken of retaliatory tariffs.
Vietnam, where companies like Apple, Nike and Samsung Electronics have large manufacturing operations, appears particularly exposed. Its exports to the United States were worth $142 billion last year, nearly 30% of its gross domestic product.
Vietnam’s benchmark stock index slid 6.7%, on course for its biggest one-day drop since January 2021 while its currency, the dong, lost 0.7% to hit an all-time low.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered up a task force to address the situation after an urgent cabinet meeting early on Thursday, state media said. He noted the country’s 8% growth target for this year remained unchanged.
“Vietnam’s export-driven growth model has been highly successful, attracting multinational companies … However, a 46% U.S. tariff would directly challenge this model,” said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam.
ING estimates that the tariffs put 5.5% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product at risk.
Vietnam made a number of recent concessions to Washington to avoid tariffs, including cutting duties and a pledge to import more U.S. goods, and is likely to offer more in the coming days.
“I expect negotiations to continue on ways to reduce or mitigate the impact of any new tariffs,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.
HOPING FOR TALKS
Thai Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan said his government was prepared for negotiations and had high hopes they would go well, citing Thailand’s good relations with the U.S.
Thailand is hoping for 3% growth this year. It has lagged regional peers, growing 2.5% last year, held back by soaring household debt.
The country’s stock index, already having taken a battering this year due to its weak economy and last week’s earthquake, slipped 1.1% while the baht fell to a one-month low. ING estimates the tariffs put 3% of the country’s GDP at risk.
Malaysia, which was dealt a rate of 24%, announced it would not seek retaliatory tariffs and it said the trade ministry would be actively engaging with U.S. authorities “to seek solutions that will uphold the spirit of free and fair trade.”
Cambodia is facing tariffs of 49% that will hurt its garment and footwear industries and promise to crush hopes that it could attract investment relocating from other countries in the region.
It is a “very, very serious situation for the economy,” said a Cambodia-based investment consultant who declined to be identified.
There is “nothing that Cambodia can offer as a negotiating tool, and will be at the back of a very long queue,” he added.

Title: Stock market ends lower as investors take cautious approach on US tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:25:25 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Thursday as investors remained cautious following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs.  
The new tariff structure includes a 10 per cent tax on all US imports, with higher tariffs on countries with a trade surplus. India will now face a 26 per cent tariff.  
The Sensex fell 322.08 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at 76,295.36. During the day, the index fluctuated between an intraday high of 76,493.74 and a low of 75,807.55.  
The Nifty also ended lower, down 82.25 points, or 0.35 per cent, at 23,250.10.  
Tech stocks led the losses, with TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, and Tata Motors declining by up to 4.02 per cent.  
On the other hand, Power Grid Corporation, Sun Pharma, Ultratech Cement, NTPC, and Asian Paints were among the top gainers, rising as much as 4.57 per cent.  
The IT sector was the worst performer, with the Nifty IT index dropping 4.21 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems, Coforge, TCS, and Mphasis. Auto, oil & gas, and realty stocks also struggled.  
However, pharma stocks performed well, with the Nifty Pharma index climbing 2.25 per cent. Banking, healthcare, FMCG, and consumer durables stocks also saw gains, rising up to 1.94 per cent.  
Despite the broader market decline, small-cap stocks outperformed, with the Nifty Smallcap100 index rising 0.58 per cent.  
Market analysts said that investors are expected to remain watchful of global developments and their impact on market trends.  
The rupee ended flat but traded in a volatile range between 85.75 and 85.35, as markets reacted to Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy.

Title: Hundreds of thousands flee as Israel seizes Rafah in new Gaza ‘security zone’
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:58:05 +0000
Content: Hundreds of thousands of fleeing Gazans sought shelter on Thursday in one of the biggest mass displacements of the war, as Israeli forces advanced into the ruins of the city of Rafah, part of a newly announced “security zone” they intend to seize.
A day after declaring their intention to capture large swathes of the crowded enclave, Israeli force pushed into the city on Gaza’s southern edge which had served as a last refuge for people fleeing other areas for much of the war.
Gaza’s health ministry reported at least 97 people killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, including at least 20 killed in an airstrike around dawn in Shejaia suburb of Gaza City.
Rafah “is gone, it is being wiped out,” a father of seven among the hundreds of thousands who had fled from Rafah to neighbouring Khan Younis, told Reuters via a chat app.
“They are knocking down what is left standing of houses and property,” said the man who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.
After a strike killed several people in Khan Younis, Adel Abu Fakher was checking the damage to his tent.
“Is anything left for us? There’s nothing left for us. We’re being killed while asleep,” he said.
The assault to capture Rafah is a major escalation in the war, which Israel restarted last month after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January.
GAZANS FEAR PERMANENT DEPOPULATION
Israel has not spelled out its longterm aims for the security zone its troops are now seizing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu said troops were taking an area he called the “Morag Axis”, a reference to an abandoned former Israeli settlement once located between Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the adjacent main southern city Khan Younis.
Gazans who had returned to homes in the ruins during the ceasefire have now been ordered to flee communities on the northern and southern edges of the strip.
They fear that Israel’s intention is to depopulate those areas indefinitely, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people permanently homeless in one of the poorest and most crowded territories on earth. The security zone includes some of Gaza’s last agricultural land and critical water infrastructure.
Since the first phase of the ceasefire expired at the start of March with no agreement to prolong it, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods reaching Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, recreating what international organisations describe as a humanitarian catastrophe after weeks of relative calm.
Israel’s stated goal since the start of the war has been the destruction of the Hamas militant group which ran Gaza for nearly two decades and led the attack on Israeli communities in October 2023 that precipitated the war.
But with no effort made to establish an alternative administration, Hamas-led police returned to the streets during the ceasefire. Fighters still hold 59 dead and living hostages which Israel says must be handed over to extend the truce; Hamas says it will free them only under a deal that ends the war.
Israeli leaders say they have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, with hundreds of people demonstrating in north Gaza’s Beit Lahiya on Wednesday opposing the war and demanding Hamas quit power. Hamas calls the protesters collaborators and says Israel is behind them.
The war began with a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023 with gunmen killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s campaign has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say.
Rafah residents said most of the local population had followed Israel’s order to leave, as Israeli strikes toppled buildings there. But a strike on the main road between Khan Younis and Rafah stopped most movement between the two cities.
Movement of people and traffic along the western coastal road near Morag was also limited by bombardment, said residents.
“Others stayed because they don’t know where to go, or got fed up of being displaced several times. We are afraid they might be killed or at best detained,” said Basem, a resident of Rafah who declined to give a second name.
Markets have emptied and prices for basic necessities have soared under Israel’s total blockade of food, medicine, and fuel.
The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but has nominal authority over hospitals in Gaza, said Gaza’s entire healthcare system was at risk of collapse.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was warmly welcomed in Thailand on Thursday, receiving a ceremonial Guard of Honour upon his arrival in Bangkok for the 6th BIMSTEC Summit.
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra greeted PM Modi at the Government House, where the two leaders were scheduled to engage in wide-ranging discussions aimed at strengthening India-Thailand relations. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, shared details of the reception, noting that PM Modi’s arrival was marked by a special ceremonial welcome.
“A special ceremonial welcome with Guard of Honour. PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand warmly received PM Narendra Modi at the Government House in Bangkok today. The two leaders will have wide-ranging discussions for charting the way for future India-Thailand partnership,” Jaiswal posted on X.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi also had a delegation-level talk with Thai PM Shinawatra, furthering bilateral discussions on cooperation in various sectors.
PM Modi also witnessed a culturally significant moment when he witnessed a captivating performance of the Ramakien, the Thai adaptation of the Ramayana. The performance highlighted the deep civilisational ties between India and Thailand, with the Ramayana remaining a shared cultural and spiritual heritage across the two nations. The Thai version of the epic features Lord Rama as Phra Ram, embodying the same virtues of sacrifice, devotion, and triumph over evil as seen in the Indian version.
Taking to X, PM Modi expressed his admiration for the performance: “A cultural connect like no other! Witnessed a captivating performance of the Thai Ramayana, Ramakien. It was a truly enriching experience that beautifully showcased the shared cultural and civilisational ties between India and Thailand. The Ramayana truly continues to connect hearts and traditions across so many parts of Asia.”
PM Modi was also greeted by the Indian community in Bangkok, who welcomed him with chants and prayers, symbolizing the enduring cultural bond between the two nations. “Grateful for the warm welcome by the Indian community in Bangkok. India and Thailand share a deep-rooted cultural bond that continues to flourish through our people. Heartening to see this connection reflected so strongly here,” PM Modi tweeted.

Title: World Boxing Cup: Manish, Hitesh and Abhinash sail into semifinals with dominant wins
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:03:11 +0000
Content: Indian boxers Manish Rathore, Hitesh, and Abhinash Jamwal lit up the ring at the World Boxing Cup Brazil 2025 on Wednesday, each securing dominant wins in their respective quarterfinals.
Jamwal tamed Germany’s Denis Bril with a unanimous decision in the 65kg category, while Hitesh defeated Italy’s Gabriele Guidi Rontani by the same scoreline in the 70kg category.
In the 55kg category, Manish Rathore faced Australia’s Paris Olympian Yusuf Chothia. The Indian national champion proved that he was well-prepared for whatever his opponent threw at him. Both boxers kept things tight in all three rounds, with Rathore emerging victorious as three judges ruled in his favour, while two gave equal points to both.
In the semifinals, Rathore will face Nursultan Altynbek of Kazakhstan, Hitesh will take on Makan Traore, and Jamwal will play Gianluigi Malanga of Italy.
Earlier, national champion Jadumani Singh Mandengbam overcame Ellis Trowbridge of Great Britain to reach the semifinals in the 50kg category on Wednesday.
Trowbridge, the 2024 World Boxing Cup Finals silver medallist, began the bout in his usual aggressive style, but the Indian was prepared to absorb the pressure and find ways to land his punches, earning a 3:2 split decision in his favour.
Jadumani will now face former Asian U-22 champion Asilbek Jalilov for a place in the final. However, India’s challenge in the 75kg, 85kg, and 90+kg categories came to an end after all three boxers fought valiantly in their respective bouts.
Nikhil Dubey lost the 75kg bout 0:5 against local favourite Kaue Belini, while Jugnoo was on the wrong end of a 1:4 split decision against France’s Abdoulaye Traore in the 85kg category.
Narender came close to beating Kazakhstan’s Daniyal Saparbay, even earning a 30-27 verdict from one judge, but lost the 90+kg bout on a 3:2 split decision.

Title: India accelerates 6G development with testbeds, 100 new 5G labs, and global research collaborations
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:46:17 +0000
Content: The central government unveiled the Bharat 6G Vision Document in March 2023, outlining the nation’s ambitious plan to design, develop, and deploy 6G network technologies by 2030. The primary goal is to establish India as a global leader in 6G technology, delivering ubiquitous, intelligent, and secure connectivity that will enhance the quality of life for its citizens and the world at large.
To achieve this, the government has launched several initiatives aimed at accelerating the development of 6G technology within the country. One of the key measures is the funding of two crucial testbeds—the 6G THz Testbed and the Advanced Optical Communication Testbed. These initiatives are intended to promote research and development (R&D) and foster innovation in the 6G domain, laying a strong foundation for next-generation communication technologies.
Additionally, the government has sanctioned the establishment of 100 5G labs at academic institutions across India in the financial year 2023-24. These labs will play an essential role in building a 6G-ready ecosystem, enabling academic institutions and start-ups to thrive while preparing the next generation of technologists with the necessary tools and expertise.
In an effort to accelerate research on 6G networks, 111 research proposals have been approved to explore and develop 6G ecosystems. These research initiatives are designed to align India’s efforts with the global roadmap for 6G technology, ensuring that the country remains at the forefront of innovation.
The government has also facilitated the formation of the Bharat 6G Alliance, a collaboration between domestic industries, academic institutions, national research bodies, and standards organizations. This alliance will develop a comprehensive action plan for 6G technology. To further boost international collaboration, the central government has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with leading global 6G alliances.
As part of its global outreach, India hosted the inaugural International 6G Symposium, coinciding with the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA) 2024 and the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2024. The symposium brought together industry leaders, academics, and government officials to explore advancements in 6G technology on both local and global levels.
India has also made significant contributions to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s International Mobile Technology (IMT) 2030 framework, often referred to as the foundation for 6G. India advocated for the inclusion of “Ubiquitous Connectivity” as one of the six key usage scenarios for 6G and highlighted coverage, interoperability, and sustainability as essential capabilities for future wireless networks.
Through these initiatives, the Indian government is laying the groundwork for a future where 6G technology will not only revolutionize communications but also enable transformative advancements across various sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and beyond.

Title: EPFO simplifies claim settlement process with two key reforms
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:44:56 +0000
Content: In a significant move to enhance the Ease of Living for Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) members and improve the Ease of Doing Business for employers, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has introduced two major reforms in its claim settlement process. These changes aim to streamline operations and reduce claim rejections, the Ministry of Labour & Employment announced on Thursday.
No More Requirement to Upload Cheque Leaf or Attested Bank Passbook
EPFO has eliminated the need for members to upload an image of a cheque leaf or an attested bank passbook when filing online claims. Initially implemented as a pilot project for KYC-updated members, this reform has benefited 1.7 crore EPF members since its launch on May 28, 2024.
Following the success of the pilot, EPFO has now extended this relaxation to all members. Since the bank account holder’s name is already verified at the time of seeding with the Universal Account Number (UAN), this additional documentation is no longer required.
With this change, around 6 crore EPF members will immediately benefit, as it will eliminate claim rejections caused by poor-quality or unreadable uploads, reducing grievances and delays in claim processing.
Employer Approval No Longer Needed for Bank Account Seeding with UAN
To further simplify the process, EPFO has removed the requirement for employer approval when seeding bank accounts with UAN after bank verification.
Until now, EPF members had to link their bank accounts with UAN to receive seamless PF withdrawals. In FY 2024-25, 1.3 crore members submitted bank account seeding requests, which, after bank verification, required employer approval via Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) or E-Sign.
According to the Ministry of Labour & Employment, around 36,000 such requests are raised daily. While banks take an average of 3 days to complete verification, employers take around 13 days, leading to delays and a growing backlog. Currently, 14.95 lakh approvals are pending with employers, impacting millions of EPF members.
Out of 7.74 crore contributing members, 4.83 crore have already seeded their bank accounts with UAN. With this reform, EPFO has eliminated employer approval from the process, immediately benefiting 14.95 lakh pending cases.
Additionally, the change will simplify bank account updates, allowing members to enter a new account number and IFSC code, which will be verified through Aadhaar OTP authentication.

Title: India exploring opportunities amid US reciprocal tariffs on India: Centre
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:32:40 +0000
Content: In response to US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order imposing reciprocal tariffs, The Indian government on Thursday said that it is assessing the implications of the new trade policy and exploring opportunities that may arise from it.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry issued a statement detailing the US administration’s new tariff regime, which includes additional ad-valorem duties ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from all trading partners. Under this executive order, the baseline 10% duty will be effective from April 5, 2025, with country-specific additional duties coming into force on April 9, 2025. For India, the additional tariff as per the executive order stands at 27%.
“The Department of Commerce is carefully examining the implications of the various measures and announcements made by the US administration. In line with the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat,’ the department is engaging with stakeholders, including Indian industry and exporters, to gather their assessments of the new tariffs and to evaluate the overall situation,” the ministry said in its statement.
The Ministry of Commerce said that it is actively studying potential opportunities arising from the new US trade policy, noting that the situation is being assessed with a long-term view of the country’s strategic interests.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Trump had launched ‘Mission 500’ on February 13, 2025, with the ambitious goal of more than doubling bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. To this end, ongoing discussions between Indian and US trade teams are focused on the swift conclusion of a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement. This agreement would cover a wide range of issues, including deepening supply chain integration and enhancing trade, investment, and technology transfers between the two nations.
“The ongoing discussions aim to facilitate the growth of trade, investments, and technology transfers between both nations,” the statement said. “We remain in close contact with the Trump Administration and expect to make progress in the coming days.”
India also reaffirmed the importance of its Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with the United States, committing to continued cooperation on the ‘Catalysing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology’ (COMPACT) initiative. The goal of this partnership is to ensure that trade ties between the two countries remain a pillar of mutual prosperity, driving transformative changes for the benefit of the people of both nations.
Since President Trump began his second term, he has consistently emphasized the principle of tariff reciprocity, asserting that the United States will mirror tariffs imposed by other countries, including India, to ensure fair trade practices.

Title: PM Modi witnesses Thai adaptation of Ramayana, calls it a “beautiful confluence of cultures”
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:27:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attended a performance of Ramakien, the Thai adaptation of the Indian epic Ramayana, during his visit to Thailand.
The performance was led by Ekkalak Nu-ngoen and a group of students from the Faculty of Music and Drama at the Bunditpatanasilpa Institute in Thailand. The retelling of the epic was presented through a unique fusion of two classical dance forms—India’s Bharatanatyam and Thailand’s Khon, showcasing the deep cultural ties between the two nations.
The Ramayana holds a special place in both Indian and Thai traditions. While in India, Lord Rama is revered as the Prince of Ayodhya, in the Thai adaptation, he is known as Phra Ram. Despite the differences in names and presentation, both versions uphold the same values of sacrifice, duty, devotion, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil, reflecting the shared cultural heritage of the two countries.
During PM Modi’s visit, Thailand’s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lalivan Karnchanachari, expressed enthusiasm about his presence. “We welcome PM Modi to our beautiful country as he is here to attend the BIMSTEC meeting. The performance was a perfect blend of Indian and Thai cultures, and we hope the Prime Minister enjoys his time here,” she said.
One of the performers also shared their excitement about presenting Ramakien before the Indian leader. “We are very happy to perform Ramayana and Ramakien, combining Thai classical dance with Bharatanatyam, in front of the Prime Minister and other distinguished guests,” the artist said.
Earlier in the day, as he arrived at his hotel in Bangkok, PM Modi witnessed a Garba performance and received a warm welcome from the Indian diaspora and local Indian community members.
Looking ahead, PM Modi expressed enthusiasm for participating in official engagements at the BIMSTEC Leaders’ Summit in Bangkok. Upon his arrival at the airport, he was received by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport, Suriya Jungrungreangkit. He later shared pictures from the airport, where he was seen interacting with members of the Indian community, who greeted him with excitement and warmth.

Title: No non-Muslim can interfere in Waqf Board: Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:26:04 +0000
Content: Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday defended the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, against allegations that it would undermine Muslim interests. Rijiju clarified that the bill does not allow non-Muslims to interfere in the management of the Waqf Board, emphasizing that the management, creation, and beneficiaries of Waqf properties would remain exclusively within the Muslim community.
Rijiju introduced the bill in the Rajya Sabha amidst widespread concerns and criticism, asserting that the new legislation would strengthen the governance of Waqf properties and enhance transparency. He categorically rejected claims that the bill would be unconstitutional or infringe on the rights of Muslims. “Any Muslim who wishes to manage their property through a trust can do so without restrictions,” he stated.
The minister explained that the Waqf Board functions much like a Charity Commissioner. He added that the bill would require proof of ownership before a property could be declared Waqf, removing the previous provision where any claim by the Waqf Board would automatically result in the property being designated as Waqf.
Rijiju also said that the bill had undergone extensive consultation before being introduced. Over one crore memoranda and suggestions were received from the public, and a Parliamentary Committee conducted consultations in ten cities, including Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Patna, Chennai, Bengaluru, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, and Lucknow.
The minister traced the government’s reform efforts back to the 1976 Congress-led government’s inquiry commission and the 2006 Sachar Committee Report, which recommended strengthening and digitizing the Waqf Board. At the time, Waqf properties totaled 4.9 lakh, generating an annual income of Rs 163 crore. The Sachar Committee had estimated that, with proper management, these properties could generate Rs 12,000 crore annually. Today, the number of Waqf properties has grown to 8.72 lakh, with the potential for much higher revenue.
Rijiju also referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report led by K. Rehman Khan, a former Minority Affairs Minister, which had pointed out the Waqf Board’s inadequate infrastructure, manpower, and funding. The JPC recommended establishing a centralized data bank and structured leasing policies for Waqf properties. Rijiju asserted that the current government was implementing these long-overdue reforms, which previous Congress and UPA governments had failed to act upon.
In his address, Rijiju highlighted the differences in the approach of the Modi government compared to the Congress-led UPA. The 2013 UPA government had set up a JPC to reform the Waqf Board ahead of elections, but the current JPC, formed under the BJP government, had engaged more comprehensively, with 31 members, 36 meetings, consultations with 284 delegations and organizations, and inputs from 25 states, five minority commissions, and multiple lawmakers.
Rijiju also pointed out that the number of memoranda submitted had significantly increased from just 32 in 2013 to over one crore now, reflecting the widespread public participation in the reform process.
Rijiju emphasized that the BJP government is committed to implementing these long-pending reforms. “These committees were set up during Congress and UPA rule, yet they failed to act. The Narendra Modi government is fulfilling the recommendations that the Congress did not dare to implement,” Rijiju stated.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, according to Rijiju, will ensure greater accountability and efficiency in the management of Waqf properties, address long-standing concerns, and safeguard the rights and autonomy of the Muslim community.

Title: Lok Sabha passes Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024 to boost maritime trade and regional development
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:37:02 +0000
Content: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024, marking a significant step toward revolutionizing India’s maritime sector. The bill aims to provide a dedicated legal framework for coastal trade, promoting a more economical, reliable, and sustainable mode of transportation. By facilitating coastal shipping, the legislation seeks to ease the congestion on India’s overloaded road and rail networks.
Union Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, emphasized the bill’s strategic importance, stating, “The Bill seeks to unlock the full potential of India’s vast and strategic coastline, providing a dedicated legal framework for coastal trade.”
The Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024 seeks to streamline and modernize India’s coastal trade while aligning with the National Logistics Policy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision. The bill introduces future-ready provisions, aiming to integrate coastal trade into the broader logistics framework and enhance the competitiveness of India’s maritime sector.
The proposed legislation addresses gaps in earlier laws such as the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. It includes key provisions for licensing and regulating foreign vessels in Indian coastal trade, ensuring compliance with updated and modernized regulations. A National Coastal and Inland Shipping Strategic Plan will be formulated, alongside the creation of a National Database for Coastal Shipping.
Sarbananda Sonowal, explaining the bill’s broader implications, remarked, “The overarching goal of the Bill is to develop a coastal fleet owned and operated by Indian entities. This will reduce our dependence on foreign vessels and significantly lower logistics costs, promote green transport, and create thousands of jobs in shipbuilding, port services, and vessel manning.”
Coastal shipping is expected to be a key player in reducing logistics costs and promoting sustainable transportation. The bill introduces provisions that will ease the process for Indian ships to engage in coastal trade. Among the provisions is the removal of the general trading license requirement for Indian ships, which will reduce compliance burdens and improve the ease of doing business.
Foreign vessels will now be able to engage in coastal trade only under specific licenses issued by the Director General of Shipping. This regulation supports Indian shipbuilding and employment for seafarers, aligning with the government’s “Make in India” initiative. Furthermore, the bill mandates the formulation of a National Coastal and Inland Shipping Strategic Plan, ensuring that the sector remains competitive and aligned with India’s long-term growth objectives.
The Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024 modernizes and streamlines coastal trade regulations. As Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal highlighted, “The new Coastal Shipping Bill modernizes and streamlines coastal trade regulations, addressing gaps in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. Unlike its predecessor, which focused solely on vessel licensing, this Bill provides a holistic framework aligned with global cabotage practices.”
Additionally, the bill introduces several strategic measures, including prioritized berthing, green clearance channels, and the reduction of GST on bunker fuel. Coastal cargo traffic has surged 119% in the past decade, from 74 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 162 million tonnes in 2023-24. The bill sets a target of 230 million tonnes by 2030, further underlining the need for reforms in India’s maritime sector.
A key provision of the Coastal Shipping Bill is its emphasis on integrating coastal shipping with inland waterways. Sonowal stated, “The integration of coastal and inland waterways will promote regional development of riverine and coastal areas alike. This Bill will also provide long-term growth for coastal and inland waterways transport in states such as Odisha, Karnataka, and Goa.”
By promoting collaborative planning, the bill ensures that coastal shipping growth is inclusive and participative. The involvement of States and Union Territories is guaranteed in the development of strategies and routes, fostering cooperative federalism and collective planning.
The introduction of a National Database for Coastal Shipping aims to enhance transparency, coordination, and data-driven decision-making. Additionally, the bill expands the category of entities allowed to charter foreign vessels, including Indian citizens, NRIs, OCIs, and LLPs. This ensures that a wider range of stakeholders can participate in India’s growing coastal shipping sector.
Addressing concerns from opposition parties, Sarbananda Sonowal asserted that the bill is grounded in cooperative federalism. “The Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024 upholds cooperative federalism by ensuring the active participation of States and Union Territories,” he stated. Under Clause 8(3), a committee comprising representatives from major ports, State Maritime Boards, and experts will draft the National Coastal and Inland Shipping Strategic Plan. This provision guarantees States a direct role in shaping the country’s coastal shipping strategy.
The integration of coastal shipping with inland waterways offers new possibilities for regional development and economic growth, particularly in riverine and coastal states. By recognizing the role of States in this process, the bill ensures that the maritime sector grows in a collaborative and inclusive manner, in line with India’s broader development goals.

Title: No violence in Manipur in the last four months: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:21:32 +0000
Content: The Lok Sabha passed the statutory resolution moved by Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the approval of the imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur on Thursday. The House also expressed its respect, sympathy, and deep sorrow for those who lost their lives in the violence in Manipur.
Shah further said that there has been no violence in Manipur for nearly four months, from December to March, and provisions for food, medicines, and medical facilities have been ensured in the camps.
Introducing the resolution, Union Home Minister Shah said that ethnic violence between two communities in Manipur had started due to a decision by the Manipur High Court regarding a reservation-related dispute. He clarified that these are neither riots nor terrorism, but ethnic clashes between two communities stemming from the interpretation of the High Court’s decision, according to a statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
He mentioned that online arrangements for technical and medical education had been made, and for primary education, classes had been set up inside the camps with provisions for their studies.
Shah emphasized that there should be no violence and that ethnic violence should not be linked to any political party. He noted that the opposition tried to portray the violence as something that occurred during the current government’s tenure. He informed the House that between 1993 and 1998, there was a Naga-Kuki conflict in Manipur that lasted for five years, resulting in 750 deaths, and sporadic incidents continued for a decade.
He highlighted that while the government believes such incidents should never happen under its rule, an unfortunate decision led to the violence, which was promptly brought under control. Shah revealed that of the 260 deaths in the violence, 80 percent occurred in the first month, while the remaining deaths occurred in the following months.
The home minister also pointed out that in the 1997-98 Kuki-Paite conflict, more than 50 villages were destroyed, 40,000 people were displaced, 352 people were killed, hundreds were injured, and 5,000 homes were burned. Additionally, during the six-month-long Meitei-Pangal conflict in 1993, over 100 people were killed.
Shah said that the opposition is trying to present this as the first instance of violence in Manipur and implying that the current government has failed. He mentioned that three major incidents of violence—spanning 10 years, 3 years, and 6 months—had occurred during the rule of the previous government. He added that after these incidents, no official from the then government, including the Home Minister, visited the region.
The home minister noted that the BJP came to power in 2017, and in the previous five years, Manipur was shut down for an average of 212 days per year, despite the fact that no ethnic violence occurred during that time. He also mentioned that there were over 1,000 encounters, which had to be taken cognizance of by the Supreme Court. He said that before the High Court order, there was not a single day of shutdown or blockade in Manipur, and no violence occurred during the six years of BJP rule since 2017. He explained that in a specific situation, when both communities interpreted a High Court decision as being against them, violence erupted within just two days.
Regarding the accusations from the opposition about the government’s neglect of the violence in Manipur, Shah informed the House that on the very day the High Court’s order was issued, security forces’ companies were dispatched to the region via Air Force planes.
He emphasized that everyone shares the same concern about this matter. The Home Minister appealed to all members not to politicize the issue, as the government is making every possible effort to restore peace in Manipur. Shah added that for every life lost in this violence, the House should hold respect, empathy, and sorrow in its heart.
Shah said that after the imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur, discussions were held with both communities, and separate meetings with all organizations from both communities have taken place. He mentioned that the Ministry of Home Affairs will soon convene a joint meeting and emphasized that while the government is working to find a path to end the violence, the top priority is to establish peace.
Shah added that the situation would not be considered satisfactory until displaced people are no longer living in camps.

Title: Understanding Waqf and the 2025 amendment: Key reforms, challenges, and implications
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:18:26 +0000
Content: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was cleared by the Lok Sabha on Thursday after a 12-hour-long debate, with 288 members voting in favor and 232 against. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) described the bill as a crucial reform for transparency and minority welfare, while the opposition voiced concerns over its implications. All amendments proposed by opposition members were rejected by voice votes.
What is Waqf?
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, is a significant step towards reforming the management of Waqf properties in India. Rooted in Islamic law and tradition, Waqf refers to an endowment made by a Muslim for charitable or religious purposes, such as building mosques, schools, hospitals, or other public institutions. A key characteristic of Waqf property is its inalienability, meaning it cannot be sold, gifted, inherited, or encumbered once it is designated as Waqf.
Challenges in Waqf Property Management
Over the years, mismanagement, corruption, and inefficiencies have plagued the administration of Waqf properties, preventing them from serving their intended purpose of benefiting underprivileged communities. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeks to address these challenges by introducing measures to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in Waqf management.
Ensuring Transparency and Preventing Corruption
A major issue has been the lack of transparency in Waqf property management, which has led to corruption and financial mismanagement. To combat this, the bill mandates the digitisation of all Waqf records, ensuring easy access and real-time monitoring. A centralised digital portal will track Waqf properties, helping to prevent unauthorised transactions and ensuring that funds are used exclusively for social welfare.
Addressing Legal Disputes and Land Encroachments
Legal disputes and prolonged litigations have been a persistent problem, with thousands of cases pending over land encroachments and ownership claims. The bill introduces stricter regulations to curb the unauthorised declaration of properties as Waqf land, a practice that has led to conflicts in several states. For example, in Tamil Nadu, a farmer in Thiruchenthurai village was unable to sell his land due to Waqf Board claims over the entire village. Similar disputes have emerged in Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, affecting thousands of families. By addressing such issues, the bill ensures that property rights are protected while maintaining the integrity of Waqf institutions.
Empowering Muslim Women
The amendment also prioritizes the welfare of Muslim women, particularly widows and divorced women, by promoting self-help groups and financial independence programs. It ensures greater representation of women in Waqf Boards and supports initiatives such as scholarships for Muslim girls, vocational training programs, and legal aid centers for inheritance disputes and domestic violence cases. By empowering women, the bill seeks to make Waqf governance more inclusive and responsive to community needs.
Enhancing Healthcare Access
Healthcare access for the poor is another key focus of the bill. With better management of Waqf properties, more resources can be directed towards establishing clinics and hospitals, funding medical aid programs, and providing essential medicines in underserved areas. The bill encourages partnerships with charitable organisations to expand healthcare services, ensuring that Waqf properties contribute directly to improving public health.
Improving Education and Skill Development
Education plays a critical role in uplifting marginalized communities. The bill facilitates the construction and maintenance of schools and madrassas, offering scholarships and financial aid to students from low-income backgrounds. It also promotes vocational training centers to equip young people with job-ready skills, increasing their employment opportunities and economic stability.
Addressing Housing Needs
Housing is another essential aspect addressed by the bill. Many poor families struggle to afford proper shelter, and Waqf properties can play a vital role in providing low-cost housing solutions. The amendment allows Waqf Boards to use designated properties for affordable housing projects, shelters for the homeless, and subsidised rental programs for economically weaker sections. This initiative ensures that Waqf resources are used to address critical social needs rather than being left unused or encroached upon.
Promoting Economic Self-Sufficiency
Economic self-sufficiency is a key goal of the reform. The bill encourages skill development programs, microfinance support, and small business loans to help individuals become financially independent. By supporting entrepreneurship and employment initiatives, the amendment ensures that Waqf properties contribute to economic growth and self-reliance within the community.
Tackling Illegal Occupation of Waqf Properties
Illegal occupation of Waqf properties has been a significant concern, with nearly 58,898 properties unlawfully taken over, according to the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal. The bill introduces stronger legal measures to reclaim encroached lands and protect Waqf assets from unauthorised occupation. District collectors will have increased authority to enforce these measures, ensuring that Waqf properties are preserved for their intended purpose of community welfare.
Ensuring Inclusivity in Waqf Governance
The bill also promotes inclusivity and equitable distribution of Waqf resources. It ensures representation from various Muslim sects, including Bohra and Aghakhani communities, and mandates the inclusion of members from backward classes in State and Central Waqf Boards. Additionally, two non-Muslim members will be included in the Boards to enhance transparency and accountability.
By reforming the legal and administrative framework of Waqf management, the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, establishes a fair and transparent system that prioritizes social welfare, economic empowerment, and community development. The role of Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council is regulatory rather than religious, ensuring legal compliance and safeguarding public interest. By introducing checks and balances, empowering stakeholders, and improving governance, the bill paves the way for a progressive and effective Waqf administration in India.

Title: We believe in development-ism, not expansionism: PM Modi in Thailand
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:39:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Thai counterpart, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, held delegation-level talks in Bangkok on Thursday, marking a significant step in bilateral relations. Following the discussions, the two leaders announced their decision to elevate India-Thailand ties to a strategic partnership, strengthening cooperation across key sectors.
Delivering a joint press statement after the talks, PM Modi expressed his condolences over the recent earthquake in Thailand. “On behalf of the people of India, I extend deep sympathies for the loss of lives in the earthquake that struck on March 28. We pray for the speedy recovery of those who were injured.”  
Asserting that Thailand holds a special place in India’s ‘Act East’ Policy and Indo-Pacific vision, the prime minister said, “India and Thailand support a free, open, inclusive, rule-based order; we believe in a policy of development-ism, not expansionism.”  
“Today, we have decided to elevate our relationship to the level of a strategic partnership. We have also agreed to establish a strategic dialogue between our security agencies” the PM added. 
He also highlighted the centuries-old cultural connection between the two countries and expressed gratitude to the Thai PM for issuing a special commemorative stamp featuring 18th-century Ramayana mural paintings.  
“India and Thailand share centuries-old ties rooted in deep cultural and spiritual connections. The spread of Buddhism has linked our people, from Ayutthaya to Nalanda, fostering intellectual exchanges. The tales of the Ramayana are an integral part of Thai culture. The influence of Sanskrit and Pali is evident in the Thai language and traditions even today. I am grateful to the Thai government for issuing a commemorative stamp based on Ramayana mural paintings from the 18th century during my visit”, PM Modi said. 
During the meeting, PM Modi was presented with the “World Ti-pitaka: Sajjhaya Phonetic Edition” by Prime Minister Shinawatra. 
This edition, released by the Thai government in 2016 to commemorate King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) and Queen Sirikit’s 70-year reign, is a compilation of Lord Buddha’s teachings with an accurate pronunciation of the Pali Tipitaka’s over nine million syllables. The Thai government has gifted it to more than 30 countries as a “Gift of Peace and Wisdom for All.”  
“On behalf of ‘Buddha Bhoomi’ India, I accepted it with folded hands. Last year, holy relics of Lord Buddha were sent from India to Thailand. It is heartening that over four million devotees had the opportunity to receive darshan. I am pleased to announce that the holy relics of Lord Buddha, discovered in Gujarat’s Aravalli in 1960, will also be sent to Thailand for darshan. Our shared heritage was also evident at the Mahakumbh this year, where over 600 Buddhist devotees from Thailand and other nations participated,” the prime minister added.  
He also expressed gratitude to the Thai government for supporting Indian nationals affected by cybercrimes.  
The Ministry of External Affairs noted that Prime Minister Modi and Thai PM Shinawatra discussed bilateral cooperation across various sectors. The two leaders agreed to elevate bilateral ties to a strategic partnership and exchanged multiple Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs).

Title: Southeast Asian nations, among hardest-hit by Trump tariffs, seek talks
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 13:24:00 +0000
Content: Southeast Asian nations reeled on Thursday as they were hit with some of President Donald Trump’s heftiest tariffs, which now threaten the economies that have benefited from investment since he imposed levies on China during his first term.
Vietnam, slapped with 46% tariffs, said it would set up a task force and Thailand’s prime minister said she would pursue negotiations to try to reduce the 37% rate her country faces – far greater than the 11% it had expected.
Both countries are heavy exporters to the U.S., having gained from the so-called China+1 strategy, whereby manufacturers, seeking to escape tariffs on China, shifted some of their Chinese production to nearby countries in the region.
“We have to negotiate and get into details,” Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said. “We can’t let it get to where we miss our GDP target.”
Six of the nine Southeast Asian countries listed by Trump were slapped with much bigger-than-expected tariffs of between 32% and 49%. By comparison, the level for the European Union was 20%, Japan’s was 24% and India’s 27%.
So far, none of the Southeast Asian nations have spoken of retaliatory tariffs.
Vietnam, where companies like Apple, Nike and Samsung Electronics have large manufacturing operations, appears particularly exposed. Its exports to the United States were worth $142 billion last year, nearly 30% of its gross domestic product.
Vietnam’s benchmark stock index slid 6.7%, on course for its biggest one-day drop since January 2021 while its currency, the dong, lost 0.7% to hit an all-time low.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered up a task force to address the situation after an urgent cabinet meeting early on Thursday, state media said. He noted the country’s 8% growth target for this year remained unchanged.
“Vietnam’s export-driven growth model has been highly successful, attracting multinational companies … However, a 46% U.S. tariff would directly challenge this model,” said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam.
ING estimates that the tariffs put 5.5% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product at risk.
Vietnam made a number of recent concessions to Washington to avoid tariffs, including cutting duties and a pledge to import more U.S. goods, and is likely to offer more in the coming days.
“I expect negotiations to continue on ways to reduce or mitigate the impact of any new tariffs,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.
HOPING FOR TALKS
Thai Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan said his government was prepared for negotiations and had high hopes they would go well, citing Thailand’s good relations with the U.S.
Thailand is hoping for 3% growth this year. It has lagged regional peers, growing 2.5% last year, held back by soaring household debt.
The country’s stock index, already having taken a battering this year due to its weak economy and last week’s earthquake, slipped 1.1% while the baht fell to a one-month low. ING estimates the tariffs put 3% of the country’s GDP at risk.
Malaysia, which was dealt a rate of 24%, announced it would not seek retaliatory tariffs and it said the trade ministry would be actively engaging with U.S. authorities “to seek solutions that will uphold the spirit of free and fair trade.”
Cambodia is facing tariffs of 49% that will hurt its garment and footwear industries and promise to crush hopes that it could attract investment relocating from other countries in the region.
It is a “very, very serious situation for the economy,” said a Cambodia-based investment consultant who declined to be identified.
There is “nothing that Cambodia can offer as a negotiating tool, and will be at the back of a very long queue,” he added.

Title: Stock market ends lower as investors take cautious approach on US tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:25:25 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Thursday as investors remained cautious following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs.  
The new tariff structure includes a 10 per cent tax on all US imports, with higher tariffs on countries with a trade surplus. India will now face a 26 per cent tariff.  
The Sensex fell 322.08 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at 76,295.36. During the day, the index fluctuated between an intraday high of 76,493.74 and a low of 75,807.55.  
The Nifty also ended lower, down 82.25 points, or 0.35 per cent, at 23,250.10.  
Tech stocks led the losses, with TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, and Tata Motors declining by up to 4.02 per cent.  
On the other hand, Power Grid Corporation, Sun Pharma, Ultratech Cement, NTPC, and Asian Paints were among the top gainers, rising as much as 4.57 per cent.  
The IT sector was the worst performer, with the Nifty IT index dropping 4.21 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems, Coforge, TCS, and Mphasis. Auto, oil & gas, and realty stocks also struggled.  
However, pharma stocks performed well, with the Nifty Pharma index climbing 2.25 per cent. Banking, healthcare, FMCG, and consumer durables stocks also saw gains, rising up to 1.94 per cent.  
Despite the broader market decline, small-cap stocks outperformed, with the Nifty Smallcap100 index rising 0.58 per cent.  
Market analysts said that investors are expected to remain watchful of global developments and their impact on market trends.  
The rupee ended flat but traded in a volatile range between 85.75 and 85.35, as markets reacted to Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy.

Title: Hundreds of thousands flee as Israel seizes Rafah in new Gaza ‘security zone’
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:58:05 +0000
Content: Hundreds of thousands of fleeing Gazans sought shelter on Thursday in one of the biggest mass displacements of the war, as Israeli forces advanced into the ruins of the city of Rafah, part of a newly announced “security zone” they intend to seize.
A day after declaring their intention to capture large swathes of the crowded enclave, Israeli force pushed into the city on Gaza’s southern edge which had served as a last refuge for people fleeing other areas for much of the war.
Gaza’s health ministry reported at least 97 people killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, including at least 20 killed in an airstrike around dawn in Shejaia suburb of Gaza City.
Rafah “is gone, it is being wiped out,” a father of seven among the hundreds of thousands who had fled from Rafah to neighbouring Khan Younis, told Reuters via a chat app.
“They are knocking down what is left standing of houses and property,” said the man who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.
After a strike killed several people in Khan Younis, Adel Abu Fakher was checking the damage to his tent.
“Is anything left for us? There’s nothing left for us. We’re being killed while asleep,” he said.
The assault to capture Rafah is a major escalation in the war, which Israel restarted last month after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January.
GAZANS FEAR PERMANENT DEPOPULATION
Israel has not spelled out its longterm aims for the security zone its troops are now seizing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu said troops were taking an area he called the “Morag Axis”, a reference to an abandoned former Israeli settlement once located between Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the adjacent main southern city Khan Younis.
Gazans who had returned to homes in the ruins during the ceasefire have now been ordered to flee communities on the northern and southern edges of the strip.
They fear that Israel’s intention is to depopulate those areas indefinitely, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people permanently homeless in one of the poorest and most crowded territories on earth. The security zone includes some of Gaza’s last agricultural land and critical water infrastructure.
Since the first phase of the ceasefire expired at the start of March with no agreement to prolong it, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods reaching Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, recreating what international organisations describe as a humanitarian catastrophe after weeks of relative calm.
Israel’s stated goal since the start of the war has been the destruction of the Hamas militant group which ran Gaza for nearly two decades and led the attack on Israeli communities in October 2023 that precipitated the war.
But with no effort made to establish an alternative administration, Hamas-led police returned to the streets during the ceasefire. Fighters still hold 59 dead and living hostages which Israel says must be handed over to extend the truce; Hamas says it will free them only under a deal that ends the war.
Israeli leaders say they have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, with hundreds of people demonstrating in north Gaza’s Beit Lahiya on Wednesday opposing the war and demanding Hamas quit power. Hamas calls the protesters collaborators and says Israel is behind them.
The war began with a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023 with gunmen killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s campaign has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say.
Rafah residents said most of the local population had followed Israel’s order to leave, as Israeli strikes toppled buildings there. But a strike on the main road between Khan Younis and Rafah stopped most movement between the two cities.
Movement of people and traffic along the western coastal road near Morag was also limited by bombardment, said residents.
“Others stayed because they don’t know where to go, or got fed up of being displaced several times. We are afraid they might be killed or at best detained,” said Basem, a resident of Rafah who declined to give a second name.
Markets have emptied and prices for basic necessities have soared under Israel’s total blockade of food, medicine, and fuel.
The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but has nominal authority over hospitals in Gaza, said Gaza’s entire healthcare system was at risk of collapse.

Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra greeted PM Modi at the Government House, where the two leaders were scheduled to engage in wide-ranging discussions aimed at strengthening India-Thailand relations. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, shared details of the reception, noting that PM Modi’s arrival was marked by a special ceremonial welcome.
“A special ceremonial welcome with Guard of Honour. PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand warmly received PM Narendra Modi at the Government House in Bangkok today. The two leaders will have wide-ranging discussions for charting the way for future India-Thailand partnership,” Jaiswal posted on X.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi also had a delegation-level talk with Thai PM Shinawatra, furthering bilateral discussions on cooperation in various sectors.
PM Modi also witnessed a culturally significant moment when he witnessed a captivating performance of the Ramakien, the Thai adaptation of the Ramayana. The performance highlighted the deep civilisational ties between India and Thailand, with the Ramayana remaining a shared cultural and spiritual heritage across the two nations.

Taking to X, PM Modi expressed his admiration for the performance: “A cultural connect like no other! Witnessed a captivating performance of the Thai Ramayana, Ramakien. It was a truly enriching experience that beautifully showcased the shared cultural and civilisational ties between India and Thailand. The Ramayana truly continues to connect hearts and traditions across so many parts of Asia.”

India and Thailand share a deep-rooted cultural bond that continues to flourish through our people. Heartening to see this connection reflected so strongly here,” PM Modi tweeted.

Title: India calls on BRICS to boost climate cooperation, mobilize $1.3 trillion at 11th Environment Ministers’ meeting
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 07:18:44 +0000
Content: India on Thursday called for collective leadership to advance the 2030 Climate Agenda—a comprehensive set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all UN member states in 2015, with a target completion date of 2030.
Speaking at the 11th BRICS Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Brasília, Brazil, the Indian delegation, led by Amandeep Garg, Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), urged BRICS nations to strengthen climate financing mechanisms.
A key focus was the Baku to Belem Roadmap, aimed at securing $1.3 trillion in climate finance to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). India called for enhanced climate financing mechanisms to help BRICS nations meet their sustainability commitments.
India also highlighted that the proposed $300 billion per year by 2035 under the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance falls significantly short of the $1.3 trillion target. The Indian delegation emphasized that COP30, to be hosted by Brazil, will be a defining moment for advancing global climate adaptation and resilience.
Underscoring BRICS’ pivotal role in shaping global climate policy, India noted that the bloc accounts for 47% of the world’s population and 36% of global GDP (PPP). It stressed the importance of equitable carbon budget utilization and a fair transition that allows developing countries to pursue growth while meeting climate goals.
On the energy front, India reaffirmed the BRICS New Delhi Declaration (2021), which advocates for a diversified energy mix—embracing fossil fuels, nuclear, hydrogen, and renewables. It also spotlighted the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun, One World, One Grid, as a key global effort to enhance renewable energy integration.
India underlined the value of resource efficiency and circular economy approaches, citing the Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition (RECEIC), launched under its G20 Presidency, as a replicable model for international cooperation on sustainable resource use.
Calling for a “Just Transition,” India urged recognition of the varied economic realities of developing countries. It stressed that equitable access to finance, technology, and capacity-building must remain central to global climate negotiations. BRICS, it said, should play a stronger role in multilateral forums and champion the voice of the Global South.
With BRICS expanding to 11 members, India noted the coalition’s enhanced capacity to influence global environmental governance. It called for joint responses to shared challenges such as desertification, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss.
India reiterated the importance of continued BRICS collaboration in key forums like the UNFCCC, UNCCD, CBD, and UNEA, and reaffirmed the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) as a cornerstone of climate diplomacy.
Acknowledging BRICS’ progress in sustainability, India cited initiatives like the Partnership for Urban Environmental Sustainability, the Clean Rivers Programme, and Sustainable Urban Management. It called for deeper cooperation in tackling marine plastic pollution, improving air quality, and advancing circular economy practices.
Reaffirming its commitment to conservation, India spotlighted the International Big Cat Alliance and encouraged fellow BRICS nations to join other global initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, and the Global Biofuel Alliance to collectively accelerate sustainable development and climate action.

PM Modi conveyed his condolences for the loss of lives and extensive property damage caused by the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar.

Title: After passage from Parliament, Waqf Bill awaits President’s nod: Details here
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:51:42 +0000
Content: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was passed by Rajya Sabha in the wee hours of Friday after a marathon debate, involving heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches. The Upper House debated the bill for nearly 14 hours and then cleared it with 128 votes in favour and 95 against.
The legislation was earlier cleared by the Lok Sabha after nearly 12 hours debate, with 288 votes in favour and 232 against.
With this, both the Houses have cleared the decks for amendments in the Waqf Bill of 1995 and repealing the Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923.
The next course of action is the Presidential assent for the bill, following which it will turn into a law.
The Bill will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu soon and her approval will pave the way for amending the 1995 laws, governing Waqf properties.
According to a leading portal, the government is expecting a smaller window for the approval, unlike the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).
The NDA government, which is projecting the Waqf Amendment Bill as one of key milestone decision in first year of Modi 3.0 is expected to notify it for implementation, soon after getting President’s nod.
Interestingly, one of the major highlights of Rajya Sabha voting last night, was Biju Janata Dal (BJD)’s stand on the contentious bill.
As per the numbers of NDA and INDIA bloc, the bill was expected to sail through in Rajya Sabha but with a lower margin as compared to Lok Sabha. NDA was expected to get support of 123 MPs but ended up securing 128 votes in favour while INDIA bloc ended at 95 (as against expected figure of 98).
Hours before the voting, Naveen Patnaik-led BJD opened the gates for “conscience vote’, telling its 7 MPs that they would not be bound by a whip and could vote for whichever side they wanted.
Some BJD MPs cross-voted in favour of NDA, there bettering its tally than earlier expected. A total of 119 votes was needed for the bill to get through but BJP’s efficient floor management helped it secure 128 votes.
Meanwhile, Congress has stated that it will challenge the constitutionality of the Waqf legislation in the Supreme Court.
“The INC will very soon be challenging in the Supreme Court the constitutionality of the Wakf (Amendment) Bill, 2024,” he wrote in a post on X.

Title: Mark Chapman ruled out of final ODI against Pakistan due to hamstring injury

Title: ‘Waqf Bill will benefit Muslims, no threat to religious sites,’ says Shahabuddin Razvi
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:33:57 +0000
Content: Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi, the National President of All India Muslim Jamaat, has expressed his strong support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, calling it a significant step toward improving the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in India. The Bill, which passed through both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha this week, aims to reform the management of Waqf properties and ensure that they benefit the marginalized Muslim communities.
In his first public statement after the passage of the bill, Maulana Shahabuddin hailed the efforts of the Modi government and emphasized that the Waqf (Amendment) Bill would be a boon for common Muslims, stating that it was in no way harmful to them. “The Waqf Amendment Bill does not harm common Muslims, it will benefit them. The only ones who stand to lose are the Waqf land mafias who have illegally occupied valuable land. Common Muslims will not be affected by this,” he clarified.
The Maulana further explained that the primary objective of the bill was to safeguard the interests of the poor and vulnerable sections within the Muslim community. He elaborated that the revenue generated from Waqf land would be directed toward enhancing the socio-economic status of impoverished Muslims, with a focus on those who cannot afford quality education for their children.
“The income from Waqf land will be used for the benefit of poor Muslims, helping children from low-income families get a better education, and assisting orphans and widows in their development,” Maulana Shahabuddin said.
He reassured the community that the funds would be used in accordance with the intended purpose of the Waqf, particularly in establishing schools, colleges, madrasas, and orphanages that would uplift the educational and social standing of underprivileged Muslims.
Addressing concerns regarding the impact of the bill on religious sites, the Maulana stressed that the Waqf Amendment Bill posed no threat to mosques, madrasas, Eidgahs, cemeteries, or shrines. “These religious institutions will remain unaffected. The government will not interfere with them in any way,” he affirmed.
The Maulana also cautioned against the spread of misleading political narratives, urging the Muslim community to avoid falling prey to divisive political rhetoric. “Some politicians are misleading Muslims for their own interests. I appeal to the Muslim community to not fall for their provocations,” he warned.
The passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill came after a heated debate in the Rajya Sabha in the early hours of Friday. The Bill was approved with a majority of 128 votes in favor and 95 votes against, following intense discussions. The Bill had earlier been passed in the Lok Sabha after nearly 12 hours of deliberations.
Maulana Shahabuddin also drew a parallel between the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the controversy surrounding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Reflecting on how political leaders misled the Muslim community during the CAA debates, he emphasized that fears surrounding the loss of citizenship were unfounded. “When the CAA law was introduced, Muslims were misled into believing that their citizenship would be revoked. However, after its implementation, it became clear that no Muslim in India lost their citizenship, and instead, many were granted citizenship,” he said.

Title: India, South Korea discuss measures to bolster trade cooperation
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:17:54 +0000
Content: South Korea and India held a joint forum on growth strategy on Friday and discussed measures to expand bilateral cooperation in trade, Seoul’s Industry Ministry said.
At the Seoul forum, the two sides explored ways to strengthen cooperation in trade, investment, and emerging industries such as advanced manufacturing and renewable energy, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy.
The two countries upgraded their bilateral relations to a special strategic partnership in 2015 to boost comprehensive cooperation in trade, defence, and technology.
The forum, co-hosted by the Industry Ministry and the Embassy of India in Seoul, took place just a day after the U.S. administration announced plans to impose country-by-country reciprocal tariffs, raising concerns over a global trade war.
South Korea is subject to 25 percent reciprocal duties, and India to 27 percent.
“The two countries have seen limited performance compared to their potential for cooperation, but South Korea will work to promote more tangible cooperation with India this year,” said Kim Jong-chul, Director General for International Trade Relations at the Ministry.
Indian Ambassador to South Korea, Amit Kumar, also called for a sustainable partnership between the two countries, considering their economic structures, growth potential, and strategic benefits, according to the Ministry.
Meanwhile, South Korean defence giant Hanwha Aerospace has signed a 371.4 billion-won ($253.6 million) deal to export homegrown K9 self-propelled howitzers to India.
Under the agreement, the company will deliver the K9 howitzers to the Indian Army by September 2030, in cooperation with Mumbai-based company Larsen & Toubro, according to Hanwha Aerospace.
The deal aligns with India’s ongoing efforts to modernize its military, the company added.
This agreement follows a 2017 contract under which Hanwha supplied 372.7 billion won worth of K9 howitzers to India by 2020.
Hanwha Aerospace said this additional contract reflects the K9’s proven reliability in meeting the Indian Army’s operational needs.

Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:09:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, where he is expected to make key announcements reinforcing India’s role in strengthening regional cooperation.
BIMSTEC Secretary General Indra Mani Pandey highlighted the significance of PM Modi’s participation, expressing confidence that his address would include declarations aimed at enhancing India’s contributions to the regional bloc.
“PM will address BIMSTEC, and we are looking forward to his speech. I am sure there will be announcements and declarations reinforcing India’s role in strengthening regional cooperation through BIMSTEC,” Pandey told ANI in Thailand.
Despite the recent earthquake in Thailand, the host nation has proceeded with the summit, a decision that Pandey praised. He emphasized that the summit would yield significant outcomes, including the adoption of the Bangkok Vision 2030, the approval of the Eminent Persons Group Report, and the signing of a maritime transport cooperation agreement.
“It is commendable that despite the challenges posed by the earthquake, Thailand has gone ahead with hosting the summit. We expect a very successful outcome, including a summit declaration, the adoption of Bangkok Vision 2030, the endorsement of the eminent persons group report, and the signing of the maritime transport cooperation agreement,” he added.
India’s Leading Role in BIMSTEC
As a founding member of BIMSTEC, India has played a crucial role in advancing the regional cooperation agenda. Pandey recalled that PM Modi hosted a retreat for BIMSTEC leaders in 2016 alongside the BRICS Summit, a move that significantly pushed forward regional collaboration.
India’s engagement with BIMSTEC has been further reinforced by a recent bilateral meeting between PM Modi and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Pandey described the meeting as a step towards strengthening the “spirit of cooperation” between the two nations.
“India has always played a vital role in advancing the BIMSTEC agenda. PM Modi’s retreat with BIMSTEC leaders in 2016 was a momentous occasion that propelled regional cooperation. The recent bilateral meeting with Thai PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra will further bolster this spirit of cooperation,” he noted.
Growing Bilateral Ties
Pandey also highlighted India’s strong bilateral relations with BIMSTEC member states, emphasizing that PM Modi’s engagements during the summit would further deepen these ties.
“India has excellent bilateral relations with the BIMSTEC member states, and I am confident that the Prime Minister’s meetings will further contribute not only to strengthening these relationships but also to enhancing the spirit of regional cooperation,” he said.
A significant development at the summit is Bangladesh assuming the BIMSTEC chairmanship. As a founding member and the host of the BIMSTEC Secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh is expected to play a crucial role in regional economic cooperation, particularly in trade, investment, and the blue economy.
“Bangladesh will take over as the next chair after the summit. Being a founding member and hosting the Secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh will play a key role in advancing regional cooperation in trade, investment, development, and the blue economy,” Pandey stated.
Cultural Diplomacy
In a significant cultural gesture, PM Modi announced that India would send relics of Lord Buddha—discovered in Gujarat’s Aravalli in the 1960s—to Thailand for public viewing and worship.
“I am happy to announce that the holy relics of Lord Buddha, which were found in Gujarat’s Aravalli in 1960, will be sent to Thailand for darshan,” PM Modi said.
According to the Gujarat Tourism website, these relics were unearthed from Devni Mori, an ancient Buddhist monastery site dating back to the 3rd-4th century AD. PM Modi also recalled how India had sent Lord Buddha’s relics to Thailand last year, allowing over 4 million devotees to pay their respects.
BIMSTEC Summit 2025: Focus on Prosperity and Regional Growth
The 6th BIMSTEC Summit, themed “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” will take place on April 4, 2025, in Bangkok. The summit aims to enhance regional cooperation in trade, security, and connectivity while endorsing the Bangkok Vision 2030.

Title: BIMSTEC Summit: PM Modi, Myanmar’s Aung Hlaing discuss quake relief, bilateral ties
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 06:04:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar’s military-led government, on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok, discussing efforts to strengthen bilateral ties and extend support following the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar.
This marks the first bilateral meeting between the two leaders during PM Modi’s third term in office.
Taking to X, PM Modi shared details of the meeting, saying, “Met Senior General Min Aung Hlaing of Myanmar on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok. Once again expressed condolences on the loss of lives and damage to property in the wake of the recent earthquake.”
“India is doing whatever is possible to assist our sisters and brothers of Myanmar in this critical time,” he added.
Following the 7.7-magnitude earthquake that claimed over 3,000 lives, India launched Operation Brahma, positioning itself as a first responder, consistent with its Neighbourhood First and Act East policies.
Under the operation, India has dispatched tonnes of medical supplies and relief materials to Myanmar.
PM Modi had earlier expressed deep sorrow over the disaster and conveyed India’s condolences directly to Min Aung Hlaing, reaffirming India’s commitment to assisting Myanmar during this crisis.
Apart from discussing earthquake relief, the two leaders also explored ways to enhance cooperation between their countries.
“We also discussed bilateral relations between India and Myanmar, particularly in sectors like connectivity, capacity building, infrastructure development, and more,” PM Modi posted on X.

Title: Akash Deep ready for LSG comeback against MI after injury layoff
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 05:05:25 +0000
Content: Ahead of Lucknow Super Giants’ (LSG) home clash against five-time champions Mumbai Indians (MI), pacer Akash Deep has declared himself “100 per cent fit and ready” to play after recovering from a back injury that sidelined him for the past three months.
The match at Ekana Stadium in Lucknow will see two struggling teams—both with just one win in three matches—battle for momentum in IPL 2025. For Akash Deep, this game could mark his return to competitive cricket after an extended absence. The pacer, who played two Tests in Australia during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy last year, suffered an injury before the fifth Test at Sydney. He joined the LSG camp on April 2, two days ahead of the fixture.
“The first match is very important for me. I have played one practice match, but after a two to three-month break, no matter how much you practice, confidence only builds when you play a real match,” Akash Deep said in the pre-match press conference, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.
Akash last played a T20 match for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) during IPL 2024 in April. Since 2022, he has featured in eight IPL games, taking seven wickets. His only T20 match in the past 18 months was in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (October-November 2023). RCB released him ahead of the 2024 Mega Auction, and LSG secured his services for Rs. 8 crore.
“The jersey changes, but the player remains the same. I am really enjoying my time with this franchise. Though I have not been with the team for long due to injury, I feel quite confident,” he added.
LSG’s slow start under new captain Rishabh Pant—losing to Delhi Capitals, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad, and then falling to Punjab Kings—has been impacted by injuries to key pacers. Mohsin Khan has been ruled out of the tournament, with Shardul Thakur replacing him. Mayank Yadav’s return from a lumbar stress injury has been further delayed by a toe injury, leaving Avesh Khan and Prince Yadav as the main fast-bowling options.
Despite the setbacks, Akash Deep remains optimistic about LSG’s bowling attack. “Performance is not always in our control as a team. We have played just three matches, and IPL is a long tournament. Despite four fast bowlers being injured, our first match performance was great. The best is yet to come,” he asserted.
The young pacer is also eager to learn from LSG’s mentor, Indian pace legend Zaheer Khan. “I feel lucky to play under such a big coach for two months. His experience will help me refine the small technical aspects of my game. As a fast bowler, major changes aren’t possible, but fine-tuning can make a difference,” he said.
Squads:
Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton (w), Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Ashwani Kumar, Vignesh Puthur, Corbin Bosch, Raj Bawa, Robin Minz, Satyanarayana Raju, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Karn Sharma, Reece Topley, Bevon Jacobs, Krishnan Shrijith, Arjun Tendulkar.
Lucknow Super Giants: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Manimaran Siddharth, Prince Yadav, Shahbaz Ahmed, Himmat Singh, Akash Maharaj Singh, Matthew Breetzke, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Deep, Mayank Yadav, Shamar Joseph, Arshin Kulkarni.

Title: India-Myanmar energy ties set to deepen, says Indian Envoy Abhay Thakur
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:40:56 +0000
Content: India and Myanmar are set to deepen their energy cooperation, with several key initiatives currently underway, according to Abhay Thakur, India’s Ambassador to Myanmar. The growing partnership is expected to be driven by strategic agreements and sectoral collaboration, including in shipping, solar energy, and trade.
Speaking to ANI on Friday, Ambassador Thakur said, “We have a number of reasons why India-Myanmar energy cooperation would be more intense in the future… A coastal shipping agreement, which is in the works, would make this energy cooperation, particularly gasoline and diesel supplies, attractive for Myanmar.”
He also pointed to India’s ongoing efforts to enhance bilateral trade mechanisms, stating, “We are also working hard to increase the volume of the rupee chart settlement trade.”
Highlighting collaboration in renewable energy, the Ambassador emphasized the importance of solar initiatives: “We also have collaboration, including in particular, in the solar energy sector under the Joint Working Groups (JWGs) on Power. All of this, put together, has the potential of boosting India-Myanmar energy cooperation.”
In addition to energy collaboration, Ambassador Thakur underscored India’s rapid humanitarian response following the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28, claiming over 3,000 lives. He noted that India was one of the first nations to offer assistance, delivering critical supplies within 24 hours.
“We were the first responders, providing a helping hand to Myanmar in their time of need within 24 hours,” Thakur said. “Our assistance exceeds 1,000 tonnes of a range of HADR [Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief] material, including gen sets, kitchen sets, all kinds of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, food, meals ready to eat. We’re also bringing in rice and cooking oil. We set up a field hospital for medicines, so there is a very wide-ranging response, and this has been noticed by the government and the people of Myanmar.”
The international community has also stepped in to support Myanmar. The Quad nations—India, the United States, Australia, and Japan—have pledged over USD 20 million in humanitarian aid for the crisis-stricken country.
In a joint statement, the Quad expressed solidarity with Myanmar and acknowledged the catastrophic impact of the earthquake: “We, the Quad partners, have so far committed humanitarian assistance estimated at a combined value of over USD 20 million. Through our funding and bilateral efforts, we are delivering relief supplies and deploying emergency medical teams and supporting humanitarian partners working in Myanmar to provide care for those affected by the earthquake.”
The statement also offered condolences for the significant loss of life and destruction of infrastructure, particularly in light of Myanmar’s already fragile humanitarian situation.

Both Houses will reconvene during the Monsoon Session of Parliament; however, the dates have not yet been announced.  
Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, during his valedictory remarks in the 267th session of the Upper House, extended his gratitude to the members for their “active participation and valuable contribution.”  
“Hon’ble Members, we have come to the conclusion of a very productive 267th session of the Sabha. As we conclude this session, I extend my gratitude to each one of you for your active participation and valuable contribution,” Dhankhar said.  
He noted that the House functioned for 159 hours during the session, achieving a productivity rate of 119 percent. He further stated that on April 3, Rajya Sabha had its longest-ever sitting, starting at 11 AM and continuing until 4:02 AM on April 4. A record 49 private members’ bills were introduced in the Upper House.  
“Overall, the House functioned for a total of 159 hours, including more than four hours past midnight. The productivity of this session stood at 119 percent. On April 3, 2025, Rajya Sabha began its proceedings at 11 AM and held its longest-ever sitting, lasting until 4:02 AM the next day, marking a historic milestone,” the Rajya Sabha Chairman said.  
“A record 49 private members’ bills were introduced in the Upper House. I extend my appreciation to all members and staff for their dedication and efforts,” he added.  
Meanwhile, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla stated that the Lower House held 26 sittings from January 31, 2025, achieving an overall productivity rate of approximately 118 percent.

Title: PM Modi to inaugurate New Pamban rail bridge and launch major infrastructure projects in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:28:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Tamil Nadu on April 6th to inaugurate the highly anticipated New Pamban rail bridge, India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, and launch several key infrastructure projects that are set to enhance connectivity and drive economic growth in the state.
On the occasion of Ram Navami, PM Modi will inaugurate the New Pamban rail bridge at noon. This state-of-the-art bridge, which connects the island town of Rameswaram to the mainland, is a pioneering engineering feat in India. Built at a cost of over Rs 550 crore, the bridge spans 2.08 kilometers and consists of 99 spans, including a 72.5-meter vertical lift span. This lift span rises up to 17 meters, allowing ships to pass freely without disrupting rail traffic. Designed for dual rail tracks, the bridge is constructed using high-grade materials to ensure durability and minimize maintenance. The bridge’s advanced protective coatings also enable it to withstand the harsh marine environment, ensuring its longevity for years to come.
As part of the inauguration, PM Modi will flag off a new train service from the bridge and witness its operation. The New Pamban Rail Bridge holds cultural significance, as it is situated near Dhanushkodi, which is traditionally believed to be the starting point of the Ram Setu (Adam’s Bridge) mentioned in the Ramayana.
Following the bridge inauguration, PM Modi will visit the renowned Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram. Afterward, he will lay the foundation stone and dedicate a series of infrastructure projects worth over Rs 8,300 crore to the nation. These projects are expected to improve connectivity, enhance regional economic activity, and boost the state’s development.
Among the major projects to be launched, PM Modi will lay the foundation for the four-laning of the 28-km Walajapet–Ranipet section of NH-40. He will also dedicate the completed 29-km Viluppuram–Puducherry section of NH-332. Additionally, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation for the 57-km Poondiyankuppam–Sattanathapuram section of NH-32 and the 48-km Cholapuram–Thanjavur section of NH-36. These upgraded highways will enhance access to important pilgrim centers, tourist destinations, and key medical and port facilities across the region.

Title: Indian Railways sets new record with production of 41,929 wagons to boost cargo capacity
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:20:33 +0000
Content: Indian Railways has achieved a record-breaking feat in wagon production, manufacturing 41,929 wagons in the financial year 2024–25 — the highest ever in a single year. This marks an 11% year-on-year increase over the 37,650 wagons produced in FY 2023–24, the Ministry of Railways announced on Friday.
The latest figures reflect a staggering threefold surge compared to the average annual production of 13,262 wagons recorded between 2004 and 2014. The robust increase underlines significant strides in the Railways’ manufacturing capacity and operational efficiency.
Year-wise Wagon Production:
Between 2004 and 2014, the average annual wagon production stood at 13,262 units. This figure rose to an average of 15,875 units per year during the 2014–2024 period. In recent years, Indian Railways has seen a sharp increase: 22,790 wagons were produced in 2022–23, followed by 37,650 in 2023–24, and, culminating in a record 41,929 wagons in 2024–25. Over the last three financial years alone, total wagon production has reached an impressive 1,02,369 units.
The Ministry stated that this unprecedented growth in wagon production is poised to reduce freight transport bottlenecks and ensure smoother and faster cargo movement across the country. Key industries such as coal, cement, and steel are expected to benefit significantly from improved logistics and delivery timelines.
Boost to Economy and Environment
The increase in rail freight capacity is also expected to bring substantial economic and environmental benefits. Enhanced wagon availability reduces reliance on road transport, cutting fuel consumption and lowering emissions—key to meeting India’s sustainability goals. Moreover, increased freight efficiency helps contain logistics costs, benefiting businesses and easing inflationary pressure on consumers.

Title: PM Modi urges Bangladesh’s Yunus to avoid rhetoric, protect minorities
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:11:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government in Bangladesh. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
This was the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since the ouster of the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the formation of the interim government under Yunus’s leadership in the neighbouring country last August.
Prime Minister Modi urged that any rhetoric which vitiates the environment should be avoided. He expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of the long-standing relationship between the two nations.
“The Prime Minister also underlined India’s concerns related to the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, and expressed his expectation that the government of Bangladesh would ensure their protection — including by thoroughly investigating all cases of atrocities committed against them,” said Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri during a media briefing after the BIMSTEC Summit.
During the meeting, PM Modi reiterated India’s support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive Bangladesh. He also emphasized that India believes in a people-centric approach to the bilateral relationship and highlighted the long-standing cooperation between the two countries, which has delivered tangible benefits to the people of both nations.
“In this spirit, he once again underlined to Prof. Yunus India’s desire to forge a positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh, based on pragmatism. The Prime Minister also urged that any rhetoric which vitiates the environment should be avoided.”
“On the border, strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal crossings — especially at night — are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. There are several mechanisms between the two countries, and these could convene as appropriate to review and strengthen our ties,” added Foreign Secretary Misri.
Discussions also covered Dhaka’s request for Hasina’s extradition and the holding of elections in Bangladesh.
As PM Modi expressed his grave concern about attacks on minorities and urged Bangladesh to act responsibly, he also shared his views with Yunus on the importance of holding regular and inclusive elections — a vital component of any democracy and essential for ensuring a stable Bangladesh in the future.
Earlier in the day, Bangladesh assumed the Chair of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).
Founded on June 6, 1997, the regional grouping has expanded from its original four member states — Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand — to include Myanmar, Bhutan, and Nepal, supporting regional collaboration on a variety of issues, including healthcare.
“The Prime Minister congratulated Bangladesh on assuming the Chair of BIMSTEC and looked forward to the forum advancing regional cooperation under Bangladesh’s leadership. The leaders also exchanged views on other issues and agreed to enhance consultations and cooperation to strengthen regional integration, including under the BIMSTEC framework,” said Misri.
Meanwhile, Chief Advisor’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam told Bangladeshi media that Yunus presented a photograph to Prime Minister Modi during their meeting, showing Modi awarding Yunus a gold medal at the 102nd Indian Science Congress held in Mumbai on January 3, 2015.
“All issues of mutual interest were discussed. The meeting was very constructive, productive, and fruitful,” Alam said.

Title: US lobbies UN rights council forsaken by Trump, diplomats say
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:08:47 +0000
Content: Two months after President Donald Trump announced a halt to U.S. engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council, Washington is influencing its work by applying pressure publicly and behind the scenes, seven diplomats and rights workers said.
The United States left its seat empty during a six-week session of the 47-member council ending on Friday, but its lobbying and pressure had some success, the sources told Reuters.
They said the U.S., which has accused the council of an anti-Israel bias, had focused on blunting a proposal by Pakistan on the creation of an International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM), the most rigorous type of U.N. investigation, on Israel’s actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The version of Pakistan’s proposal that was passed on Wednesday by the council, whose mission is to promote and protect human rights worldwide, did not include the creation of the IIIM.
The council already has a commission of inquiry on the Palestinian Territories, but Pakistan’s proposal would have created an additional probe with extra powers to gather evidence for possible use in international courts.
A March 31 letter sent by Brian Mast, Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, and James R. Risch, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cautioned against voting the proposal through.
“Any HRC member state or U.N. entity that supports an Israel-specific IIM … will face the same consequences as the ICC faced,” the letter said.
It appeared to be referring to sanctions approved by the House of Representatives on the International Criminal Court in protest at its arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and former defence minister over Israel’s campaign in Gaza.
The final version of Pakistan’s proposal referred only to an invitation to the U.N. General Assembly to consider an IIIM in future.
Two Geneva-based diplomats said they had received messages from U.S. diplomats before the change of wording asking them to oppose the new investigation.
“They were saying: ‘back off on this issue’,” said one, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Reuters could not establish whether the revision was a direct result of U.S. actions.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said it was complying with the executive order signed by Trump on Feb. 4 withdrawing the U.S. from the council and would not participate in it, adding: “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on private diplomatic conversations.”
Pakistan’s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
‘RAW POWER’
The U.S. and Israel are not members of the council but, like all U.N. member states have informal observer status and a seat in the council’s meeting chamber.
International human rights institutions are now at a critical juncture, said Phil Lynch, Director of International Service for Human Rights, a non-governmental organization.
“We are potentially confronting a future characterised by lawlessness and raw power,” he said.
The U.S. was once the top donor to the U.N. rights system, but Trump has said the U.N. is “not being well run” and aid cuts by his administration have forced scalebacks.
The U.S. and Israel have also opposed the mandate of one of the council’s independent experts up for renewal this week.
The Israeli ambassador said on March 24 that Francesca Albanese, a critic of Israeli actions in Gaza, had breached a U.N. code of conduct through “blatant antisemitic behaviour and discourse”, a diplomatic note showed.
The U.S. State Department spokesperson said Albanese was “unfit for her role”.
“The correspondence received is under consideration,” council spokesperson Pascal Sim said, adding that he expected Albanese’s term be renewed.
The internal body that ensures U.N. experts adhere to a code of conduct condemned what it described as a coordinated campaign against Albanese, according to a letter from the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures dated 28 March.
It found no evidence to support Israel’s complaints against Albanese. However, it is introducing social media guidelines for U.N. experts in light of some concerns raised about her X posts.

Title: Study warns against surge in antibiotic prescriptions for young adults
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:00:18 +0000
Content: Younger people are increasingly being prescribed antibiotics without a proper assessment of complication risks, warns a new study. This practice could potentially lead to antibiotic resistance.  
The study, led by epidemiologists at the University of Manchester, UK, found that doctors are prescribing antibiotics to tens of thousands of patients with infections, often without considering the prognosis or the risk of the infection worsening.  
An analysis of 15.7 million patient records revealed that the oldest patients in the sample were 31% less likely than the youngest patients to receive an antibiotic for upper respiratory infections.  
This suggests that “many younger people are being prescribed antibiotics even though they are often fit enough to recover without them, potentially leading to resistance,” the research team stated in their paper, published in the prestigious Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.  
Conversely, many older individuals—who may not be able to combat infections without antibiotics—are not receiving them, increasing the risk of complications and hospital admissions.  
Patients with multiple health conditions were 7% less likely than those without major health issues to receive an antibiotic for upper respiratory infections.  
Furthermore, the study found that the likelihood of being prescribed antibiotics for lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections was unrelated to hospital admission risk. Meanwhile, the probability of receiving antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections was only weakly linked to hospital admission risk.  
“Antibiotics are effective in treating bacterial infections, but their inappropriate use carries the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and loss of effectiveness. That is why AMR has been recognized as one of the biggest threats to global public health,” said lead author Professor Tjeerd van Staa from the University of Manchester.  
“The study finds that antibiotics for common infections are often not prescribed according to complication risk, suggesting there is significant scope to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing,” van Staa added.  
Dr. Ali Fahmi from the university urged clinicians to “focus on improving risk-based antibiotic prescribing for infections that are less severe and typically self-limiting.”

Title: Cabinet approves four multitracking projects to enhance Indian Railways capacity
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 10:51:04 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Friday approved four major multitracking projects for Indian Railways, aiming to significantly enhance line capacity and improve both passenger and freight transportation across key routes. With an estimated total cost of Rs. 18,658 crore, these projects will be completed by 2030-31 and are expected to streamline logistics, reduce costs, and support sustainable rail operations.
Spanning 1,247 kilometers across 15 districts in Maharashtra, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh, the four approved projects are crucial for increasing the efficiency of transportation for essential commodities like coal, iron ore, and other minerals. These improvements will help boost supply chains, contributing to accelerated economic growth in the region. Additionally, the projects will reduce congestion on some of the busiest railway sections in India, providing enhanced mobility and service reliability for Indian Railways.
The four projects include the third and fourth line expansion between Sambalpur and Jarapda, the third and fourth line between Jharsuguda and Sason, the fifth and sixth line between Kharsia, Naya Raipur, and Parmalkasa, and the doubling of the Gondia-Balharshah track. These capacity upgrades are designed to ease operations, meet growing demand, and support Prime Minister Modi’s vision of a “New India,” which focuses on comprehensive development and empowering people through enhanced employment and self-employment opportunities.
These projects are part of the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity. This initiative has been made possible through integrated planning and aims to provide seamless connectivity for the movement of people, goods, and services. The projects will also see the construction of 19 new stations, improving access to important regions, including two aspirational districts—Gadchiroli and Rajnandgaon. This enhanced connectivity will benefit around 3,350 villages and approximately 47.25 million people.
The Kharsia-Naya Raipur-Parmalkasa line will provide direct connectivity to new areas such as Baloda Bazar, opening up possibilities for the establishment of new industrial units, including cement plants. This will further stimulate the local economy and improve regional development.
The capacity expansion will also help meet the growing demand for transporting goods such as agricultural products, fertilizers, coal, iron ore, steel, cement, and limestone. It is expected to result in an additional freight capacity of 88.77 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). As a result, these projects will contribute to achieving climate goals by reducing oil imports by 95 crore liters annually and lowering CO2 emissions by 477 crore kilograms, which is equivalent to the environmental benefit of planting 19 crore trees.

Title: India expands National Tele Mental Health Programme: Over two million calls handled, new mobile app launched
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 16:01:42 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has provided an update on the National Tele Mental Health Programme (NTMHP), highlighting significant strides in expanding mental health services across India. 
As of April 1, 2025, a total of 36 States and Union Territories have established 53 Tele MANAS Cells, offering round-the-clock tele-mental health services in 20 languages as per regional preferences. The helpline has handled over 20,05,000 calls, reflecting the increasing need for accessible mental health support nationwide.
Launched on October 10, 2022, the NTMHP functions as the digital extension of the District Mental Health Programme. The primary objective of this initiative is to ensure universal access to equitable, affordable, and high-quality mental health care. By providing 24×7 tele-mental health counseling services through the toll-free helpline number 14416, the programme aims to reach every individual seeking support, regardless of location.
A major milestone in this initiative was the launch of the Tele MANAS Mobile Application on World Mental Health Day, October 10, 2024. This comprehensive platform has been designed to provide assistance ranging from general mental well-being to severe mental disorders. Over the past three years, the government has allocated more than Rs. 230 crore to support the expansion and operation of the NTMHP.
In addition to these efforts, a dedicated Tele-MANAS Cell has been set up at the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune. This facility is specifically aimed at providing mental health assistance to Armed Forces personnel and their dependents, ensuring their well-being and access to quality mental healthcare.
The government is also integrating mental health services into primary healthcare through its Ayushman Arogya Mandirs initiative. More than 1.75 lakh Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been upgraded under this scheme, with mental health services included in the package of Comprehensive Primary Health Care.
Furthermore, the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), implemented under the National Mental Health Programme, is operational in 767 districts across the country. This initiative focuses on early detection, management, and treatment of mental illnesses at the district hospital level. The DMHP extends its services to Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), offering outpatient care, counseling, psycho-social interventions, continuous support for severe mental disorders, medication, outreach services, and ambulance facilities.

Title: Parliament passes the Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:42:25 +0000
Content: The Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025, introduced by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 3, following its earlier approval in the Rajya Sabha. With both Houses clearing the legislation, this marks the second major aviation reform under his leadership. 
The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.
It builds on the framework of the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which sought to simplify and standardize international leasing agreements. Although India formally adopted this convention in 2008, gaps in legal enforcement led to higher leasing costs—typically 8 to 10 percent higher than in other nations. This legislation aims to address those gaps, ensuring legal certainty for aircraft financiers and reducing costs for Indian carriers.
Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector. He pointed to concrete figures demonstrating this growth: between Independence and 2014, the total number of passengers flying annually in India stood at 10.38 crore. 
In just the next decade, that number more than doubled to 22.81 crore in 2024. Similarly, the number of airports in India grew from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more set to be launched soon.
The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. He stated that no other country has witnessed such rapid aviation expansion in such a short period.
The bill is expected to streamline leasing processes, make India a more attractive destination for aviation investments, and improve the country’s compliance scores under the Cape Town Convention. These changes are essential for reducing airline costs and encouraging new entrants into the sector.
Discussions on the bill also touched upon broader challenges in the civil aviation sector, such as the high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational costs. The minister expressed concern over the variation in ATF tax across states and urged more states to follow the example of those who have reduced their rates. Lowering these taxes, he argued, would boost regional connectivity and reduce costs for passengers.
Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building. Plans are in place to generate 2.5 crore liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2025 and transition over 100 airports to renewable energy, underscoring India’s commitment to greener aviation. 
The sector also faces a growing demand for trained pilots, estimated at 30,000 to 34,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. The government is working on increasing the number of Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and issuing more commercial pilot licenses annually to meet this demand.

Title: Over 68 lakh cancer treatments provided, Rs. 13,000 crore spent under PM-JAY: government outlines nationwide cancer care achievements
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:38:16 +0000
Content: In a significant move to combat the growing burden of cancer in India, the Government has implemented a series of robust measures aimed at the detection, prevention, and treatment of the disease. According to an official statement released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday, these steps are being taken through both technical and financial support to States and Union Territories under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), which operates under the National Health Mission (NHM).
As part of the initiative, a network of 770 District NCD Clinics, 233 Cardiac Care Units, 372 District Day Care Centres, and 6,410 NCD clinics at Community Health Centres has been established across the country. A population-based screening and management programme for common non-communicable diseases—including oral, breast, and cervical cancers—has also been rolled out under Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, with a focus on providing services in rural and underserved regions.
To strengthen tertiary care, the government has set up 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centres in various states. Additionally, all 22 newly established AIIMS are equipped with cancer treatment facilities, offering comprehensive diagnostic, medical, and surgical services. The National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar, with 1,460 beds, and the second campus of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in Kolkata, with 460 beds, further augment the country’s capacity for super-specialty cancer care.
In parallel, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) continues to offer financial protection of Rs. 5 lakh per family annually for secondary and tertiary hospitalization to nearly 55 crore beneficiaries. Notably, the scheme has recently been expanded to cover all senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of income.
Cancer care features prominently in AB PM-JAY, with over 68 lakh treatments worth Rs.13,000 crore carried out under the scheme so far—of which more than 75% have benefited rural patients. Furthermore, targeted therapies have supported over 4.5 lakh treatments valued at over Rs. 985 crore, with more than 76% accessed by rural beneficiaries.
In a forward-looking move announced in the Union Budget 2025–26, the Government plans to set up 200 Day Care Cancer Centres (DCCCs) in district hospitals across the country during the financial year 2025–26, as part of a three-year roadmap. These centres will be established based on a detailed gap analysis of existing cancer care infrastructure, availability of trained personnel, and medical equipment. Districts with a high cancer burden and limited access to treatment will be prioritized, with strong referral linkages planned between the DCCCs, State Cancer Institutes, and Tertiary Care Centres to ensure a seamless continuum of care.

Title: India-Myanmar energy ties set to deepen, says Indian Envoy Abhay Thakur
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:40:56 +0000
Content: India and Myanmar are set to deepen their energy cooperation, with several key initiatives currently underway, according to Abhay Thakur, India’s Ambassador to Myanmar. The growing partnership is expected to be driven by strategic agreements and sectoral collaboration, including in shipping, solar energy, and trade.
Speaking to ANI on Friday, Ambassador Thakur said, “We have a number of reasons why India-Myanmar energy cooperation would be more intense in the future… A coastal shipping agreement, which is in the works, would make this energy cooperation, particularly gasoline and diesel supplies, attractive for Myanmar.”
He also pointed to India’s ongoing efforts to enhance bilateral trade mechanisms, stating, “We are also working hard to increase the volume of the rupee chart settlement trade.”
Highlighting collaboration in renewable energy, the Ambassador emphasized the importance of solar initiatives: “We also have collaboration, including in particular, in the solar energy sector under the Joint Working Groups (JWGs) on Power. All of this, put together, has the potential of boosting India-Myanmar energy cooperation.”
In addition to energy collaboration, Ambassador Thakur underscored India’s rapid humanitarian response following the devastating earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28, claiming over 3,000 lives. He noted that India was one of the first nations to offer assistance, delivering critical supplies within 24 hours.
“We were the first responders, providing a helping hand to Myanmar in their time of need within 24 hours,” Thakur said. “Our assistance exceeds 1,000 tonnes of a range of HADR [Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief] material, including gen sets, kitchen sets, all kinds of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, food, meals ready to eat. We’re also bringing in rice and cooking oil. We set up a field hospital for medicines, so there is a very wide-ranging response, and this has been noticed by the government and the people of Myanmar.”
The international community has also stepped in to support Myanmar. The Quad nations—India, the United States, Australia, and Japan—have pledged over USD 20 million in humanitarian aid for the crisis-stricken country.
In a joint statement, the Quad expressed solidarity with Myanmar and acknowledged the catastrophic impact of the earthquake: “We, the Quad partners, have so far committed humanitarian assistance estimated at a combined value of over USD 20 million. Through our funding and bilateral efforts, we are delivering relief supplies and deploying emergency medical teams and supporting humanitarian partners working in Myanmar to provide care for those affected by the earthquake.”
The statement also offered condolences for the significant loss of life and destruction of infrastructure, particularly in light of Myanmar’s already fragile humanitarian situation.

Both Houses will reconvene during the Monsoon Session of Parliament; however, the dates have not yet been announced.  
Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, during his valedictory remarks in the 267th session of the Upper House, extended his gratitude to the members for their “active participation and valuable contribution.”  
“Hon’ble Members, we have come to the conclusion of a very productive 267th session of the Sabha. As we conclude this session, I extend my gratitude to each one of you for your active participation and valuable contribution,” Dhankhar said.  
He noted that the House functioned for 159 hours during the session, achieving a productivity rate of 119 percent. He further stated that on April 3, Rajya Sabha had its longest-ever sitting, starting at 11 AM and continuing until 4:02 AM on April 4. A record 49 private members’ bills were introduced in the Upper House.  
“Overall, the House functioned for a total of 159 hours, including more than four hours past midnight. The productivity of this session stood at 119 percent. On April 3, 2025, Rajya Sabha began its proceedings at 11 AM and held its longest-ever sitting, lasting until 4:02 AM the next day, marking a historic milestone,” the Rajya Sabha Chairman said.  
“A record 49 private members’ bills were introduced in the Upper House. I extend my appreciation to all members and staff for their dedication and efforts,” he added.

Title: PM Modi accorded ceremonial welcome in Sri Lanka
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:38:22 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a grand ceremonial welcome at the Independence Square in Colombo on Saturday, as Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake hosted him during his State Visit to the island nation.
This marks PM Modi’s fourth visit to Sri Lanka since 2014 and his first since President Dissanayake assumed office.
The ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and key members of Dissanayake’s Cabinet.
PM Modi arrived in Colombo late on Saturday evening from Bangkok following his participation in the 6th BIMSTEC Summit. The invitation for the visit was extended by the Sri Lankan President during his maiden official trip to India in December last year.
Despite heavy rains, hundreds of Sri Lankans and members of the Indian diaspora lined the streets and gathered outside Bandaranaike International Airport and the hotel to greet the Indian leader with enthusiasm.
Welcoming him at the airport were top ministers from the Sri Lankan government, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, Labour Minister Anil Jayantha, Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Science and Technology Minister Chrishantha Abeysena.
Shortly after landing, PM Modi took to X and wrote, “Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programmes in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka considers Dissanayake’s State Visit to India last December a “watershed moment” in its bilateral ties with New Delhi.
PM Modi now becomes the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new President, further cementing the deep diplomatic bond shared by the two countries.
Ahead of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri underscored the importance of the India-Sri Lanka partnership.
“The India-Sri Lanka relationship is deeply rooted in civilisational links, shared history, religion, culture, and strong people-to-people ties. In the modern era, it has evolved into a close economic, cultural, and technical partnership. Sri Lanka is an integral part of our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, and this relationship, built on mutual trust and goodwill, has stood the test of time,” he said.
Recalling India’s swift assistance during Sri Lanka’s economic crisis in 2022, Misri said, “India was glad to be able to play a key role in the economic stabilisation and recovery of the country, thereby demonstrating its commitment as a dependable neighbour and as a first responder to any crisis in the region.”
Prime Minister Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with President Dissanayake, reviewing progress on joint initiatives outlined in the “Joint Vision for Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future” adopted during the President’s December visit to India.
Several bilateral agreements across sectors, such as energy connectivity, digitisation, defence, health, and multisectoral grant assistance, are expected to be signed in the presence of both leaders.
In addition to his official meetings, Prime Minister Modi will engage with senior political leaders and other dignitaries of Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, he will accompany President Dissanayake to Anuradhapura to inaugurate development projects supported by Indian financial assistance.
The two leaders will also visit the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex, an iconic site symbolising the civilisational ties between the two countries. PM Modi had previously paid homage at the temple during his 2015 visit and later revisited Sri Lanka in 2019.
The ongoing visit will also cover discussions on long-pending issues related to Indian fishermen. Both leaders are expected to address matters concerning the early release and repatriation of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats.
The Indian government has consistently maintained that the safety, security, and welfare of Indian fishermen are of the highest priority and has pursued the matter with Sri Lankan authorities through diplomatic channels and bilateral mechanisms.
“The Prime Minister has raised this matter in all recent interactions, including the December 16, 2024, meeting with the Sri Lankan President,” Foreign Secretary Misri noted.
He also highlighted the historical background of the issue, tracing it to maritime boundary arrangements agreed upon in the 1970s between both nations.
“We have repeatedly requested the Sri Lankan Government to treat the fishermen issue as a humanitarian and livelihood concern without using force under any circumstances,” Misri added.
The Prime Minister’s current visit is seen as a continuation of India’s sustained outreach to its neighbours under the Neighbourhood First policy, aimed at fostering greater cooperation, connectivity, and mutual respect across South Asia. He is scheduled to return to New Delhi on April 6.

Title: SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin clinch $13.5 billion-dollar Pentagon launch contracts
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:30:04 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX, United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin on Friday won U.S. Space Force rocket launch contracts worth a combined $13.5 billion through 2029 to send some of the Pentagon’s most sensitive and complex satellites into space.
The Space Force’s flagship National Security Space Launch procurement program will assign roughly 54 missions through 2029 in incremental task orders, according to its Space Systems Command office.
SpaceX, awarded 28 of the missions, won $5.9 billion. ULA, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed won $5.3 billion for 19 missions. Blue Origin got seven missions worth a combined $2.3 billion, with those planned for launch in a later year.
Reuters earlier reported SpaceX and ULA were tapped for the awards.
The program, the most competitive and lucrative U.S. launch effort, effectively affirms the companies as the most capable American rocket providers, though Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has launched once in January and has less experience than SpaceX’s and ULA’s rockets.
SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 rocket, is the world’s most active launch company. It has launched dozens of military space missions in recent years. The company said it will use Falcon 9 and its more powerful Falcon Heavy – three Falcon cores strapped together – for the Phase 3 missions.
ULA’s new Vulcan rocket had its first two launches last year. The Pentagon certified Vulcan for national security missions this month after months of review into a mishap with its solid rocket motors during one of its flights.
The awards are part of the Phase 3 program’s “Lane 2” track. That track contains the Pentagon’s most difficult and expensive missions, involving a variety of complex orbits around Earth, for which only the top U.S. launch companies with the most experience are to compete.
SpaceX, according to two people familiar with the plans, will get a vast majority of the missions ordered by the Space Force in the first year of the program. The company’s launch rate with Falcon 9 is far greater than ULA and Blue Origin’s.
SpaceX CEO, Musk, a special government employee and close ally of President Donald Trump, has wielded enormous influence over the U.S. government, from slashing federal agencies in his government efficiency effort to pushingallies to lead federal agencies that oversee billions of dollars’ worth of SpaceX government contracts.
Friday’s awards have been years in the making. It is a third phase of a program governing how the U.S. Defense Department purchases rides to space for its military and intelligence satellites, a lucrative area of government procurement once dominated by the Boeing and Lockheed Martinjoint venture, United Launch Alliance.
SpaceX has risen in the past decade to become a dominant launch player. Its reusable Falcon 9 rockets offer a cost-cutting capability its rivals have been slower to match, making the company a key vendor for the Pentagon, which is also increasingly reliant on the company for satellite-based military intelligence.
In an earlier phase of the national security launch program, Phase 2, SpaceX won 40% of the missions while ULA got 60%, representing over $6 billion in missions combined.
Some missions originally assigned to ULA under Phase 2 had to be transferred to SpaceX over development delays with ULA’s Vulcan rocket, which had frustrated Pentagon officials.
“We are very pleased to be awarded 40 percent of the Phase 3 procurement,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno said in a statement. “Vulcan is the right choice for critical national security space missions and is the only rocket today designed to meet all the requirements of our nation’s space launch needs.”
With SpaceX emerging as a dominant winner in the program, Musk nonetheless took a jab at SpaceX’s rivals on X, his social media platform.
“Winning 60% of the missions may sound generous, but the reality is that all SpaceX competitors combined cannot currently deliver the other 40%! I hope they succeed, but they aren’t there yet,” he said.

Title: India expands National Tele Mental Health Programme: Over two million calls handled, new mobile app launched
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 16:01:42 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has provided an update on the National Tele Mental Health Programme (NTMHP), highlighting significant strides in expanding mental health services across India. 
As of April 1, 2025, a total of 36 States and Union Territories have established 53 Tele MANAS Cells, offering round-the-clock tele-mental health services in 20 languages as per regional preferences. The helpline has handled over 20,05,000 calls, reflecting the increasing need for accessible mental health support nationwide.
Launched on October 10, 2022, the NTMHP functions as the digital extension of the District Mental Health Programme. The primary objective of this initiative is to ensure universal access to equitable, affordable, and high-quality mental health care. By providing 24×7 tele-mental health counseling services through the toll-free helpline number 14416, the programme aims to reach every individual seeking support, regardless of location.
A major milestone in this initiative was the launch of the Tele MANAS Mobile Application on World Mental Health Day, October 10, 2024. This comprehensive platform has been designed to provide assistance ranging from general mental well-being to severe mental disorders. Over the past three years, the government has allocated more than Rs. 230 crore to support the expansion and operation of the NTMHP.
In addition to these efforts, a dedicated Tele-MANAS Cell has been set up at the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune. This facility is specifically aimed at providing mental health assistance to Armed Forces personnel and their dependents, ensuring their well-being and access to quality mental healthcare.
The government is also integrating mental health services into primary healthcare through its Ayushman Arogya Mandirs initiative. More than 1.75 lakh Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been upgraded under this scheme, with mental health services included in the package of Comprehensive Primary Health Care.
Furthermore, the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), implemented under the National Mental Health Programme, is operational in 767 districts across the country. This initiative focuses on early detection, management, and treatment of mental illnesses at the district hospital level. The DMHP extends its services to Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), offering outpatient care, counseling, psycho-social interventions, continuous support for severe mental disorders, medication, outreach services, and ambulance facilities.

Title: Parliament passes the Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:42:25 +0000
Content: The Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025, introduced by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 3, following its earlier approval in the Rajya Sabha. With both Houses clearing the legislation, this marks the second major aviation reform under his leadership. 
The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.
It builds on the framework of the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which sought to simplify and standardize international leasing agreements. Although India formally adopted this convention in 2008, gaps in legal enforcement led to higher leasing costs—typically 8 to 10 percent higher than in other nations. This legislation aims to address those gaps, ensuring legal certainty for aircraft financiers and reducing costs for Indian carriers.
Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector. He pointed to concrete figures demonstrating this growth: between Independence and 2014, the total number of passengers flying annually in India stood at 10.38 crore. 
In just the next decade, that number more than doubled to 22.81 crore in 2024. Similarly, the number of airports in India grew from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more set to be launched soon.
The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. He stated that no other country has witnessed such rapid aviation expansion in such a short period.
The bill is expected to streamline leasing processes, make India a more attractive destination for aviation investments, and improve the country’s compliance scores under the Cape Town Convention. These changes are essential for reducing airline costs and encouraging new entrants into the sector.
Discussions on the bill also touched upon broader challenges in the civil aviation sector, such as the high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational costs. The minister expressed concern over the variation in ATF tax across states and urged more states to follow the example of those who have reduced their rates. Lowering these taxes, he argued, would boost regional connectivity and reduce costs for passengers.
Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building. Plans are in place to generate 2.5 crore liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2025 and transition over 100 airports to renewable energy, underscoring India’s commitment to greener aviation. 
The sector also faces a growing demand for trained pilots, estimated at 30,000 to 34,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. The government is working on increasing the number of Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and issuing more commercial pilot licenses annually to meet this demand.

Title: Over 68 lakh cancer treatments provided, Rs. 13,000 crore spent under PM-JAY: government outlines nationwide cancer care achievements
Publication Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:38:16 +0000
Content: In a significant move to combat the growing burden of cancer in India, the Government has implemented a series of robust measures aimed at the detection, prevention, and treatment of the disease. According to an official statement released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday, these steps are being taken through both technical and financial support to States and Union Territories under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), which operates under the National Health Mission (NHM).
As part of the initiative, a network of 770 District NCD Clinics, 233 Cardiac Care Units, 372 District Day Care Centres, and 6,410 NCD clinics at Community Health Centres has been established across the country. A population-based screening and management programme for common non-communicable diseases—including oral, breast, and cervical cancers—has also been rolled out under Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, with a focus on providing services in rural and underserved regions.
To strengthen tertiary care, the government has set up 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centres in various states. Additionally, all 22 newly established AIIMS are equipped with cancer treatment facilities, offering comprehensive diagnostic, medical, and surgical services. The National Cancer Institute in Jhajjar, with 1,460 beds, and the second campus of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in Kolkata, with 460 beds, further augment the country’s capacity for super-specialty cancer care.
In parallel, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) continues to offer financial protection of Rs. 5 lakh per family annually for secondary and tertiary hospitalization to nearly 55 crore beneficiaries. Notably, the scheme has recently been expanded to cover all senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of income.
Cancer care features prominently in AB PM-JAY, with over 68 lakh treatments worth Rs.13,000 crore carried out under the scheme so far—of which more than 75% have benefited rural patients. Furthermore, targeted therapies have supported over 4.5 lakh treatments valued at over Rs. 985 crore, with more than 76% accessed by rural beneficiaries.
In a forward-looking move announced in the Union Budget 2025–26, the Government plans to set up 200 Day Care Cancer Centres (DCCCs) in district hospitals across the country during the financial year 2025–26, as part of a three-year roadmap. These centres will be established based on a detailed gap analysis of existing cancer care infrastructure, availability of trained personnel, and medical equipment. Districts with a high cancer burden and limited access to treatment will be prioritized, with strong referral linkages planned between the DCCCs, State Cancer Institutes, and Tertiary Care Centres to ensure a seamless continuum of care.

Title: Bracewell, Sears star as New Zealand complete 3-0 clean sweep over Pakistan
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:01:59 +0000
Content: New Zealand continued their dominance over Pakistan with a comprehensive 43-run win in the third ODI at Mount Maunganui, sealing a 3-0 series whitewash.
After a rain-delayed start, the match was curtailed to 42 overs per side. Hosts posted 264, thanks to impactful half-centuries from Michael Bracewell and youngster Rhys Mariu. Pakistan, despite several starts in the chase, folded for 221 as Ben Sears picked up another five-wicket haul.
Put in to bat after Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss for a third time in the series, New Zealand overcame early trouble with a series of steady partnerships. Mariu (58) and Henry Nicholls added 78 for the second wicket before captain Bracewell’s late assault – 59 off just 40 balls – lifted the total. He struck six sixes, five of them off Akif Javed, including three in the final two overs to provide the late flourish.
Pakistan’s chase never got going. Imam-ul-Haq was stretchered off early after suffering a freak injury when a throw stuck in his helmet grill. Usman Khan replaced him as a concussion substitute, but the innings lacked fluency. Abdullah Shafique (33) and Babar Azam (50) provided some resistance, but their slow pace left Pakistan behind the scoring rate. Sears removed Shafique and later returned to rip through the lower order, finishing with 5 for 34.
Bracewell added a stunning diving catch to his tally, while Duffy and O’Rourke kept things tight throughout. Rizwan’s quick 37 was the only real burst of momentum for Pakistan, but it fizzled out as the wickets kept tumbling.
Brief scores: New Zealand 264/8 in 42 overs (Michael Bracewell 59, Rhys Mariu 58; Akif Javed 4-62, Naseem Shah 2-54) beat Pakistan 221 all out in 40 overs (Babar Azam 50, Mohammad Rizwan 37; Ben Sears 5-34, Jacob Duffy 2-40) by 43 runs.

His work in championing the rights of the oppressed and his significant political roles, including as the Defence Minister during the 1971 India-Pakistan war and later as Deputy Prime Minister from 1977 to 1979, solidified his place in Indian history.
His legacy as a leader who fought for social justice and national unity continues to inspire generations.

Title: US starts collecting Trump’s new 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:47:55 +0000
Content: U.S. customs agents began collecting President Donald Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday, with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week.
The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at U.S. seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT), ushering in Trump’s full rejection of the post-World War Two system of mutually agreed tariff rates.
“This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trump’s first term.
Shaw told a Brookings Institution event on Thursday that she expected the tariffs to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates. “But this is huge. This is a pretty seismic and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on earth,” she added.
Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement shook global stock markets to their core, wiping out $5 trillion in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday’s close, a record two-day decline. Prices for oil and commodities plunged, while investors fled to the safety of government bonds.
Among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin to shippers indicates no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday.
But a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin did provide a 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded onto vessels or planes and in transit to the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday. These cargoes need arrive to by 12:01 a.m. ET on May 27 to avoid the 10% duty.
At the same hour on Wednesday, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% are due to take effect. European Union imports will be hit with a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff, bringing Trump’s total new levies on China to 54%.
Vietnam, which benefited from the shift of U.S. supply chains away from China after Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing, will be hit with a 46% tariff and agreed on Friday to discuss a deal with Trump.
Canada and Mexico were exempt from both Trump’s latest duties because they are still subject to a 25% tariff related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis for goods that do not comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada rules of origin.
Trump is excluding goods subject to separate, 25% national security tariffs, including steel and aluminum, cars, trucks and auto parts.
His administration also released a list of more than 1,000 product categories exempted from the tariffs. Valued at $645 billion in 2024 imports, these include crude oil, petroleum products and other energy imports, pharmaceuticals, uranium, titanium, lumber and semiconductors and copper. Except for energy, the Trump administration is investigating several of these sectors for further national security tariffs.

Title: PM Modi holds talks with Lankan Prez Dissanayake in Colombo; Defence pact on agenda
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:55:07 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held bilateral talks with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Colombo, aimed at bolstering the strategic and developmental partnership between the two neighbours.
The discussions are expected to be on a shared road map for mutual prosperity and regional cooperation under the “Joint Vision for Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future,” first adopted during President Dissanayake’s visit to India in December last year.
During the wide-ranging discussions, both sides are expected to have reviewed progress on key joint initiatives and agreed to further enhance cooperation in critical sectors, including energy connectivity, digitisation, Defence, health, and multisectoral grant assistance.
Several agreements in these areas are expected to be signed in the presence of the two leaders.
In addition to his official engagements, PM Modi is also scheduled to interact with senior political figures and dignitaries of Sri Lanka during his visit.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at Colombo’s Independence Square, which the Ministry of External Affairs described as “special” — marking the first time Sri Lanka has hosted such an event for a visiting foreign leader.
This is PM Modi’s fourth visit to the island nation since 2014 and his first since Dissanayake assumed office.
The ceremonial event was attended by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and several key members of the Cabinet.
PM Modi arrived in Colombo late Friday from Bangkok after attending the 6th BIMSTEC Summit. His current visit comes at the invitation of President Dissanayake, extended during his maiden trip to India last year.
Despite heavy rain in the capital, hundreds of Sri Lankans and members of the Indian diaspora turned out to greet PM Modi with enthusiasm, lining the route from Bandaranaike International Airport to his hotel.
At the airport, the Prime Minister was welcomed by several top Lankan ministers, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, Labour Minister Anil Jayantha, Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Science and Technology Minister Chrishantha Abeysena.
Soon after landing, PM Modi posted on X: “Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programmes in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka has termed Dissanayake’s December visit to India as a “watershed moment” in its relationship with New Delhi. PM Modi now becomes the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new Sri Lankan President — a symbolic gesture underscoring the importance both nations place on their bilateral ties.
On Sunday, PM Modi will travel with President Dissanayake to Anuradhapura for the inauguration of development projects supported by Indian financial assistance.
The two leaders will also visit the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex, which holds deep cultural and spiritual significance in India-Sri Lanka relations. PM Modi had visited the temple during his 2015 tour and again in 2019.
Among the major issues expected to be addressed during the visit are the long-standing concerns surrounding Indian fishermen. Discussions will focus on the early release and repatriation of detained Indian fishermen and their boats.
The Indian government has repeatedly highlighted its commitment to ensuring the safety and welfare of Indian fishermen and has consistently raised the matter through diplomatic and bilateral channels.
PM Modi’s visit is seen as an extension of India’s Neighbourhood First policy — an initiative focussed on strengthening ties and trust with South Asian neighbours. The Prime Minister is scheduled to conclude his visit and return to New Delhi on April 6.

Title: Sri Lanka confers its highest honour for global leaders on PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:50:30 +0000
Content: In a grand recognition of his efforts to strengthen India-Sri Lanka ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Saturday conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana, the island nation’s highest civilian honour for Heads of State and Government.
The prestigious award was presented by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during a joint press briefing in Colombo.
Instituted specifically to honour global leaders of nations maintaining friendly relations with Sri Lanka, the award reflects a deep appreciation of their solidarity and goodwill towards the Sri Lankan people.
“I am pleased to announce that the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to confer upon PM Modi the highest Sri Lanka honour — Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana,” President Dissanayake said.
“Prime Minister Modi highly deserves this honour. This is what we firmly believe,” he added.
In his remarks, PM Modi expressed deep gratitude, saying the honour was not just a personal recognition but one for 140 crore Indians.
“To be honoured with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan award by President Dissanayake is not just an honour to me but to 140 crore Indians… I thank the President, the government of Sri Lanka, and the people here,” he said.
PM Modi added that the honour stands as a testament to the long-standing relationship and deep-rooted friendship between the two neighbouring nations.
The Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana medal, specially designed to recognise extraordinary friendships on the global stage, symbolises the shared spiritual and cultural heritage of both countries.
The Dharma Chakra represents their common Buddhist legacy, while the Pun Kalasa — a ceremonial vessel with rice sheaves — signifies prosperity and renewal. The Navarathna, or nine precious gems within a lotus-encircled globe, epitomises the enduring India-Sri Lanka bond.
This award marks the 22nd international recognition bestowed on PM Modi by a foreign country, underlining his growing stature as a global statesman committed to regional peace, development, and spiritual diplomacy.
President Dissanayake, hailing India and Sri Lanka’s ties, said, “Sri Lanka and India share more than just geographical proximity. We have similar aspirations as governments, and we deeply appreciate all these engagements, which we consider to be of historic significance.”
He emphasised the strong cultural and historical foundation of the relationship, adding, “We are neighbours with deep historical, religious and cultural ties that go back over a long period of time and our time-tested relationship is built on shared values, mutual respect and common interests.”
Highlighting cooperation across sectors, both leaders virtually inaugurated several key bilateral projects, including the Sampur Solar Power Project and a Temperature-Controlled Agriculture Warehouse in Dambulla.
A series of Memoranda of Understanding were also exchanged to deepen collaboration in areas such as energy, digital transformation, and trilateral cooperation.
Among the key MoUs exchanged were the implementation of HVDC interconnection for power import/export, the sharing of successful digital solutions for digital transformation, trilateral MoU between India, Sri Lanka and the UAE for developing Trincomalee as an energy hub.
India’s financial assistance to Sri Lanka continues to make a significant impact, reaching all 25 districts of the island nation.
The cumulative financial aid extended by India, including emergency support, totals approximately $7 billion, with grant assistance accounting for $780 million. Over the past decade, more than 40 developmental projects have been completed under grants totalling nearly $265 million.
Indian investments also play a vital role in Sri Lanka’s economic landscape, with the overall investment portfolio surpassing $2 billion.
The conferring of the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana award comes as a powerful symbol of shared destinies, spiritual kinship, and a vision for progress rooted in mutual respect and trust between the two nations.

Title: Will continue to strengthen maritime sector, ports: PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:47:17 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the government will continue to strengthen the country’s maritime sector and ports, which play a crucial role in driving India’s progress and prosperity.
In his message to mark the National Maritime Day, PM Modi said, “We recall India’s rich maritime history and the role played by this sector in nation-building. “
The Prime Minister said India was a recognised sea power in earlier times, but the maritime sector was ignored in the period after independence.
However, during the last 10 years New India has achieved several new milestones in the maritime sector and the Government is continuously working to strengthen the country’s maritime ecosystem.
PM Modi pointed out that the cargo handling capacity of the country’s major ports has been doubled over the last 10 years and thousands of kilometres of new roads have been constructed to improve connectivity to ports.
The Prime Minister further stated the government’s mantra of “ports for prosperity and ports for progress” has brought about huge changes in the maritime sector. In addition the new mantra of “ports for productivity” has also been taken forward for the development of maritime infrastructure, he added.
PM Modi highlighted that the government was taking further steps to develop coastal shipping. The statement came in the backdrop of the ‘Coastal Shipping Bill’ approved by the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
The Bill seeks to regulate vessels engaged in trade within Indian coastal waters. The bill aims to consolidate and amend the law relating to regulation of coastal shipping, promote coastal trade and encourage domestic participation. This Bill will ensure that India is equipped with a coastal fleet, owned and operated by the citizens of the country for its national security and commercial needs.
The Prime Minister further stated that the inland waterways of the country were also being developed as part of the strategy to strengthen India’s maritime sector.
PM Modi pointed out that history has shown whenever India’s maritime sector has been strong both the country and world have reaped benefits. Keeping this crucial fact in mind, the government is continuously working in a planned manner to strengthen the country’s maritime sector, he added.

Title: PM Modi accorded ceremonial welcome in Sri Lanka

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a grand ceremonial welcome at the Independence Square in Colombo on Saturday, as Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake hosted him during his State Visit to the island nation.
This marks PM Modi’s fourth visit to Sri Lanka since 2014 and his first since President Dissanayake assumed office.
The ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and key members of Dissanayake’s Cabinet.
PM Modi arrived in Colombo late on Saturday evening from Bangkok following his participation in the 6th BIMSTEC Summit. The invitation for the visit was extended by the Sri Lankan President during his maiden official trip to India in December last year.
Despite heavy rains, hundreds of Sri Lankans and members of the Indian diaspora lined the streets and gathered outside Bandaranaike International Airport and the hotel to greet the Indian leader with enthusiasm.
Welcoming him at the airport were top ministers from the Sri Lankan government, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, Labour Minister Anil Jayantha, Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Science and Technology Minister Chrishantha Abeysena.
Shortly after landing, PM Modi took to X and wrote, “Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programmes in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka considers Dissanayake’s State Visit to India last December a “watershed moment” in its bilateral ties with New Delhi.
PM Modi now becomes the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new President, further cementing the deep diplomatic bond shared by the two countries.
Ahead of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri underscored the importance of the India-Sri Lanka partnership.
“The India-Sri Lanka relationship is deeply rooted in civilisational links, shared history, religion, culture, and strong people-to-people ties. In the modern era, it has evolved into a close economic, cultural, and technical partnership. Sri Lanka is an integral part of our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, and this relationship, built on mutual trust and goodwill, has stood the test of time,” he said.
Recalling India’s swift assistance during Sri Lanka’s economic crisis in 2022, Misri said, “India was glad to be able to play a key role in the economic stabilisation and recovery of the country, thereby demonstrating its commitment as a dependable neighbour and as a first responder to any crisis in the region.”
Prime Minister Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with President Dissanayake, reviewing progress on joint initiatives outlined in the “Joint Vision for Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future” adopted during the President’s December visit to India.
Several bilateral agreements across sectors, such as energy connectivity, digitisation, defence, health, and multisectoral grant assistance, are expected to be signed in the presence of both leaders.
In addition to his official meetings, Prime Minister Modi will engage with senior political leaders and other dignitaries of Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, he will accompany President Dissanayake to Anuradhapura to inaugurate development projects supported by Indian financial assistance.
The two leaders will also visit the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex, an iconic site symbolising the civilisational ties between the two countries. PM Modi had previously paid homage at the temple during his 2015 visit and later revisited Sri Lanka in 2019.
The ongoing visit will also cover discussions on long-pending issues related to Indian fishermen. Both leaders are expected to address matters concerning the early release and repatriation of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats.
The Indian government has consistently maintained that the safety, security, and welfare of Indian fishermen are of the highest priority and has pursued the matter with Sri Lankan authorities through diplomatic channels and bilateral mechanisms.
“The Prime Minister has raised this matter in all recent interactions, including the December 16, 2024, meeting with the Sri Lankan President,” Foreign Secretary Misri noted.
He also highlighted the historical background of the issue, tracing it to maritime boundary arrangements agreed upon in the 1970s between both nations.
“We have repeatedly requested the Sri Lankan Government to treat the fishermen issue as a humanitarian and livelihood concern without using force under any circumstances,” Misri added.
The Prime Minister’s current visit is seen as a continuation of India’s sustained outreach to its neighbours under the Neighbourhood First policy, aimed at fostering greater cooperation, connectivity, and mutual respect across South Asia. He is scheduled to return to New Delhi on April 6.

Title: SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin clinch $13.5 billion-dollar Pentagon launch contracts
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:30:04 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX, United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin on Friday won U.S. Space Force rocket launch contracts worth a combined $13.5 billion through 2029 to send some of the Pentagon’s most sensitive and complex satellites into space.
The Space Force’s flagship National Security Space Launch procurement program will assign roughly 54 missions through 2029 in incremental task orders, according to its Space Systems Command office.
SpaceX, awarded 28 of the missions, won $5.9 billion. ULA, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed won $5.3 billion for 19 missions. Blue Origin got seven missions worth a combined $2.3 billion, with those planned for launch in a later year.
Reuters earlier reported SpaceX and ULA were tapped for the awards.
The program, the most competitive and lucrative U.S. launch effort, effectively affirms the companies as the most capable American rocket providers, though Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has launched once in January and has less experience than SpaceX’s and ULA’s rockets.
SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 rocket, is the world’s most active launch company. It has launched dozens of military space missions in recent years. The company said it will use Falcon 9 and its more powerful Falcon Heavy – three Falcon cores strapped together – for the Phase 3 missions.
ULA’s new Vulcan rocket had its first two launches last year. The Pentagon certified Vulcan for national security missions this month after months of review into a mishap with its solid rocket motors during one of its flights.
The awards are part of the Phase 3 program’s “Lane 2” track. That track contains the Pentagon’s most difficult and expensive missions, involving a variety of complex orbits around Earth, for which only the top U.S. launch companies with the most experience are to compete.
SpaceX, according to two people familiar with the plans, will get a vast majority of the missions ordered by the Space Force in the first year of the program. The company’s launch rate with Falcon 9 is far greater than ULA and Blue Origin’s.
SpaceX CEO, Musk, a special government employee and close ally of President Donald Trump, has wielded enormous influence over the U.S. government, from slashing federal agencies in his government efficiency effort to pushingallies to lead federal agencies that oversee billions of dollars’ worth of SpaceX government contracts.
Friday’s awards have been years in the making. It is a third phase of a program governing how the U.S. Defense Department purchases rides to space for its military and intelligence satellites, a lucrative area of government procurement once dominated by the Boeing and Lockheed Martinjoint venture, United Launch Alliance.
SpaceX has risen in the past decade to become a dominant launch player. Its reusable Falcon 9 rockets offer a cost-cutting capability its rivals have been slower to match, making the company a key vendor for the Pentagon, which is also increasingly reliant on the company for satellite-based military intelligence.
In an earlier phase of the national security launch program, Phase 2, SpaceX won 40% of the missions while ULA got 60%, representing over $6 billion in missions combined.
Some missions originally assigned to ULA under Phase 2 had to be transferred to SpaceX over development delays with ULA’s Vulcan rocket, which had frustrated Pentagon officials.
“We are very pleased to be awarded 40 percent of the Phase 3 procurement,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno said in a statement. “Vulcan is the right choice for critical national security space missions and is the only rocket today designed to meet all the requirements of our nation’s space launch needs.”
With SpaceX emerging as a dominant winner in the program, Musk nonetheless took a jab at SpaceX’s rivals on X, his social media platform.
“Winning 60% of the missions may sound generous, but the reality is that all SpaceX competitors combined cannot currently deliver the other 40%! I hope they succeed, but they aren’t there yet,” he said.

Content: Marking a significant milestone, the Stand-Up India Scheme has completed seven years since its launch on April 5, 2016. Initiated by the Ministry of Finance under the banner of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the scheme was designed to empower Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and women entrepreneurs by facilitating bank loans for setting up new enterprises.
Over the years, the Stand-Up India Scheme has evolved from a funding initiative into a transformative movement that has nurtured entrepreneurial dreams, generated employment, and contributed to inclusive economic growth. Since its inception, the scheme has seen a steady increase in sanctioned loan amounts—from Rs. 16,085.07 crore as of March 31, 2019, to a remarkable Rs. 61,020.41 crore by March 17, 2025. This growth underscores the expanding outreach and impact of the scheme across the nation.
Between March 2018 and March 2024, the scheme registered substantial growth in financial empowerment across its target groups. The number of SC loan accounts surged from 9,399 to 46,248, with the loan amount increasing from Rs. 1,826.21 crore to Rs. 9,747.11 crore. For ST beneficiaries, the number of accounts rose from 2,841 to 15,228, with sanctioned loans jumping from Rs. 574.65 crore to Rs. 3,244.07 crore. Women entrepreneurs witnessed the most significant growth during this period. Their accounts increased from 55,644 to 1,90,844, while the sanctioned amount grew from Rs. 12,452.37 crore to Rs. 43,984.10 crore.

Title: Bracewell, Sears star as New Zealand complete 3-0 clean sweep over Pakistan
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:01:59 +0000
Content: New Zealand continued their dominance over Pakistan with a comprehensive 43-run win in the third ODI at Mount Maunganui, sealing a 3-0 series whitewash.
After a rain-delayed start, the match was curtailed to 42 overs per side. Hosts posted 264, thanks to impactful half-centuries from Michael Bracewell and youngster Rhys Mariu. Pakistan, despite several starts in the chase, folded for 221 as Ben Sears picked up another five-wicket haul.
Put in to bat after Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss for a third time in the series, New Zealand overcame early trouble with a series of steady partnerships. Mariu (58) and Henry Nicholls added 78 for the second wicket before captain Bracewell’s late assault – 59 off just 40 balls – lifted the total. He struck six sixes, five of them off Akif Javed, including three in the final two overs to provide the late flourish.
Pakistan’s chase never got going. Imam-ul-Haq was stretchered off early after suffering a freak injury when a throw stuck in his helmet grill. Usman Khan replaced him as a concussion substitute, but the innings lacked fluency. Abdullah Shafique (33) and Babar Azam (50) provided some resistance, but their slow pace left Pakistan behind the scoring rate. Sears removed Shafique and later returned to rip through the lower order, finishing with 5 for 34.
Bracewell added a stunning diving catch to his tally, while Duffy and O’Rourke kept things tight throughout. Rizwan’s quick 37 was the only real burst of momentum for Pakistan, but it fizzled out as the wickets kept tumbling.
Brief scores: New Zealand 264/8 in 42 overs (Michael Bracewell 59, Rhys Mariu 58; Akif Javed 4-62, Naseem Shah 2-54) beat Pakistan 221 all out in 40 overs (Babar Azam 50, Mohammad Rizwan 37; Ben Sears 5-34, Jacob Duffy 2-40) by 43 runs.

Title: PM Modi pays tribute to Babu Jagjivan Ram on his birth anniversary
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:52:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid heartfelt tributes to Babu Jagjivan Ram, the former Deputy Prime Minister of India, on the occasion of his birth anniversary.
Taking to the social media platform X, PM Modi expressed admiration for Jagjivan Ram’s tireless efforts in fighting for the rights of the underprivileged and his contributions to the nation’s progress.
In his post on X, PM Modi wrote, “Respectful tributes to former Deputy Prime Minister of the country Babu Jagjivan Ram on his birth anniversary. His lifelong struggle for the rights of the deprived and the oppressed will always remain a source of inspiration.”
In a video message shared on the same platform, the Prime Minister highlighted the immense legacy of Babu Jagjivan Ram.
“He dedicated his life to the betterment of the poor and spent many years in the service of the nation,” PM Modi said. He also recalled Jagjivan Ram’s significant role during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, stating, “Thakur Jagjivan Ram wanted two things, a strong India and a democratic India. When we strongly retaliated against Pakistan, Thakur Ji was the Defence Minister of India.”
The Prime Minister further added that Jagjivan Ram was the first Congress leader to raise his voice against the Emergency.
“During those difficult days, when people were getting arrested, he emerged as a voice of strength and encouraged people not to fear,” PM Modi said. He concluded his tribute by paying his respects to the leader on his birth anniversary.
Earlier in the day, Telangana Chief Minister K. Revanth Reddy also paid tribute to the legendary leader, acknowledging Jagjivan Ram’s unparalleled service to the nation.
The CM remarked, “Babuji was born in a poor family and rose to the highest position with his unwavering dedication.”
Babu Jagjivan Ram, widely known as Babuji, was one of India’s most prominent Dalit icons.
His work in championing the rights of the oppressed and his significant political roles, including as the Defence Minister during the 1971 India-Pakistan war and later as Deputy Prime Minister from 1977 to 1979, solidified his place in Indian history.
His legacy as a leader who fought for social justice and national unity continues to inspire generations.

Title: US starts collecting Trump’s new 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:47:55 +0000
Content: U.S. customs agents began collecting President Donald Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday, with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week.
The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at U.S. seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT), ushering in Trump’s full rejection of the post-World War Two system of mutually agreed tariff rates.
“This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trump’s first term.
Shaw told a Brookings Institution event on Thursday that she expected the tariffs to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates. “But this is huge. This is a pretty seismic and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on earth,” she added.
Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement shook global stock markets to their core, wiping out $5 trillion in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday’s close, a record two-day decline. Prices for oil and commodities plunged, while investors fled to the safety of government bonds.
Among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin to shippers indicates no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday.
But a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin did provide a 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded onto vessels or planes and in transit to the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday. These cargoes need arrive to by 12:01 a.m. ET on May 27 to avoid the 10% duty.
At the same hour on Wednesday, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% are due to take effect. European Union imports will be hit with a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff, bringing Trump’s total new levies on China to 54%.
Vietnam, which benefited from the shift of U.S. supply chains away from China after Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing, will be hit with a 46% tariff and agreed on Friday to discuss a deal with Trump.
Canada and Mexico were exempt from both Trump’s latest duties because they are still subject to a 25% tariff related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis for goods that do not comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada rules of origin.
Trump is excluding goods subject to separate, 25% national security tariffs, including steel and aluminum, cars, trucks and auto parts.
His administration also released a list of more than 1,000 product categories exempted from the tariffs. Valued at $645 billion in 2024 imports, these include crude oil, petroleum products and other energy imports, pharmaceuticals, uranium, titanium, lumber and semiconductors and copper. Except for energy, the Trump administration is investigating several of these sectors for further national security tariffs.

Title: PM Modi holds talks with Lankan Prez Dissanayake in Colombo; Defence pact on agenda
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:55:07 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held bilateral talks with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Colombo, aimed at bolstering the strategic and developmental partnership between the two neighbours.
The discussions are expected to be on a shared road map for mutual prosperity and regional cooperation under the “Joint Vision for Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future,” first adopted during President Dissanayake’s visit to India in December last year.
During the wide-ranging discussions, both sides are expected to have reviewed progress on key joint initiatives and agreed to further enhance cooperation in critical sectors, including energy connectivity, digitisation, Defence, health, and multisectoral grant assistance.
Several agreements in these areas are expected to be signed in the presence of the two leaders.
In addition to his official engagements, PM Modi is also scheduled to interact with senior political figures and dignitaries of Sri Lanka during his visit.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at Colombo’s Independence Square, which the Ministry of External Affairs described as “special” — marking the first time Sri Lanka has hosted such an event for a visiting foreign leader.
This is PM Modi’s fourth visit to the island nation since 2014 and his first since Dissanayake assumed office.
The ceremonial event was attended by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and several key members of the Cabinet.
PM Modi arrived in Colombo late Friday from Bangkok after attending the 6th BIMSTEC Summit. His current visit comes at the invitation of President Dissanayake, extended during his maiden trip to India last year.
Despite heavy rain in the capital, hundreds of Sri Lankans and members of the Indian diaspora turned out to greet PM Modi with enthusiasm, lining the route from Bandaranaike International Airport to his hotel.
At the airport, the Prime Minister was welcomed by several top Lankan ministers, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, Labour Minister Anil Jayantha, Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Science and Technology Minister Chrishantha Abeysena.
Soon after landing, PM Modi posted on X: “Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programmes in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka has termed Dissanayake’s December visit to India as a “watershed moment” in its relationship with New Delhi. PM Modi now becomes the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new Sri Lankan President — a symbolic gesture underscoring the importance both nations place on their bilateral ties.
On Sunday, PM Modi will travel with President Dissanayake to Anuradhapura for the inauguration of development projects supported by Indian financial assistance.
The two leaders will also visit the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex, which holds deep cultural and spiritual significance in India-Sri Lanka relations. PM Modi had visited the temple during his 2015 tour and again in 2019.
Among the major issues expected to be addressed during the visit are the long-standing concerns surrounding Indian fishermen. Discussions will focus on the early release and repatriation of detained Indian fishermen and their boats.
The Indian government has repeatedly highlighted its commitment to ensuring the safety and welfare of Indian fishermen and has consistently raised the matter through diplomatic and bilateral channels.
PM Modi’s visit is seen as an extension of India’s Neighbourhood First policy — an initiative focussed on strengthening ties and trust with South Asian neighbours. The Prime Minister is scheduled to conclude his visit and return to New Delhi on April 6.

Title: Sri Lanka confers its highest honour for global leaders on PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:50:30 +0000
Content: In a grand recognition of his efforts to strengthen India-Sri Lanka ties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Saturday conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana, the island nation’s highest civilian honour for Heads of State and Government.
The prestigious award was presented by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during a joint press briefing in Colombo.
Instituted specifically to honour global leaders of nations maintaining friendly relations with Sri Lanka, the award reflects a deep appreciation of their solidarity and goodwill towards the Sri Lankan people.
“I am pleased to announce that the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to confer upon PM Modi the highest Sri Lanka honour — Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana,” President Dissanayake said.
“Prime Minister Modi highly deserves this honour. This is what we firmly believe,” he added.
In his remarks, PM Modi expressed deep gratitude, saying the honour was not just a personal recognition but one for 140 crore Indians.
“To be honoured with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan award by President Dissanayake is not just an honour to me but to 140 crore Indians… I thank the President, the government of Sri Lanka, and the people here,” he said.
PM Modi added that the honour stands as a testament to the long-standing relationship and deep-rooted friendship between the two neighbouring nations.
The Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana medal, specially designed to recognise extraordinary friendships on the global stage, symbolises the shared spiritual and cultural heritage of both countries.
The Dharma Chakra represents their common Buddhist legacy, while the Pun Kalasa — a ceremonial vessel with rice sheaves — signifies prosperity and renewal. The Navarathna, or nine precious gems within a lotus-encircled globe, epitomises the enduring India-Sri Lanka bond.
This award marks the 22nd international recognition bestowed on PM Modi by a foreign country, underlining his growing stature as a global statesman committed to regional peace, development, and spiritual diplomacy.
President Dissanayake, hailing India and Sri Lanka’s ties, said, “Sri Lanka and India share more than just geographical proximity. We have similar aspirations as governments, and we deeply appreciate all these engagements, which we consider to be of historic significance.”
He emphasised the strong cultural and historical foundation of the relationship, adding, “We are neighbours with deep historical, religious and cultural ties that go back over a long period of time and our time-tested relationship is built on shared values, mutual respect and common interests.”
Highlighting cooperation across sectors, both leaders virtually inaugurated several key bilateral projects, including the Sampur Solar Power Project and a Temperature-Controlled Agriculture Warehouse in Dambulla.
A series of Memoranda of Understanding were also exchanged to deepen collaboration in areas such as energy, digital transformation, and trilateral cooperation.
Among the key MoUs exchanged were the implementation of HVDC interconnection for power import/export, the sharing of successful digital solutions for digital transformation, trilateral MoU between India, Sri Lanka and the UAE for developing Trincomalee as an energy hub.
India’s financial assistance to Sri Lanka continues to make a significant impact, reaching all 25 districts of the island nation.
The cumulative financial aid extended by India, including emergency support, totals approximately $7 billion, with grant assistance accounting for $780 million. Over the past decade, more than 40 developmental projects have been completed under grants totalling nearly $265 million.
Indian investments also play a vital role in Sri Lanka’s economic landscape, with the overall investment portfolio surpassing $2 billion.
The conferring of the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana award comes as a powerful symbol of shared destinies, spiritual kinship, and a vision for progress rooted in mutual respect and trust between the two nations.

Title: Will continue to strengthen maritime sector, ports: PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 07:47:17 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the government will continue to strengthen the country’s maritime sector and ports, which play a crucial role in driving India’s progress and prosperity.
In his message to mark the National Maritime Day, PM Modi said, “We recall India’s rich maritime history and the role played by this sector in nation-building. “
The Prime Minister said India was a recognised sea power in earlier times, but the maritime sector was ignored in the period after independence.
However, during the last 10 years New India has achieved several new milestones in the maritime sector and the Government is continuously working to strengthen the country’s maritime ecosystem.
PM Modi pointed out that the cargo handling capacity of the country’s major ports has been doubled over the last 10 years and thousands of kilometres of new roads have been constructed to improve connectivity to ports.
The Prime Minister further stated the government’s mantra of “ports for prosperity and ports for progress” has brought about huge changes in the maritime sector. In addition the new mantra of “ports for productivity” has also been taken forward for the development of maritime infrastructure, he added.
PM Modi highlighted that the government was taking further steps to develop coastal shipping. The statement came in the backdrop of the ‘Coastal Shipping Bill’ approved by the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
The Bill seeks to regulate vessels engaged in trade within Indian coastal waters. The bill aims to consolidate and amend the law relating to regulation of coastal shipping, promote coastal trade and encourage domestic participation. This Bill will ensure that India is equipped with a coastal fleet, owned and operated by the citizens of the country for its national security and commercial needs.
The Prime Minister further stated that the inland waterways of the country were also being developed as part of the strategy to strengthen India’s maritime sector.
PM Modi pointed out that history has shown whenever India’s maritime sector has been strong both the country and world have reaped benefits. Keeping this crucial fact in mind, the government is continuously working in a planned manner to strengthen the country’s maritime sector, he added.

Title: PM Modi accorded ceremonial welcome in Sri Lanka
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:38:22 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a grand ceremonial welcome at the Independence Square in Colombo on Saturday, as Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake hosted him during his State Visit to the island nation.
This marks PM Modi’s fourth visit to Sri Lanka since 2014 and his first since President Dissanayake assumed office.
The ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and key members of Dissanayake’s Cabinet.
PM Modi arrived in Colombo late on Saturday evening from Bangkok following his participation in the 6th BIMSTEC Summit. The invitation for the visit was extended by the Sri Lankan President during his maiden official trip to India in December last year.
Despite heavy rains, hundreds of Sri Lankans and members of the Indian diaspora lined the streets and gathered outside Bandaranaike International Airport and the hotel to greet the Indian leader with enthusiasm.
Welcoming him at the airport were top ministers from the Sri Lankan government, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, Labour Minister Anil Jayantha, Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Women and Child Affairs Minister Saroja Savithri Paulraj, and Science and Technology Minister Chrishantha Abeysena.
Shortly after landing, PM Modi took to X and wrote, “Landed in Colombo. Grateful to the ministers and dignitaries who welcomed me at the airport. Looking forward to the programmes in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka considers Dissanayake’s State Visit to India last December a “watershed moment” in its bilateral ties with New Delhi.
PM Modi now becomes the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new President, further cementing the deep diplomatic bond shared by the two countries.
Ahead of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri underscored the importance of the India-Sri Lanka partnership.
“The India-Sri Lanka relationship is deeply rooted in civilisational links, shared history, religion, culture, and strong people-to-people ties. In the modern era, it has evolved into a close economic, cultural, and technical partnership. Sri Lanka is an integral part of our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, and this relationship, built on mutual trust and goodwill, has stood the test of time,” he said.
Recalling India’s swift assistance during Sri Lanka’s economic crisis in 2022, Misri said, “India was glad to be able to play a key role in the economic stabilisation and recovery of the country, thereby demonstrating its commitment as a dependable neighbour and as a first responder to any crisis in the region.”
Prime Minister Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with President Dissanayake, reviewing progress on joint initiatives outlined in the “Joint Vision for Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future” adopted during the President’s December visit to India.
Several bilateral agreements across sectors, such as energy connectivity, digitisation, defence, health, and multisectoral grant assistance, are expected to be signed in the presence of both leaders.
In addition to his official meetings, Prime Minister Modi will engage with senior political leaders and other dignitaries of Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, he will accompany President Dissanayake to Anuradhapura to inaugurate development projects supported by Indian financial assistance.
The two leaders will also visit the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple complex, an iconic site symbolising the civilisational ties between the two countries. PM Modi had previously paid homage at the temple during his 2015 visit and later revisited Sri Lanka in 2019.
The ongoing visit will also cover discussions on long-pending issues related to Indian fishermen. Both leaders are expected to address matters concerning the early release and repatriation of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats.
The Indian government has consistently maintained that the safety, security, and welfare of Indian fishermen are of the highest priority and has pursued the matter with Sri Lankan authorities through diplomatic channels and bilateral mechanisms.
“The Prime Minister has raised this matter in all recent interactions, including the December 16, 2024, meeting with the Sri Lankan President,” Foreign Secretary Misri noted.
He also highlighted the historical background of the issue, tracing it to maritime boundary arrangements agreed upon in the 1970s between both nations.
“We have repeatedly requested the Sri Lankan Government to treat the fishermen issue as a humanitarian and livelihood concern without using force under any circumstances,” Misri added.
The Prime Minister’s current visit is seen as a continuation of India’s sustained outreach to its neighbours under the Neighbourhood First policy, aimed at fostering greater cooperation, connectivity, and mutual respect across South Asia. He is scheduled to return to New Delhi on April 6.

Title: SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin clinch $13.5 billion-dollar Pentagon launch contracts
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 05:30:04 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX, United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin on Friday won U.S. Space Force rocket launch contracts worth a combined $13.5 billion through 2029 to send some of the Pentagon’s most sensitive and complex satellites into space.
The Space Force’s flagship National Security Space Launch procurement program will assign roughly 54 missions through 2029 in incremental task orders, according to its Space Systems Command office.
SpaceX, awarded 28 of the missions, won $5.9 billion. ULA, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed won $5.3 billion for 19 missions. Blue Origin got seven missions worth a combined $2.3 billion, with those planned for launch in a later year.
Reuters earlier reported SpaceX and ULA were tapped for the awards.
The program, the most competitive and lucrative U.S. launch effort, effectively affirms the companies as the most capable American rocket providers, though Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has launched once in January and has less experience than SpaceX’s and ULA’s rockets.
SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 rocket, is the world’s most active launch company. It has launched dozens of military space missions in recent years. The company said it will use Falcon 9 and its more powerful Falcon Heavy – three Falcon cores strapped together – for the Phase 3 missions.
ULA’s new Vulcan rocket had its first two launches last year. The Pentagon certified Vulcan for national security missions this month after months of review into a mishap with its solid rocket motors during one of its flights.
The awards are part of the Phase 3 program’s “Lane 2” track. That track contains the Pentagon’s most difficult and expensive missions, involving a variety of complex orbits around Earth, for which only the top U.S. launch companies with the most experience are to compete.
SpaceX, according to two people familiar with the plans, will get a vast majority of the missions ordered by the Space Force in the first year of the program. The company’s launch rate with Falcon 9 is far greater than ULA and Blue Origin’s.
SpaceX CEO, Musk, a special government employee and close ally of President Donald Trump, has wielded enormous influence over the U.S. government, from slashing federal agencies in his government efficiency effort to pushingallies to lead federal agencies that oversee billions of dollars’ worth of SpaceX government contracts.
Friday’s awards have been years in the making. It is a third phase of a program governing how the U.S. Defense Department purchases rides to space for its military and intelligence satellites, a lucrative area of government procurement once dominated by the Boeing and Lockheed Martinjoint venture, United Launch Alliance.
SpaceX has risen in the past decade to become a dominant launch player. Its reusable Falcon 9 rockets offer a cost-cutting capability its rivals have been slower to match, making the company a key vendor for the Pentagon, which is also increasingly reliant on the company for satellite-based military intelligence.
In an earlier phase of the national security launch program, Phase 2, SpaceX won 40% of the missions while ULA got 60%, representing over $6 billion in missions combined.
Some missions originally assigned to ULA under Phase 2 had to be transferred to SpaceX over development delays with ULA’s Vulcan rocket, which had frustrated Pentagon officials.
“We are very pleased to be awarded 40 percent of the Phase 3 procurement,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno said in a statement. “Vulcan is the right choice for critical national security space missions and is the only rocket today designed to meet all the requirements of our nation’s space launch needs.”
With SpaceX emerging as a dominant winner in the program, Musk nonetheless took a jab at SpaceX’s rivals on X, his social media platform.
“Winning 60% of the missions may sound generous, but the reality is that all SpaceX competitors combined cannot currently deliver the other 40%! I hope they succeed, but they aren’t there yet,” he said.

Title: PM Modi, Lankan President Dissanayake launch India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:16:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.

Title: India’s forex reserves rise to USD 665.4 billion, biggest jump in nearly five months: RBI
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 06:49:39 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves continued their upward momentum, rising by USD 6.596 billion to USD 665.396 billion as of March 28 — the highest weekly gain in nearly five months, as per RBI data.
This substantial increase is the highest in nearly five months, following a period of decline.  
According to RBI data, forex reserves have cumulatively increased by USD 20.1 billion over the past three weeks, with about USD 6.6 billion added in the latest reporting week. Experts attribute the earlier declines to shaken investor confidence in Indian equity markets.  
As of March 28, the data shows that gold reserves stood at USD 77.793 billion, while foreign currency assets were valued at USD 565.014 billion.  
During the same period, the Indian Rupee appreciated by 0.6 per cent against the US Dollar. This appreciation is seen as a sign of renewed foreign investment confidence in the Indian stock markets.  
Any decline in reserves is typically due to RBI interventions aimed at preventing sharp depreciation of the Rupee.  
Official estimates suggest that India’s current forex reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10 to 11 months of projected imports.  
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, compared to a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves increased by a little over USD 20 billion.  
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation’s central bank or monetary authority. These are primarily held in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.  
The RBI often intervenes in the currency market by managing liquidity—selling dollars to curb a weakening Rupee and buying dollars when the Rupee strengthens.

Title: It was a great honour meeting PM Modi, say Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup-winning cricketers
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:45:38 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday for an official visit and took time out of his busy schedule to meet the members of the 1996 ODI World Cup-winning Sri Lanka team.
“It was a great honour to meet him personally as the ’96 team. We talked about sports during 1996, how we won the World Cup, and how we beat India, as well as the future of Sri Lanka. It went really well.
“Honourable Prime Minister, I think, follows cricket. He knows everything as a leader, being the most powerful person in South Asia. His cricket knowledge is very good. He knows about cricket, talked about the 1996 World Cup, Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda (de Silva), and asked me about how we beat India,” said former left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas.
Opener Sanath Jayasuriya said meeting PM Modi was a great experience.
“It was a great meeting for us, the ’96 cricket team, to have a meeting with the honourable Prime Minister. We discussed a few things. We talked about our cricket, both past and present, what we’re going through at the moment, and what we’re doing currently.
“He talked about, in general, everything – how he took over and how he developed the country as a nation. We were discussing that. He explained everything about what he has done since 2014. So, it was a great meeting for us and a great experience, as some of the things he mentioned were new to us. The honourable Prime Minister explained everything about what he has done for India,” said Jayasuriya.
Jayasuriya’s opening partner, Romesh Kaluwitharana, said India, under PM Modi, has helped Sri Lanka a lot.
“Actually, I think from the time His Excellency came into power, he changed a lot of things. He’s done a lot of good for Sri Lanka as well. We are ever grateful to India. Especially in times of crisis, India has always been there for us. Also, particularly in cricket, whenever there’s a financial issue, they have always helped us with tours to get our feet on the ground,” said Kaluwitharana.
Former spinner and international umpire Kumara Dharmasena was excited after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said it was the first time he had seen a leader like him. Roshan Mahanama said meeting Prime Minister Modi was a “dream come true.”

Title: Important day to reiterate commitment towards Viksit Bharat: PM Modi on BJP’s ‘Sthapana Diwas’
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:19:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended heartfelt wishes to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and workers on the occasion of the party’s ‘Sthapana Diwas’ and expressed gratitude to those who, over the years, have dedicated themselves to the growth and strengthening of the party.
The BJP was formally established on April 6, 1980, during a workers’ convention held at Kotla Ground in New Delhi, where Atal Bihari Vajpayee was chosen as its first president.
Taking to X, PM Modi said, “Greetings to all BJP Karyakartas on the party’s Sthapana Diwas. We recall all those who devoted themselves to strengthening our party over the last several decades. This important day makes us reiterate our unparalleled commitment to work towards India’s progress and realize the dream of a Viksit Bharat.”
Reaffirming the government’s commitment to national development, he further added, “The people of India are witnessing the good governance agenda of our party, which is also reflected in the historic mandates we’ve received in the years gone by, whether in the Lok Sabha elections, Assembly elections across different states, or various local body polls across the nation.”
Highlighting the party’s approach to inclusive development, the Prime Minister said, “Our governments will continue serving society and ensuring all-round development.”
He also acknowledged the critical role of party workers in spreading the message of good governance at the grassroots level.
“My best wishes to all our hardworking Karyakartas, the backbone of our party, as they actively work on the ground and elaborate on our good governance agenda. I am proud of the manner in which our Karyakartas are working round the clock in every part of the nation, serving the poor, downtrodden, and marginalized. Their energy and enthusiasm are truly motivating,” the PM said.
The party’s roots, however, go deeper, tracing back to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951. The Jana Sangh was established as a counter-response to the dominance of the Indian National Congress and in collaboration with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Widely perceived as the political arm of the RSS, the Jana Sangh formed the ideological and organizational base upon which the BJP was eventually built.
Though formally launched in 1980, the BJP’s ideological foundation is deeply rooted in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. According to the party’s official website, the post-independence era saw growing discomfort among nationalist citizens, especially after the demise of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
With what the party, on its website, describes as “Nehru’s authoritarianism” gaining ground in the Congress, concerns arose over policies like minority appeasement, the license-permit-quota system, national security issues, and what was perceived as weak stances on Kashmir and other international matters.
“Frustrated by ‘Nehruism’ and India’s silence on the atrocities being committed on Hindu minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee resigned from the Nehru cabinet,” reads the BJP website.
It further notes, “As a result, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh was established on October 21, 1951, in Delhi’s Raghomal Arya Kanya High School under the chairmanship of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.”

Title: Massive protests erupt across U.S. against Trump and Musk’s government overhaul
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 03:29:19 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., and across the U.S. on Saturday, part of some 1,200 demonstrations that were expected to form the largest single day of protest against President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.
People streamed onto the expanse of grass surrounding the Washington Monument under gloomy skies and light rain. Organizers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend a rally at the National Mall.
Some 150 activist groups had signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests were planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.
Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among those who gathered by the stage beneath the Washington Monument.
She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”
The crowd around the memorial continued to build throughout the day. Some carried Ukrainian flags and others wore Palestinian keffiyeh scarves and carried “Free Palestine” signs, while Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives blasted Trump’s policies on stage.
Wayne Hoffman, 73, a retired money manager from West Cape May, New Jersey, said he was concerned about Trump’s economic policies, including his widespread use of tariffs.
“It’s going to cost the farmers in the red states. It’s going to cost people their jobs – certainly their 401Ks. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars,” Hoffman said.
Kyle, a 20-year-old intern from Ohio, was a lone Trump supporter, sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat and walking the fringe of the Washington, D.C., rally while engaging protesters in debate.
“Most people aren’t too hostile. A few people cuss,” said Kyle, who declined to give his last name.
Trump, who shook financial markets and upset nations around the world with a raft of trade tariffs this week, spent the day in Florida, playing a round of golf at his club in Jupiter before returning to his Mar-a-Lago compound in the afternoon.
Some four miles (6 km) from Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, more than 400 demonstrators gathered on a sunny day in protest. Drivers honked their horns in support of the pastel-and khaki-clad demonstrators as they passed by.
“Markets tank, Trump golfs,” read one sign.
At another protest in Stamford, Connecticut, Sue-ann Friedman, 84, brought a bright pink, handmade sign objecting to the administration’s moves to cut funding for medical research.
“I thought my marching days were over, and then we get somebody like Musk and Trump,” said Friedman.
Paul Kretschmann, a 74-year-old retired attorney in Stamford, said it was the first time he had ever attended a protest.
“My concern is that Social Security is going to be gutted, that we’re going to lose our benefits, and that there’s going to be nobody around to administer it in the first place,” he said. “I’m afraid that this is all part of a larger plan to dismantle the government and for Trump to maintain power.”
DOGE UNDER FIRE
With Trump’s blessing, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has scythed through the U.S. government, eliminating more than 200,000 jobs from the 2.3 million federal workforce. At times, the effort has been haphazard and forced the recall of needed specialists.
On Friday, the Internal Revenue Service began laying off more than 20,000 workers, as much as 25% of its ranks.
Several hundred people gathered outside the headquarters of the Social Security Administration, a top DOGE target, near Baltimore to protest against cuts to the agency which delivers benefits to the elderly and disabled.
Linda Falcao, who turns 65 in two months, told the crowd she had been paying into the Social Security fund since the age of 16.
“I’m terrified, I’m angry, I’m pissed, I’m bewildered this could happen to the United States,” she said. “I do love America and I’m heartbroken. I need my money. I want my money. I want my benefits!” The crowd chanted, “It’s our money!”
White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston disputed the protesters’ charge that Trump aimed to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
“President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors,” Huston said in an email.
Much of Trump’s agenda has been restrained by lawsuits contending he has overstepped his authority with attempts to fire civil servants, deport immigrants and reverse transgender rights.
Trump returned to office on January 20 with a stream of executive orders and other measures critics say are aligned with an agenda outlined by Project 2025, a deeply conservative political initiative to reshape government and consolidate presidential authority. His supporters have applauded Trump’s audacity as necessary to disrupt entrenched liberal interests.
Hours before the protests were due to kick off in the United States, hundreds of anti-Trump Americans living in Europe gathered in Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and London to voice opposition to Trump’s sweeping makeover of U.S. foreign and domestic policies.

Title: President Droupadi Murmu gives assent to Waqf Amendment Bill
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 02:53:11 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu has given her assent to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which was passed by Parliament during its budget session. The President also gave her assent to the Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, which was also passed by Parliament.
The Law Ministry issued notifications on Saturday saying that the President has given her assent to the two bills.
The Rajya Sabha passed the bill on Friday with 128 votes in favor and 95 against, while the Lok Sabha cleared the bill after a lengthy debate, with 288 members voting in favor and 232 opposing it.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, was a “watershed moment” and that it would help the marginalized, who have been “denied both voice and opportunity.”
“The passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill by both Houses of Parliament marks a watershed moment in our collective quest for socio-economic justice, transparency, and inclusive growth. This will particularly help those who have long remained on the margins, thus being denied both voice and opportunity,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, focuses on improving the management of waqf properties, empowering stakeholders relevant to the management of waqf properties, improving the efficiency of the survey, registration, and case disposal process, and developing waqf properties. While the core purpose remains the management of waqf properties, the aim is to implement modern and scientific methods for better governance. The Mussalman Waqf Act of 1923 was also repealed.
The bill, first introduced in August last year, was revised following recommendations by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. It amends the original Waqf Act of 1995, aiming to streamline the administration of waqf properties across India. Key features include improving the registration process and incorporating technology to enhance the efficiency of Waqf board operations.
The bill aims to overcome the shortcomings of the previous act, enhance the efficiency of Waqf boards, improve the registration process, and increase the role of technology in managing waqf records.

Title: Bracewell, Sears star as New Zealand complete 3-0 clean sweep over Pakistan
Publication Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:01:59 +0000
Content: New Zealand continued their dominance over Pakistan with a comprehensive 43-run win in the third ODI at Mount Maunganui, sealing a 3-0 series whitewash.
After a rain-delayed start, the match was curtailed to 42 overs per side. Hosts posted 264, thanks to impactful half-centuries from Michael Bracewell and youngster Rhys Mariu. Pakistan, despite several starts in the chase, folded for 221 as Ben Sears picked up another five-wicket haul.
Put in to bat after Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss for a third time in the series, New Zealand overcame early trouble with a series of steady partnerships. Mariu (58) and Henry Nicholls added 78 for the second wicket before captain Bracewell’s late assault – 59 off just 40 balls – lifted the total. He struck six sixes, five of them off Akif Javed, including three in the final two overs to provide the late flourish.
Pakistan’s chase never got going. Imam-ul-Haq was stretchered off early after suffering a freak injury when a throw stuck in his helmet grill. Usman Khan replaced him as a concussion substitute, but the innings lacked fluency. Abdullah Shafique (33) and Babar Azam (50) provided some resistance, but their slow pace left Pakistan behind the scoring rate. Sears removed Shafique and later returned to rip through the lower order, finishing with 5 for 34.
Bracewell added a stunning diving catch to his tally, while Duffy and O’Rourke kept things tight throughout. Rizwan’s quick 37 was the only real burst of momentum for Pakistan, but it fizzled out as the wickets kept tumbling.
Brief scores: New Zealand 264/8 in 42 overs (Michael Bracewell 59, Rhys Mariu 58; Akif Javed 4-62, Naseem Shah 2-54) beat Pakistan 221 all out in 40 overs (Babar Azam 50, Mohammad Rizwan 37; Ben Sears 5-34, Jacob Duffy 2-40) by 43 runs.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid heartfelt tributes to Babu Jagjivan Ram, the former Deputy Prime Minister of India, on the occasion of his birth anniversary.
Taking to the social media platform X, PM Modi expressed admiration for Jagjivan Ram’s tireless efforts in fighting for the rights of the underprivileged and his contributions to the nation’s progress.
In his post on X, PM Modi wrote, “Respectful tributes to former Deputy Prime Minister of the country Babu Jagjivan Ram on his birth anniversary. His lifelong struggle for the rights of the deprived and the oppressed will always remain a source of inspiration.”
In a video message shared on the same platform, the Prime Minister highlighted the immense legacy of Babu Jagjivan Ram.
“He dedicated his life to the betterment of the poor and spent many years in the service of the nation,” PM Modi said. He also recalled Jagjivan Ram’s significant role during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, stating, “Thakur Jagjivan Ram wanted two things, a strong India and a democratic India. When we strongly retaliated against Pakistan, Thakur Ji was the Defence Minister of India.”
The Prime Minister further added that Jagjivan Ram was the first Congress leader to raise his voice against the Emergency.
“During those difficult days, when people were getting arrested, he emerged as a voice of strength and encouraged people not to fear,” PM Modi said. He concluded his tribute by paying his respects to the leader on his birth anniversary.
Earlier in the day, Telangana Chief Minister K. Revanth Reddy also paid tribute to the legendary leader, acknowledging Jagjivan Ram’s unparalleled service to the nation.
The CM remarked, “Babuji was born in a poor family and rose to the highest position with his unwavering dedication.”
Babu Jagjivan Ram, widely known as Babuji, was one of India’s most prominent Dalit icons.
His work in championing the rights of the oppressed and his significant political roles, including as the Defence Minister during the 1971 India-Pakistan war and later as Deputy Prime Minister from 1977 to 1979, solidified his place in Indian history.
His legacy as a leader who fought for social justice and national unity continues to inspire generations.

Title: Flood threat: Vadodara launches rapid river deepening project
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:39:51 +0000
Content: The Gujarat government has launched large-scale work under the Vishwamitri River Project, aimed at enhancing the river’s flow capacity and improving the management of urban water bodies.
An official stated that the project, currently in full swing, seeks to increase the Vishwamitri River’s water-carrying capacity by 40 percent within a target period of 100 days.
Last year, Vadodara experienced severe flooding, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and led to the displacement of residents.
Determined to prevent a recurrence of such devastation, the government has fast-tracked river rejuvenation efforts. These include deepening and widening the Vishwamitri River, along with connecting key water bodies such as Ajwa Salav, Pratappura Sarovar, Dena Lake, and several city canals.
According to the official, a total of 526 machines have been deployed across various sites to execute the project on a war footing.
So far, 9.98 lakh cubic meters of soil and sludge have been excavated from the riverbed and surrounding areas.
“In addition, approximately 68 hectares of forest area have been cleared to facilitate smoother water flow. This is one of the most comprehensive flood prevention initiatives the city has ever seen. We are racing against time to complete the work before the monsoon,” said a senior project engineer.
He added that, alongside the river rejuvenation, efforts are also underway to clean and restore ten key lakes within the city.
“Work has been completed in two of these lakes, while development is ongoing in two others. In total, 474 deep rainwater recharge wells have been planned as part of the project, of which 25 have already been completed,” he said.
These wells are expected to improve groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff during heavy rainfall.
The project also includes a robust waste management component. As part of the cleaning and excavation process, 500 metric tons of plastic waste have been collected and sent to the Atladara processing plant for recycling.
Additionally, 11,000 metric tons of gravel recovered during the operation have been crushed and stored at the Atladara facility for potential reuse in infrastructure work.
Officials emphasized that the Vishwamitri River Project is not only about flood control — it is also a crucial step toward urban environmental restoration and climate resilience.
“With Vadodara’s growing population and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, the city’s natural drainage systems and water bodies require urgent and sustained attention,” they noted.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Swasth Bharat, Samriddh Bharat” has served as the guiding force behind Gujarat’s remarkable progress in maternal and child healthcare under CM Bhupendra Patel, in alignment with the 2025 World Health Day theme, “Healthy Start, Hopeful Future.”
With initiatives focused on empowering women and improving neonatal care, Gujarat has halved its Maternal Mortality Rate—from 112 (2011-13) to 57 (2020). Over 14 lakh pregnant women annually receive timely check-ups, immunizations, and nutrition services. The state has also established 121 First Referral Units, 153 Blood Storage Units, and 20 Maternity ICUs, achieving an institutional delivery rate of 99.97%.
Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 54 (2005) to 23 (2020), thanks to programs like HBNC, HBYC, SAANS, and Stop Diarrhea, supported by a strong network of newborn care units.
Under SH-RBSK, over 1.61 crore children are screened annually. The initiative also facilitated 206 kidney, 37 liver, and 211 bone marrow transplants, and free treatment for thousands of children with serious health conditions.
The “Breaking the Silence” campaign has restored hearing in 3,260 children via free cochlear implants. In 2025, Gujarat won two Gold SKOCH Awards for excellence in child health.
Gujarat also pioneered digital health cards for schoolchildren, with over 1.15 crore cards issued. Between 2019–2023, the state ranked first nationally in newborn screening and congenital disorder management.

Title: Samsung seeks ways to cushion blow from US tariffs
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:53:39 +0000
Content: Tech giant Samsung Electronics may need to overhaul its global production strategy as new U.S. reciprocal tariffs could significantly impact its smartphone business, industry sources said on Sunday.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a minimum 10 percent “baseline” tariff on all imports to the United States, along with country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on goods from South Korea.
The reciprocal tariffs—covering most product categories except for items such as vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals—are set to take effect from Wednesday (U.S. time), according to Yonhap news agency.
Experts and industry analysts noted that Samsung Electronics will need to adapt to the U.S. tariff policy by leveraging its strategy of diversifying production bases.
Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, currently produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam, which now faces a 46 percent reciprocal tariff on goods entering the U.S. The remainder of its smartphone production is spread across India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea.
India faces a 26 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and Brazil just 10 percent—making Brazil a potentially attractive hub for serving the U.S. market.
Sources suggest Samsung may consider ramping up production in India, Brazil, and South Korea, particularly for premium models intended for American consumers.
Brazil, in particular, stands out due to its low tariffs and geographic proximity to the U.S., they added.
The company is expected to reassess its production strategy ahead of the summer launch of its next-generation foldable smartphones, but for now, it is proceeding cautiously.
“Nothing has been decided yet,” said an official from Samsung Electronics.
South Korea’s economy is likely to face headwinds as the U.S. administration’s reciprocal tariffs may severely impact the country’s exports to the United States, while also disrupting the global market—potentially dealing a further blow to South Korean trade, local experts warned.
They expressed serious concerns for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, especially as the Trump administration continues to implement protectionist trade policies, including 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as similarly high duties on foreign-made cars.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. He was also garlanded by the temple priest.
The Ramanathaswamy Shiva Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple holds mythological significance as it is believed that Lord Ram established and worshipped at this temple before crossing the Ram Setu bridge to reach Sri Lanka to rescue his wife from Ravan. It also features the longest corridor among Hindu temples in India.
Governor R.N. Ravi had also visited the temple before the inauguration of the bridge.
Earlier today, while sharing an aerial view during his return journey from Sri Lanka, PM Modi highlighted how he was able to have a “darshan” of both Ram Setu and Ayodhya’s ‘Surya Tilak’.
“On the way back from Sri Lanka a short while ago, I was blessed to have a darshan of the Ram Setu. And, as a divine coincidence, it happened at the same time as the Surya Tilak was taking place in Ayodhya. Blessed to have the darshan of both,” the PM said in a post on X.
PM Modi is also scheduled to hold roadshows in a Tamil Nadu city.

Title: Sri Lanka releases 14 Indian fishermen during PM Modi’s visit
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:40:36 +0000
Content: In a significant gesture underscoring growing bilateral goodwill, Sri Lanka on Sunday released 14 Indian fishermen during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation. 
The release followed detailed discussions between PM Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier on Saturday, during which the long-standing issue of fishermen’s arrests was taken up.
The Prime Minister, during his remarks at a joint press briefing, said, “We discussed the fishermen’s issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats.”
The arrest of Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, by Sri Lankan authorities for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters has been a recurring point of tension.
Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by Sri Lankan forces, raising concerns among coastal communities and prompting repeated appeals for intervention.
Addressing a press conference following the talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days.”
“This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister said himself during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides,” Misri added.
The release of 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during PM Modi’s visit, which included the joint inauguration of India-backed railway projects such as the upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway track and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the New Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. This landmark project is India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge, showcasing the nation’s growing engineering and infrastructural capabilities.
The 2.07-kilometre-long bridge, spanning the Palk Strait, stands as a testament to India’s engineering prowess and visionary infrastructure development. PM Modi, accompanied by Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi, flagged off the first train to cross the sea bridge.
A demonstration showcased the bridge’s functionality, with visuals capturing key moments. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) boat successfully navigated under the structure, highlighting its vertical clearance and maritime accessibility. Following the boat’s passage, a train crossed the bridge, demonstrating its structural integrity and operational readiness.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Vaishnaw hoisted the BJP flag at the Pamban Bridge site and congratulated party workers on the BJP’s foundation day.  
“The resolve of Antyodaya and the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’… Heartfelt congratulations to all workers on the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” his post read.
Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi also visited the Swamy Temple in Rameswaram ahead of the inauguration.
The story of the bridge dates back to 1914, when British engineers constructed the original Pamban Bridge—a cantilever structure with a Scherzer rolling lift span—connecting Rameswaram Island to mainland India. The new bridge, sanctioned in 2019, is three metres taller than the original, enhancing sea connectivity and accommodating maritime traffic more efficiently.
The bridge has long served as a vital link for pilgrims, tourists, and trade. However, the harsh marine environment and increasing transportation demands necessitated a modern upgrade. In 2019, the central government approved the construction of a technologically advanced, future-ready replacement.
Constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna PSU under the Ministry of Railways, the New Pamban Bridge has been designed to meet higher standards for speed, load-bearing capacity, and maritime clearance. It enhances connectivity while showcasing India’s capabilities in safety, durability, and innovation.
As India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, the New Pamban Bridge joins the ranks of other iconic international structures known for their engineering achievements—such as the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Tower Bridge in London, and the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.

Title: Lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust, hope: Amit Shah congratulates party workers on BJP’s Foundation Day
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:46:27 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated party workers on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Foundation Day on Sunday, saying that the lotus symbol has emerged as a powerful emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the people.
In a post on X, Shah said, “Today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the countrymen. The works of service, security, and cultural awakening that the BJP has undertaken in the past decade will become milestones in the days to come.”
“Crores of BJP workers, steadfastly adhering to ideological commitment, will continue to contribute to nation-building” he added. 
Recalling the party’s key achievements, including the revocation of Article 370 and the movement to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said the party has always ensured the welfare of the poor, the underprivileged, and women.
“Whether it is about taking the Shri Ram Temple movement to every individual, making the removal of Article 370 its resolve, or ensuring the welfare of the poor, the deprived, and women — BJP has, since its inception, made the nation’s interest its highest goal,” his post read.
Highlighting the party’s journey since its inception in 1980, Shah said the BJP has consistently demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies and ensuring welfare for farmers.
“In its four-decade journey, BJP has demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies, providing every poor person with housing, food, health insurance, and promoting the welfare of farmers all at once,” the home minister said.
The BJP was officially formed on April 6, 1980, based on the Panch Nishthas (Five Commitments). However, the party’s roots trace back to the formation of the Jana Sangh in 1950.
The Jana Sangh was founded by former Union Minister Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the Emergency ended in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party to oppose the Congress. However, a dispute arose over dual membership—whether members affiliated with the RSS could remain in the Janata Party. This led to the Jana Sangh members parting ways and forming the BJP on April 6, 1980.
Since its formation, the BJP has had two Prime Ministers: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.
The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it won 303 seats—the highest in its history.

Title: PM Modi, Lankan President Dissanayake launch India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:16:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.

Title: India’s forex reserves rise to USD 665.4 billion, biggest jump in nearly five months: RBI
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 06:49:39 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves continued their upward momentum, rising by USD 6.596 billion to USD 665.396 billion as of March 28 — the highest weekly gain in nearly five months, as per RBI data.
This substantial increase is the highest in nearly five months, following a period of decline.  
According to RBI data, forex reserves have cumulatively increased by USD 20.1 billion over the past three weeks, with about USD 6.6 billion added in the latest reporting week. Experts attribute the earlier declines to shaken investor confidence in Indian equity markets.  
As of March 28, the data shows that gold reserves stood at USD 77.793 billion, while foreign currency assets were valued at USD 565.014 billion.  
During the same period, the Indian Rupee appreciated by 0.6 per cent against the US Dollar. This appreciation is seen as a sign of renewed foreign investment confidence in the Indian stock markets.  
Any decline in reserves is typically due to RBI interventions aimed at preventing sharp depreciation of the Rupee.  
Official estimates suggest that India’s current forex reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 10 to 11 months of projected imports.  
In 2023, India added around USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, compared to a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022. In 2024, the reserves increased by a little over USD 20 billion.  
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a nation’s central bank or monetary authority. These are primarily held in reserve currencies such as the US Dollar, with smaller portions in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.  
The RBI often intervenes in the currency market by managing liquidity—selling dollars to curb a weakening Rupee and buying dollars when the Rupee strengthens.
