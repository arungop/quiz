Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Research examines better screening methods for statin use
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:29:10 +0000
Content: A new study in the United States is exploring the most effective method to screen and assess patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease and to determine who would benefit from statin medication to lower cholesterol.
Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have introduced a new approach that relies on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess risk and guide statin prescriptions. The CAC score is determined through a low-radiation computed tomography (CT) scan, which detects calcium deposits in plaques within the coronary arteries of the heart.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, the study’s principal investigator and a distinguished clinical and cardiovascular research physician at Intermountain Health, explained that the research aims to improve the selection process for patients who need statins. Instead of relying solely on coronary risk factor equations, the study examines whether direct imaging of plaque burden is a more effective indicator of risk.
The study, which has now enrolled over 5,600 patients, was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago on Saturday. As part of the research, patients’ risk assessment scores were shared with their physicians through letters, indicating whether a statin was recommended based on high-risk findings.
Initial findings revealed that while the two groups in the study had similar baseline characteristics, the rate of statin prescription recommendations varied significantly. The study is expected to conclude in early 2026, after which researchers will compare outcomes such as deaths, heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations over a follow-up period of up to seven years, with an average follow-up of over four years.
Understanding the most effective approach to statin prescription is crucial, given that these medications come with costs and potential side effects, including muscle aches and an increased risk of diabetes. The study’s findings could help refine treatment strategies for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

Title: ChatGPT can be used in sensory evaluation of foods, specifically brownies: study
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A recent study suggests that ChatGPT can be utilized in the sensory evaluation of foods, particularly brownies, offering insights that may streamline new product development and even enhance recipes.
Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US examined 15 different brownie recipes, ranging from traditional ingredient combinations to unconventional ones, such as mealworm powder and fish oil. Study author Damir Torrico, an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provided ChatGPT with these recipe formulas and asked it to describe the sensory characteristics of each brownie, including taste, texture, and overall appeal. He then categorized ChatGPT’s responses to determine whether they were positive, negative, or neutral.
Torrico noted that relying on human testers can sometimes slow down the evaluation process, especially when multiple product prototypes need assessment simultaneously. Sensory panels require time, coordination, and, in some cases, certain ingredients may not be food-grade, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This is why large language models like ChatGPT are being explored for sensory evaluation, as they have the potential to replicate certain human responses.
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s responses were overwhelmingly positive, even for brownies containing unusual ingredients. This aligns with a psychological concept known as “hedonic asymmetry,” which suggests that both humans and AI tend to describe beneficial experiences in more positive terms. Torrico explained that food plays a fundamental role in nourishment and energy, leading humans to respond positively to it. In attempting to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT appeared to exhibit the same tendency, always focusing on the positive aspects of the recipes.
The study suggests that AI can provide general insights into which products are worth further testing and which might not be suitable for a lengthy evaluation process. Torrico believes that ChatGPT could be further developed for sensory evaluation to assist the food industry. Moving forward, he plans to refine the experiment by training ChatGPT to use a vocabulary similar to that of a human descriptive panel.

Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:36:12 +0000
Content: The market outlook for the coming week will be shaped by a combination of domestic and global economic factors, including key indicators such as PMI data, foreign institutional investments (FIIs), auto sales figures, and major US economic data releases. Among the most closely watched developments will be the HSBC Composite PMI data for India, set to be released on Friday, while auto companies will begin reporting their sales figures from Monday.
On the global front, market sentiment will be influenced by policy developments related to India-US tariffs and the potential impact of former US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on finished vehicle imports, which is set to take effect from April 3. Additionally, investors will closely track the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a series of crucial US economic data releases, including job openings, non-farm payrolls, and the unemployment rate.
Last week, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with both the Nifty and Sensex posting gains of approximately 0.70%, closing at 23,519.35 and 77,414.92, respectively. Banking stocks played a key role in driving the rally, with Bank Nifty rising nearly 2% to settle at 51,564.81. Among sectoral indices, Nifty PSE and FMCG emerged as the top performers, whereas media and pharma stocks lagged behind.
Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree, infusing Rs 17,426 crore into equities between March 24 and 28, while domestic institutional investors contributed Rs 6,797 crore during the same period. This consistent inflow of foreign capital helped the Nifty post a 6.3% gain in March, reversing losses from the previous month and closing on a strong note.
The Indian stock market will remain closed on March 31 in observance of Eid.
According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, Nifty has strong support at 23,300, and if breached, it could decline towards 23,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could push the index towards 24,100, potentially extending the ongoing rally.

Title: GRAP-I restrictions revoked in Delhi-NCR as air quality improves
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 02:45:32 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Graded Response Action Plan – Stage I (GRAP-I) in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect after air quality improved in the city.
The decision came after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday clocked 153 as per the daily bulletin provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
The CAQM said that the AQI of the national capital showed significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR.
“AQI of Delhi has shown significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR. The AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 153 for 29.03.2025 (in ‘Moderate’ category). Further, the forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts AQI to mainly remain in the ‘Moderate’ category in the coming days,” CAQM said in a statement.
“Therefore, keeping in view this trend of improvement in the overall AQI of Delhi, the CAQM Sub-Committee unanimously decided to revoke Stage-I of the extant schedule of GRAP in the entire NCR, with immediate effect,” it added.
“All the agencies concerned are also required to take note of various actions and the targeted timelines as envisaged in the comprehensive policy issued by the Commission to curb air pollution in the NCR and take appropriate actions accordingly in the field, particularly the dust mitigation measures for C&amp;D activities &amp; Roads/Open areas, which becomes a pre-dominant factor in the coming months determining the air quality in Delhi-NCR,” CAQM further said.
“The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and review the situation from time to time for further appropriate decision depending upon the air quality in Delhi and the forecast made by IMD/ IITM,” CAQM stated in the statement.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Title: People across country celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with joy and unity
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:13:10 +0000
Content: Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations have begun across the country, with an outpouring of joy and unity as families and communities come together to mark the end of Ramadan.  
The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.  
A child celebrating Eid spoke to ANI after offering his morning prayers and said, “We are celebrating Eid with parents and friends, and all are happy… Whatever people give us (in Eidi), we take it happily.”  
Children embraced each other and wished greetings of Eid-ul-Fitr.  
BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain offered namaz at the Parliament Street mosque in Delhi on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Speaking to ANI, he said, “I extend my best wishes to the people of the country on the occasion of Eid. Today, people have peacefully offered Namaz everywhere. Eid is the day to forget everything and hug each other. I pray that there should be unity in the country and that our country progresses.”  
Shakeel Ahmed, a Pakistani citizen originally from India, said, “I am happy that I came to Delhi, my birthplace, with my relatives to celebrate Eid.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a foreign student of GD Goenka University from Mozambique said, “It was my first time here, and it was one of the best experiences that I had in India… India is very rich in this way. We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”  
On security arrangements for Eid-ul-Fitr, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Central Delhi, M Harsha Vardhan, said, “Today, a huge crowd is observed at the mosques. All the security arrangements have been made in central Delhi. Till now, no case has been reported. We have deployed adequate forces… Arrangements for Navratri have also been made. A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the PM said, “Greetings on Eid-ul-Fitr. May this festival enhance the spirit of hope, harmony, and kindness in our society. May there be joy and success in all your endeavors. Eid Mubarak!”  
President Droupadi Murmu also extended her best wishes on the occasion.  
“Greetings to all countrymen, especially Muslim brothers and sisters, on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This festival strengthens the feeling of brotherhood and conveys the message of compassion and charity. I wish that this festival brings peace, prosperity, and happiness to everyone’s life and strengthens the spirit of moving forward on the path of goodness,” she said in a post on X, in Urdu.  
Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also extended his wishes.  
“Eid Mubarak! May this joyous occasion bring peace, happiness, prosperity, and good health to you and your loved ones.”  
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also shared his warm greetings.  
“On this joyous occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, I extend my warmest greetings to fellow citizens. Eid profoundly evokes feelings of fraternity, compassion, and the spirit of sharing amongst us all, strengthening the pluralistic bonds that unite our people. May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.  
Eid upholds the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. Along with giving Zakat, many also provide meals, clothing, and support to the less fortunate, reflecting Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.

A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Title: 6th BIMSTEC Summit to convene in Bangkok on April 4, focusing on trade, security and regional cooperation
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:46:48 +0000
Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”

The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: SpaceX launches private astronaut crew in Fram2 polar-orbiting mission
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:23:58 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Monday launched a crew of four private astronauts led by a crypto entrepreneur on a mission to orbit Earth from pole to pole, a novel trajectory in which no humans have traveled before.
Maltese investor Chun Wang, a Chinese-born magnate who founded a bitcoin mining company, is the bankroller and commander of the SpaceX mission, named Fram2, a reference to the Norwegian “Fram” ship that pioneered Arctic exploration at the turn of the 20th century.
Wang and three associates launched aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule at 9:47 p.m. EDT on Monday (0147 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, setting off for a free-flying mission for three to five days, during which they will partake in 22 research experiments largely centered on how spaceflight and microgravity affect the human body.
The four crew members on Monday afternoon were driven to the launchpad in a caravan of Teslas – the electric cars of Musk’s other company – winding through the roads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a police escort, as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched overhead in an unrelated Starlink mission.
“We’re gonna watch a rocket launch while on our way to a rocket launch,” Wang wrote on X, the social media site owned by Musk, alongside a video of a Falcon 9 climbing the skies to space during their drive.
The mission, SpaceX’s sixth private astronaut flight, is the company’s latest novel effort that expands its dominance in the global human spaceflight arena. It comes as Musk’s power as SpaceX CEO and the world’s richest man soars as he works as a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, a role that has given him extraordinary influence for a businessman over an array of U.S. policy matters.
Fram2 is the 16th crewed mission overall using the reusable Crew Dragon, a gumdrop-shaped spacecraft that SpaceX developed with NASA funding to provide the U.S. space agency a ride for its astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
SpaceX and its Dragon craft have dominated the nascent market for private orbital spaceflight, an area in which a key source of demand originally came from a small field of wealthy tourists. Dragon is the world’s only privately built capsule routinely flying missions in orbit, as Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule is held up in development.
In recent years, with Dragon flights costing roughly $55 million per seat, the spaceflight market – involving companies such as Axiom Space that contract Crew Dragon missions – has fixated more on astronauts from governments willing to pay the sum mainly for national prestige and bolstering domestic spaceflight experience.
But the Fram2 crew is untethered from government backing. Wang’s friends include Norwegian film director Jannicke Mikkelsen, who specializes in virtual-reality cinematography; German robotics researcher and polar scientist Rabea Rogge, and Australian adventurer Eric Philips, who has taken up ambitious skiing expeditions in Earth’s harsh polar regions.

Title: South Korea Constitutional Court to rule on Yoon’s impeachment on April 4
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:12:36 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court, which is reviewing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment, will announce its decision on whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him on April 4, the court said in a statement on Tuesday.
The court said the ruling will be delivered at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) and live broadcast of the session will be permitted.
Yoon was impeached by parliament on December 14 after being accused of violating his constitutional duty by declaring martial law in early December with no justifiable grounds.
The suspended leader has said he never intended to fully impose military rule but instead meant to sound the alarm over the opposition Democratic Party’s abuse of its parliamentary majority that he argued was threatening to destroy the country.
In his final statement before the court ended arguments on February 25, Yoon also said his decision to declare martial law was an appeal to the people to overcome “anti-state forces”, pro-North Korea sympathisers, and opposition gridlock.
The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the dollar after the announcement of the ruling date. The stock market’s benchmark was up 1.5% after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5%.
The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when 6 or more judges agree, according to South Korea’s constitution.
The wait of more than a month for the time of the ruling has fuelled a bitter clash between the ruling party, with many of its members calling for Yoon’s reinstatement, and the opposition, which has said his return would deal a serious blow to the country’s constitutional order.
The looming decision has also deepened division among the public, with large crowds packing downtown streets in rallies for and against Yoon’s removal, with rhetoric becoming increasingly heated. Police are bracing for potential violence once the ruling is announced.
The People Power Party’s floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, welcomed the announcement and said the ruling party will accept the court’s decision but warned “social conflict will become stronger whatever the decision is”.
The Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said he was confident the court will rule unanimously against Yoon.
The majority of the public backs Yoon’s removal, according to opinion polls, although support has ebbed since the initial days after the martial law declaration last December.
A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed 60% of the respondents saying Yoon should be ousted.
NEW ELECTION WITHIN 60 DAYS IF YOON OUSTED
Parliamentary lawyers seeking his removal compared Yoon to a dictator during their final arguments at his impeachment trial.
Yoon, a former prosecutor who has seen his popularity dive, could face removal from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if his impeachment is upheld, marking a tumultuous end to a tenure marred by political turmoil.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon is also on a separate criminal trial on charges of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law and faces the death penalty or life in prison if convicted although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997.
His shock martial law announcement, which banned political and parliamentary activity, triggered a constitutional crisis that also led to the impeachment of the prime minister who became acting president.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was reinstated on March 24 by the Constitutional Court and resumed his role as acting president.
In an impeachment trial in 2017, eight justices of the court at the time unanimously backed a decision to oust the then President Park Geun-hye for violating her constitutional duty.

Title: India nears Naxalism-free goal as most affected districts drop to six: Home Minister Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced a significant reduction in the number of districts most affected by Left-Wing Extremism (LWE), also known as Naxalism, stating that the number has dropped from 12 to just 6. This reduction marks a key milestone in the ongoing efforts to create a Naxalism-free India.
In a post on X, Shah highlighted the Modi government’s “ruthless approach” towards eradicating Naxalism and emphasized the country’s commitment to fostering development across all regions. “The Modi government is determined to build a Sashakt, Surakshit, and Samriddh Bharat with relentless efforts for all-encompassing development and a firm stance against Naxalism. We are committed to uprooting Naxalism completely by 31st March 2026,” he stated.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of districts affected by Naxalism in India had previously been 38. Out of these, the number of “most affected” districts has now decreased to 6, with a parallel reduction in the number of “Districts of Concern” and “Other LWE-affected Districts.”
The six districts most affected by Naxalism now include four from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli).
Additionally, the number of “Districts of Concern,” which require intensified resources and attention, has been reduced from 9 to 6. These districts are located in Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem).
The number of “Other LWE-affected Districts,” which are also experiencing Naxal activity but to a lesser degree, has dropped from 17 to 6. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariaband, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu).
To support these districts in their recovery and development, central govt provides financial assistance under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme. The most affected districts receive Rs. 30 crore, while Districts of Concern are allocated Rs. 10 crore to fill gaps in public infrastructure. Special projects tailored to the needs of these areas are also funded by the government.

Title: US, Denmark to hold first high-level talks since Trump’s win
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:45:00 +0000
Content: Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen is set to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week in the first high-level talks since President Donald Trump’s re-election and his vow to “take control” of Greenland, the Financial Times said.
The prospect of such talks comes amid simmering tension between the two nations over U.S. interest in taking control of Greenland, the Arctic island controlled by Denmark since 1721.
The meeting is planned for the sidelines of a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels set to begin on Thursday, the paper said on Tuesday, citing two officials briefed on the preparations.
However, the officials warned the event could be cancelled because of tense relations between Copenhagen and Washington, it added.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland from April 2 to 4 for talks with the new government of the semi-autonomous territory just days after a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.
On his trip, Vance accused Denmark of not doing a good job of keeping the island safe and suggested the United States would better protect the strategically located island.

Title: India’s most-capped women’s player Vandana Katariya bids farewell to international hockey
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:04:41 +0000
Content: Indian women’s hockey stalwart Vandana Katariya has officially announced her retirement from international hockey, bringing an end to an illustrious career spanning over 15 years.
With 320 international appearances and 158 goals to her name, Vandana departs as the most-capped player in the history of Indian women’s hockey. Beyond the numbers, she leaves behind an inspiring legacy—one of resilience, quiet determination, and an unwavering commitment to elevating Indian women’s hockey.
The 32-year-old forward, who made her senior team debut in 2009, was an integral part of several defining moments in the sport, including India’s historic fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where she became the first and only Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Games.
Announcing her retirement, Vandana, who played her last match for India during the Bhubaneswar leg of the FIH Pro League 2024-25 in February, reflected on her journey with mixed emotions.
“This decision wasn’t easy, but I know it’s the right time. Hockey has been my life for as long as I can remember, and wearing the Indian jersey was the greatest honour. But every journey has its course, and I leave with immense pride, gratitude, and love for the sport. Indian hockey is in great hands, and I will always be its biggest supporter.”
She extended heartfelt appreciation to everyone who played a role in her career. “I want to thank my coaches, teammates, support staff, Hockey India, my family, and all the fans who have supported me over the years. Every cheer, every message, every word of encouragement meant the world to me.”
Hailing from Roshnabad, Haridwar, Vandana’s journey began like that of many young girls in India—on dusty fields with dreams far bigger than her circumstances. Over the years, she represented India on the grandest stages, including two Olympic Games (Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020), two FIH Hockey Women’s World Cups (2018, 2022), three Commonwealth Games (2014, 2018, 2022), and three Asian Games (2014, 2018, 2022).
Her contributions were instrumental in India’s rise in world hockey. She played a pivotal role in securing gold medals at the Women’s Asian Champions Trophy (2016, 2023) and the FIH Hockey Women’s Nations Cup (2022), silver medals at the 2018 Asian Games, the 2013 and 2018 Women’s Asian Champions Trophy, and bronze medals at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the 2014 and 2022 Asian Games, and the FIH Hockey Pro League 2021-22.
Hockey India President Dilip Tirkey paid tribute to Vandana’s contributions, saying, “Vandana was not just a goal scorer; she was the heartbeat of the Indian attack, a tireless worker, and a leader by example. Her presence in the forward line gave India an edge, especially in high-pressure situations. She has set a benchmark for future generations, and we at Hockey India are immensely proud of her achievements. We wish her the very best in her future endeavours.”
Vandana was also a key member of India’s bronze medal-winning squad at the 2013 Junior World Cup, finishing as the team’s top scorer and the tournament’s third-highest goal scorer.
Apart from representing India in multiple global tournaments, Vandana featured in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Hockey India League in 2025, playing for Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers.
Among her many achievements, Vandana’s Tokyo Olympics heroics remain unforgettable. Her hat-trick in a crucial 4-3 victory over South Africa helped India reach the quarterfinals and secure their best-ever Olympic finish.
Speaking about that defining moment, Vandana said, “I still get goosebumps thinking about Tokyo. The Olympics are special, and that match against South Africa was one of the most emotional games of my life. I just wanted to give everything for my team, for my country. The hattrick was special, but more than that, it was about proving that we belonged on that stage.”
For her immense contributions, Vandana was honoured with some of India’s most prestigious awards, including the Arjuna Award (2021) and the Padma Shri (2022). She also received the Hockey India Balbir Singh Sr. Award for Player of the Year (Women) in 2014, the Hockey India President’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2021, and the Hockey India Dhanraj Pillay Award for Forward of the Year in 2021 and 2022, cementing her status as one of India’s finest forwards.
Hockey India Secretary General Bhola Nath Singh lauded her remarkable journey, stating, “Vandana’s journey is nothing short of inspirational. From her early days to becoming a stalwart of Indian hockey, she has shown exceptional skill, resilience, and commitment. Her performances in crucial matches, especially at the Tokyo Olympics, will be remembered for years to come. As she takes her final bow, she leaves behind a legacy of resilience, excellence, and inspiration—one that will continue to guide the next generation of Indian hockey stars.”

Title: Mumbai scouts find another IPL gem in paceman Ashwani
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:46:08 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya heaped praise on his team’s scouting department for unearthing another gem in Ashwani Kumar, after the pace bowler produced the best figures by an Indian on his Indian Premier League debut.
The 23-year-old Ashwani bagged 4-24 in three overs on Monday to help dismiss reigning champions Kolkata Knight Riders for 116 in 16.2 overs before Mumbai secured an eight-wicket victory to open their account in this year’s tournament.
Ashwani’s heroics came after spinner Vignesh Puthur claimed 3-32 on his debut in Mumbai’s defeat by Chennai Super Kings last week, and Pandya was delighted with the team’s latest find.
“I’m really happy for the young kid,” said Pandya.
“It’s all the scouts, they picked him. They’ve gone to all places and picked these young kids. We played a practice game, he had that zip, that late swing, something off the wicket, a different action and he was a lefty.”
Mumbai batsman Ryan Rickelton also played a big role in the win with an unbeaten 62, but said Ashwani had laid the foundation with his deceptive pace and swing.
“He’s a lot quicker than people recognise at first. I think that’s a great attribute he has, and he can swing the new ball,” South African Rickelton added.
“I know it’s quite tough, we’ve got two specialist swing bowlers with the new ball as well, but to have that second plan without that swing factor was really impressive … He rushes you a little bit as well.
“He’s a great addition to the group and the wicket can suit him. Looking forward to seeing, if he gets the opportunity, his other set of skills come through. He’s a nice find for Mumbai.”

Content: Teenage batting prodigy Sam Konstas has been added to Australia’s list of contracted players in a huge vote of confidence for the two-test opener.
The 19-year-old was named among 23 contracted players on Tuesday, three months on from making a memorable 60 in his international debut in the Melbourne test against India.
Konstas was one of three players to earn their first national contracts, joining spinner Matt Kuhnemann and all-rounder Beau Webster.
White-ball all-rounders Sean Abbott and Aaron Hardie, and seven-test spinner Todd Murphy made way for the new trio.
“In Sam, we see promising upside in a young player who will continue to develop at the first-class level and in the international environment,” selector George Bailey said in a statement.
Kuhnemann’s contract is another boost for the left-arm spinner who was recently cleared of having a suspect bowling action following his prolific tour of Sri Lanka.
Kuhnemann was reported for his bowling action after he was Player of the Series with 16 wickets in Sri Lanka.
Tasmania all-rounder Webster has had a strong entry into test cricket since his Sydney debut against India, scoring 150 runs at an average of 50.00 from his three matches along with three wickets with his medium pace.
“Matt was outstanding once again in Sri Lanka and we believe he can play a key role across the next 18 months,” said Bailey.
“In Beau’s case, he proved more than comfortable at Test level with bat and ball, adds an additional dimension in the field and to the balance of the side.”
With 20 out of 23 players retaining their contracts, selectors have opted for continuity over change for an aging Australian squad.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh may feel fortunate to be included after the 33-year-old was dropped during the test series against India after a dreadful run of scores.
Pace bowler Jhye Richardson was retained despite nearly three years passing since his last international match.
Fringe pace bowlers Lance Morris and Xavier Bartlett also kept their contracts after barely featuring for Australia in the 2024/25 season.

Title: China launches military drills around Taiwan, calls its president a ‘parasite’
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:26:48 +0000
Content: China began joint army, navy and rocket force exercises around Taiwan on Tuesday as a “stern warning” against separatism and called Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te a “parasite”, as Taiwan sent warships to respond to China’s navy approaching its coast.
The exercises around the democratically governed island, which China views as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring under its control, come after Lai called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” last month.
China detests Lai as a “separatist,” and in a video accompanying the Eastern Theatre Command’s announcement of the drills depicted him as cartoon bug held by a pair of chopsticks above a burning Taiwan, calling him in English a “parasite”.
“The focus is on exercises such as combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets, and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes,” the Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills, with the presidential office saying China was “widely recognised by the international community as a troublemaker” and that the government has the confidence and ability to defend itself.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.
Two senior Taiwan officials told Reuters that more than 10 Chinese military ships had approached close to Taiwan’s 24 nautical mile (44 km) contiguous zone and Taiwan sent its own warships to respond.
However, Taiwan has not detected any live fire by the Chinese military, one of the officials said.
TAIWAN DISPATCHES WARSHIPS
Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered the island’s response area on Monday, adding that it had dispatched military aircraft and ships and activated land-based missile systems in response.
The drills took place after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth left the region following visits to Japan and the Philippines, where he criticised China and said Japan was “indispensable” for tackling Chinese aggression.
A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters, citing internal assessments, that Beijing needed to avoid any “perceived confrontation” with Washington prior to the U.S.-China trade talks, and thus Taiwan has become a pretext.
“Taiwan is their best excuse. That’s why they chose to launch such military drills as soon as the U.S. defence secretary left Asia,” the official said.
The de facto U.S. embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, said the United States will continue to support the island.
“Once again, China has shown that it is not a responsible actor and has no problem putting the region’s security and prosperity at risk,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
“CLOSING IN”
China’s military released a series of propaganda videos in quick succession after the drill announcement, depicting Chinese warships and fighter jets encircling Taiwan, Taipei being aimed at from above, and military vehicles patrolling city streets.
A video of a poster accompanying the drills titled “Closing In,” and showing Chinese forces surrounding the island, was released on the Eastern Theatre Command’s Weibo.
This was followed by a video titled “Shell”, depicting president Lai as a green cartoon bug spawning parasites across the island, on the Eastern Theatre Command’s WeChat page.
“Parasite poisoning Taiwan island. Parasite hollowing Island out. Parasite courting ultimate destruction,” the animation said.
Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said such rhetoric was not conducive to peace and “shows their provocative character,” when asked about Lai’s cartoon depiction.
A third video, “Subdue Demons and Vanquish Evils”, featured Sun Wukong, the magical monkey king from the Ming Dynasty epic “Journey to the West” as he is depicted in the “Black Myth: Wukong” hit video game.
It opens with the video’s title flashing across the screen and the Chinese mythical warrior riding on clouds before cutting to footage of Chinese fighter jets.
“The joint exercise and training conducted by the Eastern Theatre of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the vicinity of Taiwan Island is a resolute punishment for the Lai Ching-Te authorities’ rampant ‘independence’ provocations,” said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.
Taiwan’s Koo told reporters the PLA should focus first on resolving its issues with corruption instead of destroying peace and stability in the region.
China’s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge over the past few years, which saw former Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu ousted in October 2024.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Koo’s remarks.
The Taiwan security source, citing internal intelligence assessments, said China was trying to busy its military with exercises as a way of distracting and stopping its soldiers from discussing the corruption crackdown amongst themselves on base.
China’s coast guard said it was also taking part in the drills, saying it was simulating “inspection and capture, interception and detention operations against unwarranted vessels” to show its exercise of “legitimate jurisdiction” over Taiwan.
The Global Times, which is owned by the People’s Daily newspaper of the governing Chinese Communist Party, said the drill had not been given a code name to show that Chinese military forces surrounding the island “has become a normal practice,” citing Zhang Chi of National Defence University.
“Through a series of exercises held in the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the PLA has strongly enhanced its ability to prepare for war and fight battles,” the article on the paper’s Weixin social media page added.
China has staged several rounds of war games around Taiwan since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in 2022.

Title: Chilean President Boric arrives in India for 5-Day state visit, set to meet PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:09:24 +0000
Content: Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday for a five-day state visit to India, marking a significant step in strengthening the bilateral ties between the two nations. Upon his arrival, Boric was warmly welcomed by Union Minister of State (MoS) Pabitra Margherita and was accorded a ceremonial Guard of Honour at the airport.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced the arrival of President Boric with a post on X, “Bienvenido, President Gabriel Boric! President Boric of Chile landed in New Delhi on his first State Visit to India. Accorded a ceremonial welcome & Guard of Honour.”
Accompanying President Boric is a high-level delegation that includes ministers, parliament members, senior officials, business representatives, media personnel, and prominent Chileans involved in the India-Chile cultural exchange. The delegation is scheduled to visit Agra, Mumbai, and Bengaluru before concluding the visit on April 5.
Following his arrival, the Chilean President took to X to express his enthusiasm about the visit: “6:30 a.m. in New Delhi, and from here we begin this State Visit to India, a momentous occasion for strengthening and diversifying our economic, political, and cultural relations at a time when multilateral cooperation is more necessary than ever. We are talking about the fifth-largest economy and the most populous country on the planet, with whom we share common ground and opportunities for growth in key areas such as agribusiness, innovation, and the creative industries.”
He further emphasized the importance of strengthening bilateral ties, saying, “We’re here to strengthen and reinforce our ties, and that’s why I’m joined by government officials, the National Congress, business leaders, leaders in the fields of innovation and culture, distinguished professors, and students. A busy schedule. I’ll keep you posted!”
President Boric is set to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 1 for comprehensive discussions on the full spectrum of India-Chile relations. A special luncheon will also be hosted by PM Modi in Boric’s honour.
In addition to his meeting with PM Modi, President Boric will also engage with President Droupadi Murmu for further deliberations. A banquet will be hosted in his honour following their discussions.
The Chilean President’s itinerary includes visits to Mumbai and Bengaluru, where he will meet with political leaders, industry heads, startup entrepreneurs, and technology innovators. The goal of these meetings is to foster deeper collaboration between India and Chile across various sectors, including agribusiness, technology, and innovation.
The MEA highlighted the importance of this State Visit as an opportunity for both nations to assess and enhance their bilateral relations. It is also a chance to deliberate on regional and global matters of mutual interest.
“India-Chile relations have traditionally been characterized by warmth, friendship, and a shared commitment to a range of global issues,” the MEA stated. “Both countries cooperate extensively in multilateral forums and share similar views on climate change, renewable energy, and on expanding and reforming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).”
Chile has long supported India’s bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC, with the support being reaffirmed in a Joint Statement issued at the conclusion of the official visit of the Chilean Foreign Minister to India in April 2003. Chile and India also share concerns about the threat of international terrorism and have consistently condemned terrorism in all its forms.
Earlier this year, a parliamentary delegation led by BJP Lok Sabha MP Jagdambika Pal visited Chile from January 11-15. The delegation participated in the Summit meeting at Congreso Futuro on January 13 and the Third World Summit of the Committees of the Future on January 14. During the visit, the delegation engaged in extensive discussions with Chilean parliamentarians on a wide range of topics.
