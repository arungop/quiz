Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Research examines better screening methods for statin use
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:29:10 +0000
Content: A new study in the United States is exploring the most effective method to screen and assess patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease and to determine who would benefit from statin medication to lower cholesterol.
Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have introduced a new approach that relies on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess risk and guide statin prescriptions. The CAC score is determined through a low-radiation computed tomography (CT) scan, which detects calcium deposits in plaques within the coronary arteries of the heart.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, the study’s principal investigator and a distinguished clinical and cardiovascular research physician at Intermountain Health, explained that the research aims to improve the selection process for patients who need statins. Instead of relying solely on coronary risk factor equations, the study examines whether direct imaging of plaque burden is a more effective indicator of risk.
The study, which has now enrolled over 5,600 patients, was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago on Saturday. As part of the research, patients’ risk assessment scores were shared with their physicians through letters, indicating whether a statin was recommended based on high-risk findings.
Initial findings revealed that while the two groups in the study had similar baseline characteristics, the rate of statin prescription recommendations varied significantly. The study is expected to conclude in early 2026, after which researchers will compare outcomes such as deaths, heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations over a follow-up period of up to seven years, with an average follow-up of over four years.
Understanding the most effective approach to statin prescription is crucial, given that these medications come with costs and potential side effects, including muscle aches and an increased risk of diabetes. The study’s findings could help refine treatment strategies for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

Title: ChatGPT can be used in sensory evaluation of foods, specifically brownies: study
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A recent study suggests that ChatGPT can be utilized in the sensory evaluation of foods, particularly brownies, offering insights that may streamline new product development and even enhance recipes.
Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US examined 15 different brownie recipes, ranging from traditional ingredient combinations to unconventional ones, such as mealworm powder and fish oil. Study author Damir Torrico, an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provided ChatGPT with these recipe formulas and asked it to describe the sensory characteristics of each brownie, including taste, texture, and overall appeal. He then categorized ChatGPT’s responses to determine whether they were positive, negative, or neutral.
Torrico noted that relying on human testers can sometimes slow down the evaluation process, especially when multiple product prototypes need assessment simultaneously. Sensory panels require time, coordination, and, in some cases, certain ingredients may not be food-grade, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This is why large language models like ChatGPT are being explored for sensory evaluation, as they have the potential to replicate certain human responses.
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s responses were overwhelmingly positive, even for brownies containing unusual ingredients. This aligns with a psychological concept known as “hedonic asymmetry,” which suggests that both humans and AI tend to describe beneficial experiences in more positive terms. Torrico explained that food plays a fundamental role in nourishment and energy, leading humans to respond positively to it. In attempting to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT appeared to exhibit the same tendency, always focusing on the positive aspects of the recipes.
The study suggests that AI can provide general insights into which products are worth further testing and which might not be suitable for a lengthy evaluation process. Torrico believes that ChatGPT could be further developed for sensory evaluation to assist the food industry. Moving forward, he plans to refine the experiment by training ChatGPT to use a vocabulary similar to that of a human descriptive panel.

Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:36:12 +0000
Content: The market outlook for the coming week will be shaped by a combination of domestic and global economic factors, including key indicators such as PMI data, foreign institutional investments (FIIs), auto sales figures, and major US economic data releases. Among the most closely watched developments will be the HSBC Composite PMI data for India, set to be released on Friday, while auto companies will begin reporting their sales figures from Monday.
On the global front, market sentiment will be influenced by policy developments related to India-US tariffs and the potential impact of former US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on finished vehicle imports, which is set to take effect from April 3. Additionally, investors will closely track the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a series of crucial US economic data releases, including job openings, non-farm payrolls, and the unemployment rate.
Last week, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with both the Nifty and Sensex posting gains of approximately 0.70%, closing at 23,519.35 and 77,414.92, respectively. Banking stocks played a key role in driving the rally, with Bank Nifty rising nearly 2% to settle at 51,564.81. Among sectoral indices, Nifty PSE and FMCG emerged as the top performers, whereas media and pharma stocks lagged behind.
Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree, infusing Rs 17,426 crore into equities between March 24 and 28, while domestic institutional investors contributed Rs 6,797 crore during the same period. This consistent inflow of foreign capital helped the Nifty post a 6.3% gain in March, reversing losses from the previous month and closing on a strong note.
The Indian stock market will remain closed on March 31 in observance of Eid.
According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, Nifty has strong support at 23,300, and if breached, it could decline towards 23,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could push the index towards 24,100, potentially extending the ongoing rally.

Title: GRAP-I restrictions revoked in Delhi-NCR as air quality improves
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 02:45:32 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Graded Response Action Plan – Stage I (GRAP-I) in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect after air quality improved in the city.
The decision came after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday clocked 153 as per the daily bulletin provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
The CAQM said that the AQI of the national capital showed significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR.
“AQI of Delhi has shown significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR. The AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 153 for 29.03.2025 (in ‘Moderate’ category). Further, the forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts AQI to mainly remain in the ‘Moderate’ category in the coming days,” CAQM said in a statement.
“Therefore, keeping in view this trend of improvement in the overall AQI of Delhi, the CAQM Sub-Committee unanimously decided to revoke Stage-I of the extant schedule of GRAP in the entire NCR, with immediate effect,” it added.
“All the agencies concerned are also required to take note of various actions and the targeted timelines as envisaged in the comprehensive policy issued by the Commission to curb air pollution in the NCR and take appropriate actions accordingly in the field, particularly the dust mitigation measures for C&amp;D activities &amp; Roads/Open areas, which becomes a pre-dominant factor in the coming months determining the air quality in Delhi-NCR,” CAQM further said.
“The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and review the situation from time to time for further appropriate decision depending upon the air quality in Delhi and the forecast made by IMD/ IITM,” CAQM stated in the statement.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Title: People across country celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with joy and unity
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:13:10 +0000
Content: Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations have begun across the country, with an outpouring of joy and unity as families and communities come together to mark the end of Ramadan.  
The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.  
A child celebrating Eid spoke to ANI after offering his morning prayers and said, “We are celebrating Eid with parents and friends, and all are happy… Whatever people give us (in Eidi), we take it happily.”  
Children embraced each other and wished greetings of Eid-ul-Fitr.  
BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain offered namaz at the Parliament Street mosque in Delhi on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Speaking to ANI, he said, “I extend my best wishes to the people of the country on the occasion of Eid. Today, people have peacefully offered Namaz everywhere. Eid is the day to forget everything and hug each other. I pray that there should be unity in the country and that our country progresses.”  
Shakeel Ahmed, a Pakistani citizen originally from India, said, “I am happy that I came to Delhi, my birthplace, with my relatives to celebrate Eid.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a foreign student of GD Goenka University from Mozambique said, “It was my first time here, and it was one of the best experiences that I had in India… India is very rich in this way. We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”  
On security arrangements for Eid-ul-Fitr, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Central Delhi, M Harsha Vardhan, said, “Today, a huge crowd is observed at the mosques. All the security arrangements have been made in central Delhi. Till now, no case has been reported. We have deployed adequate forces… Arrangements for Navratri have also been made. A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the PM said, “Greetings on Eid-ul-Fitr. May this festival enhance the spirit of hope, harmony, and kindness in our society. May there be joy and success in all your endeavors. Eid Mubarak!”  
President Droupadi Murmu also extended her best wishes on the occasion.  
“Greetings to all countrymen, especially Muslim brothers and sisters, on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This festival strengthens the feeling of brotherhood and conveys the message of compassion and charity. I wish that this festival brings peace, prosperity, and happiness to everyone’s life and strengthens the spirit of moving forward on the path of goodness,” she said in a post on X, in Urdu.  
Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also extended his wishes.  
“Eid Mubarak! May this joyous occasion bring peace, happiness, prosperity, and good health to you and your loved ones.”  
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also shared his warm greetings.  
“On this joyous occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, I extend my warmest greetings to fellow citizens. Eid profoundly evokes feelings of fraternity, compassion, and the spirit of sharing amongst us all, strengthening the pluralistic bonds that unite our people. May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.  
Eid upholds the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. Along with giving Zakat, many also provide meals, clothing, and support to the less fortunate, reflecting Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.

A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Title: 6th BIMSTEC Summit to convene in Bangkok on April 4, focusing on trade, security and regional cooperation
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:46:48 +0000
Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”

The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: SpaceX launches private astronaut crew in Fram2 polar-orbiting mission
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:23:58 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Monday launched a crew of four private astronauts led by a crypto entrepreneur on a mission to orbit Earth from pole to pole, a novel trajectory in which no humans have traveled before.
Maltese investor Chun Wang, a Chinese-born magnate who founded a bitcoin mining company, is the bankroller and commander of the SpaceX mission, named Fram2, a reference to the Norwegian “Fram” ship that pioneered Arctic exploration at the turn of the 20th century.
Wang and three associates launched aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule at 9:47 p.m. EDT on Monday (0147 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, setting off for a free-flying mission for three to five days, during which they will partake in 22 research experiments largely centered on how spaceflight and microgravity affect the human body.
The four crew members on Monday afternoon were driven to the launchpad in a caravan of Teslas – the electric cars of Musk’s other company – winding through the roads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a police escort, as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched overhead in an unrelated Starlink mission.
“We’re gonna watch a rocket launch while on our way to a rocket launch,” Wang wrote on X, the social media site owned by Musk, alongside a video of a Falcon 9 climbing the skies to space during their drive.
The mission, SpaceX’s sixth private astronaut flight, is the company’s latest novel effort that expands its dominance in the global human spaceflight arena. It comes as Musk’s power as SpaceX CEO and the world’s richest man soars as he works as a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, a role that has given him extraordinary influence for a businessman over an array of U.S. policy matters.
Fram2 is the 16th crewed mission overall using the reusable Crew Dragon, a gumdrop-shaped spacecraft that SpaceX developed with NASA funding to provide the U.S. space agency a ride for its astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
SpaceX and its Dragon craft have dominated the nascent market for private orbital spaceflight, an area in which a key source of demand originally came from a small field of wealthy tourists. Dragon is the world’s only privately built capsule routinely flying missions in orbit, as Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule is held up in development.
In recent years, with Dragon flights costing roughly $55 million per seat, the spaceflight market – involving companies such as Axiom Space that contract Crew Dragon missions – has fixated more on astronauts from governments willing to pay the sum mainly for national prestige and bolstering domestic spaceflight experience.
But the Fram2 crew is untethered from government backing. Wang’s friends include Norwegian film director Jannicke Mikkelsen, who specializes in virtual-reality cinematography; German robotics researcher and polar scientist Rabea Rogge, and Australian adventurer Eric Philips, who has taken up ambitious skiing expeditions in Earth’s harsh polar regions.

Title: South Korea Constitutional Court to rule on Yoon’s impeachment on April 4
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:12:36 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court, which is reviewing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment, will announce its decision on whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him on April 4, the court said in a statement on Tuesday.
The court said the ruling will be delivered at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) and live broadcast of the session will be permitted.
Yoon was impeached by parliament on December 14 after being accused of violating his constitutional duty by declaring martial law in early December with no justifiable grounds.
The suspended leader has said he never intended to fully impose military rule but instead meant to sound the alarm over the opposition Democratic Party’s abuse of its parliamentary majority that he argued was threatening to destroy the country.
In his final statement before the court ended arguments on February 25, Yoon also said his decision to declare martial law was an appeal to the people to overcome “anti-state forces”, pro-North Korea sympathisers, and opposition gridlock.
The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the dollar after the announcement of the ruling date. The stock market’s benchmark was up 1.5% after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5%.
The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when 6 or more judges agree, according to South Korea’s constitution.
The wait of more than a month for the time of the ruling has fuelled a bitter clash between the ruling party, with many of its members calling for Yoon’s reinstatement, and the opposition, which has said his return would deal a serious blow to the country’s constitutional order.
The looming decision has also deepened division among the public, with large crowds packing downtown streets in rallies for and against Yoon’s removal, with rhetoric becoming increasingly heated. Police are bracing for potential violence once the ruling is announced.
The People Power Party’s floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, welcomed the announcement and said the ruling party will accept the court’s decision but warned “social conflict will become stronger whatever the decision is”.
The Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said he was confident the court will rule unanimously against Yoon.
The majority of the public backs Yoon’s removal, according to opinion polls, although support has ebbed since the initial days after the martial law declaration last December.
A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed 60% of the respondents saying Yoon should be ousted.
NEW ELECTION WITHIN 60 DAYS IF YOON OUSTED
Parliamentary lawyers seeking his removal compared Yoon to a dictator during their final arguments at his impeachment trial.
Yoon, a former prosecutor who has seen his popularity dive, could face removal from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if his impeachment is upheld, marking a tumultuous end to a tenure marred by political turmoil.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon is also on a separate criminal trial on charges of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law and faces the death penalty or life in prison if convicted although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997.
His shock martial law announcement, which banned political and parliamentary activity, triggered a constitutional crisis that also led to the impeachment of the prime minister who became acting president.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was reinstated on March 24 by the Constitutional Court and resumed his role as acting president.
In an impeachment trial in 2017, eight justices of the court at the time unanimously backed a decision to oust the then President Park Geun-hye for violating her constitutional duty.

Title: India nears Naxalism-free goal as most affected districts drop to six: Home Minister Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced a significant reduction in the number of districts most affected by Left-Wing Extremism (LWE), also known as Naxalism, stating that the number has dropped from 12 to just 6. This reduction marks a key milestone in the ongoing efforts to create a Naxalism-free India.
In a post on X, Shah highlighted the Modi government’s “ruthless approach” towards eradicating Naxalism and emphasized the country’s commitment to fostering development across all regions. “The Modi government is determined to build a Sashakt, Surakshit, and Samriddh Bharat with relentless efforts for all-encompassing development and a firm stance against Naxalism. We are committed to uprooting Naxalism completely by 31st March 2026,” he stated.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of districts affected by Naxalism in India had previously been 38. Out of these, the number of “most affected” districts has now decreased to 6, with a parallel reduction in the number of “Districts of Concern” and “Other LWE-affected Districts.”
The six districts most affected by Naxalism now include four from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli).
Additionally, the number of “Districts of Concern,” which require intensified resources and attention, has been reduced from 9 to 6. These districts are located in Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem).
The number of “Other LWE-affected Districts,” which are also experiencing Naxal activity but to a lesser degree, has dropped from 17 to 6. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariaband, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu).
To support these districts in their recovery and development, central govt provides financial assistance under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme. The most affected districts receive Rs. 30 crore, while Districts of Concern are allocated Rs. 10 crore to fill gaps in public infrastructure. Special projects tailored to the needs of these areas are also funded by the government.

Title: US, Denmark to hold first high-level talks since Trump’s win
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:45:00 +0000
Content: Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen is set to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week in the first high-level talks since President Donald Trump’s re-election and his vow to “take control” of Greenland, the Financial Times said.
The prospect of such talks comes amid simmering tension between the two nations over U.S. interest in taking control of Greenland, the Arctic island controlled by Denmark since 1721.
The meeting is planned for the sidelines of a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels set to begin on Thursday, the paper said on Tuesday, citing two officials briefed on the preparations.
However, the officials warned the event could be cancelled because of tense relations between Copenhagen and Washington, it added.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland from April 2 to 4 for talks with the new government of the semi-autonomous territory just days after a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.
On his trip, Vance accused Denmark of not doing a good job of keeping the island safe and suggested the United States would better protect the strategically located island.

Title: India’s most-capped women’s player Vandana Katariya bids farewell to international hockey
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:04:41 +0000
Content: Indian women’s hockey stalwart Vandana Katariya has officially announced her retirement from international hockey, bringing an end to an illustrious career spanning over 15 years.
With 320 international appearances and 158 goals to her name, Vandana departs as the most-capped player in the history of Indian women’s hockey. Beyond the numbers, she leaves behind an inspiring legacy—one of resilience, quiet determination, and an unwavering commitment to elevating Indian women’s hockey.
The 32-year-old forward, who made her senior team debut in 2009, was an integral part of several defining moments in the sport, including India’s historic fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where she became the first and only Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Games.
Announcing her retirement, Vandana, who played her last match for India during the Bhubaneswar leg of the FIH Pro League 2024-25 in February, reflected on her journey with mixed emotions.
“This decision wasn’t easy, but I know it’s the right time. Hockey has been my life for as long as I can remember, and wearing the Indian jersey was the greatest honour. But every journey has its course, and I leave with immense pride, gratitude, and love for the sport. Indian hockey is in great hands, and I will always be its biggest supporter.”
She extended heartfelt appreciation to everyone who played a role in her career. “I want to thank my coaches, teammates, support staff, Hockey India, my family, and all the fans who have supported me over the years. Every cheer, every message, every word of encouragement meant the world to me.”
Hailing from Roshnabad, Haridwar, Vandana’s journey began like that of many young girls in India—on dusty fields with dreams far bigger than her circumstances. Over the years, she represented India on the grandest stages, including two Olympic Games (Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020), two FIH Hockey Women’s World Cups (2018, 2022), three Commonwealth Games (2014, 2018, 2022), and three Asian Games (2014, 2018, 2022).
Her contributions were instrumental in India’s rise in world hockey. She played a pivotal role in securing gold medals at the Women’s Asian Champions Trophy (2016, 2023) and the FIH Hockey Women’s Nations Cup (2022), silver medals at the 2018 Asian Games, the 2013 and 2018 Women’s Asian Champions Trophy, and bronze medals at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the 2014 and 2022 Asian Games, and the FIH Hockey Pro League 2021-22.
Hockey India President Dilip Tirkey paid tribute to Vandana’s contributions, saying, “Vandana was not just a goal scorer; she was the heartbeat of the Indian attack, a tireless worker, and a leader by example. Her presence in the forward line gave India an edge, especially in high-pressure situations. She has set a benchmark for future generations, and we at Hockey India are immensely proud of her achievements. We wish her the very best in her future endeavours.”
Vandana was also a key member of India’s bronze medal-winning squad at the 2013 Junior World Cup, finishing as the team’s top scorer and the tournament’s third-highest goal scorer.
Apart from representing India in multiple global tournaments, Vandana featured in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Hockey India League in 2025, playing for Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers.
Among her many achievements, Vandana’s Tokyo Olympics heroics remain unforgettable. Her hat-trick in a crucial 4-3 victory over South Africa helped India reach the quarterfinals and secure their best-ever Olympic finish.
Speaking about that defining moment, Vandana said, “I still get goosebumps thinking about Tokyo. The Olympics are special, and that match against South Africa was one of the most emotional games of my life. I just wanted to give everything for my team, for my country. The hattrick was special, but more than that, it was about proving that we belonged on that stage.”
For her immense contributions, Vandana was honoured with some of India’s most prestigious awards, including the Arjuna Award (2021) and the Padma Shri (2022). She also received the Hockey India Balbir Singh Sr. Award for Player of the Year (Women) in 2014, the Hockey India President’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2021, and the Hockey India Dhanraj Pillay Award for Forward of the Year in 2021 and 2022, cementing her status as one of India’s finest forwards.
Hockey India Secretary General Bhola Nath Singh lauded her remarkable journey, stating, “Vandana’s journey is nothing short of inspirational. From her early days to becoming a stalwart of Indian hockey, she has shown exceptional skill, resilience, and commitment. Her performances in crucial matches, especially at the Tokyo Olympics, will be remembered for years to come. As she takes her final bow, she leaves behind a legacy of resilience, excellence, and inspiration—one that will continue to guide the next generation of Indian hockey stars.”

Title: Mumbai scouts find another IPL gem in paceman Ashwani
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:46:08 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya heaped praise on his team’s scouting department for unearthing another gem in Ashwani Kumar, after the pace bowler produced the best figures by an Indian on his Indian Premier League debut.
The 23-year-old Ashwani bagged 4-24 in three overs on Monday to help dismiss reigning champions Kolkata Knight Riders for 116 in 16.2 overs before Mumbai secured an eight-wicket victory to open their account in this year’s tournament.
Ashwani’s heroics came after spinner Vignesh Puthur claimed 3-32 on his debut in Mumbai’s defeat by Chennai Super Kings last week, and Pandya was delighted with the team’s latest find.
“I’m really happy for the young kid,” said Pandya.
“It’s all the scouts, they picked him. They’ve gone to all places and picked these young kids. We played a practice game, he had that zip, that late swing, something off the wicket, a different action and he was a lefty.”
Mumbai batsman Ryan Rickelton also played a big role in the win with an unbeaten 62, but said Ashwani had laid the foundation with his deceptive pace and swing.
“He’s a lot quicker than people recognise at first. I think that’s a great attribute he has, and he can swing the new ball,” South African Rickelton added.
“I know it’s quite tough, we’ve got two specialist swing bowlers with the new ball as well, but to have that second plan without that swing factor was really impressive … He rushes you a little bit as well.
“He’s a great addition to the group and the wicket can suit him. Looking forward to seeing, if he gets the opportunity, his other set of skills come through. He’s a nice find for Mumbai.”

Content: Teenage batting prodigy Sam Konstas has been added to Australia’s list of contracted players in a huge vote of confidence for the two-test opener.
The 19-year-old was named among 23 contracted players on Tuesday, three months on from making a memorable 60 in his international debut in the Melbourne test against India.
Konstas was one of three players to earn their first national contracts, joining spinner Matt Kuhnemann and all-rounder Beau Webster.
White-ball all-rounders Sean Abbott and Aaron Hardie, and seven-test spinner Todd Murphy made way for the new trio.
“In Sam, we see promising upside in a young player who will continue to develop at the first-class level and in the international environment,” selector George Bailey said in a statement.
Kuhnemann’s contract is another boost for the left-arm spinner who was recently cleared of having a suspect bowling action following his prolific tour of Sri Lanka.
Kuhnemann was reported for his bowling action after he was Player of the Series with 16 wickets in Sri Lanka.
Tasmania all-rounder Webster has had a strong entry into test cricket since his Sydney debut against India, scoring 150 runs at an average of 50.00 from his three matches along with three wickets with his medium pace.
“Matt was outstanding once again in Sri Lanka and we believe he can play a key role across the next 18 months,” said Bailey.
“In Beau’s case, he proved more than comfortable at Test level with bat and ball, adds an additional dimension in the field and to the balance of the side.”
With 20 out of 23 players retaining their contracts, selectors have opted for continuity over change for an aging Australian squad.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh may feel fortunate to be included after the 33-year-old was dropped during the test series against India after a dreadful run of scores.
Pace bowler Jhye Richardson was retained despite nearly three years passing since his last international match.
Fringe pace bowlers Lance Morris and Xavier Bartlett also kept their contracts after barely featuring for Australia in the 2024/25 season.

Title: China launches military drills around Taiwan, calls its president a ‘parasite’
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:26:48 +0000
Content: China began joint army, navy and rocket force exercises around Taiwan on Tuesday as a “stern warning” against separatism and called Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te a “parasite”, as Taiwan sent warships to respond to China’s navy approaching its coast.
The exercises around the democratically governed island, which China views as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring under its control, come after Lai called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” last month.
China detests Lai as a “separatist,” and in a video accompanying the Eastern Theatre Command’s announcement of the drills depicted him as cartoon bug held by a pair of chopsticks above a burning Taiwan, calling him in English a “parasite”.
“The focus is on exercises such as combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets, and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes,” the Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills, with the presidential office saying China was “widely recognised by the international community as a troublemaker” and that the government has the confidence and ability to defend itself.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.
Two senior Taiwan officials told Reuters that more than 10 Chinese military ships had approached close to Taiwan’s 24 nautical mile (44 km) contiguous zone and Taiwan sent its own warships to respond.
However, Taiwan has not detected any live fire by the Chinese military, one of the officials said.
TAIWAN DISPATCHES WARSHIPS
Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered the island’s response area on Monday, adding that it had dispatched military aircraft and ships and activated land-based missile systems in response.
The drills took place after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth left the region following visits to Japan and the Philippines, where he criticised China and said Japan was “indispensable” for tackling Chinese aggression.
A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters, citing internal assessments, that Beijing needed to avoid any “perceived confrontation” with Washington prior to the U.S.-China trade talks, and thus Taiwan has become a pretext.
“Taiwan is their best excuse. That’s why they chose to launch such military drills as soon as the U.S. defence secretary left Asia,” the official said.
The de facto U.S. embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, said the United States will continue to support the island.
“Once again, China has shown that it is not a responsible actor and has no problem putting the region’s security and prosperity at risk,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
“CLOSING IN”
China’s military released a series of propaganda videos in quick succession after the drill announcement, depicting Chinese warships and fighter jets encircling Taiwan, Taipei being aimed at from above, and military vehicles patrolling city streets.
A video of a poster accompanying the drills titled “Closing In,” and showing Chinese forces surrounding the island, was released on the Eastern Theatre Command’s Weibo.
This was followed by a video titled “Shell”, depicting president Lai as a green cartoon bug spawning parasites across the island, on the Eastern Theatre Command’s WeChat page.
“Parasite poisoning Taiwan island. Parasite hollowing Island out. Parasite courting ultimate destruction,” the animation said.
Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said such rhetoric was not conducive to peace and “shows their provocative character,” when asked about Lai’s cartoon depiction.
A third video, “Subdue Demons and Vanquish Evils”, featured Sun Wukong, the magical monkey king from the Ming Dynasty epic “Journey to the West” as he is depicted in the “Black Myth: Wukong” hit video game.
It opens with the video’s title flashing across the screen and the Chinese mythical warrior riding on clouds before cutting to footage of Chinese fighter jets.
“The joint exercise and training conducted by the Eastern Theatre of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the vicinity of Taiwan Island is a resolute punishment for the Lai Ching-Te authorities’ rampant ‘independence’ provocations,” said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.
Taiwan’s Koo told reporters the PLA should focus first on resolving its issues with corruption instead of destroying peace and stability in the region.
China’s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge over the past few years, which saw former Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu ousted in October 2024.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Koo’s remarks.
The Taiwan security source, citing internal intelligence assessments, said China was trying to busy its military with exercises as a way of distracting and stopping its soldiers from discussing the corruption crackdown amongst themselves on base.
China’s coast guard said it was also taking part in the drills, saying it was simulating “inspection and capture, interception and detention operations against unwarranted vessels” to show its exercise of “legitimate jurisdiction” over Taiwan.
The Global Times, which is owned by the People’s Daily newspaper of the governing Chinese Communist Party, said the drill had not been given a code name to show that Chinese military forces surrounding the island “has become a normal practice,” citing Zhang Chi of National Defence University.
“Through a series of exercises held in the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the PLA has strongly enhanced its ability to prepare for war and fight battles,” the article on the paper’s Weixin social media page added.
China has staged several rounds of war games around Taiwan since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in 2022.

Title: The next UPI? How an India energy stack can lead the digital energy revolution
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:06:39 +0000
Content: At the United Nations’ first International Conference on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in April 2024, held under India’s leadership, the global discussion centered on how this framework can accelerate sustainable development and promote inclusivity.
As a participant in these discussions, it was evident that India’s success in building open, interoperable, and citizen-centric DPIs has set a global benchmark.
While Aadhaar has transformed delivery of public services, social security and welfare measure for a large target audience, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has disrupted traditional banking and finance to make it inclusive and universally available to all.
These DPIs have demonstrated how technology can bridge accessibility gaps, improve governance, enhance efficiency, and unlock economic opportunities at scale.
India’s DPI revolution has proved that open digital infrastructure can accelerate social and economic development across sectors. This same digital-first approach also holds immense potential to address one of the country’s most complex challenges—energy transition.
The case for an India energy stack 
With a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and a net-zero commitment by 2070, India is moving forward to modernize its aging power grid, integrate large-scale renewable energy, and ensure affordability and accessibility for all.
However, several systemic barriers hinder this transition. Intermittent renewable supply, inefficient grid management, and a lack of real-time energy data make large-scale clean energy integration challenging. Financially struggling distribution companies, land acquisition hurdles, and storage constraints add further roadblocks. Fragmented policy implementation and regulatory misalignment between central and state governments hinder efficiency and slow progress.
To overcome these challenges, India needs a digitally integrated energy ecosystem—an ‘India Energy Stack’—that enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, much like the India UPI Stack transformed financial services.
Benefits of an energy stack 
India’s energy governance must transition from a fragmented, legacy energy system to a digitally integrated, intelligent, and citizen-centric model.
A unified digital energy architecture could unlock efficiencies that today remain out of reach. Grid reliability could be transformed through real-time intelligence, markets could become more transparent and competitive, and decentralized renewable energy could be scaled more effectively.
Moreover, the convergence of AI, blockchain, and IoT in the energy sector has the potential to create a self-regulating, demand-responsive system, reducing inefficiencies and ensuring that energy flows dynamically when and where it is needed most.
A digital-first approach could also make India’s energy transition more equitable. By embedding granular data tracking and real-time analytics, clean energy can be expanded without placing additional strain on grid networks.
What can India do? 

India must establish a Digital Energy Identity (DEID) for every consumer, prosumer, and energy producer to enable seamless participation in energy markets, targeted subsidy distribution, and decentralized renewable energy trading. While Aadhaar can serve as a foundational identity layer, DEID should be designed specifically to track energy consumption, facilitate dynamic pricing, and integrate with real-time market mechanisms.
A UPI-linked digital payment system for electricity can streamline transactions, allowing consumers to pay bills, trade surplus solar energy, and receive instant credits, eliminating inefficiencies in billing and settlement while improving financial inclusion. This could accelerate the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, enabling seamless payments for households selling excess rooftop solar power to the grid, ensuring faster crediting and wider adoption of decentralized renewable energy.
India must leverage the National Smart Grid Mission, which focuses on automation, communication, and IT systems to enhance real-time grid reliability. AI-driven forecasting and IoT-enabled smart meters should be deployed to predict demand fluctuations, prevent outages, and enable dynamic pricing. These technologies will help utilities optimize energy distribution, reduce peak load stress, and lower costs while ensuring better integration of renewables into the grid.
India must develop a National Energy Data Platform (NEDP), building on NITI Aayog’s India Energy Dashboards (IED), to serve as a real-time, open energy data exchange. This platform should provide utilities, regulators, and startups with access to granular consumption patterns, grid load forecasts, and decentralized energy trading insights. A sandbox for innovation can help startups develop new use cases to improve demand-supply planning, optimize pricing, and enhance service efficiency, while standardized data drives market innovation, strengthens grid reliability, and supports AI-powered decision-making for a more adaptive energy ecosystem.
India must integrate blockchain technology into its newly launched Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) to ensure real-time verification, prevent fraud, and enhance market transparency. A decentralized, tamper-proof system can streamline carbon credit transactions, boosting investor confidence and attracting climate finance. This will position the country as a leader in global carbon markets, fostering a robust green investment ecosystem.

A well-executed India Energy Stack will not only accelerate India’s clean energy transition but also position the country as a global leader in digital energy innovation. However, its success will depend on addressing key challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and the infrastructure costs of digital adoption. A robust regulatory framework and targeted incentives will be crucial to drive industry participation and ensure seamless integration.
This is India’s moment to set the standard for a future where energy is smarter, greener, and fully aligned with our vision of Viksit Bharat.

Title: UPI transaction volume up 13.5% in March, value at record Rs 24.77 lakh crore
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:54:13 +0000
Content: The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) saw a 13.59% increase in transaction volume in March, reaching 18.3 billion transactions, compared to 16.11 billion in February, according to data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
March recorded a record Rs 24.77 lakh crore worth of UPI-based transactions, marking a 12.79% increase from Rs 21.96 lakh crore in February.
On a daily basis, the UPI network saw more than 590 million average transactions, totaling Rs 79,910 crore in daily transaction value, according to NPCI data.
On a year-on-year basis, the record-breaking UPI transactions in March amounted to Rs 24.77 lakh crore, representing a 25% surge in value and an impressive 36% growth in volume. This highlights the unstoppable momentum of India’s digital payments revolution.
With daily transactions averaging Rs 79,910 crore (up 1.9% from February), and volumes rising by 2.6%, these numbers underscore the rapid adoption and trust in digital financial solutions.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, digital payment users experienced issues processing transactions on UPI. The NPCI attributed the problem to the closing of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).
“Today, due to the financial year closing, some banks are facing intermittent transaction declines. The UPI system is working fine, and we are working with the concerned banks for necessary redressal,” the NPCI said in a statement.
Starting April 1, it will be mandatory for UPI member banks, UPI apps, and third-party providers to follow new guidelines.
According to the new norms, the UPI ID linked to an inactive mobile number will become inactive. That is, if the mobile number registered with a bank is inactive for an extended period, the UPI ID of the user will also be unlinked, and the user will no longer be able to use the UPI service.
As a result, every UPI user must ensure that the mobile number registered with their bank is active.
Under the new guidelines, the user’s bank-verified mobile number will act as the UPI identifier. Additionally, banks and UPI applications must update their mobile number records every week to prevent issues arising from recycled or modified numbers.

Title: A focused article on the essential traits, tools, and strategies required for leadership in a rapidly evolving, tech-driven world
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:22:52 +0000
Content: In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of technology, leadership is undergoing a radical transformation. What was once a role focused primarily on managing IT systems has evolved into a multifaceted position centered around driving strategic innovation, fostering business growth, and enabling cross-functional collaboration. Digital leaders today must navigate the complexities of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing, all of which are reshaping industries. As these innovations bring about new opportunities, they also require a new set of leadership traits and strategies to harness their potential responsibly.
As a leading advocate for responsible digital leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the AI Summit in Paris, emphasized the need for AI systems free from biases. “AI is writing the codes of humanity in this century, but we must ensure that these codes are free from biases,” he stated. Modi’s remarks highlight the crucial responsibility of digital leaders—not only to harness cutting-edge technology but to do so in an ethical, transparent, and inclusive manner. Open-source systems and high-quality, unbiased datasets play a vital role in this effort. As digital leaders, we must ensure that the technologies we implement benefit society as a whole, advancing progress while avoiding the perpetuation of harmful biases or inequalities.
India’s own journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse provides a shining example of visionary leadership. Through initiatives like Digital India, the country has transformed itself into a global leader in the digital space. The initiative has focused on improving digital governance, building digital infrastructure, and enhancing digital literacy. With over 950 million internet users, India is proving that technology is a powerful tool for economic growth and better public service delivery. However, as India’s experience illustrates, true digital leadership is not about simply mastering the latest technologies; it is about using these tools to create meaningful impact and drive societal progress.
At the heart of successful digital leadership are certain essential traits. Adaptability and agility are paramount in a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed. Digital leaders must not only keep up with technological disruptions but also anticipate changes and lead their organizations through transitions. Whether it’s adopting AI, blockchain, or automation, leaders must remain flexible, open to change, and able to pivot when necessary.
Data-driven decision-making is another crucial trait for digital leaders. In the digital age, data is one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. Effective leaders must leverage data analytics to make informed decisions, guide strategic initiatives, and drive innovation. But data’s power comes with responsibility. Our Prime Minister’s call for unbiased AI systems highlights the vital role leaders play in ensuring that data is accurate, inclusive, and free from bias to create a fair future. Data should serve to improve fairness and transparency, and leaders must prioritize ethical considerations in their decision-making.
Yet, the ability to navigate technology and data is only part of what makes a great digital leader. Ethical leadership plays a critical role in ensuring that technology is used for the benefit of society. As AI, automation, and other advanced technologies reshape industries, leaders must be proactive in addressing privacy concerns, mitigating biases, and promoting transparency. Trust and accountability are essential elements of ethical leadership, and it is up to leaders to guide their organizations in a way that benefits all stakeholders. AI, for example, offers immense potential for improving lives and businesses, but it also raises questions around privacy, fairness, and discrimination. It is the responsibility of digital leaders to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly, without causing harm.
Another fundamental aspect of effective leadership in the digital era is emotional intelligence (EQ). While technical expertise is essential, the ability to navigate human relationships is equally important. Self-awareness, empathy, and communication skills are essential for leaders to build trust, foster collaboration, and resolve conflicts effectively. In an increasingly remote and hybrid work environment, clear and empathetic communication becomes even more crucial. The ability to connect with teams, stakeholders, and customers on a personal level is what ultimately makes a leader effective, especially when navigating the complexities of digital transformation.
Visionary thinking is also a defining trait of digital leadership. The digital world is constantly changing, and leaders must be able to anticipate the next big trend, identify opportunities, and guide their organizations toward success. Leaders who think long-term, who can envision the future of their industries and align technology with strategic goals, will lead the way in shaping the future. India’s Digital India initiative is a prime example of visionary leadership, where the country’s leadership proactively anticipated the digital revolution and took steps to ensure India could lead in this space.
To effectively lead in the digital era, digital leaders must also embrace the right tools and strategies. Cloud computing and data analytics are indispensable in helping organizations make real-time decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation. The ability to store, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data is transforming the way businesses operate and engage with customers. AI and automation are also revolutionizing industries by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. However, as these technologies evolve, leaders must strike a balance between efficiency and ethics. Automation, for example, can result in significant improvements in productivity, but it can also displace jobs if not implemented thoughtfully.
Fostering innovation is a critical component of successful digital leadership. Leaders must create environments where experimentation is encouraged, risks are taken, and learning is continuous. To remain competitive in the digital economy, organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforces. As technology evolves, so too must the skills of employees. Those who fail to keep pace with digital advancements risk becoming obsolete. By investing in continuous learning, leaders ensure that their teams remain agile and ready to tackle new challenges.
Looking to the future, the digital leader of tomorrow will need to embody a blend of technical expertise, ethical responsibility, emotional intelligence, and visionary thinking. The pace of technological change shows no sign of slowing, and the leaders who succeed will be those who can adapt quickly, make informed decisions based on data, and champion ethical and inclusive technology practices. India’s journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse offers valuable insights into how visionary leadership can drive national transformation, and the world is watching closely. In this new era, the digital leader is not just a technologist but a champion of responsible, impactful technology use—one who recognizes the power of technology to shape the future and uses it to build a better, more inclusive world.

Title: Indian Prime Minister leading the men for women vision, calling for a change in the gender imbalance in personal, social and professional lives
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:16:49 +0000
Content: The Mahabharata celebrates the presence of Krishna, a symbol for the antar-atma or inner wisdom, supporting queen Draupadi when she was wronged but none of her dear ones came to help. The ancient culture of India is replete with such stories when men and women stood by each other and created a good life together by sharing strengths. Krishna and Draupadi’s relationship was that of friendship and care, representing the core moral compass for any bond on earth. The story also emphasizes on the responsibilities of a ‘friend’ who must be there for each other in times of need. Friends may or may not be able to fight our battles on our behalf, but they are available to sharpen our arms and wash our wounds.

Women’s emancipation, globally, has been a concern for centuries. The movements have been slow, but firm and steady. Many men had come forward partnering the women in their struggles to unshackle from regressive traditions that made their worlds smaller. Such men have appeared in conservative families and narrow-minded societies, soldiering against women’s exploitations, irrespective of their personal equations with them. They stood the ground as true friends, attempting to change perspectives in favour of a fair and equal society. Men’s growing support over the years have enhanced the voices of women in raising awareness and challenging deep-rooted biases. From the fathers educating their daughters for an independent and respectful future, brothers sharing household chores, to the colleagues imparting tough training to prepare women employees for corporate growth or enforcing a safe and positive working environment – men’s cooperation normalizes women’s participation in all spheres, making it a shared responsibility rather than a women-only cause. Also, men who actively promote gender equality set strong examples for future generations.

Throughout history, several male leaders across the world have played a crucial role in championing women’s emancipation, challenging patriarchal norms, and advocating for gender equality. In India, Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a pioneering social reformer who fought against the inhumane practice of sati and worked towards women’s rights in education and inheritance. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was instrumental in advocating for girls’ education and widow remarriage, which led to the enactment of the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first Vice President and second President of India, was a proponent of women’s education. In August 1848, Jyotirao Phule, and his wife, Savitribai opened the first girls’ school in Pune with nine girls from different social backgrounds, soon expanding to 18 schools for girls and children from Dalit families, between 1848 and 1852. Authors like Rabindranath Tagore, Vishnu Prabhakar, Premchand, Mulk Raj Anand, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and others included strong women characters in their novels which made people think. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher and politician, strongly advocated for gender equality. In the United States, Abraham Lincoln, though primarily known for abolishing slavery, believed in the fundamental equality of all individuals, supporting women’s rights movements. Theodore Roosevelt pushed for women’s right to vote. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela actively promoted women’s rights, recognizing that true freedom could not be achieved without gender equality. He appointed women to key government positions and worked to dismantle discriminatory practices. Ban Ki-moon, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, launched initiatives like HeForShe, encouraging men to participate in the fight for gender equality.

Studies show that economies with higher female workforce participation experience sustained economic growth and improved living standards. Political leaders across the world are redefining the norms to include women in all social functions, governance and business. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for women’s liberation is deeply rooted in the fact that India’s growth is incomplete without the progress of its women. One of our biggest opportunities is that India is a country with over 1.4 billion people, where women make up nearly half the population. Their full participation is key to economic prosperity. By 2036, India’s population is expected to reach 1.522 billion, with approximately 750 million women. When women have equal access to education, employment, and leadership roles, the GDP rises, poverty declines, and systems strengthen. According to an International Monetary Fund report, women’s workforce participation on par with men could boost India’s GDP by 27 per cent. If 50 percent of skilled women join the workforce, the growth rate could rise 1.5 per cent to 9 percent per year. One of the biggest challenges is India’s demographic divide. Unlike many Western nations, where the majority of people live in urban centers, India’s rural and semi-urban population remains dominant. Women in these areas, especially from lower castes and tribal backgrounds, have historically faced limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
The Modi government has aggressively pushed for grassroot-level leadership, ensuring that women from the most marginalized communities receive education and training to become local leaders, business owners, and policymakers. By educating these women and giving them a platform, the government is fostering self-reliance, ensuring that they do not remain dependent on male family members for their financial and personal decisions. PM Modi has been vocal about his focus, especially on raising the marginalized women’s position in India, attempting to transform silent contributors into informed decision-makers.

In July 2018, PM Modi, addressing over one crore women, emphasized youth skill development and women empowerment under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana. In Chhattisgarh, 122 Bihan Bazaar outlets across 22 districts sell over 200 Self-Help Group (SHG) products. Since 2014, 20 lakh SHGs have been formed, benefiting 2.25 crore families, adding an earning member to five crore rural households by 2018. Since 2014, women-centric policies have fostered Nari Shakti-led development as a pillar of New India. Initiatives like Self-Help Groups, Lakhpati Didi, and Drone Didi have boosted rural women’s economic empowerment. By December 2024, ₹9.74 lakh crore had been provided to women-led SHGs. India has 25,385 women welfare cooperatives and 1,44,396 dairy cooperatives employing rural women. As of March 2025, 90.87 lakh SHGs support 10.05 crore rural families. Under Lakhpati Didi, women in SHGs receive interest-free loans of ₹5 lakh. India’s development story today is spearheaded by grassroot entrepreneurs and leaders across gender, caste and locations. The remote locations have been especially monitored, ensuring that the huge potentials of the country are being increasingly realized. 
One of the most symbolic acknowledgments of women’s power has been their increasing representation in the Padma Awards, India’s highest civilian honors. Under the Modi government, a large number of grassroots women leaders, social workers, and change-makers—many from humble backgrounds—have been recognized for their contributions. This has sent a strong message to patriarchal societies in rural and remote areas, forcing men to acknowledge and respect women’s achievements. When a tribal woman, a rural teacher, or a female scientist receives a national honor, it compels the men in their communities to rethink traditional gender roles.

When the Prime Minister of a country actively champions women’s empowerment, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring men across all sections of society to adopt a similar outlook. India is a country of diverse cultures and practices, spread over a large rural and remote landscape, neck deep in superstitions and ill practices because of lack of exposure and infrastructure. PM Narendra Modi’s consistent emphasis on women’s dignity, inclusion, and success is targeting a national mindset shift, encouraging men to respect, support, and uplift women in their own families, workplaces, and communities. His speeches often highlight the contributions of women in various fields. With significant infrastructural developments and rewarding women achievers from remote communities, a strong message is constantly being passed to the men of the backward communities to build the life-frame together by sharing responsibilities instead of looking down at women as the weaker sections. PM Modi has frequently spoken about women achievers in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ program, he has personally met and honored women like Nari Shakti Puraskar awardees, grassroots leaders, and athletes. He acknowledged the critical contributions of the women scientists during his interactions with ISRO’s women engineers for Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 missions.
Events like Pariksha Pe Charcha found him motivating girls to excel in academics and overcome societal pressures. He also met young female innovators, such as those from Atal Tinkering Labs, praising their scientific achievements. In 2023, he met Purnima Devi Barman, an award-winning conservationist, praising her work in protecting the greater adjutant stork. He has also appreciated Tulsi Gowda, a Padma Shri awardee known as the “Encyclopedia of Forests,” for her lifelong dedication to afforestation. During global summits like COP26 and G20, he has highlighted the contributions of women in climate action. In 2023, he also interacted with schoolgirls at the G20 Summit’s “Mission LiFE” event, urging them to take leadership in climate action. His encouragement of female students, especially in STEM fields, has reinforced the importance of education in empowering young women to shape India’s future.

By consistently advocating for women’s progress, PM Modi has set an example for millions of men. It shows, in the way the society is opening up for women, fostering an environment of trust and sharing. Each successful woman inspires a thousand more to believe in their competence. Every supporting man inspires ten others to believe in social justice. The ratio is obviously not parallel, and hence it will take a long time for a holistic change. The good news is that things have started turning with the Prime Minister of the country taking the lead and openly discussing women’s success and the importance of such progress. The mountains that must be brought down and the dark prisons to be shattered have been identified. Business leaders ensuring equal pay, houses where a girl-child is not someone to be married off and fathers treating women as equals becoming the male role model for boys, a society that leaves stereotypes and discriminations behind – the path is long and demanding. A large number of men and women today are committed to fostering a healthy and competitive environment, targeting exponential growth in terms of learning and output. They are dedicated and are even fighting the mind-blocks of self and others, to protect, upheld and empower the collective Indian dream.

Title: Sensex plunges nearly 2 percent amid US tariff concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:15:51 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets plunged on Tuesday, the first trading session of the new financial year, as investors reacted to global trade tensions ahead of the US reciprocal tariff announcement on Wednesday.
The Sensex tumbled 1,390.41 points, or 1.80 percent, closing at 76,024.51, after swinging between an intra-day high of 77,487.05 and a low of 75,912.18. The Nifty 50 also slumped 353.65 points, or 1.50 percent, to settle at 23,165.70, with an intra-day range of 23,565.15 to 23,136.40.
The selloff was broad-based, with most Sensex stocks ending in the red, except Zomato, IndusInd Bank, and State Bank of India (SBI).
Top losers included HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, and Infosys, which declined up to 3.66 percent.
Midcap and smallcap stocks also faced pressure. Nifty Midcap100 lost 0.86 percent, while Nifty Smallcap100 dipped 0.70 percent.
The BSE Midcap index dropped 0.9 percent, whereas the Smallcap index edged up 0.2 percent.
Sectorally, IT, real estate, and consumer durables fell nearly 2 percent each, while media, oil & gas, and telecom stocks managed to stay positive.
Investor sentiment turned jittery, with India VIX—known as the fear index—surging 8.37 percent to 13.78, indicating increased market uncertainty.
“Amid heightened global volatility ahead of the anticipated US reciprocal tariff announcement tomorrow (US time), the domestic market witnessed a significant sell-off today. Investors are eagerly awaiting the specifics of these tariffs while also keeping a close eye on ongoing negotiations for a potential Indo-US trade agreement,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited.
The IT sector bore the brunt of the selloff due to its heavy exposure to the US market, while real estate stocks tumbled after Maharashtra raised ready reckoner rates, impacting property valuations.

Title: Women-Government partnership is communicating and chartering the Indian growth story for global audience
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:06:48 +0000
Content: Women possess innate leadership qualities like resilience, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, which enable them to manage households, finances, and communities even in the lowest economic strata. Their emotional intelligence helps build strong relationships, mediate conflicts, and foster collaboration, making them effective leaders in both grassroots and corporate settings. Women bring fresh perspectives, drive ethical decision-making, and enhance organizational productivity, with diverse leadership teams often proving to be more innovative and financially successful. Their success as entrepreneurs, particularly in microfinance and self-help groups, further demonstrates that leadership thrives in determination and vision, regardless of socio-economic background.
As per a McKinsey Global Institute report, India could achieve an 18 percent increase over business-as-usual GDP (USD 770 billion) by 2025 if the full potential of women in the workforce are unlocked. This would create a multiplier effect with time, and would ensure that India would be able to keep up our growth trajectory we have had since 1991, and would play a key role in ensuring that India would transform into a high income developed country by 2047, in the 100th year of our Independence.
Women in India have played a crucial role in grassroots leadership, contributing to social movements, local governance, and community development, despite facing systemic barriers. From leadership during the freedom struggle with figures like Rani Lakshmibai and Sarojini Naidu, to post-independence contributions through the Panchayati Raj system, women have significantly influenced political and social change. Women leaders like Chhavi Rajawat and Gaura Devi have brought innovation to rural governance, while organizations like SEWA have empowered women in the informal sector, driving social and economic progress. Women’s progress in their personal, social and professional lives have often been a journey of immense grit, through unthinkable adversities, because patriarchal mindsets do not treat women’s success with kindness and pride. Be it a domestic set-up or a boardroom, women’s achievements are often suppressed which is an extra hurdle that needs to be overcome for their voices to be heard. It is unfortunate though when the very leadership of a country would be reluctant to offer the desired push to break the mind-blocks.
Historically, the inclusion of women in the Padma awards was minimal, with their representation often hovering around 5-10% of the total recipients each year. However, after the Modi government came to power in 2014, there has been a significant increase in the recognition of women, reflecting broader societal changes towards gender equality and increased attention to women’s contributions across various fields. The numbers were, only 7 women were honored out of 80 recipients in 2013, 6 women among 88 awardees in 2012, 8 women out of 109 recipients in 2011 and 9 women out of 130 awardees in 2010. In 2018, out of 85 awardees, 14 were women, recognizing their contributions across various fields. In 2019, for the first time, the Sports Ministry recommended only women for the Padma Awards, highlighting a significant shift towards acknowledging women’s achievements in sports. The trend continued in 2021, with 29 women and one transgender individual among the 119 awardees. In 2022, 34 women were honored among 128 recipients, marking a consistent effort to recognize women’s contributions. The count of women were 19 out of 106 in 2023, 30 out of 132 in 2024 and 23 out of 139 in 2025. This upward trend reflects a broader societal acknowledgment of women’s roles and achievements in diverse sectors, promoting gender inclusivity and inspiring future generations.
Improving the women’s count of the recipients of Padma Awards was not a mere show of statistics. This was a genuine attempt to acknowledge the untold stories of resilience and leadership that exist in India’s heartlands and its hinterlands alike, by celebrating the paths that women were creating for themselves and their communities. Everyone has great women surrounding them, who give them the overview of life and livelihood. When a few among them are recognized at the highest levels of national awards, a society rises from its slumber and takes notice of things that it had earlier neglected.
In recent years, the Padma awards have felicitated truly deserving women with exemplary track records in the field of art, education, science, environment and more. The inclusion of successful women from grassroots, lower socio-economic, and geographically marginalized sectors in the Padma Awards list signals a powerful message to both the Indian population and the global community about India’s changing social and political landscape where women are breaking barriers to recreate history, and the government is supporting their vision to nurture an inclusive society, where everyone—regardless of their social, economic, or geographical status—has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s growth. The glorious partnership between women-force and the government marks India’s repositioning as a strong, forward-thinking and progressive nation for global observers.

Such a feat however, was not achieved overnight by random addition of women in the nomination lists. A lot of work has gone into the background to introduce infrastructural developments that help the visionaries create their success stories. For the government, there is a two-fold task. One, to facilitate the existing talents and two, to prepare the grounds for the next line of talents. The Indian government is working hard to erase the challenges that remain in the form of societal norms, patriarchal attitudes, and limited access to common resources, that hinder women’s growth. With increasing education, government initiatives, and awareness campaigns, more women are stepping into professional roles to gain financial independence.
Programs like the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and Mahila Samakhya have further strengthened women’s leadership by providing training and economic opportunities. Launched in 2015, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) campaign aimed to ensure the survival, protection, and education of girls, leading to increased school enrollment, a decline in female foeticide, improved sex ratios, and greater promotion of women’s rights. It has notably improved the child sex ratio, with states like Haryana and Rajasthan seeing significant changes, such as Haryana’s gender ratio rising from 850 girls per 1,000 boys in 2015 to 933 girls per 1,000 boys in 2021.
India has implemented several initiatives to ensure equal access to quality education for girls, including the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and programs like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), which have improved school enrollment, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has improved school infrastructure for girls, while the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes gender equity in education. Addressing sanitation issues, the Swachh Bharat Mission, launched in 2014, prioritized women-friendly toilets, with vending machines for sanitary pads and other facilities, improving female enrollment and safety. To empower women economically, initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and Stand Up India Scheme support women entrepreneurs, with the number of women-driven ideas increasing from 10% in 2014 to 30% in 2018. Rapid digitization in India, built on the India Stack and the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity, is driving financial inclusivity and ensuring that support schemes reach even the remotest areas.
The digital revolution has empowered women by facilitating access to technology and digital literacy, with programs like PMGDISHA training 60 million rural citizens and 67,000 women entrepreneurs running Common Service Centres (CSCs). The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is enhancing healthcare accessibility, while SANKALP Hubs for Women Empowerment operate across 742 districts. Additionally, initiatives like digital banking and Aadhaar-linked services are providing women with increased financial security.

Such reforms are actively dedicated for the rising presence of women in India’s national recognition platforms. They serve a subtle yet powerful response to external critics and media outlets, which have often painted India in a negative light. For years, international media have highlighted India’s challenges with gender violence, social exclusion, and the marginalization of women. Critics have used these issues to defame India’s progress, often portraying the country as a place where women are systematically oppressed. The increasing acknowledgment of grassroots women leaders in the Padma Awards narrative is a sophisticated counter-narrative. It challenges the simplistic portrayal of Indian women as victims of societal and cultural constraints and instead showcases them as resilient, capable, and integral contributors to national development. Each of these women are instrumental in writing the New India narrative as envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. India is evolving, and women are at the forefront of this transformation. The increasing recognition of women in prestigious national awards like the Padma Awards is an assertion of the women’s agency in shaping her own story of progress and empowerment, one that is defined by India and its people, not its critics.

Title: A concise exploration of India’s digital transformation journey, detailing key successes and learnings to guide international audiences
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:57:29 +0000
Content: In the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in digital transformation, revolutionizing the way its citizens interact with technology. From pioneering digital payments to building one of the world’s largest biometric identification systems, India’s digital economy has reshaped industries, empowered millions, and set new global benchmarks. As the country moves toward its ambitious goal of a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028, its journey offers valuable lessons for nations seeking to build inclusive, scalable, and sustainable digital ecosystems. India’s story is one of unprecedented growth, bold policies, and an unwavering focus on inclusivity, serving as a testament to the power of technology to drive socioeconomic change.
India’s digital economy has witnessed exponential growth, propelled by rapid internet penetration, affordable data, and widespread smartphone adoption. With over 950 million internet users and 650 million smartphone users, the nation has embraced connectivity at an unprecedented scale. This digital boom has reshaped the country’s economic landscape, creating new opportunities and industries while closing long-standing divides, particularly between urban and rural areas. Historically, rural India has been underserved by technology, but as internet access has expanded, these areas have become significant contributors to the digital revolution. The widespread availability of affordable internet and mobile data has brought new economic opportunities to rural India, where previously digital access was a luxury. By breaking down geographical barriers, digital transformation has helped millions gain access to services such as education, healthcare, and financial inclusion, areas where technology had once struggled to reach.
At the forefront of this transformation is India’s financial technology sector, which has redefined the way people transact, save, and invest. In 2016, the introduction of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) catalyzed a cashless revolution, enabling real-time digital payments via mobile apps and QR codes. UPI has allowed India to leapfrog traditional banking systems, moving directly to mobile and internet-based financial services. The success of UPI, an open, interoperable model designed for financial inclusion, offers valuable lessons on how digital payment platforms can drive large-scale adoption and economic integration. Unlike WeChat Pay in China, which operates within an all-encompassing ecosystem, UPI focuses on public access and empowerment. Today, India processes more than 10 billion UPI transactions every month, a staggering figure that highlights the scale of adoption and India’s growing influence in the global financial landscape. Countries like Singapore and the UAE have adopted similar models, recognizing UPI’s ability to facilitate efficient, inclusive, and scalable financial systems.
The success of UPI is not just a national achievement; it has become a global benchmark for digital payments. Countries around the world, particularly in emerging markets, have recognized UPI as a model for building a secure and inclusive digital payments ecosystem. The platform’s interoperability allows users to access and transfer funds across multiple banks and payment platforms seamlessly, making it an ideal tool for financial inclusion. Moreover, UPI’s focus on empowering individuals with accessible, low-cost financial services has proved critical in fostering economic integration, particularly among low-income and marginalized populations.
Alongside UPI, India’s digital transformation is also closely tied to the Aadhaar system, the world’s largest biometric identification program. Aadhaar has helped over 1.3 billion people access critical services such as banking, subsidies, and healthcare. Much like Estonia’s digital identity system, Aadhaar serves as a model for biometric-based identification, although with a focus on financial inclusion rather than e-governance. Estonia’s digital ID system is designed primarily to enable secure transactions and online governance, while Aadhaar’s primary focus is on ensuring that all citizens, especially the underserved, can access essential services and benefits. Aadhaar’s role in promoting financial inclusion is unparalleled—enabling Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) that have saved the Indian government billions of dollars by reducing fraud and inefficiencies in welfare distribution.
India’s emphasis on affordability and accessibility has been pivotal to the success of its digital revolution. The telecom sector has played a crucial role in this by offering low-cost mobile data, making internet access available to millions of people, including in rural areas. With mobile data prices as low as $0.09 per GB, India has witnessed one of the most significant surges in data consumption globally, with the average user consuming 14GB of data per month. The availability of affordable mobile data has democratized access to information and services, opening new possibilities in education, healthcare, and business. The expansion of 5G services will further accelerate this growth, bridging the digital divide between urban and rural India and enabling innovations that will transform every sector, from telemedicine to e-commerce.
The growth of e-commerce in India has been another testament to the power of digital transformation. Between 2017 and 2023, digital payments in India’s e-commerce sector grew by 50.8%, reflecting the rapid adoption of online shopping. Major global players like Amazon and Flipkart have capitalized on this trend, shaping consumer behavior and pushing the boundaries of online retail. However, it is India’s homegrown platforms, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), that are redefining the landscape of digital commerce. ONDC aims to empower small businesses by providing them with the infrastructure to participate in the digital economy, creating a more level playing field. In this way, ONDC helps small businesses compete with larger corporations, ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation reach all sectors of society.
India’s success in building an inclusive digital ecosystem has been underpinned by its government’s strategic policies and initiatives. Programs such as Digital India, launched in 2015, laid the foundation for a strong digital infrastructure, expanding broadband connectivity, promoting e-governance, and ensuring that public services are available online. Initiatives like Startup India and Make in India have further nurtured the country’s tech ecosystem, positioning India as the third-largest startup hub globally, with over 100 unicorns. These programs have helped India build a thriving digital economy that spans across sectors, including finance, healthcare, education, and agriculture. The Digital India initiative has played a crucial role in ensuring that the country’s vast population can participate in the digital economy, bridging the gap between urban and rural regions and empowering citizens to access vital services.
While India’s digital transformation has been a success story, it has not been without challenges. As the digital economy grows, so too does the need for strong data protection and cybersecurity measures. The digital landscape is continually evolving, and the challenge for policymakers will be to balance rapid technological advancements with ensuring user privacy and security. India is working to strengthen its regulatory frameworks to ensure that innovation continues while safeguarding citizens’ rights. India’s approach to data protection will be crucial in maintaining public trust and fostering further digital adoption.
Looking ahead, India’s digital economy is poised to continue its growth trajectory, with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) set to drive the next wave of innovation. AI alone is expected to contribute nearly $957 billion to India’s GDP by 2035, with transformative impacts on sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. Blockchain, cloud computing, and IoT are already being integrated across industries to improve efficiency, security, and data-driven decision-making. As these technologies evolve, they will further position India as a global leader in digital transformation.
India’s digital revolution has demonstrated that transformation is not just about technology—it’s about people. By prioritizing inclusivity, affordability, and accessibility, India has shown that a well-planned digital economy can empower millions, bridge socioeconomic gaps, and drive sustainable growth. The success of UPI, Aadhaar, and other key initiatives serves as a model for other nations looking to modernize their own digital economies. India’s focus on financial inclusion, accessibility, and open, interoperable platforms provides valuable insights for countries around the world seeking to replicate its success. India’s journey offers both inspiration and a roadmap, proving that with the right policies, partnerships, and people-centric approaches, a thriving digital future is within reach.

Content: The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has emerged as a powerful tool for women’s financial empowerment, with women accounting for 68% of the scheme’s 52 crore beneficiaries, according to a report by the State Bank of India’s (SBI) Economic Research Department released on Wednesday.
Over the last nine fiscals (FY16 to FY25), the per-woman PMMY loan disbursement grew at a CAGR of 13%, reaching Rs. 62,679, while incremental deposits per woman rose by 14% CAGR to Rs. 95,269, highlighting the scheme’s impact in fostering financial independence.
The report praised PMMY for bringing entrepreneurially underrepresented social groups into the financial mainstream. Notably, nearly 50% of PMMY accounts belong to SC/ST and OBC categories, with 11% from minority groups.
Among states, Bihar leads in the number of women PMMY entrepreneurs (4.2 crore), followed by Tamil Nadu (4.0 crore) and West Bengal (3.7 crore). Meanwhile, Maharashtra has the highest share of women account holders (79%), followed by Jharkhand (75%) and West Bengal (73%).
The average loan ticket size has seen significant growth, nearly tripling from Rs. 38,000 in FY16 to Rs. 1.02 lakh in FY25. Since its inception, PMMY has sanctioned 52.07 crore loans worth Rs. 33.19 lakh crore (as of February 28).
PMMY, launched under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA), facilitates collateral-free loans up to Rs. 20 lakh through Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs).
The loan category mix has also evolved, with the share of Shishu loans (smallest loan category) dropping from 93% in FY16 to 51.7% in FY25, while Kishor loans (mid-range category) grew from 5.9% to 44.7%. This shift indicates that many Shishu borrowers have expanded their businesses and moved to higher loan brackets, reflecting growth in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
The SBI report underscores PMMY’s transformative role in fostering entrepreneurship and economic inclusion among women and marginalized communities, strengthening their financial standing and business potential.

Title: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju says Waqf Amendment Bill is for the benefit of the country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday said that the Waqf Amendment Bill, set to be introduced in the Lok Sabha, serves the nation’s best interests. Dismissing opposition to the bill as politically motivated, Rijiju emphasized that any objections should be rooted in logic and assured that the government is prepared to address all concerns.
Speaking to the media, Rijiju highlighted the significance of the bill, calling it a “historic day” and underscoring its importance not only for Muslims but for the entire nation. “This bill is being introduced in the interest of the country, and crores of Muslims, along with the whole country, will support it,” he said. He also addressed the political opposition, asserting that those opposing the bill were doing so out of political motives. “If someone opposes, they should oppose on the basis of logic, and we will also answer them,” Rijiju added.
The Union Minister noted that the bill was the result of extensive thought and preparation, indicating that it had been carefully considered before its introduction.
In a show of support for the bill, Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) President Jayant Chaudhary expressed his backing, stating, “We are with the NDA. We’ve issued a whip.” Similarly, Union Minister George Kurian voiced his approval, stating that all communities, including poor Muslims and the middle class, supported the amendment. Kurian further argued that the opposition to the bill was primarily coming from large landowners. “Only big landlords are opposing this Bill,” he said, stressing that the bill was transparent and directly linked to land and property.
Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Minister OP Rajbhar criticized opposition parties, accusing them of engaging in “vote politics.” He specifically targeted the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and Congress, alleging that their supporters were opposing the bill for political gains. Rajbhar also pointed out that the Waqf Board rules had been amended three times previously, with any shortcomings addressed to ensure that the benefits reached those under the Waqf Board’s jurisdiction. “I would like to ask those who are opposing to tell me the name of one poor person who has benefited from Waqf Board land,” he said. Rajbhar reiterated that the government’s goal was to ensure the benefit of Waqf land for the underprivileged, accusing the opposition of opposing the bill solely for votes.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is set to be tabled in Parliament today, and both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have issued whips to ensure the presence of their MPs in the House. With no signs of bipartisan consensus between the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition INDIA bloc, the outcome of the bill’s introduction is expected to be determined by the majority numbers present in the Lok Sabha.

Title: NHAI hikes toll charges on highways and expressways across country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:56:13 +0000
Content: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has raised toll charges for motorists driving through highways and expressways across the country by an average of 4 to 5 per cent as part of the annual exercise of factoring in inflation costs.
The adjustment is part of NHAI’s annual review, which aligns toll rates with inflation based on the wholesale price index, and the additional revenue will support highway upkeep and expansion projects, a senior official said.
According to the NHAI notification, the one-way toll on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for cars and jeeps travelling from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut will rise from Rs 165 to Rs 170, while the commute from Ghaziabad to Meerut will increase from Rs 70 to Rs 75.
Light commercial vehicles and buses on this route will have to shell out Rs 275 per trip, while trucks will be charged Rs 580. At the Chhijarsi toll plaza on NH-9, tolls for cars will go up from Rs 170 to Rs 175. Light commercial vehicles will pay Rs 280, while buses and trucks will have to cough up Rs 590.
Motorists travelling on highways running through Lucknow, including those linking the state capital to Kanpur, Ayodhya, Raebareli, and Barabanki, will have to pay an additional Rs 5 to 10 per trip for light vehicles, while heavy vehicles will have to shell out an extra Rs 20 to 25.
The monthly pass for cars will go up from Rs 930 to Rs 950, while for cabs the amount will increase from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
On the Delhi-Jaipur Highway, at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, tolls for private cars and jeeps will stay the same, but larger vehicles will see an increase of Rs 5 per trip. The monthly pass for cars will rise from Rs 930 to Rs 950, and for commercial cars and jeeps, it will go from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
There are around 855 plazas on India’s national highway network, of which 675 are government-funded, while another 180 or so are managed by private operators.

Title: Ghibli effect: ChatGPT usage hits record after rollout of viral feature
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:34:36 +0000
Content: The frenzy to create Ghibli-style AI art using ChatGPT’s image-generation tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI’s chatbot last week, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature’s usage.
The viral trend saw users from across the globe flood social media with images based on the hand-drawn style of the famed Japanese animation outfit, Studio Ghibli, founded by renowned director Hayao Miyazaki and known for movies such as “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro”.
Average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time this year, according to data from market research firm Similarweb.
“We added one million users in the last hour,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an X post on Monday, comparing it with the addition of one million users in five days following ChatGPT’s red-hot launch more than two years ago.
Active users, in-app subscription revenue and app downloads reached an all-time high last week, according to SensorTower data, after the AI company launched updates to its GPT-4o model, enabling advanced image generation capabilities.
Global app downloads and weekly active users on the ChatGPT app grew 11% and 5%, respectively, from the prior week, while in-app purchase revenue increased 6%, the market intelligence firm said.
However, the chatbot has been hit with a series of glitches and low-scale outages over the past week as it deals with a spike in traffic due to the popularity of its image-generating tool.
“We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” the OpenAI co-founder said on Tuesday.

LEGAL UNCERTAINTY
The extensive use of the AI tool for the Ghibli effect has also led to questions about potential copyright violations.
“The legal landscape of AI-generated images mimicking Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style is an uncertain terrain. Copyright law has generally protected only specific expressions rather than artistic styles themselves,” said Evan Brown, partner at law firm Neal & McDevitt.
OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data used to train its AI models and the legality surrounding its latest feature.
Studio Ghibli co-founder Miyazaki’s comments from 2016 on AI-generated images resurfaced after the trend blew up last week.
“I am utterly disgusted,” Miyazaki had said after being shown an early render of an AI-generated.
“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”

Title: Myanmar junta should expand access for earthquake rescuers, aid and rights groups say as death toll nears 3,000
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:31:32 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s ruling junta should free up movement by international aid workers to help survivors of a devastating earthquake, even in areas controlled by groups battling it, aid and human rights groups said, as the death toll looks set to cross 3,000.
The military has struggled to run Myanmar since overthrowing the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, reducing to tatters the economy and basic services including healthcare.
With thousands injured and infrastructure crippled following Friday’s quake of magnitude 7.7, regional authorities were struggling to cope and desperately needed support, the groups said.
“The situation remains critical, with disrupted communications and road access hampering response efforts, particularly in Sagaing,” the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said, referring to one hard-hit area.
More than 28 million people live in the six regions affected by the quake, it added in a statement, saying it had $12 million in emergency funding for food, shelter, water, sanitation, mental health support, and other services.
China’s official Xinhua news agency said the death toll rose to 2,886 on Wednesday, with 4,639 injured, citing the junta.
The rural parts of hard-hit Sagaing were mostly under the control of armed resistance groups fighting the military government, the International Crisis Group said.
“They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict,” it added in a statement.
Even before the quake, the ICG said, information had been hard to gather from such areas, because of a junta blackout of internet and mobile phone networks as part of the conflict. The military has dismissed as misinformation accusations that it committed widespread atrocities as it fought against a multi-pronged rebellion that followed the coup.
UNFETTERED ACCESS
Human Rights Watch urged the junta to allow unfettered access for humanitarian aid and lift curbs impeding aid agencies, saying donors should channel aid through independent groups rather than only junta authorities.
“Myanmar’s junta cannot be trusted to respond to a disaster of this scale,” Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report.
“Concerned governments and international agencies need to press the junta to allow full and immediate access to survivors, wherever they are.”
Australia announced a further A$6.5 million ($4.1 million) in humanitarian support for Myanmar, supplied “through thoroughly vetted international and local partners.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, “We take proactive steps to ensure our assistance does not legitimise the military regime in Myanmar.”
The military council has rejected requests from international journalists to cover the quake devastation, citing the lack of water, electricity, and hotels.
In neighbouring Thailand, the death toll from the quake rose to 22 on Wednesday, with hundreds of buildings damaged.
Rescuers scoured for survivors in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, where the death toll is 15, with 72 missing.
The government is investigating the collapse and initial tests showed some steel samples from the site were substandard.

Title: Soccer: Wolves ease relegation worries with 1-0 win over West Ham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:48:08 +0000
Content: Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal of the game as they beat visitors West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday to make it two wins in a row and put some more daylight between them and the Premier League relegation places.
The win leaves Wolves in 17th spot on 29 points, 12 ahead of Ipswich Town in 18th and 19th-placed Leicester City, who are both in action on Wednesday against Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively. West Ham are 16th on 34 points.
The visitors almost took an early lead when Jarrod Bowen made his way down the right before putting in a low cross in the 13th minute, but the ball went just behind striker Evan Ferguson and he couldn’t get a clean shot away.
Wolves defender Toti Gomes also went close to breaking the deadlock three minutes later as he met a near-post free kick with a header that flashed towards goal and forced a great save from Alphonse Areola.
Strand Larsen finally broke the deadlock in the 21st minute, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and drilling a deflected effort past Areola for his 10th goal of the season, and six minutes later Marshall Munetsi should have made it two, but his shot came crashing back off the crossbar.
Hammers manager Graham Potter sent on striker Niclas Fuellkrug after the break, and though he gave a much-needed focal point to the visitors’ attack, the game descended into a bad-tempered affair punctuated by pushing, shoving and arguing for much of the second half.
The Hammers went on to dominate but they failed to create good goal-scoring chances, and the closest they came to an equaliser were a header off the crossbar by Fuellkrug and a late shot that Tomas Soucek fired just wide.
Strand Larsen, who had another good effort fly just wide in the second half, said he was delighted to reach double figures for the season, despite needing the help of a deflection to get on the scoresheet.
“I don’t care, the ball went in. It doesn’t matter how. I’m happy anyway,” he told Sky Sports.
“10 is always the goal for a striker, and we have eight games to go. People have been doubting me a bit so I think it’s nice to show them. Today I was a bit lucky, but that’s how it is,” he added.

Title: Soccer: Saka seals comeback with goal as Arsenal beat Fulham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:32:48 +0000
Content: Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 in the Premier League on Tuesday thanks to another goal from stand-in striker Mikel Merino while Bukayo Saka struck a few minutes into his return from nearly four months out with injury.
Arsenal went ahead eight minutes before halftime when a cute ball from Jurrien Timber put Ethan Nwaneri round the back of the Fulham defence. He found Merino whose shot deflected beyond the reach of goalkeeper Bernd Leno into the corner.
The second half was a blizzard of chances for both sides.
Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard blazed over from a Gabriel Martinelli cross. Fulham then nearly equalised when Raul Jimenez had a breakaway chance well saved by goalkeeper David Raya with Leno doing the same at the other end from Timber.
Saka’s return brought the biggest roar from the Arsenal supporters when the 23-year-old nodded in a flicked-on cross in the 73rd minute not long after coming on.
Arsenal’s manager Mikel Arteta described it as “a beautiful moment” that showed how much “our people love, respect, and admire Bukayo.”
“It’s not a surprise to any of us… It lifted the stadium, the energy. It’s great to have him back.”
It wasn’t a perfect evening for the home side though. Rodrigo Muniz got a late consolation goal for Fulham, while Arsenal defenders Gabriel and Timber both went off with injuries, the former after just 15 minutes.
Arteta told reporters that both players would be assessed on Wednesday to see the extent of their problems.
“Gabby felt something in his hamstring, we don’t know how big that is,” Arteta said. “Jurrien was struggling very early in the game, he managed to continue but at some point, he couldn’t.”
Arsenal’s victory means they trail league leaders Liverpool by nine points with eight games remaining. Arne Slot’s side could widen the gap again when they play local rivals Everton on Wednesday.
Arsenal also play Everton in the Premier League on Saturday before hosting Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final next week.
Fulham manager Marco Silva said his team had not been aggressive enough to win the game and push towards a European competition qualification place, although they did have a string of chances in the second half.
“What decided the game was that we conceded two soft goals,” Silva said.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches ‘NITI NCAER states Economic Forum’ portal to strengthen fiscal data access
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:03:36 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday unveiled the “NITI NCAER States Economic Forum” portal in New Delhi. Developed by NITI Aayog in collaboration with the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), the portal serves as a comprehensive repository of State finances, providing data on social, economic, and fiscal parameters from 1990-91 to 2022-23, according to NITI Aayog.
Speaking at the launch event, Sitharaman highlighted the portal’s role in ensuring authentic and accessible financial data for states. She stated that the platform would enable states to make informed policy interventions, improve revenue management, and learn from peer experiences. She also stressed the need for balance in public finances, ensuring revenue generation without imposing excessive burdens on citizens.
Dr. Poonam Gupta, Director General of NCAER, underscored the significance of the portal in understanding the diverse fiscal trajectories of states. She noted that a centralized platform would allow policymakers to compare financial strategies and make well-informed decisions.
NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam described the initiative as a valuable public knowledge resource, promoting fiscal awareness and learning across states. He further termed the forum a “permanent asset for the nation”, aiding in data-driven economic policymaking.
Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Suman K Bery, emphasized that the forum represents a significant step toward data-driven research, particularly in public finance management.

Title: As Iran tensions build, US military moves warplanes to reinforce Middle East
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 04:58:57 +0000
Content: U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reinforced U.S. military capability in the Middle East with more warplanes, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, amid a more than two-week-old U.S. bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran.
The Pentagon’s brief statement did not specify which aircraft were being deployed or where precisely they were sent.
However, as many as six B-2 bombers have relocated in the past week or so to a U.S.-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, according to U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Experts say that puts the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest U.S. bombs and nuclear weapons, in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.
“Should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to defend our people,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.
The U.S. military’s Strategic Command has declined to say how many B-2s have reached Diego Garcia and noted that it does not comment on exercises or operations involving the B-2.
There is already considerable firepower in the Middle East and the U.S. military will soon have two aircraft carriers in the region.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran on Sunday with bombing and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.
While B-2 bombers have been employed to strike buried Houthi targets in Yemen, most experts say use of the stealthy bomber is overkill there and the targets aren’t buried so deeply.
However, the B-2 is equipped to carry America’s most potent bomb — the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator. That is the weapon that experts say could be used to strike Iran’s nuclear program.
There are only 20 B-2 bombers in the Air Force’s inventory so they are usually used sparingly.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the U.S. would receive a strong blow if Trump followed through with his threats.
Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Commander Amirali Hajizadeh threatened U.S. forces in the Middle East, noting American bases in the Middle East and adding: “They are in a glass house and should not throw stones.”
One official told Reuters that the U.S. military was also moving some air defense capabilities from Asia to the Middle East.
In his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions.
Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal’s limits on uranium enrichment.
Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian energy purposes.

Title: May god shower blessings upon India and its leadership: Myanmar locals hail Operation Brahma
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:30:25 +0000
Content: India’s Operation Brahma is in full swing, providing critical rescue and relief efforts in Myanmar following a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The local community has expressed deep gratitude for India’s swift aid and support during this crisis.
A Myanmar local, Hussain, spoke to ANI and expressed gratitude for India’s efforts in Myanmar. He said, “We felt great relief when you arrived. You (Indians) are very hardworking people. We are very happy and at peace. We have benefited greatly from the arrival of the NDRF. May God shower blessings upon India and its leadership.”  
NDRF crew member Kavita Singh told ANI, “There is little possibility of finding survivors as several days have passed, and the weather is extremely hot. So far, we have only retrieved dead bodies.”  
She emphasized the NDRF’s commitment, stating that despite infrastructural challenges and risks, the team remains dedicated to the operation. Singh also mentioned that the NDRF has received immense support from the locals. She shared an incident in which a family approached the NDRF team, expressing relief and gratitude for their rescue efforts. “We are very proud and thankful that you have come to help us,” the locals told them.  
Another NDRF crew member, Manju Bhati, stated that a team of 57 NDRF personnel had arrived in Myanmar. She explained that they had been assigned 13 locations to work in. “It is very difficult to retrieve the dead bodies. The intense heat makes survival nearly impossible. In such narrow streets, neither excavators nor cranes can operate… Everyone is in God’s hands now,” she said.  
In response to the earthquake, an NDRF team, along with essential relief supplies, has been deployed to support rescue operations. According to an NDRF statement on Tuesday, “An Urban Search & Rescue (USAR) team of 80 skilled rescuers from the 8th Battalion NDRF, Ghaziabad, along with four trained canines, was airlifted in two sorties by the Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130 Hercules aircraft.”  
The scale of devastation in Myanmar is enormous, and the swift actions taken by the Indian government are helping to alleviate the suffering of the affected population.  
India has delivered 625 metric tonnes (MT) of Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) material to Myanmar as part of Operation Brahma, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Tuesday.  
Operation Brahma was launched to provide essential support, including Search and Rescue (SAR), humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and medical assistance, following the earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28.  
As the First Responder in times of crisis in the region, Operation Brahma is a whole-of-government effort by India to address the widespread destruction in Myanmar.  
India has extended support on multiple fronts. According to the Indian Army, surgeons at the Indian medical facility in Myanmar have successfully performed two life-saving surgeries. On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Myo Moe Aung, who is overseeing relief operations in Mandalay Division, visited the hospital unexpectedly. He praised the efficiency of the medical setup and appreciated India’s extraordinary efforts in supporting Myanmar during this tragic crisis.  
Indian Naval ships INS Satpura and INS Savitri, from the Eastern Naval Command, sailed for Yangon on March 29, carrying 40 tonnes of HADR material, which was handed over to the Chief Minister of Yangon on Monday. INS Karmuk and LCU 52, from the Andaman and Nicobar Command, sailed for Yangon on March 30, carrying 30 tonnes of relief materials, including clothing, drinking water, food, medicines, and emergency supplies. These were handed over at Yangon Port on Tuesday, the MEA confirmed.  
The MEA further stated that India stands ready to deploy additional material assistance and resources based on the evolving ground-level needs.  
India’s ongoing efforts under Operation Brahma highlight its commitment to providing swift and substantial responses to natural disasters in its neighborhood.

Title: Pak troops cross LoC in J&K’s Poonch; effectively responded, says Indian Army
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:17:28 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Wednesday that the Pakistan Army intruded into Indian territory and violated the ceasefire by opening fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.
“The violation took place at 1:10 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Indian troops responded with controlled and calibrated retaliation,” the spokesperson said.
The defence spokesperson did not mention any casualties on the Pakistani side due to the Indian retaliation. However, official sources said five enemy soldiers were injured in the explosion and the subsequent exchange of fire between the two sides.
Lt. Colonel Suneel Bartwal, MoD spokesperson, said in a statement: “On April 1, 2025, a mine blast occurred in the Krishna Ghati sector due to a Pakistan Army intrusion across the LoC. This was followed by unprovoked firing and a ceasefire violation by the Pakistan Army. Our troops responded effectively in a controlled and calibrated manner. The situation is under control and is being closely monitored.”
“The Indian Army reiterates the importance of upholding the tenets of the Director Generals Military Operations (DGsMO) understanding of 2021 to maintain peace along the LoC,” he added.
Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on February 25, 2021, between the two sides, ceasefire violations have been rare, and local issues have usually been resolved through flag meetings at the brigade commander’s level.
The Indian Army and security forces have been maintaining heightened vigilance along the border and the LoC due to the presence of foreign mercenaries in the border districts of Poonch, Rajouri, and Kathua, as well as in some areas of the Jammu division hinterland.
Currently, an extended ‘seek and destroy’ operation has been underway since March 23, when five Pakistani terrorists were spotted in the Kathua district, 4 km inside the International Border.
So far, two of the five terrorists have been gunned down by security forces, while efforts are ongoing to trace and eliminate the remaining three.
Four local policemen were killed in the initial gunfight between the police and the hiding terrorists.

Title: Israel to seize parts of Gaza as military operation expands
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:12:35 +0000
Content: Israel announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza on Wednesday, saying large areas of the enclave would be seized and added to its security zones, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
In a statement, Defence Minister Israel Katz said evacuations would take place from areas where there was fighting, while urging Gazans to eliminate Hamas and return Israeli hostages as the only way to end the war.
He said the operation would clear out militants and infrastructure “and seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.
The Israeli military had already issued evacuation warnings to Gazans living around the southern city of Rafah and towards the city of Khan Younis, telling them to move to the Al-Mawasi area on the shore, previously designated a humanitarian zone.
The Palestinian civil defence agency said at least 12 bodies had been recovered by its teams in Khan Younis after a wave of airstrikes was reported overnight, and Palestinian radio reported that the area around Rafah was almost completely empty following the evacuation orders.
At the site of a strike in Khan Younis, Rida al-Jabbour held up a tiny shoe and pointed at a blood-spattered wall as she related how a neighbour had been killed along with her three-month-old baby, their bodies dismembered by the blast.
“From the moment the strike occurred we have not been able to sit or sleep or anything,” she said, describing how rescue workers were unable to separate the remains of those killed.
BUFFER ZONE
Katz’s statement did not make clear how much land Israel intended to seize or whether the move represented a permanent annexation of territory, which would add further pressure on a population in Gaza already living in one of the most crowded areas in the world.
According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometres or around 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave.
Seizing the buffer zone, which contains infrastructure including wells, sewage pumping stations, and wastewater treatment facilities as well as a significant part of Gaza’s agricultural land, would also increase pressure on the enclave’s ability to sustain itself.
At the same time, Israeli leaders have said they plan to facilitate voluntary departure of Palestinians from the enclave, after U.S. President Donald Trump called for it to be permanently evacuated and redeveloped as a coastal resort under U.S. control.
Katz’s remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated calls for Hamas to disarm and said the application of military pressure was the best way to get back the remaining 59 hostages.
Israeli leaders have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, the militant group which has controlled the enclave since 2007, and the expanded operation appeared at least partly aimed at increasing civilian pressure on its leaders.
“I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped,” Katz said in his statement. “This is the only way to end the war.”
WAR EXPANDS
Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza last month and sent ground troops back in, after two months of relative calm following the conclusion of a U.S.-backed truce to allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the strikes and Israel has also cut off aid to the enclave, saying much of it was taken by Hamas.
Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to get talks aimed at ending the war back on track have so far failed to make progress and the military’s return to Gaza has fuelled protests in Israel by families and supporters of some of the hostages.
On Wednesday, the Hostage Families’ Forum said it was “horrified” to wake up to news of the expanded operation.
As the operation in Gaza has escalated, Israel has also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, with a strike on a Hezbollah commander in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday that further strained fraying ceasefire agreements which largely halted fighting in January.
In addition, Israeli troops are still carrying out a major operation in the occupied West Bank.
Israel invaded Gaza following the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel by thousands of Hamas-led gunmen that killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and ravaged the Gaza Strip, forcing almost the entire population of 2.3 million from their homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in tents and improvised shelters.

Title: Hungary deploys military to contain foot-and-mouth outbreak
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:52:27 +0000
Content: Hungary has deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a northwestern area bordering Slovakia and Austria, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday.
Hungary reported its first case in more than 50 years of the disease, which often leads to trade restrictions, on a cattle farm early last month.
Since then, neighbouring Slovakia has detected outbreaks at five locations after reporting its first cases in March. It has also stepped up measures to contain the disease’s spread.
Hungarian Agriculture Minister Istvan Nagy said foot-and-mouth disease was found at two additional farms in Gyor-Moson-Sopron county by Wednesday morning, affecting 3,500 cattle in total.
“We are making every effort to prevent any additional outbreaks,” Nagy said in a Facebook video.
The defence ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions regarding the number of soldiers deployed to assist the containment effort.
Hungary’s cattle stock numbered 861,000 heads based on a livestock census in December, little changed from levels a year earlier. That constituted 1.2% of the European Union’s total cattle stocks, official statistics showed.
Data on the website of Hungary’s National Food Chain Safety Office showed foot-and-mouth disease affecting a total of four farms in Hungary, all of them located in the country’s northwest, while checks at more than 600 other farms returned negative results.
Nagy said Hungarian authorities have launched additional measures, including disinfection points at border crossings and highway exits in the northwest to prevent the disease from spreading beyond the affected county.
Foot-and-mouth disease poses no danger to humans but causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats.

Title: World Autism Awareness Day: a call for understanding and inclusion
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:44:27 +0000
Content: World Autism Awareness Day was established by the United Nations in 2007 to spread awareness about various autism spectrum disorders among its member nations. Autism is a neurological condition that primarily affects children, requiring special attention from parents and caregivers. Understanding, acceptance, and inclusion are crucial to ensuring that autistic individuals feel valued and supported.
The theme for this year’s World Autism Awareness Day is “Advancing Neurodiversity and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” This theme emphasizes that autism is a part of neurodiversity and should be addressed through global sustainability initiatives. The day serves as a reminder for parents to closely observe their children’s behaviour and seek timely diagnosis and intervention if any psychological concerns arise. Early action can significantly enhance the quality of life for those with autism.
Observance of World Autism Awareness Day
The Institute of Neurodiversity (ION), in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Global Communications, plays a significant role in observing this day. As a neuro-minority-founded organization, ION actively works towards strengthening neuro-minorities worldwide. Headquartered in Switzerland, it has members from over 40 countries who strive to create equal opportunities, foster acceptance, and promote education about autism.
To achieve the objectives outlined in this year’s theme, parents, teachers, and society at large must take proactive measures to support autistic individuals. Some key initiatives include:

Encouraging a Positive Mindset – Maintaining a supportive environment helps autistic children develop confidence and optimism. Regardless of the severity of their condition, parents should continually encourage and appreciate their small achievements.
Building Trust and Open Communication – Children with autism should feel safe sharing their concerns with family members and seeking guidance whenever needed.
Establishing a Routine – Parents should help their autistic children develop a structured daily routine that minimizes anxiety and enhances their sense of security.
Promoting Self-Worth – Both parents and teachers should instill confidence in autistic children by reinforcing that they are not different but unique. As the famous Bollywood movie Taare Zameen Par highlights, “Every child is special.” Their hidden creativity must be recognized and nurtured.
Spending Quality Time – Parents should dedicate ample time to engage with their autistic children through meaningful conversations and activities.
Avoiding Unnecessary Pressure – Comparing children or pressuring them to meet unrealistic expectations can lead to inferiority complexes, which can be highly detrimental to their mental health.

Causes and Early Intervention
Parents must recognize that each child has individual capabilities and aspirations. Unrealistic parental expectations can lead to undue stress for children, particularly those with autism. Strict parenting styles, excessive restrictions, and lack of emotional connection may hinder a child’s willingness to express their feelings. Research suggests that autism may also be linked to factors such as prenatal medication use, viral infections, or pregnancy complications.
If autism symptoms go unnoticed during childhood, they can persist into adulthood, making early diagnosis and intervention crucial. World Autism Awareness Day serves as a reminder to be proactive in recognizing, accepting, and addressing autism through education and open dialogue.
Impact of Travel on Autistic Individuals
According to the World Population Review 2025, nearly 715 out of every 100,000 people in India are affected by autism. While travel poses challenges for everyone, it can be particularly overwhelming for autistic individuals due to disruptions in routine, unpredictability, crowded spaces, and unfamiliar sights and sounds.
Government Initiatives for Autistic Individuals
The Government of India, in collaboration with various organizations, has launched several initiatives to support individuals with autism. One such initiative is the Tata E-Sanidhya Neuro-Diversity Platform, developed by the Tata Power Community Development Trust in partnership with the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NIEPID), under the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). This specialized online and offline service assists individuals with neurodiverse conditions, particularly those with autism.
Moving Beyond Awareness to Acceptance
With the increasing prevalence of autism, it is not enough to merely observe World Autism Awareness Day—we must celebrate the unique strengths of autistic individuals. Society should work towards creating an inclusive environment where autistic people can thrive without unnecessary restrictions. Through education, research, and open communication, we can dispel myths, combat stigma, and promote a culture of acceptance and empowerment.

Title: Govt pushes for defence indigenisation with naval engine development
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:29:38 +0000
Content: In a major step towards self-reliance in defence manufacturing, the Indian Navy has signed a Project Sanction Order with Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited for the design and development of a 6MW Medium Speed Marine Diesel Engine. The agreement, signed under the Make-I category, marks a significant milestone in India’s push for indigenous defence production.
The initiative will see the prototype diesel engine developed with over 50% indigenous content at a cost of Rs 270 crore, with 70% of the funding provided by the government.
India has traditionally relied on foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for high-capacity diesel engines. This project aims to break that dependency by fostering domestic capabilities in marine engine development. The sanctioned order also includes the design and development of diesel engines ranging from 3MW to 10MW. Once completed, these engines will be deployed for both main propulsion and power generation on ships operated by the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard.
This project will also serve as a catalyst for the growth of the domestic defence industrial ecosystem, encouraging innovation and fostering technological advancements in the sector.
Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has been actively promoting the indigenisation of critical defence technologies. The collaboration between the Indian Navy and Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited marks a crucial step in this direction, reinforcing India’s commitment to self-reliance and strengthening its defence capabilities for the future.

Title: Russia and Ukraine trade new accusations on breaches of energy ceasefire
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:18:57 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine accused each other on Wednesday of launching new attacks against each other’s energy facilities, in violation of a U.S.-brokered moratorium.
Both sides said they were providing details of the alleged violations to the United States, which got Moscow and Kyiv to agree the limited truce last month as a hoped-for stepping stone towards a full ceasefire.
Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had conducted drone and shelling attacks in the western Kursk region that cut off power to over 1,500 households.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a Russian drone hit an energy substation in Sumy region and artillery fire damaged a power line in Dnipropetrovsk, cutting off electricity to nearly 4,000 consumers.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is impatient with both sides to move faster towards ending the three-year war.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the fact that President Vladimir Putin had agreed the energy truce was evidence he was serious about engaging in a peace process – something that Kyiv and some of its European allies dispute.
Peskov said that Moscow would keep working with the Americans despite what he called daily Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.
Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Russia was breaking the energy truce and called on the U.S. to boost sanctions against Moscow, as Trump has threatened to do.
Ukraine said last month it was willing to accept a full 30-day ceasefire but Putin declined to agree to that, raising a series of questions about how it would be monitored and concerns that Ukraine would use the breathing space to mobilise more soldiers and acquire more weapons from the West.

Title: SpaceX rocket cargo project puts Pacific seabirds in jeopardy
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:48:09 +0000
Content: A project proposed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the U.S. Air Force to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from a remote Pacific atoll could harm the many seabirds that nest at the wildlife refuge, according to biologists and experts who have spent more than a decade working to protect them.
It would not be the first time that SpaceX’s activities have affected protected birds. A SpaceX launch of its Starship rocket in Boca Chica, Texas, last year involved a blast that destroyed nests and eggs of plover shorebirds, landing the billionaire Musk’s company in legal trouble and leading him to remark jokingly that he would refrain from eating omelets for a week to compensate.
The Air Force announced in March that it has selected Johnston Atoll, a U.S. territory in the central Pacific Ocean located nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) southwest of the state of Hawaii, as the site to test the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program it is developing with SpaceX.
The project involves test landing rocket re-entry vehicles designed to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo to anywhere on Earth within about 90 minutes. It would be a breakthrough for military logistics by making it easier to move supplies quickly into distant locations.
According to biologists and experts who have worked on the one-square-mile (2.6 square km) atoll – designated as a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge and part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument – the project could be too much for the island’s 14 species of tropical birds to withstand.
Roughly a million seabirds use the atoll, home to a variety of wildlife, throughout the year, up from just a few thousand in the 1980s. The bird species include red-tailed tropicbirds, red-footed boobies and great frigatebirds, which have eight-foot (2-1/2 meter) wingspans.
“Any sort of aviation that happens to the island is going to have an impact at this point,” said Hawaii-based biologist Steven Minamishin, who works for the National Wildlife Refuge System, part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“The biggest issue this will bring is the sound of the rocket flushing birds off of their nests and having them so anxious and unsure as to not return to their nest, resulting in a loss of generation,” said University of Texas wildlife biologist Ryan Rash, who spent nearly a year on Johnston.
The project would involve construction of two landing pads and the relanding of 10 rockets over four years.
The Air Force and SpaceX are preparing an environmental assessment of the project in the coming weeks for public comment. The assessment is a requirement under a law called the National Environmental Policy Act before the Air Force can proceed with the project, which it wants to start this year.
The Air Force in a Federal Register notice in March said the project was unlikely to have a significant environmental impact but noted it could harm migratory birds.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Air Force said it is closely consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Fisheries Service, “to assess impacts and develop necessary measures for avoiding, minimizing and/or mitigating potential environmental impacts.”
Musk is serving as an adviser to President Donald Trump as they work to downsize and remake the federal government and eliminate thousands of employees.
‘ALL THAT’S LEFT’
In the Pacific, where unpopulated land is scarce and threatened by sea level rise, the birds depend on Johnston for their nesting and survival, according to the biologists interviewed by Reuters.
This makes the protection of these birds essential, said Desirée Sorenson-Groves, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association, a nonprofit group focused on protecting U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System.
“These little remote oceanic islands are all that’s left for them,” Sorenson-Groves said. “We’ve invested a lot of money as a country to bring back wildlife to these places.”
Johnston Atoll, closed to the public, is administered by the Air Force and managed by Fish and Wildlife Service. The island was used for nuclear testing from the late 1950s to 1962, and to stockpile chemical munitions including Agent Orange from 1972 to 1975.
The Air Force completed a clean-up of the atoll in 2004, and it has served as a haven for nesting seabirds and migrating shore birds since. Visits by people to the island have been highly controlled to avoid disturbing the birds.
The Fish and Wildlife Service led an effort to eradicate yellow-crazy ants, an invasive species, on the atoll after it was declared a refuge, sending crews for six-month stints starting in 2010 and ending in 2021. Crews brought their clothing in sealed bags, had their equipment frozen and sanitized, and used separate island shoes to prevent new species from invading the atoll, said Eric Baker, a Fish and Wildlife Service volunteer and wildlife photographer who spent a year on Johnston.
“The basic rule was cause no or as little disturbance as possible,” Baker said.
Baker said he is worried that the SpaceX project will undo all the painstaking conservation efforts over the years.
“The nests and the birds there are just going to be kind of vaporized,” Baker said.

Title: “Now Waqf money will reach common and poor”: Sufi Leader expresses hope for positive impact of Waqf Bill
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 10:41:40 +0000
Content: Chairman of the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, Syed Naseruddin Chishty, on Wednesday expressed optimism about the Waqf Bill, stating that it addresses opposition concerns and will ensure Waqf funds reach underprivileged Muslims.
“People have been waiting for this for a long time. There is hope that a good bill will come. In a democracy, everyone has the right to protest, but I have learned that the government has considered the key objections raised by the opposition. This will be a very good bill,” Chishty said.
He emphasized that the bill aims to ensure the fair distribution of Waqf funds, directly benefiting economically disadvantaged Muslims in India.
“Now, Waqf money will reach the common and poor Muslims,” he stated, highlighting the bill’s potential to bring greater transparency and accountability in managing Waqf resources.
While Chishty expressed support for the bill, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has strongly opposed it, with prominent leaders warning of legal action and a nationwide protest if the bill is passed.
AIMPLB spokesperson Dr. Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas condemned the bill, stating, “If this bill is passed in Parliament, we will start a nationwide movement against it. We won’t sit quietly. We will make use of all legal and constitutional provisions available to us. We will run a peaceful agitation until the proposed amendments are withdrawn.”
Calling the bill discriminatory and communally motivated, Ilyas further added, “Sadly, the points raised by opposition members were also not considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC).”
The opposition to the bill primarily stems from fears that it could undermine the autonomy of Waqf institutions, which manage properties meant for the welfare of the Muslim community.
AIMPLB leaders have voiced concerns that the bill could negatively impact the management of Waqf properties and limit their intended benefits.
Maulana Mohammed Fazlur Rahim Mujaddidi, General Secretary of AIMPLB, also criticized the bill, stating, “With the amendments approved by the JPC, the matter has become more complicated. JPC mahaz ek fareb hai aur ek dhokha hai (JPC is just a hoax and a fraud).”

Title: India, Australia mark three years of ECTA, pledge to strengthen economic partnership
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:56:14 +0000
Content: India and Australia have commemorated the third anniversary of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA), reaffirming their commitment to deepening economic ties and fostering mutual prosperity. Since the agreement’s implementation, bilateral trade between the two nations has reached USD 24 billion.
A statement from India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry highlighted the growing trade relations, noting a 14 percent increase in India’s exports to Australia in 2023-24 compared to the previous year. This momentum has continued in the current fiscal year, with exports rising by 4.4 percent between April 2024 and February 2025.
The ECTA has opened new avenues for trade and investment, benefiting key sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. Additionally, India’s imports of essential raw materials, including metalliferous ores, cotton, and wood products, have contributed to industrial growth, reinforcing the complementary nature of the partnership.
The Ministry also emphasized the emergence of new export categories, including Calcined Petroleum Coke, High-Capacity Diesel Generating Sets, and Air Liquefaction Machinery, which demonstrate expanding trade opportunities. Looking ahead, sectors such as electronics and engineering hold significant potential for further growth.
In a separate development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott during Abbott’s visit to India in March. Modi described Abbott as “a long-time friend of India” and shared a moment from his visit to Dilli Haat, where Abbott was seen enjoying millets.
Sharing a picture with Abbott on X, PM Modi said, “Delighted to meet my good friend and former Australian PM, Mr. Tony Abbott. He has always been a friend of India. We have all seen him enjoy millets during his current visit.”
Abbott, who served as Australia’s Prime Minister from 2013 to 2015 and was a member of the House of Representatives until 2019, has played a key role in strengthening India-Australia relations.

Title: UK travel ban on ‘violent’ Man City, Chelsea fans during Club World Cup
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 14:26:48 +0000
Content: Around 150 Manchester City and Chelsea fans who have a history of violent conduct will be banned from travelling during the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States this summer, Britain’s interior ministry said on Wednesday.
To help prevent soccer-related disorder at the tournament, fans of the clubs who are already subject to a football banning order for previous thuggish behaviour will be forced to surrender their passports to the police from June 9-July 13.
“Many Manchester City and Chelsea fans will want to travel to support their teams in this summer’s tournament and we want them all to do so safely and enjoyably,” Policing Minister Diana Johnson said in a statement.
“But for the tiny minority of troublemakers who use football as an excuse for criminality, we will be applying the same proven preventative measures that we have successfully done for other overseas tournaments.”
The fans in question will be contacted by the Football Banning Orders Authority, the statement said, adding that failure to comply with the rule could result in an unlimited fine or a possible six-month prison sentence.
There were 2,172 football banning orders in force in England and Wales, according to data from last year.

Title: Waqf Amendment Bill will not be implemented retrospectively, misconceptions being spread for vote bank politics: Amit Shah in Lok Sabha
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:53:54 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected opposition members’ criticism that the government wants to interfere in the religious conduct of Muslims through the Waqf Amendment Bill and said the provisions in the legislation aim at better management of Waqf properties.
“I stand in support of the Bill introduced by my ministerial colleague. I have been carefully listening to the discussion since 12 noon… I feel that there are several misconceptions among several Members, either genuinely or politically. Also, through this House, attempts are being made to spread those misconceptions across the country,” he said.
Shah emphasized that there is no provision in the bill for the appointment of non-Muslims in processes related to the religion.
“The Waqf Act and Board came into effect in 1995. All the arguments about the inclusion of non-Muslims are about interference in the Waqf. First of all, no non-Muslim will be part of the Waqf. Let this be clear… There is no such provision to include any non-Muslim among those who manage the religious institutions; we do not want to do this. This is a major misconception that this Act will interfere with the religious practices of Muslims or the property they have donated. This misconception is being spread to instill fear among minorities for their vote bank,” he said.
“Where will non-Muslim members be included? In the Council and Waqf Board. What would they do? They won’t run any religious activity. They would only look after the administration of property donated by someone under Waqf Law, ensuring it is being used as per the law and the donor’s intent,” he added.
The home minister clarified that a person can donate only property that belongs to them and cannot donate property belonging to the government or any other individual.
He said changes have been made only in provisions related to the Council and Board in the 1995 Act, which deal with administrative tasks.
Moving the bill for passage in the House, Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said that the bill will not be applicable retrospectively and that the Centre is not seeking more powers.
“Despite having the largest Waqf property in the world, why has it not been utilized for education, medical care, skill development, and income generation for underprivileged Muslims? Why has no progress been made in this regard so far?” Rijiju questioned.
Along with the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Rijiju also moved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, for consideration and passage in the Lok Sabha.
The bill was first presented in the Lok Sabha in August of last year and was examined by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, headed by BJP member Jagdambika Pal.
The bill seeks to amend the Act of 1995. It aims to improve the administration and management of Waqf properties in India by overcoming the shortcomings of the previous act, enhancing the efficiency of Waqf boards, improving the registration process, and increasing the role of technology in managing Waqf records.

Title: May god shower blessings upon India and its leadership: Myanmar locals hail Operation Brahma
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:30:25 +0000
Content: India’s Operation Brahma is in full swing, providing critical rescue and relief efforts in Myanmar following a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The local community has expressed deep gratitude for India’s swift aid and support during this crisis.
A Myanmar local, Hussain, spoke to ANI and expressed gratitude for India’s efforts in Myanmar. He said, “We felt great relief when you arrived. You (Indians) are very hardworking people. We are very happy and at peace. We have benefited greatly from the arrival of the NDRF. May God shower blessings upon India and its leadership.”  
NDRF crew member Kavita Singh told ANI, “There is little possibility of finding survivors as several days have passed, and the weather is extremely hot. So far, we have only retrieved dead bodies.”  
She emphasized the NDRF’s commitment, stating that despite infrastructural challenges and risks, the team remains dedicated to the operation. Singh also mentioned that the NDRF has received immense support from the locals. She shared an incident in which a family approached the NDRF team, expressing relief and gratitude for their rescue efforts. “We are very proud and thankful that you have come to help us,” the locals told them.  
Another NDRF crew member, Manju Bhati, stated that a team of 57 NDRF personnel had arrived in Myanmar. She explained that they had been assigned 13 locations to work in. “It is very difficult to retrieve the dead bodies. The intense heat makes survival nearly impossible. In such narrow streets, neither excavators nor cranes can operate… Everyone is in God’s hands now,” she said.  
In response to the earthquake, an NDRF team, along with essential relief supplies, has been deployed to support rescue operations. According to an NDRF statement on Tuesday, “An Urban Search & Rescue (USAR) team of 80 skilled rescuers from the 8th Battalion NDRF, Ghaziabad, along with four trained canines, was airlifted in two sorties by the Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130 Hercules aircraft.”  
The scale of devastation in Myanmar is enormous, and the swift actions taken by the Indian government are helping to alleviate the suffering of the affected population.  
India has delivered 625 metric tonnes (MT) of Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) material to Myanmar as part of Operation Brahma, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Tuesday.  
Operation Brahma was launched to provide essential support, including Search and Rescue (SAR), humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and medical assistance, following the earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28.  
As the First Responder in times of crisis in the region, Operation Brahma is a whole-of-government effort by India to address the widespread destruction in Myanmar.  
India has extended support on multiple fronts. According to the Indian Army, surgeons at the Indian medical facility in Myanmar have successfully performed two life-saving surgeries. On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Myo Moe Aung, who is overseeing relief operations in Mandalay Division, visited the hospital unexpectedly. He praised the efficiency of the medical setup and appreciated India’s extraordinary efforts in supporting Myanmar during this tragic crisis.  
Indian Naval ships INS Satpura and INS Savitri, from the Eastern Naval Command, sailed for Yangon on March 29, carrying 40 tonnes of HADR material, which was handed over to the Chief Minister of Yangon on Monday. INS Karmuk and LCU 52, from the Andaman and Nicobar Command, sailed for Yangon on March 30, carrying 30 tonnes of relief materials, including clothing, drinking water, food, medicines, and emergency supplies. These were handed over at Yangon Port on Tuesday, the MEA confirmed.  
The MEA further stated that India stands ready to deploy additional material assistance and resources based on the evolving ground-level needs.  
India’s ongoing efforts under Operation Brahma highlight its commitment to providing swift and substantial responses to natural disasters in its neighborhood.

Title: Pak troops cross LoC in J&K’s Poonch; effectively responded, says Indian Army
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:17:28 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Wednesday that the Pakistan Army intruded into Indian territory and violated the ceasefire by opening fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.
“The violation took place at 1:10 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Indian troops responded with controlled and calibrated retaliation,” the spokesperson said.
The defence spokesperson did not mention any casualties on the Pakistani side due to the Indian retaliation. However, official sources said five enemy soldiers were injured in the explosion and the subsequent exchange of fire between the two sides.
Lt. Colonel Suneel Bartwal, MoD spokesperson, said in a statement: “On April 1, 2025, a mine blast occurred in the Krishna Ghati sector due to a Pakistan Army intrusion across the LoC. This was followed by unprovoked firing and a ceasefire violation by the Pakistan Army. Our troops responded effectively in a controlled and calibrated manner. The situation is under control and is being closely monitored.”
“The Indian Army reiterates the importance of upholding the tenets of the Director Generals Military Operations (DGsMO) understanding of 2021 to maintain peace along the LoC,” he added.
Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on February 25, 2021, between the two sides, ceasefire violations have been rare, and local issues have usually been resolved through flag meetings at the brigade commander’s level.
The Indian Army and security forces have been maintaining heightened vigilance along the border and the LoC due to the presence of foreign mercenaries in the border districts of Poonch, Rajouri, and Kathua, as well as in some areas of the Jammu division hinterland.
Currently, an extended ‘seek and destroy’ operation has been underway since March 23, when five Pakistani terrorists were spotted in the Kathua district, 4 km inside the International Border.
So far, two of the five terrorists have been gunned down by security forces, while efforts are ongoing to trace and eliminate the remaining three.
Four local policemen were killed in the initial gunfight between the police and the hiding terrorists.

Title: Israel to seize parts of Gaza as military operation expands
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:12:35 +0000
Content: Israel announced a major expansion of military operations in Gaza on Wednesday, saying large areas of the enclave would be seized and added to its security zones, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
In a statement, Defence Minister Israel Katz said evacuations would take place from areas where there was fighting, while urging Gazans to eliminate Hamas and return Israeli hostages as the only way to end the war.
He said the operation would clear out militants and infrastructure “and seize large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel”.
The Israeli military had already issued evacuation warnings to Gazans living around the southern city of Rafah and towards the city of Khan Younis, telling them to move to the Al-Mawasi area on the shore, previously designated a humanitarian zone.
The Palestinian civil defence agency said at least 12 bodies had been recovered by its teams in Khan Younis after a wave of airstrikes was reported overnight, and Palestinian radio reported that the area around Rafah was almost completely empty following the evacuation orders.
At the site of a strike in Khan Younis, Rida al-Jabbour held up a tiny shoe and pointed at a blood-spattered wall as she related how a neighbour had been killed along with her three-month-old baby, their bodies dismembered by the blast.
“From the moment the strike occurred we have not been able to sit or sleep or anything,” she said, describing how rescue workers were unable to separate the remains of those killed.
BUFFER ZONE
Katz’s statement did not make clear how much land Israel intended to seize or whether the move represented a permanent annexation of territory, which would add further pressure on a population in Gaza already living in one of the most crowded areas in the world.
According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometres or around 17% of the total area of Gaza, as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave.
Seizing the buffer zone, which contains infrastructure including wells, sewage pumping stations, and wastewater treatment facilities as well as a significant part of Gaza’s agricultural land, would also increase pressure on the enclave’s ability to sustain itself.
At the same time, Israeli leaders have said they plan to facilitate voluntary departure of Palestinians from the enclave, after U.S. President Donald Trump called for it to be permanently evacuated and redeveloped as a coastal resort under U.S. control.
Katz’s remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated calls for Hamas to disarm and said the application of military pressure was the best way to get back the remaining 59 hostages.
Israeli leaders have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, the militant group which has controlled the enclave since 2007, and the expanded operation appeared at least partly aimed at increasing civilian pressure on its leaders.
“I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped,” Katz said in his statement. “This is the only way to end the war.”
WAR EXPANDS
Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza last month and sent ground troops back in, after two months of relative calm following the conclusion of a U.S.-backed truce to allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the strikes and Israel has also cut off aid to the enclave, saying much of it was taken by Hamas.
Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to get talks aimed at ending the war back on track have so far failed to make progress and the military’s return to Gaza has fuelled protests in Israel by families and supporters of some of the hostages.
On Wednesday, the Hostage Families’ Forum said it was “horrified” to wake up to news of the expanded operation.
As the operation in Gaza has escalated, Israel has also hit targets in southern Lebanon and Syria, with a strike on a Hezbollah commander in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday that further strained fraying ceasefire agreements which largely halted fighting in January.
In addition, Israeli troops are still carrying out a major operation in the occupied West Bank.
Israel invaded Gaza following the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel by thousands of Hamas-led gunmen that killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.
The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and ravaged the Gaza Strip, forcing almost the entire population of 2.3 million from their homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in tents and improvised shelters.

Title: Hungary deploys military to contain foot-and-mouth outbreak
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:52:27 +0000
Content: Hungary has deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures to help contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a northwestern area bordering Slovakia and Austria, the agriculture minister said on Wednesday.
Hungary reported its first case in more than 50 years of the disease, which often leads to trade restrictions, on a cattle farm early last month.
Since then, neighbouring Slovakia has detected outbreaks at five locations after reporting its first cases in March. It has also stepped up measures to contain the disease’s spread.
Hungarian Agriculture Minister Istvan Nagy said foot-and-mouth disease was found at two additional farms in Gyor-Moson-Sopron county by Wednesday morning, affecting 3,500 cattle in total.
“We are making every effort to prevent any additional outbreaks,” Nagy said in a Facebook video.
The defence ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions regarding the number of soldiers deployed to assist the containment effort.
Hungary’s cattle stock numbered 861,000 heads based on a livestock census in December, little changed from levels a year earlier. That constituted 1.2% of the European Union’s total cattle stocks, official statistics showed.
Data on the website of Hungary’s National Food Chain Safety Office showed foot-and-mouth disease affecting a total of four farms in Hungary, all of them located in the country’s northwest, while checks at more than 600 other farms returned negative results.
Nagy said Hungarian authorities have launched additional measures, including disinfection points at border crossings and highway exits in the northwest to prevent the disease from spreading beyond the affected county.
Foot-and-mouth disease poses no danger to humans but causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats.

Title: DoT cracks down on spam calls, disconnects 1.75 lakh landline numbers
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:30:24 +0000
Content: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has disconnected approximately 1.75 lakh Direct Inward Dialing (DID) and landline telephone numbers found to be engaged in unauthorized promotional and illegal activities.
Authorities have observed a surge in spam calls originating from telecom identifiers such as 0731, 079, and 080, often exploiting Primary Rate Interfaces (PRIs), Lease Lines, Internet Lease Lines, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and International Private Leased Circuits (IPLC). Citizens, under the Jan Bhagidari initiative, have been actively reporting incidents of Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), spam, and fraudulent calls via the Chakshu module of Sanchar Saathi.
The DoT analyzes this crowdsourced data and forwards identified cases to its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) field offices for further investigation. Upon confirmation of violations, telecom services linked to such activities are immediately suspended.
Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have been directed to enforce strict compliance with Unified License conditions to prevent the misuse of telecom resources, including PRIs, SIP trunks, Lease Lines, and IPLC connections. TSPs are required to conduct regular checks to ensure that these services are used for legitimate purposes only.
The DoT urges enterprises, bulk customers, and consumers to ensure their telecom services comply with regulations and are not misused for spam or unauthorized commercial communication. Violations could lead to strict penalties, including service disconnections.
Additionally, citizens are encouraged to continue reporting spam calls through the Chakshu module of Sanchar Saathi ([www.sancharsaathi.gov.in](http://www.sancharsaathi.gov.in)). This collaborative initiative aims to enhance telecom security and user protection.

Title: ICC announces match officials for Women’s ODI World Cup qualifiers in Pakistan
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:29:36 +0000
Content: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has named a panel of 10 umpires and three match referees to officiate the upcoming ICC Women’s ODI World Cup Qualifiers, set to take place from April 9 to 19 in Lahore, Pakistan.
Ali Naqvi, Shandre Fritz, and Trudy Anderson have been appointed as match referees, while the umpiring panel includes Faisal Khan Afridi, Saleema Imtiaz, Sarah Dambanevana, Masudur Rahman Mukul, Shatira Jakir Jesy, Donovan Koch, Babs Gcuma, Candace La Borde, Dedunu de Silva, and Shaun Haig.
Saleema Imtiaz, the mother of Pakistan women’s all-rounder Kainat Imtiaz, made history last year as the first Pakistani woman to join an ICC panel of umpires after her nomination to the ICC International Panel of Development Umpires. “This isn’t just a win for me, it’s a win for every aspiring female cricketer and umpire in Pakistan. I hope my success motivates countless women who dream of making their mark in the sport,” she said.
Sarah Dambanevana became the first female Zimbabwean umpire to officiate in a Cricket World Cup final during the ICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup 2023 and was also the first female umpire to stand in a Zimbabwean domestic men’s fixture.
Masudur Rahman Mukul has been a regular official at ICC events, including the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cups in 2020 and 2024. Meanwhile, Shatira Jakir Jesy, a former Bangladesh women’s international cricketer, is set to make her umpiring debut in the tournament.
Donovan Koch, encouraged by elite umpire Richard Kettleborough during his playing stint in England, has also been selected for the panel.
“This is an exciting opportunity for our appointed match officials as they oversee this crucial tournament—the final step for teams on their path to the World Cup. Our officials are experienced and well-prepared, and we look forward to their participation in this event,” said Sean Easey, ICC Senior Manager – Umpires and Referees, in a statement on Thursday.
The sixth edition of the Women’s ODI World Cup Qualifiers will feature four full-member teams—Bangladesh, Ireland, Pakistan, and the West Indies—competing alongside associate nations Scotland and Thailand in a 15-match tournament. The top two teams will secure a spot in the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place later this year in India.

Title: Political storm erupts in West Bengal over Supreme Court’s decision on WBSSC appointments
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:25:48 +0000
Content: A political controversy has erupted in West Bengal following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Calcutta High Court’s ruling that annulled over 25,000 appointments made by the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) in 2016. The decision, which affects secondary and higher secondary teachers as well as non-teaching staff in Group-C and Group-D categories, has sparked widespread debate and criticism from various political quarters.
On April 22, 2024, the Calcutta High Court’s division bench, led by Justice Debangsu Basak and Justice Shabbar Rashidi, had cancelled 25,753 appointments made by WBSSC. The ruling came after it was found that many of these appointments were tainted by corruption, with candidates allegedly securing jobs by paying money, making it impossible to distinguish between legitimate and ineligible applicants.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court, in a division bench led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, upheld the Calcutta High Court’s decision. This ruling has triggered a political uproar, with both the ruling and opposition parties in West Bengal reacting strongly to the judgment.
Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharya, a senior advocate in the Calcutta High Court and Rajya Sabha member from CPI(M), expressed regret that some “eligible” candidates would suffer due to the ruling. He stated that the scale of corruption in the recruitment process made it impossible to separate genuine candidates from ineligible ones. “The nature of institutional corruption in the entire selection process was so rampant that it became impossible to segregate the ‘genuine’ candidates from ‘ineligible’ candidates. The apex court repeatedly questioned WBSSC on whether such segregation was possible or not, but the commission was unable to come up with any definite answer,” Bhattacharya said.
The BJP’s state president, Dr. Sukanta Majumdar, who is also the Union Minister of State, accused the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government of shielding corrupt practices. “The genuine candidates will now have to suffer because of the sustained efforts of the Mamata Banerjee-led state government to protect ineligible candidates who secured jobs by paying money to TMC leaders,” Majumdar said. He called for the resignation of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, demanding she take full responsibility for what he described as a “huge corruption.”
Meanwhile, Biswajit Deb, a senior Trinamool Congress leader and the advocate general of Mizoram, suggested that the state government should file a review petition in the Supreme Court to address the impact on genuine candidates. “The basic principle of the legal system is that 1,000 culprits can escape, but not even one innocent should be punished. But following the verdict, now the genuine candidates will have to suffer. So I think that the state government should immediately file a review petition at the apex court,” Deb argued.
However, Bhattacharya opposed the idea of filing a review petition, citing the potential for further delays and the unnecessary expenditure of public funds. He pointed out that such a move would prolong the legal process and burden the state’s finances.
At the time of filing the report, there was no official reaction from CM Mamata Banerjee regarding the Supreme Court’s decision or the ongoing political fallout. The state government has yet to confirm whether it will pursue a review petition in the matter.

Title: Indian exporters to face fewer challenges as US tariffs take effect, say economists
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:22:26 +0000
Content: As U.S. President Donald Trump mandates a 26 percent tariff on Indian goods, economists and industry experts believe that Indian exporters will face relatively fewer challenges compared to other major emerging markets in Asia. Among these economies, India’s tariffs remain the lowest, barring the Philippines.
According to economic experts, India is expected to be less impacted by the tariffs due to its inward-focused economy, unlike export-driven nations such as China, Japan, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.
“This is expected to have a significant impact on U.S. inflation and global trade dynamics. Exporters from India are likely to face relatively less trouble, as among major emerging markets in Asia, tariffs on U.S. imports from India remain the lowest, barring the Philippines,” said Sonal Badhan, Economics Specialist at Bank of Baroda.
Reacting to the tariff announcements, industry body ASSOCHAM highlighted that the policy shift would trigger a major realignment in global trade and supply chains.
“Tariffs unveiled by President Trump last night will lead to a significant restructuring of global trade and manufacturing value chains. India has been placed somewhere in the middle, with tariffs set at 26 percent, in addition to a 10 percent baseline duty. The actual impact of these tariffs needs thorough assessment,” said ASSOCHAM President Sanjay Nayar.
Amid these changes, economists stress that India must strengthen domestic bank liquidity to support local businesses and consumers.
“Inward-focused economies like India should ensure strong bank liquidity so that financial institutions can lend freely to domestic retail borrowers and small business owners, helping sustain domestic consumption,” said Debopam Chaudhuri, Chief Economist at Piramal Group.
Kunal Chaudhary, Tax Partner at EY India, pointed out that the new tariffs create a dual-edged scenario for India’s manufacturing sector.
“On the one hand, India benefits from relatively lower tariffs compared to China, Thailand, and Vietnam, which could offer an arbitrage opportunity for Indian exports. However, on the other hand, Indian manufacturers might face intensified competition in other markets, as countries that traditionally focus on the U.S. market may now redirect exports to other nations to compensate for the losses,” said Chaudhary.
Under the new tariff policy, steel, aluminium, and auto-related goods from India will face a 25 percent tariff. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, and energy products will remain tariff-free. All other goods from India will be taxed at 26 percent.

Title: Liverpool restore 12-point lead as Jota seals win over Everton
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:00:27 +0000
Content: Liverpool continued their march towards the Premier League title with a 1-0 victory over Everton in a scrappy Merseyside derby as Diogo Jota slotted home the winner in the second half on Wednesday.
The champions elect, with 73 points after 30 games, restored their 12-point lead over second-placed Arsenal while Everton, whose nine-game league unbeaten ended, are 15th on 34 points.
Everton’s Beto had an early goal chalked off for offside and missed a sitter before Jota broke the deadlock in the 57th minute with his first goal in two-and-a-half months. Anfield erupted when Luis Diaz back-heeled the ball into Jota’s path and the Portuguese forward beat a tackle before firing into the net.
“Massive, of course,” Jota said summing up the win. “Not only because it is a derby, but because of the (first game since the) international break. It was important to start with three points and hopefully that gives us momentum for the rest of the season.”
Liverpool fans thought Everton should have been reduced to 10 men after 11 minutes following a fierce tackle by defender James Tarkowski on Alexis Mac Allister, but Everton’s captain was only shown a yellow card.
The teams had met in an explosive derby in February that ended 2-2, with Tarkowski equalising deep in stoppage time in a chaotic game that featured four red cards, including one to Liverpool manager Arne Slot.
While Liverpool are unbeaten in 26 league games, they went into last month’s international break on a negative note after being eliminated by Paris St Germain in the Champions League and losing to Newcastle United in the League Cup final.
Slot’s men looked sluggish and disjointed on Wednesday and Everton could have gone ahead when Beto raced away from defender Virgil van Dijk and beat goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher before hitting his shot against the post.
Kelleher started in goal for Liverpool, with regular starter Alisson recovering from a concussion suffered on international duty with Brazil.
The heated mood in Anfield was cranked-up another notch with the contentious early tackle. Tarkowski won the ball but his studs-up follow-through caught Mac Allister square in the calf. VAR confirmed the decision of a yellow card, which gave the centre back the joint most yellow cards without being sent off in Premier League history, with 63.
“I thought at the time that it was a brilliant tackle for a derby game,” Everton boss David Moyes said.
Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on the Sky Sports commentary that Tarkowski was very lucky to escape a red card for a tackle that was a “potential leg breaker”.
“We were playing against Everton, they make it very difficult for you,” Van Dijk said. The games we have played against each other over the years have always been tough.
“They have a certain way of playing and you have to be ready for it. The first half wasn’t our greatest but we kept a clean sheet and obviously, Jota made a fantastic goal. Three points and we move on.”
Moyes remained without a victory at Anfield in 22 games leading Manchester United, Sunderland, and West Ham United as well as his current team.
“Liverpool were the better team, there’s no doubt about that,” Moyes said.
“But I don’t like the goal, I think the goal was offside. I’m really surprised it wasn’t given. Or maybe I’m not surprised. I don’t think many managers come here and think that they get loads of decisions at Anfield generally.”

Title: Mansukh Mandaviya inaugurates Viksit Bharat youth parliament 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:47:55 +0000
Content: Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya inaugurated the National Round of the Viksit Bharat Youth Parliament Festival 2025 in New Delhi on Wednesday. The two-day event aims to empower young minds and foster leadership through parliamentary discussions.
The festival began with the District Youth Parliament, held from March 16 to 27, followed by the State Youth Parliament, which took place from March 23 to 31 across various state legislative assemblies.
A total of 105 finalists, who excelled at both the district and state levels, are now competing in the national round.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports, Raksha Khadse, was also present at the inauguration.
In his inaugural speech, Mandaviya highlighted the integration of the Youth Parliament with the vision of Viksit Bharat, emphasizing that over 75,000 young individuals submitted one-minute videos to be part of this initiative. After rigorous selection at the district and state levels, the finalists are now debating in the Parliament, where India’s leaders have shaped the nation’s course. He urged the youth to adopt a ‘Nation First’ mindset, emphasizing that democracy thrives on constructive discussions rather than arguments. He praised India’s democratic strength, stating that Parliament symbolizes unity in diversity and offers opportunities for all, where even individuals from humble backgrounds can rise to the highest offices.
The event featured two Question Hour sessions, where participants engaged in meaningful discussions. The first session debated One Nation, One Election (ONOE), covering governance, political stability, and legal challenges. The second session focused on youth empowerment, education, skill development, and sustainability under the vision of Viksit Bharat. Each session featured teams representing MPs and Ministers, with their debates judged by a panel of Members of Parliament and senior government officials.
Additionally, Sudhanshu Trivedi, MP, conducted a master class on oratory skills, providing valuable insights into effective public speaking, a crucial skill for leadership and parliamentary debates.
On the second day, participants will visit the new Parliament building to witness live proceedings and experience the legislative process firsthand. They will engage in a focused discussion on ONOE, examining implementation models and Centre-State implications. A deliberation session led by the Ministry of Law and Justice will introduce a motion for voting. The day will conclude with the National Youth Awards ceremony (2021-22 & 2022-23), recognizing exceptional contributions to youth leadership, followed by the Viksit Bharat Youth Parliament Awards 2025, celebrating the most impactful participants.

Title: PM Modi arrives in Bangkok to warm reception ahead of BIMSTEC summit
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:43:43 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Bangkok on Thursday to a vibrant and enthusiastic welcome from the Indian diaspora, who greeted him with chants of “Modi Modi” and “Vande Mataram.”
Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Suriya Jungrungreangkit, along with several senior officials, welcomed PM Modi at the airport. His arrival marks the beginning of his official visit to Thailand, where he is set to attend the 6th BIMSTEC Summit, scheduled for April 4.
During his visit, PM Modi will engage with regional leaders to discuss key areas of cooperation within the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). The summit will serve as a platform to strengthen collaboration among member countries, addressing issues such as regional development, connectivity, and economic progress.
The Prime Minister is also scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Thai leadership to further enhance the robust India-Thailand relationship, which is grounded in shared culture, history, and economic ties. Following his arrival, PM Modi is set to interact with the Indian diaspora in Thailand, emphasizing the deep cultural and economic connections between the two nations.
In his departure statement, PM Modi highlighted the growing importance of BIMSTEC as a forum for promoting regional development. “At the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, I am departing today for Thailand on an official visit and to attend the 6th BIMSTEC Summit,” PM Modi said. He further noted, “Over the past decade, BIMSTEC has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity, and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region.”
The Prime Minister also expressed his eagerness to engage with leaders of BIMSTEC countries, adding, “I look forward to meeting the leaders of the BIMSTEC countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interests of our people in mind.”
On his official engagements in Thailand, PM Modi emphasized the importance of strengthening India-Thailand ties, particularly in the context of their shared history and culture. “During my visit, I will have the opportunity to engage with Prime Minister Shinawatra and the Thai leadership, with a common desire to elevate our age-old historical ties, which are based on the strong foundations of shared culture, philosophy, and spiritual thought,” he said.
PM Modi’s visit to Thailand is part of a two-nation tour that will also take him to Sri Lanka from April 4-6. “From Thailand, I will pay a two-day visit to Sri Lanka from April 4-6. This follows the highly successful visit of President [Ranil] Wickremesinghe to India last December. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realize our shared objectives,” PM Modi added.
Expressing optimism about his visits, the Prime Minister said, “I am confident that these visits will build on the foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening our close relationships for the benefit of our people and the wider region.”
As India takes a leading role in BIMSTEC, its involvement in the summit is poised to reinforce its commitment to regional cooperation. BIMSTEC, a regional grouping of seven countries, includes five South Asian nations—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka—and two Southeast Asian countries, Myanmar and Thailand. The grouping serves as a bridge between South Asia and Southeast Asia, with India playing a central role in shaping its agenda and promoting collaboration across sectors.

Title: Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance welcomes exclusion from US tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:21:10 +0000
Content: The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) on Thursday welcomed the exclusion of pharmaceuticals from the new import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, emphasizing the growing bilateral trade ties between India and the United States.
Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the IPA, expressed appreciation for the decision and highlighted the vital role that India plays in global healthcare, particularly in supplying affordable medicines to the US market. In a statement, Jain stated, “India and the US share a strong and growing bilateral trade relationship, with a shared vision to double trade to USD 500 billion under the Mission 500 initiative. Pharmaceuticals remain a cornerstone of this partnership, as India plays a vital role in global and US healthcare by ensuring a steady supply of affordable medicines.”
Jain also underscored the significance of the tariff exemption, noting that it highlights the importance of cost-effective, life-saving generic medicines in public health, economic stability, and national security. He reaffirmed the Indian pharmaceutical industry’s commitment to bolstering supply chain resilience and ensuring continued access to affordable medicines, which aligns with the shared priorities of both nations.
Trump’s tariff announcement, made during a speech at the Make America Wealthy Again Event on Wednesday, included new import tariffs on countries across the globe, with India facing a 26% tariff. During his address, Trump referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “great friend” but criticized India’s tariff policies, saying, “India charges the US 52 percent, and we charge them almost nothing.” He further elaborated on the discrepancy in tariff rates, adding, “The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 percent tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much higher prices like 60 percent, India charges 70 percent, Vietnam charges 75 percent and others are even higher than that.”
Trump also mentioned that a 25% tariff would be imposed on all foreign-made automobiles. The US President’s remarks come as part of a broader effort to address what he views as unfair trade practices, particularly in key sectors such as agriculture, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals.
Earlier reports indicated that any potential trade agreement between India and the US might focus on these sectors, given their political and economic sensitivity for India, especially due to high tariff rates.
In addition to India’s 26% tariff, the import tariffs imposed by Trump on other major trading partners include China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, Vietnam at 46%, Taiwan at 32%, Japan at 24%, the United Kingdom at 10%, Bangladesh at 37%, Pakistan at 29%, Sri Lanka at 44%, and Israel at 17%.

Title: CAQM invokes stage I of GRAP in Delhi-NCR as air quality declines
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:01:18 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage I of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR with immediate effect after the region’s Air Quality Index (AQI) slipped into the ‘poor’ category on Wednesday.
The decision was based on the daily average AQI provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the CAQM stated. Under Stage I of GRAP, which is activated when AQI ranges between 201-300, 27 preventive actions are to be strictly implemented by all relevant agencies across NCR.
Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) of NCR states and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have been directed to ensure strict enforcement of Stage I measures. Meanwhile, the Sub-Committee on GRAP has urged citizens to cooperate and follow the Citizen Charter guidelines for improving air quality.
Earlier, on March 29, CAQM had revoked Stage I of GRAP after Delhi’s AQI improved to 153 (moderate category). However, the recent deterioration has prompted its reimplementation.
Authorities will continue to monitor air quality levels and take further action as needed to mitigate pollution in the region.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower as Trump tariffs trigger global sell-off
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 05:44:56 +0000
Content: Indian equity indices opened lower on Thursday following a sharp sell-off in global markets after U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs.
At around 9:20 AM, the Sensex was down 470 points or 0.61 percent at 76,197, while the Nifty was down 105 points or 0.45 percent, at 23,227.
In the early trading hours, midcaps and smallcaps were trading with minor gains compared to largecaps. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 125 points or 0.24 percent at 52,183, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was up 121 points or 0.75 percent at 16,283.
On the sectoral front, auto, IT, PSU banks, FMCG, metals, and media were among the top laggards, while pharma, realty, and energy were the major gainers.
In the Sensex pack, Infosys, HCL Tech, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Tata Motors, M&M, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki, and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the major losers. On the other hand, Sun Pharma, Power Grid, NTPC, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, and UltraTech Cement were the top gainers.
Vikram Kasat, Head of Advisory at PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, stated, “Large tariff shocks threaten the U.S. and global economy. If these policies are sustained, they could likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.”
“In general terms, Canada and Mexico have been impacted less severely, while Asian countries, particularly China and Vietnam, have been hit the hardest. The European Union and Japan fall somewhere in between. The hope is that no one retaliates, because if retaliation occurs, there will be an escalation. If no retaliation happens, this might be the high-water mark,” he added.
Most Asian markets witnessed heavy selling due to U.S. tariffs, with Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Seoul trading in the red. However, U.S. markets closed in the green during Wednesday’s trading session.
On the institutional front, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling streak for the third consecutive session on April 2, offloading equities worth Rs 1,538 crore. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers for the fourth consecutive day, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,800 crore.

Title: Southeast Asian nations, among hardest-hit by Trump tariffs, seek talks
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 13:24:00 +0000
Content: Southeast Asian nations reeled on Thursday as they were hit with some of President Donald Trump’s heftiest tariffs, which now threaten the economies that have benefited from investment since he imposed levies on China during his first term.
Vietnam, slapped with 46% tariffs, said it would set up a task force and Thailand’s prime minister said she would pursue negotiations to try to reduce the 37% rate her country faces – far greater than the 11% it had expected.
Both countries are heavy exporters to the U.S., having gained from the so-called China+1 strategy, whereby manufacturers, seeking to escape tariffs on China, shifted some of their Chinese production to nearby countries in the region.
“We have to negotiate and get into details,” Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said. “We can’t let it get to where we miss our GDP target.”
Six of the nine Southeast Asian countries listed by Trump were slapped with much bigger-than-expected tariffs of between 32% and 49%. By comparison, the level for the European Union was 20%, Japan’s was 24% and India’s 27%.
So far, none of the Southeast Asian nations have spoken of retaliatory tariffs.
Vietnam, where companies like Apple, Nike and Samsung Electronics have large manufacturing operations, appears particularly exposed. Its exports to the United States were worth $142 billion last year, nearly 30% of its gross domestic product.
Vietnam’s benchmark stock index slid 6.7%, on course for its biggest one-day drop since January 2021 while its currency, the dong, lost 0.7% to hit an all-time low.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered up a task force to address the situation after an urgent cabinet meeting early on Thursday, state media said. He noted the country’s 8% growth target for this year remained unchanged.
“Vietnam’s export-driven growth model has been highly successful, attracting multinational companies … However, a 46% U.S. tariff would directly challenge this model,” said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam.
ING estimates that the tariffs put 5.5% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product at risk.
Vietnam made a number of recent concessions to Washington to avoid tariffs, including cutting duties and a pledge to import more U.S. goods, and is likely to offer more in the coming days.
“I expect negotiations to continue on ways to reduce or mitigate the impact of any new tariffs,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.
HOPING FOR TALKS
Thai Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan said his government was prepared for negotiations and had high hopes they would go well, citing Thailand’s good relations with the U.S.
Thailand is hoping for 3% growth this year. It has lagged regional peers, growing 2.5% last year, held back by soaring household debt.
The country’s stock index, already having taken a battering this year due to its weak economy and last week’s earthquake, slipped 1.1% while the baht fell to a one-month low. ING estimates the tariffs put 3% of the country’s GDP at risk.
Malaysia, which was dealt a rate of 24%, announced it would not seek retaliatory tariffs and it said the trade ministry would be actively engaging with U.S. authorities “to seek solutions that will uphold the spirit of free and fair trade.”
Cambodia is facing tariffs of 49% that will hurt its garment and footwear industries and promise to crush hopes that it could attract investment relocating from other countries in the region.
It is a “very, very serious situation for the economy,” said a Cambodia-based investment consultant who declined to be identified.
There is “nothing that Cambodia can offer as a negotiating tool, and will be at the back of a very long queue,” he added.

Title: Stock market ends lower as investors take cautious approach on US tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:25:25 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Thursday as investors remained cautious following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs.  
The new tariff structure includes a 10 per cent tax on all US imports, with higher tariffs on countries with a trade surplus. India will now face a 26 per cent tariff.  
The Sensex fell 322.08 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at 76,295.36. During the day, the index fluctuated between an intraday high of 76,493.74 and a low of 75,807.55.  
The Nifty also ended lower, down 82.25 points, or 0.35 per cent, at 23,250.10.  
Tech stocks led the losses, with TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, and Tata Motors declining by up to 4.02 per cent.  
On the other hand, Power Grid Corporation, Sun Pharma, Ultratech Cement, NTPC, and Asian Paints were among the top gainers, rising as much as 4.57 per cent.  
The IT sector was the worst performer, with the Nifty IT index dropping 4.21 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems, Coforge, TCS, and Mphasis. Auto, oil & gas, and realty stocks also struggled.  
However, pharma stocks performed well, with the Nifty Pharma index climbing 2.25 per cent. Banking, healthcare, FMCG, and consumer durables stocks also saw gains, rising up to 1.94 per cent.  
Despite the broader market decline, small-cap stocks outperformed, with the Nifty Smallcap100 index rising 0.58 per cent.  
Market analysts said that investors are expected to remain watchful of global developments and their impact on market trends.  
The rupee ended flat but traded in a volatile range between 85.75 and 85.35, as markets reacted to Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy.

Title: Hundreds of thousands flee as Israel seizes Rafah in new Gaza ‘security zone’
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:58:05 +0000
Content: Hundreds of thousands of fleeing Gazans sought shelter on Thursday in one of the biggest mass displacements of the war, as Israeli forces advanced into the ruins of the city of Rafah, part of a newly announced “security zone” they intend to seize.
A day after declaring their intention to capture large swathes of the crowded enclave, Israeli force pushed into the city on Gaza’s southern edge which had served as a last refuge for people fleeing other areas for much of the war.
Gaza’s health ministry reported at least 97 people killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, including at least 20 killed in an airstrike around dawn in Shejaia suburb of Gaza City.
Rafah “is gone, it is being wiped out,” a father of seven among the hundreds of thousands who had fled from Rafah to neighbouring Khan Younis, told Reuters via a chat app.
“They are knocking down what is left standing of houses and property,” said the man who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.
After a strike killed several people in Khan Younis, Adel Abu Fakher was checking the damage to his tent.
“Is anything left for us? There’s nothing left for us. We’re being killed while asleep,” he said.
The assault to capture Rafah is a major escalation in the war, which Israel restarted last month after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January.
GAZANS FEAR PERMANENT DEPOPULATION
Israel has not spelled out its longterm aims for the security zone its troops are now seizing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu said troops were taking an area he called the “Morag Axis”, a reference to an abandoned former Israeli settlement once located between Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the adjacent main southern city Khan Younis.
Gazans who had returned to homes in the ruins during the ceasefire have now been ordered to flee communities on the northern and southern edges of the strip.
They fear that Israel’s intention is to depopulate those areas indefinitely, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people permanently homeless in one of the poorest and most crowded territories on earth. The security zone includes some of Gaza’s last agricultural land and critical water infrastructure.
Since the first phase of the ceasefire expired at the start of March with no agreement to prolong it, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods reaching Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, recreating what international organisations describe as a humanitarian catastrophe after weeks of relative calm.
Israel’s stated goal since the start of the war has been the destruction of the Hamas militant group which ran Gaza for nearly two decades and led the attack on Israeli communities in October 2023 that precipitated the war.
But with no effort made to establish an alternative administration, Hamas-led police returned to the streets during the ceasefire. Fighters still hold 59 dead and living hostages which Israel says must be handed over to extend the truce; Hamas says it will free them only under a deal that ends the war.
Israeli leaders say they have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, with hundreds of people demonstrating in north Gaza’s Beit Lahiya on Wednesday opposing the war and demanding Hamas quit power. Hamas calls the protesters collaborators and says Israel is behind them.
The war began with a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023 with gunmen killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s campaign has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say.
Rafah residents said most of the local population had followed Israel’s order to leave, as Israeli strikes toppled buildings there. But a strike on the main road between Khan Younis and Rafah stopped most movement between the two cities.
Movement of people and traffic along the western coastal road near Morag was also limited by bombardment, said residents.
“Others stayed because they don’t know where to go, or got fed up of being displaced several times. We are afraid they might be killed or at best detained,” said Basem, a resident of Rafah who declined to give a second name.
Markets have emptied and prices for basic necessities have soared under Israel’s total blockade of food, medicine, and fuel.
The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but has nominal authority over hospitals in Gaza, said Gaza’s entire healthcare system was at risk of collapse.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was warmly welcomed in Thailand on Thursday, receiving a ceremonial Guard of Honour upon his arrival in Bangkok for the 6th BIMSTEC Summit.
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra greeted PM Modi at the Government House, where the two leaders were scheduled to engage in wide-ranging discussions aimed at strengthening India-Thailand relations. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, shared details of the reception, noting that PM Modi’s arrival was marked by a special ceremonial welcome.
“A special ceremonial welcome with Guard of Honour. PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand warmly received PM Narendra Modi at the Government House in Bangkok today. The two leaders will have wide-ranging discussions for charting the way for future India-Thailand partnership,” Jaiswal posted on X.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi also had a delegation-level talk with Thai PM Shinawatra, furthering bilateral discussions on cooperation in various sectors.
PM Modi also witnessed a culturally significant moment when he witnessed a captivating performance of the Ramakien, the Thai adaptation of the Ramayana. The performance highlighted the deep civilisational ties between India and Thailand, with the Ramayana remaining a shared cultural and spiritual heritage across the two nations. The Thai version of the epic features Lord Rama as Phra Ram, embodying the same virtues of sacrifice, devotion, and triumph over evil as seen in the Indian version.
Taking to X, PM Modi expressed his admiration for the performance: “A cultural connect like no other! Witnessed a captivating performance of the Thai Ramayana, Ramakien. It was a truly enriching experience that beautifully showcased the shared cultural and civilisational ties between India and Thailand. The Ramayana truly continues to connect hearts and traditions across so many parts of Asia.”
PM Modi was also greeted by the Indian community in Bangkok, who welcomed him with chants and prayers, symbolizing the enduring cultural bond between the two nations. “Grateful for the warm welcome by the Indian community in Bangkok. India and Thailand share a deep-rooted cultural bond that continues to flourish through our people. Heartening to see this connection reflected so strongly here,” PM Modi tweeted.

Title: World Boxing Cup: Manish, Hitesh and Abhinash sail into semifinals with dominant wins
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 11:03:11 +0000
Content: Indian boxers Manish Rathore, Hitesh, and Abhinash Jamwal lit up the ring at the World Boxing Cup Brazil 2025 on Wednesday, each securing dominant wins in their respective quarterfinals.
Jamwal tamed Germany’s Denis Bril with a unanimous decision in the 65kg category, while Hitesh defeated Italy’s Gabriele Guidi Rontani by the same scoreline in the 70kg category.
In the 55kg category, Manish Rathore faced Australia’s Paris Olympian Yusuf Chothia. The Indian national champion proved that he was well-prepared for whatever his opponent threw at him. Both boxers kept things tight in all three rounds, with Rathore emerging victorious as three judges ruled in his favour, while two gave equal points to both.
In the semifinals, Rathore will face Nursultan Altynbek of Kazakhstan, Hitesh will take on Makan Traore, and Jamwal will play Gianluigi Malanga of Italy.
Earlier, national champion Jadumani Singh Mandengbam overcame Ellis Trowbridge of Great Britain to reach the semifinals in the 50kg category on Wednesday.
Trowbridge, the 2024 World Boxing Cup Finals silver medallist, began the bout in his usual aggressive style, but the Indian was prepared to absorb the pressure and find ways to land his punches, earning a 3:2 split decision in his favour.
Jadumani will now face former Asian U-22 champion Asilbek Jalilov for a place in the final. However, India’s challenge in the 75kg, 85kg, and 90+kg categories came to an end after all three boxers fought valiantly in their respective bouts.
Nikhil Dubey lost the 75kg bout 0:5 against local favourite Kaue Belini, while Jugnoo was on the wrong end of a 1:4 split decision against France’s Abdoulaye Traore in the 85kg category.
Narender came close to beating Kazakhstan’s Daniyal Saparbay, even earning a 30-27 verdict from one judge, but lost the 90+kg bout on a 3:2 split decision.

Title: India accelerates 6G development with testbeds, 100 new 5G labs, and global research collaborations
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:46:17 +0000
Content: The central government unveiled the Bharat 6G Vision Document in March 2023, outlining the nation’s ambitious plan to design, develop, and deploy 6G network technologies by 2030. The primary goal is to establish India as a global leader in 6G technology, delivering ubiquitous, intelligent, and secure connectivity that will enhance the quality of life for its citizens and the world at large.
To achieve this, the government has launched several initiatives aimed at accelerating the development of 6G technology within the country. One of the key measures is the funding of two crucial testbeds—the 6G THz Testbed and the Advanced Optical Communication Testbed. These initiatives are intended to promote research and development (R&D) and foster innovation in the 6G domain, laying a strong foundation for next-generation communication technologies.
Additionally, the government has sanctioned the establishment of 100 5G labs at academic institutions across India in the financial year 2023-24. These labs will play an essential role in building a 6G-ready ecosystem, enabling academic institutions and start-ups to thrive while preparing the next generation of technologists with the necessary tools and expertise.
In an effort to accelerate research on 6G networks, 111 research proposals have been approved to explore and develop 6G ecosystems. These research initiatives are designed to align India’s efforts with the global roadmap for 6G technology, ensuring that the country remains at the forefront of innovation.
The government has also facilitated the formation of the Bharat 6G Alliance, a collaboration between domestic industries, academic institutions, national research bodies, and standards organizations. This alliance will develop a comprehensive action plan for 6G technology. To further boost international collaboration, the central government has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with leading global 6G alliances.
As part of its global outreach, India hosted the inaugural International 6G Symposium, coinciding with the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA) 2024 and the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2024. The symposium brought together industry leaders, academics, and government officials to explore advancements in 6G technology on both local and global levels.
India has also made significant contributions to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s International Mobile Technology (IMT) 2030 framework, often referred to as the foundation for 6G. India advocated for the inclusion of “Ubiquitous Connectivity” as one of the six key usage scenarios for 6G and highlighted coverage, interoperability, and sustainability as essential capabilities for future wireless networks.
Through these initiatives, the Indian government is laying the groundwork for a future where 6G technology will not only revolutionize communications but also enable transformative advancements across various sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and beyond.

Title: EPFO simplifies claim settlement process with two key reforms
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:44:56 +0000
Content: In a significant move to enhance the Ease of Living for Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) members and improve the Ease of Doing Business for employers, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has introduced two major reforms in its claim settlement process. These changes aim to streamline operations and reduce claim rejections, the Ministry of Labour & Employment announced on Thursday.
No More Requirement to Upload Cheque Leaf or Attested Bank Passbook
EPFO has eliminated the need for members to upload an image of a cheque leaf or an attested bank passbook when filing online claims. Initially implemented as a pilot project for KYC-updated members, this reform has benefited 1.7 crore EPF members since its launch on May 28, 2024.
Following the success of the pilot, EPFO has now extended this relaxation to all members. Since the bank account holder’s name is already verified at the time of seeding with the Universal Account Number (UAN), this additional documentation is no longer required.
With this change, around 6 crore EPF members will immediately benefit, as it will eliminate claim rejections caused by poor-quality or unreadable uploads, reducing grievances and delays in claim processing.
Employer Approval No Longer Needed for Bank Account Seeding with UAN
To further simplify the process, EPFO has removed the requirement for employer approval when seeding bank accounts with UAN after bank verification.
Until now, EPF members had to link their bank accounts with UAN to receive seamless PF withdrawals. In FY 2024-25, 1.3 crore members submitted bank account seeding requests, which, after bank verification, required employer approval via Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) or E-Sign.
According to the Ministry of Labour & Employment, around 36,000 such requests are raised daily. While banks take an average of 3 days to complete verification, employers take around 13 days, leading to delays and a growing backlog. Currently, 14.95 lakh approvals are pending with employers, impacting millions of EPF members.
Out of 7.74 crore contributing members, 4.83 crore have already seeded their bank accounts with UAN. With this reform, EPFO has eliminated employer approval from the process, immediately benefiting 14.95 lakh pending cases.
Additionally, the change will simplify bank account updates, allowing members to enter a new account number and IFSC code, which will be verified through Aadhaar OTP authentication.

Title: India exploring opportunities amid US reciprocal tariffs on India: Centre
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:32:40 +0000
Content: In response to US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order imposing reciprocal tariffs, The Indian government on Thursday said that it is assessing the implications of the new trade policy and exploring opportunities that may arise from it.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry issued a statement detailing the US administration’s new tariff regime, which includes additional ad-valorem duties ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from all trading partners. Under this executive order, the baseline 10% duty will be effective from April 5, 2025, with country-specific additional duties coming into force on April 9, 2025. For India, the additional tariff as per the executive order stands at 27%.
“The Department of Commerce is carefully examining the implications of the various measures and announcements made by the US administration. In line with the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat,’ the department is engaging with stakeholders, including Indian industry and exporters, to gather their assessments of the new tariffs and to evaluate the overall situation,” the ministry said in its statement.
The Ministry of Commerce said that it is actively studying potential opportunities arising from the new US trade policy, noting that the situation is being assessed with a long-term view of the country’s strategic interests.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Trump had launched ‘Mission 500’ on February 13, 2025, with the ambitious goal of more than doubling bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. To this end, ongoing discussions between Indian and US trade teams are focused on the swift conclusion of a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement. This agreement would cover a wide range of issues, including deepening supply chain integration and enhancing trade, investment, and technology transfers between the two nations.
“The ongoing discussions aim to facilitate the growth of trade, investments, and technology transfers between both nations,” the statement said. “We remain in close contact with the Trump Administration and expect to make progress in the coming days.”
India also reaffirmed the importance of its Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with the United States, committing to continued cooperation on the ‘Catalysing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology’ (COMPACT) initiative. The goal of this partnership is to ensure that trade ties between the two countries remain a pillar of mutual prosperity, driving transformative changes for the benefit of the people of both nations.
Since President Trump began his second term, he has consistently emphasized the principle of tariff reciprocity, asserting that the United States will mirror tariffs imposed by other countries, including India, to ensure fair trade practices.

Title: PM Modi witnesses Thai adaptation of Ramayana, calls it a “beautiful confluence of cultures”
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:27:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attended a performance of Ramakien, the Thai adaptation of the Indian epic Ramayana, during his visit to Thailand.
The performance was led by Ekkalak Nu-ngoen and a group of students from the Faculty of Music and Drama at the Bunditpatanasilpa Institute in Thailand. The retelling of the epic was presented through a unique fusion of two classical dance forms—India’s Bharatanatyam and Thailand’s Khon, showcasing the deep cultural ties between the two nations.
The Ramayana holds a special place in both Indian and Thai traditions. While in India, Lord Rama is revered as the Prince of Ayodhya, in the Thai adaptation, he is known as Phra Ram. Despite the differences in names and presentation, both versions uphold the same values of sacrifice, duty, devotion, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil, reflecting the shared cultural heritage of the two countries.
During PM Modi’s visit, Thailand’s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lalivan Karnchanachari, expressed enthusiasm about his presence. “We welcome PM Modi to our beautiful country as he is here to attend the BIMSTEC meeting. The performance was a perfect blend of Indian and Thai cultures, and we hope the Prime Minister enjoys his time here,” she said.
One of the performers also shared their excitement about presenting Ramakien before the Indian leader. “We are very happy to perform Ramayana and Ramakien, combining Thai classical dance with Bharatanatyam, in front of the Prime Minister and other distinguished guests,” the artist said.
Earlier in the day, as he arrived at his hotel in Bangkok, PM Modi witnessed a Garba performance and received a warm welcome from the Indian diaspora and local Indian community members.
Looking ahead, PM Modi expressed enthusiasm for participating in official engagements at the BIMSTEC Leaders’ Summit in Bangkok. Upon his arrival at the airport, he was received by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport, Suriya Jungrungreangkit. He later shared pictures from the airport, where he was seen interacting with members of the Indian community, who greeted him with excitement and warmth.

Title: No non-Muslim can interfere in Waqf Board: Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:26:04 +0000
Content: Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday defended the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, against allegations that it would undermine Muslim interests. Rijiju clarified that the bill does not allow non-Muslims to interfere in the management of the Waqf Board, emphasizing that the management, creation, and beneficiaries of Waqf properties would remain exclusively within the Muslim community.
Rijiju introduced the bill in the Rajya Sabha amidst widespread concerns and criticism, asserting that the new legislation would strengthen the governance of Waqf properties and enhance transparency. He categorically rejected claims that the bill would be unconstitutional or infringe on the rights of Muslims. “Any Muslim who wishes to manage their property through a trust can do so without restrictions,” he stated.
The minister explained that the Waqf Board functions much like a Charity Commissioner. He added that the bill would require proof of ownership before a property could be declared Waqf, removing the previous provision where any claim by the Waqf Board would automatically result in the property being designated as Waqf.
Rijiju also said that the bill had undergone extensive consultation before being introduced. Over one crore memoranda and suggestions were received from the public, and a Parliamentary Committee conducted consultations in ten cities, including Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Patna, Chennai, Bengaluru, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, and Lucknow.
The minister traced the government’s reform efforts back to the 1976 Congress-led government’s inquiry commission and the 2006 Sachar Committee Report, which recommended strengthening and digitizing the Waqf Board. At the time, Waqf properties totaled 4.9 lakh, generating an annual income of Rs 163 crore. The Sachar Committee had estimated that, with proper management, these properties could generate Rs 12,000 crore annually. Today, the number of Waqf properties has grown to 8.72 lakh, with the potential for much higher revenue.
Rijiju also referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report led by K. Rehman Khan, a former Minority Affairs Minister, which had pointed out the Waqf Board’s inadequate infrastructure, manpower, and funding. The JPC recommended establishing a centralized data bank and structured leasing policies for Waqf properties. Rijiju asserted that the current government was implementing these long-overdue reforms, which previous Congress and UPA governments had failed to act upon.
In his address, Rijiju highlighted the differences in the approach of the Modi government compared to the Congress-led UPA. The 2013 UPA government had set up a JPC to reform the Waqf Board ahead of elections, but the current JPC, formed under the BJP government, had engaged more comprehensively, with 31 members, 36 meetings, consultations with 284 delegations and organizations, and inputs from 25 states, five minority commissions, and multiple lawmakers.
Rijiju also pointed out that the number of memoranda submitted had significantly increased from just 32 in 2013 to over one crore now, reflecting the widespread public participation in the reform process.
Rijiju emphasized that the BJP government is committed to implementing these long-pending reforms. “These committees were set up during Congress and UPA rule, yet they failed to act. The Narendra Modi government is fulfilling the recommendations that the Congress did not dare to implement,” Rijiju stated.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, according to Rijiju, will ensure greater accountability and efficiency in the management of Waqf properties, address long-standing concerns, and safeguard the rights and autonomy of the Muslim community.
