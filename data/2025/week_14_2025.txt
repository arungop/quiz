Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Research examines better screening methods for statin use
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:29:10 +0000
Content: A new study in the United States is exploring the most effective method to screen and assess patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease and to determine who would benefit from statin medication to lower cholesterol.
Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have introduced a new approach that relies on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess risk and guide statin prescriptions. The CAC score is determined through a low-radiation computed tomography (CT) scan, which detects calcium deposits in plaques within the coronary arteries of the heart.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, the study’s principal investigator and a distinguished clinical and cardiovascular research physician at Intermountain Health, explained that the research aims to improve the selection process for patients who need statins. Instead of relying solely on coronary risk factor equations, the study examines whether direct imaging of plaque burden is a more effective indicator of risk.
The study, which has now enrolled over 5,600 patients, was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago on Saturday. As part of the research, patients’ risk assessment scores were shared with their physicians through letters, indicating whether a statin was recommended based on high-risk findings.
Initial findings revealed that while the two groups in the study had similar baseline characteristics, the rate of statin prescription recommendations varied significantly. The study is expected to conclude in early 2026, after which researchers will compare outcomes such as deaths, heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations over a follow-up period of up to seven years, with an average follow-up of over four years.
Understanding the most effective approach to statin prescription is crucial, given that these medications come with costs and potential side effects, including muscle aches and an increased risk of diabetes. The study’s findings could help refine treatment strategies for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

Title: ChatGPT can be used in sensory evaluation of foods, specifically brownies: study
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A recent study suggests that ChatGPT can be utilized in the sensory evaluation of foods, particularly brownies, offering insights that may streamline new product development and even enhance recipes.
Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US examined 15 different brownie recipes, ranging from traditional ingredient combinations to unconventional ones, such as mealworm powder and fish oil. Study author Damir Torrico, an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provided ChatGPT with these recipe formulas and asked it to describe the sensory characteristics of each brownie, including taste, texture, and overall appeal. He then categorized ChatGPT’s responses to determine whether they were positive, negative, or neutral.
Torrico noted that relying on human testers can sometimes slow down the evaluation process, especially when multiple product prototypes need assessment simultaneously. Sensory panels require time, coordination, and, in some cases, certain ingredients may not be food-grade, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This is why large language models like ChatGPT are being explored for sensory evaluation, as they have the potential to replicate certain human responses.
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s responses were overwhelmingly positive, even for brownies containing unusual ingredients. This aligns with a psychological concept known as “hedonic asymmetry,” which suggests that both humans and AI tend to describe beneficial experiences in more positive terms. Torrico explained that food plays a fundamental role in nourishment and energy, leading humans to respond positively to it. In attempting to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT appeared to exhibit the same tendency, always focusing on the positive aspects of the recipes.
The study suggests that AI can provide general insights into which products are worth further testing and which might not be suitable for a lengthy evaluation process. Torrico believes that ChatGPT could be further developed for sensory evaluation to assist the food industry. Moving forward, he plans to refine the experiment by training ChatGPT to use a vocabulary similar to that of a human descriptive panel.

Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:36:12 +0000
Content: The market outlook for the coming week will be shaped by a combination of domestic and global economic factors, including key indicators such as PMI data, foreign institutional investments (FIIs), auto sales figures, and major US economic data releases. Among the most closely watched developments will be the HSBC Composite PMI data for India, set to be released on Friday, while auto companies will begin reporting their sales figures from Monday.
On the global front, market sentiment will be influenced by policy developments related to India-US tariffs and the potential impact of former US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on finished vehicle imports, which is set to take effect from April 3. Additionally, investors will closely track the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a series of crucial US economic data releases, including job openings, non-farm payrolls, and the unemployment rate.
Last week, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with both the Nifty and Sensex posting gains of approximately 0.70%, closing at 23,519.35 and 77,414.92, respectively. Banking stocks played a key role in driving the rally, with Bank Nifty rising nearly 2% to settle at 51,564.81. Among sectoral indices, Nifty PSE and FMCG emerged as the top performers, whereas media and pharma stocks lagged behind.
Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree, infusing Rs 17,426 crore into equities between March 24 and 28, while domestic institutional investors contributed Rs 6,797 crore during the same period. This consistent inflow of foreign capital helped the Nifty post a 6.3% gain in March, reversing losses from the previous month and closing on a strong note.
The Indian stock market will remain closed on March 31 in observance of Eid.
According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, Nifty has strong support at 23,300, and if breached, it could decline towards 23,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could push the index towards 24,100, potentially extending the ongoing rally.
