Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Research examines better screening methods for statin use
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:29:10 +0000
Content: A new study in the United States is exploring the most effective method to screen and assess patients at risk of developing coronary heart disease and to determine who would benefit from statin medication to lower cholesterol.
Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have introduced a new approach that relies on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to assess risk and guide statin prescriptions. The CAC score is determined through a low-radiation computed tomography (CT) scan, which detects calcium deposits in plaques within the coronary arteries of the heart.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, the study’s principal investigator and a distinguished clinical and cardiovascular research physician at Intermountain Health, explained that the research aims to improve the selection process for patients who need statins. Instead of relying solely on coronary risk factor equations, the study examines whether direct imaging of plaque burden is a more effective indicator of risk.
The study, which has now enrolled over 5,600 patients, was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago on Saturday. As part of the research, patients’ risk assessment scores were shared with their physicians through letters, indicating whether a statin was recommended based on high-risk findings.
Initial findings revealed that while the two groups in the study had similar baseline characteristics, the rate of statin prescription recommendations varied significantly. The study is expected to conclude in early 2026, after which researchers will compare outcomes such as deaths, heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations over a follow-up period of up to seven years, with an average follow-up of over four years.
Understanding the most effective approach to statin prescription is crucial, given that these medications come with costs and potential side effects, including muscle aches and an increased risk of diabetes. The study’s findings could help refine treatment strategies for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

Title: ChatGPT can be used in sensory evaluation of foods, specifically brownies: study
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A recent study suggests that ChatGPT can be utilized in the sensory evaluation of foods, particularly brownies, offering insights that may streamline new product development and even enhance recipes.
Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US examined 15 different brownie recipes, ranging from traditional ingredient combinations to unconventional ones, such as mealworm powder and fish oil. Study author Damir Torrico, an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, provided ChatGPT with these recipe formulas and asked it to describe the sensory characteristics of each brownie, including taste, texture, and overall appeal. He then categorized ChatGPT’s responses to determine whether they were positive, negative, or neutral.
Torrico noted that relying on human testers can sometimes slow down the evaluation process, especially when multiple product prototypes need assessment simultaneously. Sensory panels require time, coordination, and, in some cases, certain ingredients may not be food-grade, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This is why large language models like ChatGPT are being explored for sensory evaluation, as they have the potential to replicate certain human responses.
Interestingly, ChatGPT’s responses were overwhelmingly positive, even for brownies containing unusual ingredients. This aligns with a psychological concept known as “hedonic asymmetry,” which suggests that both humans and AI tend to describe beneficial experiences in more positive terms. Torrico explained that food plays a fundamental role in nourishment and energy, leading humans to respond positively to it. In attempting to mimic human behavior, ChatGPT appeared to exhibit the same tendency, always focusing on the positive aspects of the recipes.
The study suggests that AI can provide general insights into which products are worth further testing and which might not be suitable for a lengthy evaluation process. Torrico believes that ChatGPT could be further developed for sensory evaluation to assist the food industry. Moving forward, he plans to refine the experiment by training ChatGPT to use a vocabulary similar to that of a human descriptive panel.

Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:36:12 +0000
Content: The market outlook for the coming week will be shaped by a combination of domestic and global economic factors, including key indicators such as PMI data, foreign institutional investments (FIIs), auto sales figures, and major US economic data releases. Among the most closely watched developments will be the HSBC Composite PMI data for India, set to be released on Friday, while auto companies will begin reporting their sales figures from Monday.
On the global front, market sentiment will be influenced by policy developments related to India-US tariffs and the potential impact of former US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on finished vehicle imports, which is set to take effect from April 3. Additionally, investors will closely track the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a series of crucial US economic data releases, including job openings, non-farm payrolls, and the unemployment rate.
Last week, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with both the Nifty and Sensex posting gains of approximately 0.70%, closing at 23,519.35 and 77,414.92, respectively. Banking stocks played a key role in driving the rally, with Bank Nifty rising nearly 2% to settle at 51,564.81. Among sectoral indices, Nifty PSE and FMCG emerged as the top performers, whereas media and pharma stocks lagged behind.
Foreign institutional investors continued their buying spree, infusing Rs 17,426 crore into equities between March 24 and 28, while domestic institutional investors contributed Rs 6,797 crore during the same period. This consistent inflow of foreign capital helped the Nifty post a 6.3% gain in March, reversing losses from the previous month and closing on a strong note.
The Indian stock market will remain closed on March 31 in observance of Eid.
According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, Nifty has strong support at 23,300, and if breached, it could decline towards 23,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could push the index towards 24,100, potentially extending the ongoing rally.

Title: GRAP-I restrictions revoked in Delhi-NCR as air quality improves
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 02:45:32 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the Graded Response Action Plan – Stage I (GRAP-I) in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect after air quality improved in the city.
The decision came after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday clocked 153 as per the daily bulletin provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
The CAQM said that the AQI of the national capital showed significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR.
“AQI of Delhi has shown significant improvement due to strong surface winds and improved meteorological conditions prevailing in Delhi-NCR. The AQI of Delhi has been recorded as 153 for 29.03.2025 (in ‘Moderate’ category). Further, the forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts AQI to mainly remain in the ‘Moderate’ category in the coming days,” CAQM said in a statement.
“Therefore, keeping in view this trend of improvement in the overall AQI of Delhi, the CAQM Sub-Committee unanimously decided to revoke Stage-I of the extant schedule of GRAP in the entire NCR, with immediate effect,” it added.
“All the agencies concerned are also required to take note of various actions and the targeted timelines as envisaged in the comprehensive policy issued by the Commission to curb air pollution in the NCR and take appropriate actions accordingly in the field, particularly the dust mitigation measures for C&amp;D activities &amp; Roads/Open areas, which becomes a pre-dominant factor in the coming months determining the air quality in Delhi-NCR,” CAQM further said.
“The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and review the situation from time to time for further appropriate decision depending upon the air quality in Delhi and the forecast made by IMD/ IITM,” CAQM stated in the statement.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Title: People across country celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with joy and unity
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:13:10 +0000
Content: Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations have begun across the country, with an outpouring of joy and unity as families and communities come together to mark the end of Ramadan.  
The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.  
A child celebrating Eid spoke to ANI after offering his morning prayers and said, “We are celebrating Eid with parents and friends, and all are happy… Whatever people give us (in Eidi), we take it happily.”  
Children embraced each other and wished greetings of Eid-ul-Fitr.  
BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain offered namaz at the Parliament Street mosque in Delhi on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Speaking to ANI, he said, “I extend my best wishes to the people of the country on the occasion of Eid. Today, people have peacefully offered Namaz everywhere. Eid is the day to forget everything and hug each other. I pray that there should be unity in the country and that our country progresses.”  
Shakeel Ahmed, a Pakistani citizen originally from India, said, “I am happy that I came to Delhi, my birthplace, with my relatives to celebrate Eid.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a foreign student of GD Goenka University from Mozambique said, “It was my first time here, and it was one of the best experiences that I had in India… India is very rich in this way. We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”  
On security arrangements for Eid-ul-Fitr, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Central Delhi, M Harsha Vardhan, said, “Today, a huge crowd is observed at the mosques. All the security arrangements have been made in central Delhi. Till now, no case has been reported. We have deployed adequate forces… Arrangements for Navratri have also been made. A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the PM said, “Greetings on Eid-ul-Fitr. May this festival enhance the spirit of hope, harmony, and kindness in our society. May there be joy and success in all your endeavors. Eid Mubarak!”  
President Droupadi Murmu also extended her best wishes on the occasion.  
“Greetings to all countrymen, especially Muslim brothers and sisters, on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This festival strengthens the feeling of brotherhood and conveys the message of compassion and charity. I wish that this festival brings peace, prosperity, and happiness to everyone’s life and strengthens the spirit of moving forward on the path of goodness,” she said in a post on X, in Urdu.  
Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also extended his wishes.  
“Eid Mubarak! May this joyous occasion bring peace, happiness, prosperity, and good health to you and your loved ones.”  
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also shared his warm greetings.  
“On this joyous occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, I extend my warmest greetings to fellow citizens. Eid profoundly evokes feelings of fraternity, compassion, and the spirit of sharing amongst us all, strengthening the pluralistic bonds that unite our people. May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.  
Eid upholds the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. Along with giving Zakat, many also provide meals, clothing, and support to the less fortunate, reflecting Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi calls for action on textile waste; lauds Panipat, Bengaluru, Tirupur for recycling efforts
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed concern over the growing issue of textile waste in India, linking it to the rising global trend of fast fashion.  
In his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address, the PM highlighted the alarming impact of textile waste, emphasizing how the habit of discarding old clothes in favour of new ones has become increasingly common. “Have you ever wondered what happens to the clothes you no longer wear? They turn into textile waste,” he said.
Citing research, the prime minister pointed out that less than one percent of textile waste is recycled into new clothing worldwide. He further noted that India ranks as the third-largest producer of textile waste, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable solutions.  
Despite the challenges, PM Modi lauded various initiatives across the country aimed at tackling textile waste. He emphasized that many Indian startups are developing textile recovery facilities and contributing to the growth of sustainable fashion.  
“Several organizations are working to empower ragpicker communities, while many young entrepreneurs are engaged in recycling old clothes and footwear to distribute to those in need. Textile waste is also being transformed into products such as decorative items, handbags, stationery, and toys,” he said. 
The prime minister also highlighted the rise of circular fashion brands and clothing rental platforms, which allow consumers to rent designer outfits instead of purchasing them outright.  
During his address, he commended the significant contributions of three Indian cities—Panipat, Bengaluru, and Tirupur—towards sustainable textile waste management.  
“Panipat in Haryana is emerging as a global hub for textile recycling. Bengaluru is setting an example with innovative technological solutions, collecting more than half of the textile waste in the region. Similarly, Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is making strides in waste management through wastewater treatment and renewable energy initiatives,” he said.  
PM Modi urged citizens to be more conscious of their fashion choices and to support sustainable practices that reduce textile waste.

Title: Aid rushes into Myanmar after earthquake kills over 1,600, ravages cities
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:51:37 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s neighbours sent warships and aircraft laden with relief materials and rescue personnel on Sunday, as international aid gained steam after a massive earthquake ravaged much of the poor Southeast Asian nation.
At least 1,600 people have been killed and 3,400 injured by Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar’s strongest in a century, its military government said.
“All military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers, must work together in a coordinated and efficient manner to ensure effective medical response,” said the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, according to state-run media.
The U.S. Geological Service’s predictive modelling estimated Myanmar’s death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country’s annual economic output.
The quake jolted parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 17 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities. At least 78 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed building.
The deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges, slowing humanitarian operations, according to the United Nations.
‘NO AID, NO RESCUE WORKERS’
The quake hit a nation already in chaos with a civil war that has escalated since the 2021 military coup, which ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and sparked a nationwide armed uprising.
The fighting has battered the largely agrarian economy of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, displaced over 3.5 million people and left essential services, such as healthcare, in tatters.
The opposition National Unity Government, which includes remnants of the previous administration, said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday.
“The NUG, together with resistance forces, allied organisations and civil society groups, will carry out rescue operations,” it said in a statement.
In some of the country’s hardest hit areas, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves.
The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said resident Han Zin.
“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out.
“We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”
Across the Irrawaddy river in Mandalay, a rescue worker said most operations in the country’s second-largest city were being conducted by small, self-organised resident groups that lack the required equipment.
“We have been approaching collapsed buildings, but some structures remain unstable while we work,” he said, asking not to be named because of security concerns.
FIELD HOSPITAL
Scores of people were feared trapped under collapsed buildings across Mandalay but most could not be reached or pulled out without heavy machinery, another humanitarian worker and two residents said.
“People are still stuck in the buildings, they can’t take people out,” said a resident who asked not to be named.
Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including Mandalay and Sagaing, were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
India, China and Thailand are among the neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
Indian military aircraft made multiple sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyitaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.
The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
Multiple teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed in overland from its southwestern province of Yunnan, China’s embassy in Myanmar said on social media.
A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state-media said.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

The day unfolded with heartfelt embraces, exchanges of Eid greetings, and the sharing of sweets and traditional delicacies, creating an infectious spirit of unity.  
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, people were seen wearing new clothes and smiling with heartfelt joy.  
The streets and homes were adorned with festive decorations, and the aroma of freshly prepared biryanis, kebabs, and sweet treats like sevai, kheer, and sheer khurma wafted through the air.

A huge crowd is observed at the Jhandewalan Temple in central Delhi.”  
The day began with prayers at mosques and open grounds, followed by visits to relatives and friends, where the tradition of exchanging sweets and gifts continued to foster bonds of love and togetherness.  
In rural areas, small gatherings and family feasts created an equally heartwarming atmosphere, where the essence of Eid was celebrated through acts of charity, the giving of Zakat, and the spirit of giving.  
The celebrations are not only about food but also about spreading peace, goodwill, and joy.  
Eid-ul-Fitr, which means “Festival of Breaking the Fast,” is celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.  
After a month of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Eid marks a time of festivity, where Muslims express their gratitude for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.  
Eid reinforces the values of charity, kindness, and compassion. In addition to giving Zakat, many people choose to help others by providing meals, clothing, and support to those less fortunate, reflecting the Islamic principles of empathy and care for others.

Title: Myanmar earthquake death toll rises to 1,700 as rescuers scramble to find survivors
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 06:50:42 +0000
Content: Rescue efforts are underway in Myanmar after a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing at least 1,700 people and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. The quake, which was felt as far away as Bangkok and parts of China, has left many more injured or trapped under rubble, CNN reported. 
At least 1,700 people are confirmed dead, with around 3,400 injured, according to the country’s military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 based on early modeling, CNN reported.  
The earthquake’s epicenter was located in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, near the historic city of Mandalay. The region, home to over 1.5 million people, has been severely affected, with multiple buildings, bridges, and temples either destroyed or damaged.  
In Bangkok, the earthquake’s impact was devastating, with at least 18 people killed and dozens more trapped under the rubble of a collapsed high-rise building. The building, which was under construction, came crashing down within minutes, claiming 11 lives.  
According to CNN, seven additional fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital as authorities scrambled to respond to the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with around 80 people still missing. Families of the missing have gathered at the site of the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.  
The earthquake that struck Myanmar was the most powerful to hit the country in over a century, registering a magnitude of 7.7. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a 6.7-magnitude tremor, which continued to rattle the region throughout the weekend.  
Rescue teams are racing against time to reach those affected, particularly in areas cut off by the collapse of a key bridge over the Irrawaddy River. With many still unaccounted for, experts fear that the true death toll may take weeks to emerge.  
Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.  
Friday’s quake is the deadliest natural disaster to hit Myanmar in years and comes at a time when the country is already reeling from a civil war. Since 2021, the ongoing conflict has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure, and left millions without adequate food and shelter.  
The level of devastation in the country “hasn’t been seen in over a century,” according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  
The impact of the earthquake will be felt “for the next few weeks,” Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise as more people remain trapped under collapsed buildings.

Title: Indian markets closed for Eid; Asian equities hit by heavy sell-off
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 05:04:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets remained closed on Monday for Eid-ul-Fitr, while major Asian markets grappled with heavy selling pressure amid heightened investor concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 4%, Taiwan’s Weighted Index declined 2.97%, and South Korea’s benchmark index slipped over 2.5%, reflecting widespread market jitters.
On Friday, Indian markets ended in the red, with the Nifty closing at 23,519 points after shedding 72 points, while the Sensex declined by 0.25 percent to settle at 77,414.  
The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: Education system is being Indianised: Maha CM Fadnavis says Sonia Gandhi should support NEP
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:41:04 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday lauded the New Education Policy (NEP), saying that it represents the “Indianisation” of India’s education system.  
His statement comes in response to criticism from Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who accused the Centre of pushing its “three core agendas—centralisation, commercialisation, and communalisation” through the NEP in an opinion piece published in The Hindu.  
Reacting to this, CM Fadnavis said that Sonia Gandhi should gain more awareness about the policy and support the Indianisation of India’s education system.  
“If the education policy introduced by Macaulay to enslave our country is being replaced with an Indianised system, then no one should have any objection to it. Any patriot will support this change. I believe Sonia Gandhi ji should learn more about it and wholeheartedly support the Indianisation of the Indian education system,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur.  
Earlier on Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to end the tendency of dividing the country based on language. He reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains committed to protecting Hindi as well as all other Indian languages.  
“Some people are unnecessarily creating controversy over Tamil and Hindi. However, the BJP is fully committed to safeguarding Hindi and all other Indian languages, and we are actively working toward that goal. There is no competition between Hindi and other Indian languages; rather, there is a spirit of cooperation among them. Hindi strengthens all Indian languages, and all Indian languages strengthen Hindi,” Singh stressed.  
“This trend of dividing the country in the name of language must stop. And if anyone can effectively spread this message and play an active role in promoting unity, I believe our sisters can do so in a more impactful way,” he added.

Title: 6th BIMSTEC Summit to convene in Bangkok on April 4, focusing on trade, security and regional cooperation
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:46:48 +0000
Content: The 6th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is set to take place on April 4 in Bangkok, Thailand, under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,” according to a release from the BIMSTEC Secretariat.  
The summit, being held three years after the 5th Summit in Colombo (which was conducted virtually in 2022), will be preceded by a meeting of BIMSTEC Senior Officials on April 2 and a meeting of BIMSTEC Foreign or External Affairs Ministers on April 3.  
According to the release, the summit aims to strengthen collaboration among the seven member states—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—to address shared security and developmental challenges.  
The agenda includes adopting the 6th BIMSTEC Summit Declaration, which will outline the leaders’ vision and directives, as well as the Bangkok Vision 2030, a pioneering roadmap for future cooperation among member states.  
Key agreements slated for signing include the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation, designed to boost cargo and passenger transport across the Bay of Bengal, enhancing trade and travel. Additionally, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be signed between BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), marking the beginning of new developmental partnerships.  
The summit will also see the adoption of the Rules of Procedure for BIMSTEC Mechanisms, complementing the BIMSTEC Charter to strengthen the institutional framework for regional cooperation. Furthermore, the Report of the Eminent Persons Group on the Future Direction of BIMSTEC—finalized after six meetings in 2024 and consultations with stakeholders—will be presented, with member states already initiating implementation steps.  
Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving global political and economic landscape, the 6th BIMSTEC Summit is expected to reinforce the organization’s role as the sole regional body in the Bay of Bengal, fostering cooperation to address security and sustainable development challenges.  
Since its inception in June 1997, BIMSTEC has held five summits in Bangkok in 2004, New Delhi in 2008, Nay Pyi Taw in 2014, Kathmandu in 2018, and Colombo in 2022. 
The upcoming summit marks a pivotal moment in shaping BIMSTEC’s future agenda across key sectors such as agriculture and food security, connectivity, environment and climate change, people-to-people contact, science, technology and innovation, security, and trade, investment, and development. BIMSTEC is also focusing on sub-sectors including the Blue Economy and Disaster Management.

Title: Screen use during bedtime can raise insomnia risk by 59%: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:29:38 +0000
Content: Love to scroll through your phone while in bed? Scientists have found that using a screen in bed can increase the risk of insomnia by 59%. 
While sleep is critical for both mental and physical health, an increasing number of people have become accustomed to using screens in bed. A study by researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health suggests that this habit may be linked to poor sleep.  
Although social media is often associated with poorer sleep due to its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation, a survey of 45,202 young adults aged 18-28 in Norway found that the type of screen activity did not matter.  
“We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption. This is likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting,” said lead author Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland from the institute.  
The study showed that screen use in bed can reduce sleep time by an average of 24 minutes. 
Notably, sleep problems were found to be highly prevalent among students.  
This may “have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being,” Hjetland added.  
Published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychiatry*, the study suggests that screens reduce sleep time primarily because they displace rest, rather than increasing wakefulness. Different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.  
“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30-60 minutes before sleep,” Hjetland advised.  
“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night,” she added, while calling for further studies to better understand the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.  
A separate study by researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US found that young adults who do not get the right amount of sleep may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure or hypertension— a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

We can see Muslims, Christians, and Hindus living in the same space, sharing the same culture, and also sharing love.”  
Another foreign student from Nigeria at GD Goenka University said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid for the second time. This is a nice place. We meet many people from different parts of the country, from our country.”  
After offering Namaz at Jama Masjid on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, another student of GD Goenka University said, “Jama Masjid is a very nice place. I met many friends and people here. We prayed together. It is one of the biggest mosques in India.”

The ongoing market pressure is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which, despite being factored into market sentiment, continues to cause uncertainty. Investors are now awaiting further clarity on the impact of these tariffs, which are set to take effect on April 2. The coming days will be crucial in determining the long-term market reaction to these policy changes.  
In the Indian markets, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net sellers for the third consecutive month in March. So far in 2025, they have been net sellers throughout.  
Data from the National Securities Depository Limited showed that FPIs had sold stocks worth Rs 3,973 crore in March. In January and February, they had offloaded equities worth Rs 78,027 crore and Rs 34,574 crore, respectively.  
FPIs had fueled the bull run in the stock market before the recent sharp slump. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves an investor buying foreign financial assets. The benchmark Sensex remains nearly 8,500 points below its all-time high of 85,978 points. However, the pace of FPI sell-offs in March has slowed down in recent sessions.  
“Despite Friday’s market close showing a decline, the robust recovery witnessed in the latter half of March, fueled by substantial foreign portfolio investor inflows, has enabled the major indices to conclude the fiscal year 2025 with notable gains,” said Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.  
He further added, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support, struggling to break the crucial resistance level of 23,800. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The technical price trading above all key moving averages further signals an uptrend.”

Title: Trump threatens Iran with bombing, tariffs if nuclear deal not reached
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:43:22 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with “possible bombing” and the imposition of secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not comply with the nuclear deal proposed by the US.  
During a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said that the US would give Iran a couple of weeks to comply and that stern action would be taken depending on how the negotiations progress.  
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing—the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump warned, as quoted by NBC News.  
“We have secondary tariffs on Iran, and we’ll probably give it a couple of weeks. If we don’t see any progress, we’re going to impose them. But we will decide on secondary tariffs based on whether or not they agree to a nuclear deal. If they make a deal, then we will never impose secondary tariffs; instead, we will hope they have a great, long, and successful life as a country,” he added.  
Trump also struck a conciliatory tone, expressing confidence that Iran would accept the deal, though he cautioned that failure to do so would have serious consequences.  
“But we’ll see what happens… I can’t imagine them doing anything other than making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the alternative, which I think everybody understands—and that alternative is not going to be pretty. And I do not prefer that,” he emphasized.  
Earlier on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Iran had rejected the possibility of direct talks with the US following a letter from President Trump regarding its nuclear program, Politico reported.  
“Although the possibility of direct negotiations has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said, as quoted by Politico.  
Tensions between Iran and the US have heightened since Trump returned to office, with his administration maintaining that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon. During his previous term, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear agreement designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, later accusing Tehran of failing to comply, Politico reported. That agreement also included China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, and the European Union.

May these celebrations usher in an era of prosperity and amity for all,” he said in a X post.

Title: Trump hints at defying constitution with third-term bid, says ‘not joking’
Publication Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 04:08:32 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by suggesting he may seek a third term in office, despite constitutional restrictions, CBS News reported.  
In a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump claimed, “There are methods which you could do it,” raising concerns about his willingness to challenge the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. “I’m not joking,” he emphasized, while also stating, “It is far too early to think about it.”  
According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This limit was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four consecutive terms.  
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally questionable, and it is unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the idea. However, his comments reflect a strong desire to maintain power, reminiscent of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
Trump’s remarks have been met with fierce criticism. Rep. Daniel Goldman called it “an escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy.” He urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s ambitions, saying, “If they believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing this.”  
Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously served as lead counsel for Trump’s first impeachment.  
Meanwhile, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, endorsed the idea, saying, “We want Trump in ’28.”  
Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, dismissed the idea, stating, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”  
Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, referenced the 12th Amendment, which states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.” He argued that if Trump is barred from the presidency under the 22nd Amendment, he is also ineligible to run for vice president.  
“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller added.  
Any attempt to pursue a third term would require extraordinary cooperation from federal and state officials, the courts, and voters.  
Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked about continuing to serve. He simply responded, “Well, I like working.” However, experts agree that a third term remains highly unlikely due to significant constitutional barriers.

Title: Big storms can’t uproot those connected to roots, says PM Modi, lauds Indian diaspora
Publication Date: Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underscored the importance of staying connected to one’s roots, stating that no matter how strong a storm may be, those deeply rooted in their heritage cannot be uprooted. Reflecting on his recent visit to Mauritius, he praised the Indian diaspora for preserving their cultural identity across generations.
Speaking during the 120th episode of Mann Ki Baat, he shared messages he received through MyGov and the NaMo App, highlighting the unique expressions of Indian culture. Among them, he mentioned a message that particularly stood out.
“Atharva Kapoor from Varanasi, Aaryash Leekha, and Atrey Maan from Mumbai expressed their thoughts on my visit to Mauritius. They said they greatly enjoyed the performance of Geet Gawai during the event. I received similar sentiments from people in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Watching Geet Gawai in Mauritius was a truly incredible experience,” he said.
Recalling the historical journey of Indian indentured labourers, he reflected on their resilience and commitment to cultural preservation. “Nearly 200 years ago, many Indians went to Mauritius as indentured labourers, uncertain of what lay ahead. Over time, they built their lives there, forged a unique identity, and remained deeply connected to their roots,” he noted.
He shared another anecdote from his visit to Guyana, where he witnessed a Chowtaal performance, emphasizing how Indian traditions continue to thrive beyond the subcontinent. To illustrate this cultural continuity, he played an audio clip of Phagwa Chowtaal from Fiji, expressing his admiration for how these traditions still evoke enthusiasm and joy.
“You might think this music is from some part of India, but you would be surprised to know it’s from Fiji. This Phagwa Chowtaal is immensely popular there and fills people with incredible energy,” he remarked. He also played a Chowtaal recording from Suriname, pointing out its significance and the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated.
During the broadcast, he highlighted how Indian cultural traditions are not just preserved but also cherished across the world. He mentioned seeing the President of Suriname, Chan Santokhi, enjoying the performance, adding that similar traditions thrive in Trinidad and Tobago, where Indian festivals are celebrated with great fervor. Many of the songs performed in these countries continue to be in Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj, and Maithili, keeping linguistic heritage alive.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the efforts of various organizations that are committed to conserving Indian heritage globally. He praised the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, which recently marked its 75th anniversary. Applauding their dedication to preserving Indian dance, music, and culture, he noted that even Singapore’s President, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, was a guest of honor at the event and commended the organization’s contributions.
Extending his best wishes, Modi emphasized how these global efforts reaffirm the deep cultural ties that Indians maintain across generations, no matter where they are in the world.

Title: SpaceX launches private astronaut crew in Fram2 polar-orbiting mission
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:23:58 +0000
Content: Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Monday launched a crew of four private astronauts led by a crypto entrepreneur on a mission to orbit Earth from pole to pole, a novel trajectory in which no humans have traveled before.
Maltese investor Chun Wang, a Chinese-born magnate who founded a bitcoin mining company, is the bankroller and commander of the SpaceX mission, named Fram2, a reference to the Norwegian “Fram” ship that pioneered Arctic exploration at the turn of the 20th century.
Wang and three associates launched aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule at 9:47 p.m. EDT on Monday (0147 GMT on Tuesday) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, setting off for a free-flying mission for three to five days, during which they will partake in 22 research experiments largely centered on how spaceflight and microgravity affect the human body.
The four crew members on Monday afternoon were driven to the launchpad in a caravan of Teslas – the electric cars of Musk’s other company – winding through the roads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a police escort, as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched overhead in an unrelated Starlink mission.
“We’re gonna watch a rocket launch while on our way to a rocket launch,” Wang wrote on X, the social media site owned by Musk, alongside a video of a Falcon 9 climbing the skies to space during their drive.
The mission, SpaceX’s sixth private astronaut flight, is the company’s latest novel effort that expands its dominance in the global human spaceflight arena. It comes as Musk’s power as SpaceX CEO and the world’s richest man soars as he works as a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, a role that has given him extraordinary influence for a businessman over an array of U.S. policy matters.
Fram2 is the 16th crewed mission overall using the reusable Crew Dragon, a gumdrop-shaped spacecraft that SpaceX developed with NASA funding to provide the U.S. space agency a ride for its astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
SpaceX and its Dragon craft have dominated the nascent market for private orbital spaceflight, an area in which a key source of demand originally came from a small field of wealthy tourists. Dragon is the world’s only privately built capsule routinely flying missions in orbit, as Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule is held up in development.
In recent years, with Dragon flights costing roughly $55 million per seat, the spaceflight market – involving companies such as Axiom Space that contract Crew Dragon missions – has fixated more on astronauts from governments willing to pay the sum mainly for national prestige and bolstering domestic spaceflight experience.
But the Fram2 crew is untethered from government backing. Wang’s friends include Norwegian film director Jannicke Mikkelsen, who specializes in virtual-reality cinematography; German robotics researcher and polar scientist Rabea Rogge, and Australian adventurer Eric Philips, who has taken up ambitious skiing expeditions in Earth’s harsh polar regions.

Title: South Korea Constitutional Court to rule on Yoon’s impeachment on April 4
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:12:36 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court, which is reviewing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment, will announce its decision on whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him on April 4, the court said in a statement on Tuesday.
The court said the ruling will be delivered at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) and live broadcast of the session will be permitted.
Yoon was impeached by parliament on December 14 after being accused of violating his constitutional duty by declaring martial law in early December with no justifiable grounds.
The suspended leader has said he never intended to fully impose military rule but instead meant to sound the alarm over the opposition Democratic Party’s abuse of its parliamentary majority that he argued was threatening to destroy the country.
In his final statement before the court ended arguments on February 25, Yoon also said his decision to declare martial law was an appeal to the people to overcome “anti-state forces”, pro-North Korea sympathisers, and opposition gridlock.
The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the dollar after the announcement of the ruling date. The stock market’s benchmark was up 1.5% after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5%.
The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when 6 or more judges agree, according to South Korea’s constitution.
The wait of more than a month for the time of the ruling has fuelled a bitter clash between the ruling party, with many of its members calling for Yoon’s reinstatement, and the opposition, which has said his return would deal a serious blow to the country’s constitutional order.
The looming decision has also deepened division among the public, with large crowds packing downtown streets in rallies for and against Yoon’s removal, with rhetoric becoming increasingly heated. Police are bracing for potential violence once the ruling is announced.
The People Power Party’s floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, welcomed the announcement and said the ruling party will accept the court’s decision but warned “social conflict will become stronger whatever the decision is”.
The Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said he was confident the court will rule unanimously against Yoon.
The majority of the public backs Yoon’s removal, according to opinion polls, although support has ebbed since the initial days after the martial law declaration last December.
A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed 60% of the respondents saying Yoon should be ousted.
NEW ELECTION WITHIN 60 DAYS IF YOON OUSTED
Parliamentary lawyers seeking his removal compared Yoon to a dictator during their final arguments at his impeachment trial.
Yoon, a former prosecutor who has seen his popularity dive, could face removal from office less than three years into his five-year presidency if his impeachment is upheld, marking a tumultuous end to a tenure marred by political turmoil.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon is also on a separate criminal trial on charges of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law and faces the death penalty or life in prison if convicted although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997.
His shock martial law announcement, which banned political and parliamentary activity, triggered a constitutional crisis that also led to the impeachment of the prime minister who became acting president.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was reinstated on March 24 by the Constitutional Court and resumed his role as acting president.
In an impeachment trial in 2017, eight justices of the court at the time unanimously backed a decision to oust the then President Park Geun-hye for violating her constitutional duty.

Title: India nears Naxalism-free goal as most affected districts drop to six: Home Minister Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced a significant reduction in the number of districts most affected by Left-Wing Extremism (LWE), also known as Naxalism, stating that the number has dropped from 12 to just 6. This reduction marks a key milestone in the ongoing efforts to create a Naxalism-free India.
In a post on X, Shah highlighted the Modi government’s “ruthless approach” towards eradicating Naxalism and emphasized the country’s commitment to fostering development across all regions. “The Modi government is determined to build a Sashakt, Surakshit, and Samriddh Bharat with relentless efforts for all-encompassing development and a firm stance against Naxalism. We are committed to uprooting Naxalism completely by 31st March 2026,” he stated.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of districts affected by Naxalism in India had previously been 38. Out of these, the number of “most affected” districts has now decreased to 6, with a parallel reduction in the number of “Districts of Concern” and “Other LWE-affected Districts.”
The six districts most affected by Naxalism now include four from Chhattisgarh (Bijapur, Kanker, Narayanpur, and Sukma), one from Jharkhand (West Singhbhum), and one from Maharashtra (Gadchiroli).
Additionally, the number of “Districts of Concern,” which require intensified resources and attention, has been reduced from 9 to 6. These districts are located in Andhra Pradesh (Alluri Sitarama Raju), Madhya Pradesh (Balaghat), Odisha (Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Malkangiri), and Telangana (Bhadradri-Kothagudem).
The number of “Other LWE-affected Districts,” which are also experiencing Naxal activity but to a lesser degree, has dropped from 17 to 6. These include districts from Chhattisgarh (Dantewada, Gariaband, and Mohla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki), Jharkhand (Latehar), Odisha (Nuapada), and Telangana (Mulugu).
To support these districts in their recovery and development, central govt provides financial assistance under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) scheme. The most affected districts receive Rs. 30 crore, while Districts of Concern are allocated Rs. 10 crore to fill gaps in public infrastructure. Special projects tailored to the needs of these areas are also funded by the government.

Title: US, Denmark to hold first high-level talks since Trump’s win
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:45:00 +0000
Content: Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen is set to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week in the first high-level talks since President Donald Trump’s re-election and his vow to “take control” of Greenland, the Financial Times said.
The prospect of such talks comes amid simmering tension between the two nations over U.S. interest in taking control of Greenland, the Arctic island controlled by Denmark since 1721.
The meeting is planned for the sidelines of a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels set to begin on Thursday, the paper said on Tuesday, citing two officials briefed on the preparations.
However, the officials warned the event could be cancelled because of tense relations between Copenhagen and Washington, it added.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland from April 2 to 4 for talks with the new government of the semi-autonomous territory just days after a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.
On his trip, Vance accused Denmark of not doing a good job of keeping the island safe and suggested the United States would better protect the strategically located island.

Title: India’s most-capped women’s player Vandana Katariya bids farewell to international hockey
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:04:41 +0000
Content: Indian women’s hockey stalwart Vandana Katariya has officially announced her retirement from international hockey, bringing an end to an illustrious career spanning over 15 years.
With 320 international appearances and 158 goals to her name, Vandana departs as the most-capped player in the history of Indian women’s hockey. Beyond the numbers, she leaves behind an inspiring legacy—one of resilience, quiet determination, and an unwavering commitment to elevating Indian women’s hockey.
The 32-year-old forward, who made her senior team debut in 2009, was an integral part of several defining moments in the sport, including India’s historic fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where she became the first and only Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Games.
Announcing her retirement, Vandana, who played her last match for India during the Bhubaneswar leg of the FIH Pro League 2024-25 in February, reflected on her journey with mixed emotions.
“This decision wasn’t easy, but I know it’s the right time. Hockey has been my life for as long as I can remember, and wearing the Indian jersey was the greatest honour. But every journey has its course, and I leave with immense pride, gratitude, and love for the sport. Indian hockey is in great hands, and I will always be its biggest supporter.”
She extended heartfelt appreciation to everyone who played a role in her career. “I want to thank my coaches, teammates, support staff, Hockey India, my family, and all the fans who have supported me over the years. Every cheer, every message, every word of encouragement meant the world to me.”
Hailing from Roshnabad, Haridwar, Vandana’s journey began like that of many young girls in India—on dusty fields with dreams far bigger than her circumstances. Over the years, she represented India on the grandest stages, including two Olympic Games (Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020), two FIH Hockey Women’s World Cups (2018, 2022), three Commonwealth Games (2014, 2018, 2022), and three Asian Games (2014, 2018, 2022).
Her contributions were instrumental in India’s rise in world hockey. She played a pivotal role in securing gold medals at the Women’s Asian Champions Trophy (2016, 2023) and the FIH Hockey Women’s Nations Cup (2022), silver medals at the 2018 Asian Games, the 2013 and 2018 Women’s Asian Champions Trophy, and bronze medals at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the 2014 and 2022 Asian Games, and the FIH Hockey Pro League 2021-22.
Hockey India President Dilip Tirkey paid tribute to Vandana’s contributions, saying, “Vandana was not just a goal scorer; she was the heartbeat of the Indian attack, a tireless worker, and a leader by example. Her presence in the forward line gave India an edge, especially in high-pressure situations. She has set a benchmark for future generations, and we at Hockey India are immensely proud of her achievements. We wish her the very best in her future endeavours.”
Vandana was also a key member of India’s bronze medal-winning squad at the 2013 Junior World Cup, finishing as the team’s top scorer and the tournament’s third-highest goal scorer.
Apart from representing India in multiple global tournaments, Vandana featured in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Hockey India League in 2025, playing for Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers.
Among her many achievements, Vandana’s Tokyo Olympics heroics remain unforgettable. Her hat-trick in a crucial 4-3 victory over South Africa helped India reach the quarterfinals and secure their best-ever Olympic finish.
Speaking about that defining moment, Vandana said, “I still get goosebumps thinking about Tokyo. The Olympics are special, and that match against South Africa was one of the most emotional games of my life. I just wanted to give everything for my team, for my country. The hattrick was special, but more than that, it was about proving that we belonged on that stage.”
For her immense contributions, Vandana was honoured with some of India’s most prestigious awards, including the Arjuna Award (2021) and the Padma Shri (2022). She also received the Hockey India Balbir Singh Sr. Award for Player of the Year (Women) in 2014, the Hockey India President’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2021, and the Hockey India Dhanraj Pillay Award for Forward of the Year in 2021 and 2022, cementing her status as one of India’s finest forwards.
Hockey India Secretary General Bhola Nath Singh lauded her remarkable journey, stating, “Vandana’s journey is nothing short of inspirational. From her early days to becoming a stalwart of Indian hockey, she has shown exceptional skill, resilience, and commitment. Her performances in crucial matches, especially at the Tokyo Olympics, will be remembered for years to come. As she takes her final bow, she leaves behind a legacy of resilience, excellence, and inspiration—one that will continue to guide the next generation of Indian hockey stars.”

Title: Mumbai scouts find another IPL gem in paceman Ashwani
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:46:08 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya heaped praise on his team’s scouting department for unearthing another gem in Ashwani Kumar, after the pace bowler produced the best figures by an Indian on his Indian Premier League debut.
The 23-year-old Ashwani bagged 4-24 in three overs on Monday to help dismiss reigning champions Kolkata Knight Riders for 116 in 16.2 overs before Mumbai secured an eight-wicket victory to open their account in this year’s tournament.
Ashwani’s heroics came after spinner Vignesh Puthur claimed 3-32 on his debut in Mumbai’s defeat by Chennai Super Kings last week, and Pandya was delighted with the team’s latest find.
“I’m really happy for the young kid,” said Pandya.
“It’s all the scouts, they picked him. They’ve gone to all places and picked these young kids. We played a practice game, he had that zip, that late swing, something off the wicket, a different action and he was a lefty.”
Mumbai batsman Ryan Rickelton also played a big role in the win with an unbeaten 62, but said Ashwani had laid the foundation with his deceptive pace and swing.
“He’s a lot quicker than people recognise at first. I think that’s a great attribute he has, and he can swing the new ball,” South African Rickelton added.
“I know it’s quite tough, we’ve got two specialist swing bowlers with the new ball as well, but to have that second plan without that swing factor was really impressive … He rushes you a little bit as well.
“He’s a great addition to the group and the wicket can suit him. Looking forward to seeing, if he gets the opportunity, his other set of skills come through. He’s a nice find for Mumbai.”

Content: Teenage batting prodigy Sam Konstas has been added to Australia’s list of contracted players in a huge vote of confidence for the two-test opener.
The 19-year-old was named among 23 contracted players on Tuesday, three months on from making a memorable 60 in his international debut in the Melbourne test against India.
Konstas was one of three players to earn their first national contracts, joining spinner Matt Kuhnemann and all-rounder Beau Webster.
White-ball all-rounders Sean Abbott and Aaron Hardie, and seven-test spinner Todd Murphy made way for the new trio.
“In Sam, we see promising upside in a young player who will continue to develop at the first-class level and in the international environment,” selector George Bailey said in a statement.
Kuhnemann’s contract is another boost for the left-arm spinner who was recently cleared of having a suspect bowling action following his prolific tour of Sri Lanka.
Kuhnemann was reported for his bowling action after he was Player of the Series with 16 wickets in Sri Lanka.
Tasmania all-rounder Webster has had a strong entry into test cricket since his Sydney debut against India, scoring 150 runs at an average of 50.00 from his three matches along with three wickets with his medium pace.
“Matt was outstanding once again in Sri Lanka and we believe he can play a key role across the next 18 months,” said Bailey.
“In Beau’s case, he proved more than comfortable at Test level with bat and ball, adds an additional dimension in the field and to the balance of the side.”
With 20 out of 23 players retaining their contracts, selectors have opted for continuity over change for an aging Australian squad.
All-rounder Mitchell Marsh may feel fortunate to be included after the 33-year-old was dropped during the test series against India after a dreadful run of scores.
Pace bowler Jhye Richardson was retained despite nearly three years passing since his last international match.
Fringe pace bowlers Lance Morris and Xavier Bartlett also kept their contracts after barely featuring for Australia in the 2024/25 season.

Title: China launches military drills around Taiwan, calls its president a ‘parasite’
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 05:26:48 +0000
Content: China began joint army, navy and rocket force exercises around Taiwan on Tuesday as a “stern warning” against separatism and called Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te a “parasite”, as Taiwan sent warships to respond to China’s navy approaching its coast.
The exercises around the democratically governed island, which China views as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring under its control, come after Lai called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” last month.
China detests Lai as a “separatist,” and in a video accompanying the Eastern Theatre Command’s announcement of the drills depicted him as cartoon bug held by a pair of chopsticks above a burning Taiwan, calling him in English a “parasite”.
“The focus is on exercises such as combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets, and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes,” the Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills, with the presidential office saying China was “widely recognised by the international community as a troublemaker” and that the government has the confidence and ability to defend itself.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.
Two senior Taiwan officials told Reuters that more than 10 Chinese military ships had approached close to Taiwan’s 24 nautical mile (44 km) contiguous zone and Taiwan sent its own warships to respond.
However, Taiwan has not detected any live fire by the Chinese military, one of the officials said.
TAIWAN DISPATCHES WARSHIPS
Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered the island’s response area on Monday, adding that it had dispatched military aircraft and ships and activated land-based missile systems in response.
The drills took place after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth left the region following visits to Japan and the Philippines, where he criticised China and said Japan was “indispensable” for tackling Chinese aggression.
A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters, citing internal assessments, that Beijing needed to avoid any “perceived confrontation” with Washington prior to the U.S.-China trade talks, and thus Taiwan has become a pretext.
“Taiwan is their best excuse. That’s why they chose to launch such military drills as soon as the U.S. defence secretary left Asia,” the official said.
The de facto U.S. embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, said the United States will continue to support the island.
“Once again, China has shown that it is not a responsible actor and has no problem putting the region’s security and prosperity at risk,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
“CLOSING IN”
China’s military released a series of propaganda videos in quick succession after the drill announcement, depicting Chinese warships and fighter jets encircling Taiwan, Taipei being aimed at from above, and military vehicles patrolling city streets.
A video of a poster accompanying the drills titled “Closing In,” and showing Chinese forces surrounding the island, was released on the Eastern Theatre Command’s Weibo.
This was followed by a video titled “Shell”, depicting president Lai as a green cartoon bug spawning parasites across the island, on the Eastern Theatre Command’s WeChat page.
“Parasite poisoning Taiwan island. Parasite hollowing Island out. Parasite courting ultimate destruction,” the animation said.
Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said such rhetoric was not conducive to peace and “shows their provocative character,” when asked about Lai’s cartoon depiction.
A third video, “Subdue Demons and Vanquish Evils”, featured Sun Wukong, the magical monkey king from the Ming Dynasty epic “Journey to the West” as he is depicted in the “Black Myth: Wukong” hit video game.
It opens with the video’s title flashing across the screen and the Chinese mythical warrior riding on clouds before cutting to footage of Chinese fighter jets.
“The joint exercise and training conducted by the Eastern Theatre of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the vicinity of Taiwan Island is a resolute punishment for the Lai Ching-Te authorities’ rampant ‘independence’ provocations,” said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office.
Taiwan’s Koo told reporters the PLA should focus first on resolving its issues with corruption instead of destroying peace and stability in the region.
China’s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge over the past few years, which saw former Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu ousted in October 2024.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Koo’s remarks.
The Taiwan security source, citing internal intelligence assessments, said China was trying to busy its military with exercises as a way of distracting and stopping its soldiers from discussing the corruption crackdown amongst themselves on base.
China’s coast guard said it was also taking part in the drills, saying it was simulating “inspection and capture, interception and detention operations against unwarranted vessels” to show its exercise of “legitimate jurisdiction” over Taiwan.
The Global Times, which is owned by the People’s Daily newspaper of the governing Chinese Communist Party, said the drill had not been given a code name to show that Chinese military forces surrounding the island “has become a normal practice,” citing Zhang Chi of National Defence University.
“Through a series of exercises held in the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the PLA has strongly enhanced its ability to prepare for war and fight battles,” the article on the paper’s Weixin social media page added.
China has staged several rounds of war games around Taiwan since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in 2022.

Title: The next UPI? How an India energy stack can lead the digital energy revolution
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:06:39 +0000
Content: At the United Nations’ first International Conference on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in April 2024, held under India’s leadership, the global discussion centered on how this framework can accelerate sustainable development and promote inclusivity.
As a participant in these discussions, it was evident that India’s success in building open, interoperable, and citizen-centric DPIs has set a global benchmark.
While Aadhaar has transformed delivery of public services, social security and welfare measure for a large target audience, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has disrupted traditional banking and finance to make it inclusive and universally available to all.
These DPIs have demonstrated how technology can bridge accessibility gaps, improve governance, enhance efficiency, and unlock economic opportunities at scale.
India’s DPI revolution has proved that open digital infrastructure can accelerate social and economic development across sectors. This same digital-first approach also holds immense potential to address one of the country’s most complex challenges—energy transition.
The case for an India energy stack 
With a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and a net-zero commitment by 2070, India is moving forward to modernize its aging power grid, integrate large-scale renewable energy, and ensure affordability and accessibility for all.
However, several systemic barriers hinder this transition. Intermittent renewable supply, inefficient grid management, and a lack of real-time energy data make large-scale clean energy integration challenging. Financially struggling distribution companies, land acquisition hurdles, and storage constraints add further roadblocks. Fragmented policy implementation and regulatory misalignment between central and state governments hinder efficiency and slow progress.
To overcome these challenges, India needs a digitally integrated energy ecosystem—an ‘India Energy Stack’—that enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, much like the India UPI Stack transformed financial services.
Benefits of an energy stack 
India’s energy governance must transition from a fragmented, legacy energy system to a digitally integrated, intelligent, and citizen-centric model.
A unified digital energy architecture could unlock efficiencies that today remain out of reach. Grid reliability could be transformed through real-time intelligence, markets could become more transparent and competitive, and decentralized renewable energy could be scaled more effectively.
Moreover, the convergence of AI, blockchain, and IoT in the energy sector has the potential to create a self-regulating, demand-responsive system, reducing inefficiencies and ensuring that energy flows dynamically when and where it is needed most.
A digital-first approach could also make India’s energy transition more equitable. By embedding granular data tracking and real-time analytics, clean energy can be expanded without placing additional strain on grid networks.
What can India do? 

India must establish a Digital Energy Identity (DEID) for every consumer, prosumer, and energy producer to enable seamless participation in energy markets, targeted subsidy distribution, and decentralized renewable energy trading. While Aadhaar can serve as a foundational identity layer, DEID should be designed specifically to track energy consumption, facilitate dynamic pricing, and integrate with real-time market mechanisms.
A UPI-linked digital payment system for electricity can streamline transactions, allowing consumers to pay bills, trade surplus solar energy, and receive instant credits, eliminating inefficiencies in billing and settlement while improving financial inclusion. This could accelerate the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, enabling seamless payments for households selling excess rooftop solar power to the grid, ensuring faster crediting and wider adoption of decentralized renewable energy.
India must leverage the National Smart Grid Mission, which focuses on automation, communication, and IT systems to enhance real-time grid reliability. AI-driven forecasting and IoT-enabled smart meters should be deployed to predict demand fluctuations, prevent outages, and enable dynamic pricing. These technologies will help utilities optimize energy distribution, reduce peak load stress, and lower costs while ensuring better integration of renewables into the grid.
India must develop a National Energy Data Platform (NEDP), building on NITI Aayog’s India Energy Dashboards (IED), to serve as a real-time, open energy data exchange. This platform should provide utilities, regulators, and startups with access to granular consumption patterns, grid load forecasts, and decentralized energy trading insights. A sandbox for innovation can help startups develop new use cases to improve demand-supply planning, optimize pricing, and enhance service efficiency, while standardized data drives market innovation, strengthens grid reliability, and supports AI-powered decision-making for a more adaptive energy ecosystem.
India must integrate blockchain technology into its newly launched Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) to ensure real-time verification, prevent fraud, and enhance market transparency. A decentralized, tamper-proof system can streamline carbon credit transactions, boosting investor confidence and attracting climate finance. This will position the country as a leader in global carbon markets, fostering a robust green investment ecosystem.

A well-executed India Energy Stack will not only accelerate India’s clean energy transition but also position the country as a global leader in digital energy innovation. However, its success will depend on addressing key challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and the infrastructure costs of digital adoption. A robust regulatory framework and targeted incentives will be crucial to drive industry participation and ensure seamless integration.
This is India’s moment to set the standard for a future where energy is smarter, greener, and fully aligned with our vision of Viksit Bharat.

Title: UPI transaction volume up 13.5% in March, value at record Rs 24.77 lakh crore
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:54:13 +0000
Content: The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) saw a 13.59% increase in transaction volume in March, reaching 18.3 billion transactions, compared to 16.11 billion in February, according to data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
March recorded a record Rs 24.77 lakh crore worth of UPI-based transactions, marking a 12.79% increase from Rs 21.96 lakh crore in February.
On a daily basis, the UPI network saw more than 590 million average transactions, totaling Rs 79,910 crore in daily transaction value, according to NPCI data.
On a year-on-year basis, the record-breaking UPI transactions in March amounted to Rs 24.77 lakh crore, representing a 25% surge in value and an impressive 36% growth in volume. This highlights the unstoppable momentum of India’s digital payments revolution.
With daily transactions averaging Rs 79,910 crore (up 1.9% from February), and volumes rising by 2.6%, these numbers underscore the rapid adoption and trust in digital financial solutions.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, digital payment users experienced issues processing transactions on UPI. The NPCI attributed the problem to the closing of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).
“Today, due to the financial year closing, some banks are facing intermittent transaction declines. The UPI system is working fine, and we are working with the concerned banks for necessary redressal,” the NPCI said in a statement.
Starting April 1, it will be mandatory for UPI member banks, UPI apps, and third-party providers to follow new guidelines.
According to the new norms, the UPI ID linked to an inactive mobile number will become inactive. That is, if the mobile number registered with a bank is inactive for an extended period, the UPI ID of the user will also be unlinked, and the user will no longer be able to use the UPI service.
As a result, every UPI user must ensure that the mobile number registered with their bank is active.
Under the new guidelines, the user’s bank-verified mobile number will act as the UPI identifier. Additionally, banks and UPI applications must update their mobile number records every week to prevent issues arising from recycled or modified numbers.

Title: A focused article on the essential traits, tools, and strategies required for leadership in a rapidly evolving, tech-driven world
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:22:52 +0000
Content: In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of technology, leadership is undergoing a radical transformation. What was once a role focused primarily on managing IT systems has evolved into a multifaceted position centered around driving strategic innovation, fostering business growth, and enabling cross-functional collaboration. Digital leaders today must navigate the complexities of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing, all of which are reshaping industries. As these innovations bring about new opportunities, they also require a new set of leadership traits and strategies to harness their potential responsibly.
As a leading advocate for responsible digital leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the AI Summit in Paris, emphasized the need for AI systems free from biases. “AI is writing the codes of humanity in this century, but we must ensure that these codes are free from biases,” he stated. Modi’s remarks highlight the crucial responsibility of digital leaders—not only to harness cutting-edge technology but to do so in an ethical, transparent, and inclusive manner. Open-source systems and high-quality, unbiased datasets play a vital role in this effort. As digital leaders, we must ensure that the technologies we implement benefit society as a whole, advancing progress while avoiding the perpetuation of harmful biases or inequalities.
India’s own journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse provides a shining example of visionary leadership. Through initiatives like Digital India, the country has transformed itself into a global leader in the digital space. The initiative has focused on improving digital governance, building digital infrastructure, and enhancing digital literacy. With over 950 million internet users, India is proving that technology is a powerful tool for economic growth and better public service delivery. However, as India’s experience illustrates, true digital leadership is not about simply mastering the latest technologies; it is about using these tools to create meaningful impact and drive societal progress.
At the heart of successful digital leadership are certain essential traits. Adaptability and agility are paramount in a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed. Digital leaders must not only keep up with technological disruptions but also anticipate changes and lead their organizations through transitions. Whether it’s adopting AI, blockchain, or automation, leaders must remain flexible, open to change, and able to pivot when necessary.
Data-driven decision-making is another crucial trait for digital leaders. In the digital age, data is one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. Effective leaders must leverage data analytics to make informed decisions, guide strategic initiatives, and drive innovation. But data’s power comes with responsibility. Our Prime Minister’s call for unbiased AI systems highlights the vital role leaders play in ensuring that data is accurate, inclusive, and free from bias to create a fair future. Data should serve to improve fairness and transparency, and leaders must prioritize ethical considerations in their decision-making.
Yet, the ability to navigate technology and data is only part of what makes a great digital leader. Ethical leadership plays a critical role in ensuring that technology is used for the benefit of society. As AI, automation, and other advanced technologies reshape industries, leaders must be proactive in addressing privacy concerns, mitigating biases, and promoting transparency. Trust and accountability are essential elements of ethical leadership, and it is up to leaders to guide their organizations in a way that benefits all stakeholders. AI, for example, offers immense potential for improving lives and businesses, but it also raises questions around privacy, fairness, and discrimination. It is the responsibility of digital leaders to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly, without causing harm.
Another fundamental aspect of effective leadership in the digital era is emotional intelligence (EQ). While technical expertise is essential, the ability to navigate human relationships is equally important. Self-awareness, empathy, and communication skills are essential for leaders to build trust, foster collaboration, and resolve conflicts effectively. In an increasingly remote and hybrid work environment, clear and empathetic communication becomes even more crucial. The ability to connect with teams, stakeholders, and customers on a personal level is what ultimately makes a leader effective, especially when navigating the complexities of digital transformation.
Visionary thinking is also a defining trait of digital leadership. The digital world is constantly changing, and leaders must be able to anticipate the next big trend, identify opportunities, and guide their organizations toward success. Leaders who think long-term, who can envision the future of their industries and align technology with strategic goals, will lead the way in shaping the future. India’s Digital India initiative is a prime example of visionary leadership, where the country’s leadership proactively anticipated the digital revolution and took steps to ensure India could lead in this space.
To effectively lead in the digital era, digital leaders must also embrace the right tools and strategies. Cloud computing and data analytics are indispensable in helping organizations make real-time decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation. The ability to store, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data is transforming the way businesses operate and engage with customers. AI and automation are also revolutionizing industries by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. However, as these technologies evolve, leaders must strike a balance between efficiency and ethics. Automation, for example, can result in significant improvements in productivity, but it can also displace jobs if not implemented thoughtfully.
Fostering innovation is a critical component of successful digital leadership. Leaders must create environments where experimentation is encouraged, risks are taken, and learning is continuous. To remain competitive in the digital economy, organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforces. As technology evolves, so too must the skills of employees. Those who fail to keep pace with digital advancements risk becoming obsolete. By investing in continuous learning, leaders ensure that their teams remain agile and ready to tackle new challenges.
Looking to the future, the digital leader of tomorrow will need to embody a blend of technical expertise, ethical responsibility, emotional intelligence, and visionary thinking. The pace of technological change shows no sign of slowing, and the leaders who succeed will be those who can adapt quickly, make informed decisions based on data, and champion ethical and inclusive technology practices. India’s journey toward becoming a digital powerhouse offers valuable insights into how visionary leadership can drive national transformation, and the world is watching closely. In this new era, the digital leader is not just a technologist but a champion of responsible, impactful technology use—one who recognizes the power of technology to shape the future and uses it to build a better, more inclusive world.

Title: Indian Prime Minister leading the men for women vision, calling for a change in the gender imbalance in personal, social and professional lives
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:16:49 +0000
Content: The Mahabharata celebrates the presence of Krishna, a symbol for the antar-atma or inner wisdom, supporting queen Draupadi when she was wronged but none of her dear ones came to help. The ancient culture of India is replete with such stories when men and women stood by each other and created a good life together by sharing strengths. Krishna and Draupadi’s relationship was that of friendship and care, representing the core moral compass for any bond on earth. The story also emphasizes on the responsibilities of a ‘friend’ who must be there for each other in times of need. Friends may or may not be able to fight our battles on our behalf, but they are available to sharpen our arms and wash our wounds.

Women’s emancipation, globally, has been a concern for centuries. The movements have been slow, but firm and steady. Many men had come forward partnering the women in their struggles to unshackle from regressive traditions that made their worlds smaller. Such men have appeared in conservative families and narrow-minded societies, soldiering against women’s exploitations, irrespective of their personal equations with them. They stood the ground as true friends, attempting to change perspectives in favour of a fair and equal society. Men’s growing support over the years have enhanced the voices of women in raising awareness and challenging deep-rooted biases. From the fathers educating their daughters for an independent and respectful future, brothers sharing household chores, to the colleagues imparting tough training to prepare women employees for corporate growth or enforcing a safe and positive working environment – men’s cooperation normalizes women’s participation in all spheres, making it a shared responsibility rather than a women-only cause. Also, men who actively promote gender equality set strong examples for future generations.

Throughout history, several male leaders across the world have played a crucial role in championing women’s emancipation, challenging patriarchal norms, and advocating for gender equality. In India, Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a pioneering social reformer who fought against the inhumane practice of sati and worked towards women’s rights in education and inheritance. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was instrumental in advocating for girls’ education and widow remarriage, which led to the enactment of the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first Vice President and second President of India, was a proponent of women’s education. In August 1848, Jyotirao Phule, and his wife, Savitribai opened the first girls’ school in Pune with nine girls from different social backgrounds, soon expanding to 18 schools for girls and children from Dalit families, between 1848 and 1852. Authors like Rabindranath Tagore, Vishnu Prabhakar, Premchand, Mulk Raj Anand, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and others included strong women characters in their novels which made people think. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher and politician, strongly advocated for gender equality. In the United States, Abraham Lincoln, though primarily known for abolishing slavery, believed in the fundamental equality of all individuals, supporting women’s rights movements. Theodore Roosevelt pushed for women’s right to vote. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela actively promoted women’s rights, recognizing that true freedom could not be achieved without gender equality. He appointed women to key government positions and worked to dismantle discriminatory practices. Ban Ki-moon, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, launched initiatives like HeForShe, encouraging men to participate in the fight for gender equality.

Studies show that economies with higher female workforce participation experience sustained economic growth and improved living standards. Political leaders across the world are redefining the norms to include women in all social functions, governance and business. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for women’s liberation is deeply rooted in the fact that India’s growth is incomplete without the progress of its women. One of our biggest opportunities is that India is a country with over 1.4 billion people, where women make up nearly half the population. Their full participation is key to economic prosperity. By 2036, India’s population is expected to reach 1.522 billion, with approximately 750 million women. When women have equal access to education, employment, and leadership roles, the GDP rises, poverty declines, and systems strengthen. According to an International Monetary Fund report, women’s workforce participation on par with men could boost India’s GDP by 27 per cent. If 50 percent of skilled women join the workforce, the growth rate could rise 1.5 per cent to 9 percent per year. One of the biggest challenges is India’s demographic divide. Unlike many Western nations, where the majority of people live in urban centers, India’s rural and semi-urban population remains dominant. Women in these areas, especially from lower castes and tribal backgrounds, have historically faced limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
The Modi government has aggressively pushed for grassroot-level leadership, ensuring that women from the most marginalized communities receive education and training to become local leaders, business owners, and policymakers. By educating these women and giving them a platform, the government is fostering self-reliance, ensuring that they do not remain dependent on male family members for their financial and personal decisions. PM Modi has been vocal about his focus, especially on raising the marginalized women’s position in India, attempting to transform silent contributors into informed decision-makers.

In July 2018, PM Modi, addressing over one crore women, emphasized youth skill development and women empowerment under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana. In Chhattisgarh, 122 Bihan Bazaar outlets across 22 districts sell over 200 Self-Help Group (SHG) products. Since 2014, 20 lakh SHGs have been formed, benefiting 2.25 crore families, adding an earning member to five crore rural households by 2018. Since 2014, women-centric policies have fostered Nari Shakti-led development as a pillar of New India. Initiatives like Self-Help Groups, Lakhpati Didi, and Drone Didi have boosted rural women’s economic empowerment. By December 2024, ₹9.74 lakh crore had been provided to women-led SHGs. India has 25,385 women welfare cooperatives and 1,44,396 dairy cooperatives employing rural women. As of March 2025, 90.87 lakh SHGs support 10.05 crore rural families. Under Lakhpati Didi, women in SHGs receive interest-free loans of ₹5 lakh. India’s development story today is spearheaded by grassroot entrepreneurs and leaders across gender, caste and locations. The remote locations have been especially monitored, ensuring that the huge potentials of the country are being increasingly realized. 
One of the most symbolic acknowledgments of women’s power has been their increasing representation in the Padma Awards, India’s highest civilian honors. Under the Modi government, a large number of grassroots women leaders, social workers, and change-makers—many from humble backgrounds—have been recognized for their contributions. This has sent a strong message to patriarchal societies in rural and remote areas, forcing men to acknowledge and respect women’s achievements. When a tribal woman, a rural teacher, or a female scientist receives a national honor, it compels the men in their communities to rethink traditional gender roles.

When the Prime Minister of a country actively champions women’s empowerment, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring men across all sections of society to adopt a similar outlook. India is a country of diverse cultures and practices, spread over a large rural and remote landscape, neck deep in superstitions and ill practices because of lack of exposure and infrastructure. PM Narendra Modi’s consistent emphasis on women’s dignity, inclusion, and success is targeting a national mindset shift, encouraging men to respect, support, and uplift women in their own families, workplaces, and communities. His speeches often highlight the contributions of women in various fields. With significant infrastructural developments and rewarding women achievers from remote communities, a strong message is constantly being passed to the men of the backward communities to build the life-frame together by sharing responsibilities instead of looking down at women as the weaker sections. PM Modi has frequently spoken about women achievers in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ program, he has personally met and honored women like Nari Shakti Puraskar awardees, grassroots leaders, and athletes. He acknowledged the critical contributions of the women scientists during his interactions with ISRO’s women engineers for Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 missions.
Events like Pariksha Pe Charcha found him motivating girls to excel in academics and overcome societal pressures. He also met young female innovators, such as those from Atal Tinkering Labs, praising their scientific achievements. In 2023, he met Purnima Devi Barman, an award-winning conservationist, praising her work in protecting the greater adjutant stork. He has also appreciated Tulsi Gowda, a Padma Shri awardee known as the “Encyclopedia of Forests,” for her lifelong dedication to afforestation. During global summits like COP26 and G20, he has highlighted the contributions of women in climate action. In 2023, he also interacted with schoolgirls at the G20 Summit’s “Mission LiFE” event, urging them to take leadership in climate action. His encouragement of female students, especially in STEM fields, has reinforced the importance of education in empowering young women to shape India’s future.

By consistently advocating for women’s progress, PM Modi has set an example for millions of men. It shows, in the way the society is opening up for women, fostering an environment of trust and sharing. Each successful woman inspires a thousand more to believe in their competence. Every supporting man inspires ten others to believe in social justice. The ratio is obviously not parallel, and hence it will take a long time for a holistic change. The good news is that things have started turning with the Prime Minister of the country taking the lead and openly discussing women’s success and the importance of such progress. The mountains that must be brought down and the dark prisons to be shattered have been identified. Business leaders ensuring equal pay, houses where a girl-child is not someone to be married off and fathers treating women as equals becoming the male role model for boys, a society that leaves stereotypes and discriminations behind – the path is long and demanding. A large number of men and women today are committed to fostering a healthy and competitive environment, targeting exponential growth in terms of learning and output. They are dedicated and are even fighting the mind-blocks of self and others, to protect, upheld and empower the collective Indian dream.

Title: Sensex plunges nearly 2 percent amid US tariff concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:15:51 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets plunged on Tuesday, the first trading session of the new financial year, as investors reacted to global trade tensions ahead of the US reciprocal tariff announcement on Wednesday.
The Sensex tumbled 1,390.41 points, or 1.80 percent, closing at 76,024.51, after swinging between an intra-day high of 77,487.05 and a low of 75,912.18. The Nifty 50 also slumped 353.65 points, or 1.50 percent, to settle at 23,165.70, with an intra-day range of 23,565.15 to 23,136.40.
The selloff was broad-based, with most Sensex stocks ending in the red, except Zomato, IndusInd Bank, and State Bank of India (SBI).
Top losers included HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, and Infosys, which declined up to 3.66 percent.
Midcap and smallcap stocks also faced pressure. Nifty Midcap100 lost 0.86 percent, while Nifty Smallcap100 dipped 0.70 percent.
The BSE Midcap index dropped 0.9 percent, whereas the Smallcap index edged up 0.2 percent.
Sectorally, IT, real estate, and consumer durables fell nearly 2 percent each, while media, oil & gas, and telecom stocks managed to stay positive.
Investor sentiment turned jittery, with India VIX—known as the fear index—surging 8.37 percent to 13.78, indicating increased market uncertainty.
“Amid heightened global volatility ahead of the anticipated US reciprocal tariff announcement tomorrow (US time), the domestic market witnessed a significant sell-off today. Investors are eagerly awaiting the specifics of these tariffs while also keeping a close eye on ongoing negotiations for a potential Indo-US trade agreement,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited.
The IT sector bore the brunt of the selloff due to its heavy exposure to the US market, while real estate stocks tumbled after Maharashtra raised ready reckoner rates, impacting property valuations.

Title: Women-Government partnership is communicating and chartering the Indian growth story for global audience
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 11:06:48 +0000
Content: Women possess innate leadership qualities like resilience, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, which enable them to manage households, finances, and communities even in the lowest economic strata. Their emotional intelligence helps build strong relationships, mediate conflicts, and foster collaboration, making them effective leaders in both grassroots and corporate settings. Women bring fresh perspectives, drive ethical decision-making, and enhance organizational productivity, with diverse leadership teams often proving to be more innovative and financially successful. Their success as entrepreneurs, particularly in microfinance and self-help groups, further demonstrates that leadership thrives in determination and vision, regardless of socio-economic background.
As per a McKinsey Global Institute report, India could achieve an 18 percent increase over business-as-usual GDP (USD 770 billion) by 2025 if the full potential of women in the workforce are unlocked. This would create a multiplier effect with time, and would ensure that India would be able to keep up our growth trajectory we have had since 1991, and would play a key role in ensuring that India would transform into a high income developed country by 2047, in the 100th year of our Independence.
Women in India have played a crucial role in grassroots leadership, contributing to social movements, local governance, and community development, despite facing systemic barriers. From leadership during the freedom struggle with figures like Rani Lakshmibai and Sarojini Naidu, to post-independence contributions through the Panchayati Raj system, women have significantly influenced political and social change. Women leaders like Chhavi Rajawat and Gaura Devi have brought innovation to rural governance, while organizations like SEWA have empowered women in the informal sector, driving social and economic progress. Women’s progress in their personal, social and professional lives have often been a journey of immense grit, through unthinkable adversities, because patriarchal mindsets do not treat women’s success with kindness and pride. Be it a domestic set-up or a boardroom, women’s achievements are often suppressed which is an extra hurdle that needs to be overcome for their voices to be heard. It is unfortunate though when the very leadership of a country would be reluctant to offer the desired push to break the mind-blocks.
Historically, the inclusion of women in the Padma awards was minimal, with their representation often hovering around 5-10% of the total recipients each year. However, after the Modi government came to power in 2014, there has been a significant increase in the recognition of women, reflecting broader societal changes towards gender equality and increased attention to women’s contributions across various fields. The numbers were, only 7 women were honored out of 80 recipients in 2013, 6 women among 88 awardees in 2012, 8 women out of 109 recipients in 2011 and 9 women out of 130 awardees in 2010. In 2018, out of 85 awardees, 14 were women, recognizing their contributions across various fields. In 2019, for the first time, the Sports Ministry recommended only women for the Padma Awards, highlighting a significant shift towards acknowledging women’s achievements in sports. The trend continued in 2021, with 29 women and one transgender individual among the 119 awardees. In 2022, 34 women were honored among 128 recipients, marking a consistent effort to recognize women’s contributions. The count of women were 19 out of 106 in 2023, 30 out of 132 in 2024 and 23 out of 139 in 2025. This upward trend reflects a broader societal acknowledgment of women’s roles and achievements in diverse sectors, promoting gender inclusivity and inspiring future generations.
Improving the women’s count of the recipients of Padma Awards was not a mere show of statistics. This was a genuine attempt to acknowledge the untold stories of resilience and leadership that exist in India’s heartlands and its hinterlands alike, by celebrating the paths that women were creating for themselves and their communities. Everyone has great women surrounding them, who give them the overview of life and livelihood. When a few among them are recognized at the highest levels of national awards, a society rises from its slumber and takes notice of things that it had earlier neglected.
In recent years, the Padma awards have felicitated truly deserving women with exemplary track records in the field of art, education, science, environment and more. The inclusion of successful women from grassroots, lower socio-economic, and geographically marginalized sectors in the Padma Awards list signals a powerful message to both the Indian population and the global community about India’s changing social and political landscape where women are breaking barriers to recreate history, and the government is supporting their vision to nurture an inclusive society, where everyone—regardless of their social, economic, or geographical status—has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s growth. The glorious partnership between women-force and the government marks India’s repositioning as a strong, forward-thinking and progressive nation for global observers.

Such a feat however, was not achieved overnight by random addition of women in the nomination lists. A lot of work has gone into the background to introduce infrastructural developments that help the visionaries create their success stories. For the government, there is a two-fold task. One, to facilitate the existing talents and two, to prepare the grounds for the next line of talents. The Indian government is working hard to erase the challenges that remain in the form of societal norms, patriarchal attitudes, and limited access to common resources, that hinder women’s growth. With increasing education, government initiatives, and awareness campaigns, more women are stepping into professional roles to gain financial independence.
Programs like the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and Mahila Samakhya have further strengthened women’s leadership by providing training and economic opportunities. Launched in 2015, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) campaign aimed to ensure the survival, protection, and education of girls, leading to increased school enrollment, a decline in female foeticide, improved sex ratios, and greater promotion of women’s rights. It has notably improved the child sex ratio, with states like Haryana and Rajasthan seeing significant changes, such as Haryana’s gender ratio rising from 850 girls per 1,000 boys in 2015 to 933 girls per 1,000 boys in 2021.
India has implemented several initiatives to ensure equal access to quality education for girls, including the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and programs like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), which have improved school enrollment, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has improved school infrastructure for girls, while the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes gender equity in education. Addressing sanitation issues, the Swachh Bharat Mission, launched in 2014, prioritized women-friendly toilets, with vending machines for sanitary pads and other facilities, improving female enrollment and safety. To empower women economically, initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and Stand Up India Scheme support women entrepreneurs, with the number of women-driven ideas increasing from 10% in 2014 to 30% in 2018. Rapid digitization in India, built on the India Stack and the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity, is driving financial inclusivity and ensuring that support schemes reach even the remotest areas.
The digital revolution has empowered women by facilitating access to technology and digital literacy, with programs like PMGDISHA training 60 million rural citizens and 67,000 women entrepreneurs running Common Service Centres (CSCs). The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is enhancing healthcare accessibility, while SANKALP Hubs for Women Empowerment operate across 742 districts. Additionally, initiatives like digital banking and Aadhaar-linked services are providing women with increased financial security.

Such reforms are actively dedicated for the rising presence of women in India’s national recognition platforms. They serve a subtle yet powerful response to external critics and media outlets, which have often painted India in a negative light. For years, international media have highlighted India’s challenges with gender violence, social exclusion, and the marginalization of women. Critics have used these issues to defame India’s progress, often portraying the country as a place where women are systematically oppressed. The increasing acknowledgment of grassroots women leaders in the Padma Awards narrative is a sophisticated counter-narrative. It challenges the simplistic portrayal of Indian women as victims of societal and cultural constraints and instead showcases them as resilient, capable, and integral contributors to national development. Each of these women are instrumental in writing the New India narrative as envisioned by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. India is evolving, and women are at the forefront of this transformation. The increasing recognition of women in prestigious national awards like the Padma Awards is an assertion of the women’s agency in shaping her own story of progress and empowerment, one that is defined by India and its people, not its critics.

Title: A concise exploration of India’s digital transformation journey, detailing key successes and learnings to guide international audiences
Publication Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:57:29 +0000
Content: In the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in digital transformation, revolutionizing the way its citizens interact with technology. From pioneering digital payments to building one of the world’s largest biometric identification systems, India’s digital economy has reshaped industries, empowered millions, and set new global benchmarks. As the country moves toward its ambitious goal of a $1 trillion digital economy by 2028, its journey offers valuable lessons for nations seeking to build inclusive, scalable, and sustainable digital ecosystems. India’s story is one of unprecedented growth, bold policies, and an unwavering focus on inclusivity, serving as a testament to the power of technology to drive socioeconomic change.
India’s digital economy has witnessed exponential growth, propelled by rapid internet penetration, affordable data, and widespread smartphone adoption. With over 950 million internet users and 650 million smartphone users, the nation has embraced connectivity at an unprecedented scale. This digital boom has reshaped the country’s economic landscape, creating new opportunities and industries while closing long-standing divides, particularly between urban and rural areas. Historically, rural India has been underserved by technology, but as internet access has expanded, these areas have become significant contributors to the digital revolution. The widespread availability of affordable internet and mobile data has brought new economic opportunities to rural India, where previously digital access was a luxury. By breaking down geographical barriers, digital transformation has helped millions gain access to services such as education, healthcare, and financial inclusion, areas where technology had once struggled to reach.
At the forefront of this transformation is India’s financial technology sector, which has redefined the way people transact, save, and invest. In 2016, the introduction of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) catalyzed a cashless revolution, enabling real-time digital payments via mobile apps and QR codes. UPI has allowed India to leapfrog traditional banking systems, moving directly to mobile and internet-based financial services. The success of UPI, an open, interoperable model designed for financial inclusion, offers valuable lessons on how digital payment platforms can drive large-scale adoption and economic integration. Unlike WeChat Pay in China, which operates within an all-encompassing ecosystem, UPI focuses on public access and empowerment. Today, India processes more than 10 billion UPI transactions every month, a staggering figure that highlights the scale of adoption and India’s growing influence in the global financial landscape. Countries like Singapore and the UAE have adopted similar models, recognizing UPI’s ability to facilitate efficient, inclusive, and scalable financial systems.
The success of UPI is not just a national achievement; it has become a global benchmark for digital payments. Countries around the world, particularly in emerging markets, have recognized UPI as a model for building a secure and inclusive digital payments ecosystem. The platform’s interoperability allows users to access and transfer funds across multiple banks and payment platforms seamlessly, making it an ideal tool for financial inclusion. Moreover, UPI’s focus on empowering individuals with accessible, low-cost financial services has proved critical in fostering economic integration, particularly among low-income and marginalized populations.
Alongside UPI, India’s digital transformation is also closely tied to the Aadhaar system, the world’s largest biometric identification program. Aadhaar has helped over 1.3 billion people access critical services such as banking, subsidies, and healthcare. Much like Estonia’s digital identity system, Aadhaar serves as a model for biometric-based identification, although with a focus on financial inclusion rather than e-governance. Estonia’s digital ID system is designed primarily to enable secure transactions and online governance, while Aadhaar’s primary focus is on ensuring that all citizens, especially the underserved, can access essential services and benefits. Aadhaar’s role in promoting financial inclusion is unparalleled—enabling Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) that have saved the Indian government billions of dollars by reducing fraud and inefficiencies in welfare distribution.
India’s emphasis on affordability and accessibility has been pivotal to the success of its digital revolution. The telecom sector has played a crucial role in this by offering low-cost mobile data, making internet access available to millions of people, including in rural areas. With mobile data prices as low as $0.09 per GB, India has witnessed one of the most significant surges in data consumption globally, with the average user consuming 14GB of data per month. The availability of affordable mobile data has democratized access to information and services, opening new possibilities in education, healthcare, and business. The expansion of 5G services will further accelerate this growth, bridging the digital divide between urban and rural India and enabling innovations that will transform every sector, from telemedicine to e-commerce.
The growth of e-commerce in India has been another testament to the power of digital transformation. Between 2017 and 2023, digital payments in India’s e-commerce sector grew by 50.8%, reflecting the rapid adoption of online shopping. Major global players like Amazon and Flipkart have capitalized on this trend, shaping consumer behavior and pushing the boundaries of online retail. However, it is India’s homegrown platforms, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), that are redefining the landscape of digital commerce. ONDC aims to empower small businesses by providing them with the infrastructure to participate in the digital economy, creating a more level playing field. In this way, ONDC helps small businesses compete with larger corporations, ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation reach all sectors of society.
India’s success in building an inclusive digital ecosystem has been underpinned by its government’s strategic policies and initiatives. Programs such as Digital India, launched in 2015, laid the foundation for a strong digital infrastructure, expanding broadband connectivity, promoting e-governance, and ensuring that public services are available online. Initiatives like Startup India and Make in India have further nurtured the country’s tech ecosystem, positioning India as the third-largest startup hub globally, with over 100 unicorns. These programs have helped India build a thriving digital economy that spans across sectors, including finance, healthcare, education, and agriculture. The Digital India initiative has played a crucial role in ensuring that the country’s vast population can participate in the digital economy, bridging the gap between urban and rural regions and empowering citizens to access vital services.
While India’s digital transformation has been a success story, it has not been without challenges. As the digital economy grows, so too does the need for strong data protection and cybersecurity measures. The digital landscape is continually evolving, and the challenge for policymakers will be to balance rapid technological advancements with ensuring user privacy and security. India is working to strengthen its regulatory frameworks to ensure that innovation continues while safeguarding citizens’ rights. India’s approach to data protection will be crucial in maintaining public trust and fostering further digital adoption.
Looking ahead, India’s digital economy is poised to continue its growth trajectory, with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) set to drive the next wave of innovation. AI alone is expected to contribute nearly $957 billion to India’s GDP by 2035, with transformative impacts on sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. Blockchain, cloud computing, and IoT are already being integrated across industries to improve efficiency, security, and data-driven decision-making. As these technologies evolve, they will further position India as a global leader in digital transformation.
India’s digital revolution has demonstrated that transformation is not just about technology—it’s about people. By prioritizing inclusivity, affordability, and accessibility, India has shown that a well-planned digital economy can empower millions, bridge socioeconomic gaps, and drive sustainable growth. The success of UPI, Aadhaar, and other key initiatives serves as a model for other nations looking to modernize their own digital economies. India’s focus on financial inclusion, accessibility, and open, interoperable platforms provides valuable insights for countries around the world seeking to replicate its success. India’s journey offers both inspiration and a roadmap, proving that with the right policies, partnerships, and people-centric approaches, a thriving digital future is within reach.

Content: The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has emerged as a powerful tool for women’s financial empowerment, with women accounting for 68% of the scheme’s 52 crore beneficiaries, according to a report by the State Bank of India’s (SBI) Economic Research Department released on Wednesday.
Over the last nine fiscals (FY16 to FY25), the per-woman PMMY loan disbursement grew at a CAGR of 13%, reaching Rs. 62,679, while incremental deposits per woman rose by 14% CAGR to Rs. 95,269, highlighting the scheme’s impact in fostering financial independence.
The report praised PMMY for bringing entrepreneurially underrepresented social groups into the financial mainstream. Notably, nearly 50% of PMMY accounts belong to SC/ST and OBC categories, with 11% from minority groups.
Among states, Bihar leads in the number of women PMMY entrepreneurs (4.2 crore), followed by Tamil Nadu (4.0 crore) and West Bengal (3.7 crore). Meanwhile, Maharashtra has the highest share of women account holders (79%), followed by Jharkhand (75%) and West Bengal (73%).
The average loan ticket size has seen significant growth, nearly tripling from Rs. 38,000 in FY16 to Rs. 1.02 lakh in FY25. Since its inception, PMMY has sanctioned 52.07 crore loans worth Rs. 33.19 lakh crore (as of February 28).
PMMY, launched under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA), facilitates collateral-free loans up to Rs. 20 lakh through Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs).
The loan category mix has also evolved, with the share of Shishu loans (smallest loan category) dropping from 93% in FY16 to 51.7% in FY25, while Kishor loans (mid-range category) grew from 5.9% to 44.7%. This shift indicates that many Shishu borrowers have expanded their businesses and moved to higher loan brackets, reflecting growth in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
The SBI report underscores PMMY’s transformative role in fostering entrepreneurship and economic inclusion among women and marginalized communities, strengthening their financial standing and business potential.

Title: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju says Waqf Amendment Bill is for the benefit of the country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 07:08:42 +0000
Content: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday said that the Waqf Amendment Bill, set to be introduced in the Lok Sabha, serves the nation’s best interests. Dismissing opposition to the bill as politically motivated, Rijiju emphasized that any objections should be rooted in logic and assured that the government is prepared to address all concerns.
Speaking to the media, Rijiju highlighted the significance of the bill, calling it a “historic day” and underscoring its importance not only for Muslims but for the entire nation. “This bill is being introduced in the interest of the country, and crores of Muslims, along with the whole country, will support it,” he said. He also addressed the political opposition, asserting that those opposing the bill were doing so out of political motives. “If someone opposes, they should oppose on the basis of logic, and we will also answer them,” Rijiju added.
The Union Minister noted that the bill was the result of extensive thought and preparation, indicating that it had been carefully considered before its introduction.
In a show of support for the bill, Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) President Jayant Chaudhary expressed his backing, stating, “We are with the NDA. We’ve issued a whip.” Similarly, Union Minister George Kurian voiced his approval, stating that all communities, including poor Muslims and the middle class, supported the amendment. Kurian further argued that the opposition to the bill was primarily coming from large landowners. “Only big landlords are opposing this Bill,” he said, stressing that the bill was transparent and directly linked to land and property.
Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Minister OP Rajbhar criticized opposition parties, accusing them of engaging in “vote politics.” He specifically targeted the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and Congress, alleging that their supporters were opposing the bill for political gains. Rajbhar also pointed out that the Waqf Board rules had been amended three times previously, with any shortcomings addressed to ensure that the benefits reached those under the Waqf Board’s jurisdiction. “I would like to ask those who are opposing to tell me the name of one poor person who has benefited from Waqf Board land,” he said. Rajbhar reiterated that the government’s goal was to ensure the benefit of Waqf land for the underprivileged, accusing the opposition of opposing the bill solely for votes.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is set to be tabled in Parliament today, and both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have issued whips to ensure the presence of their MPs in the House. With no signs of bipartisan consensus between the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition INDIA bloc, the outcome of the bill’s introduction is expected to be determined by the majority numbers present in the Lok Sabha.

Title: NHAI hikes toll charges on highways and expressways across country
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:56:13 +0000
Content: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has raised toll charges for motorists driving through highways and expressways across the country by an average of 4 to 5 per cent as part of the annual exercise of factoring in inflation costs.
The adjustment is part of NHAI’s annual review, which aligns toll rates with inflation based on the wholesale price index, and the additional revenue will support highway upkeep and expansion projects, a senior official said.
According to the NHAI notification, the one-way toll on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for cars and jeeps travelling from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut will rise from Rs 165 to Rs 170, while the commute from Ghaziabad to Meerut will increase from Rs 70 to Rs 75.
Light commercial vehicles and buses on this route will have to shell out Rs 275 per trip, while trucks will be charged Rs 580. At the Chhijarsi toll plaza on NH-9, tolls for cars will go up from Rs 170 to Rs 175. Light commercial vehicles will pay Rs 280, while buses and trucks will have to cough up Rs 590.
Motorists travelling on highways running through Lucknow, including those linking the state capital to Kanpur, Ayodhya, Raebareli, and Barabanki, will have to pay an additional Rs 5 to 10 per trip for light vehicles, while heavy vehicles will have to shell out an extra Rs 20 to 25.
The monthly pass for cars will go up from Rs 930 to Rs 950, while for cabs the amount will increase from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
On the Delhi-Jaipur Highway, at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, tolls for private cars and jeeps will stay the same, but larger vehicles will see an increase of Rs 5 per trip. The monthly pass for cars will rise from Rs 930 to Rs 950, and for commercial cars and jeeps, it will go from Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,255. Single-trip tolls for light motor vehicles and minibuses will increase from Rs 120 to Rs 125.
There are around 855 plazas on India’s national highway network, of which 675 are government-funded, while another 180 or so are managed by private operators.

Title: Ghibli effect: ChatGPT usage hits record after rollout of viral feature
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:34:36 +0000
Content: The frenzy to create Ghibli-style AI art using ChatGPT’s image-generation tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI’s chatbot last week, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature’s usage.
The viral trend saw users from across the globe flood social media with images based on the hand-drawn style of the famed Japanese animation outfit, Studio Ghibli, founded by renowned director Hayao Miyazaki and known for movies such as “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro”.
Average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time this year, according to data from market research firm Similarweb.
“We added one million users in the last hour,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an X post on Monday, comparing it with the addition of one million users in five days following ChatGPT’s red-hot launch more than two years ago.
Active users, in-app subscription revenue and app downloads reached an all-time high last week, according to SensorTower data, after the AI company launched updates to its GPT-4o model, enabling advanced image generation capabilities.
Global app downloads and weekly active users on the ChatGPT app grew 11% and 5%, respectively, from the prior week, while in-app purchase revenue increased 6%, the market intelligence firm said.
However, the chatbot has been hit with a series of glitches and low-scale outages over the past week as it deals with a spike in traffic due to the popularity of its image-generating tool.
“We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” the OpenAI co-founder said on Tuesday.

LEGAL UNCERTAINTY
The extensive use of the AI tool for the Ghibli effect has also led to questions about potential copyright violations.
“The legal landscape of AI-generated images mimicking Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style is an uncertain terrain. Copyright law has generally protected only specific expressions rather than artistic styles themselves,” said Evan Brown, partner at law firm Neal & McDevitt.
OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data used to train its AI models and the legality surrounding its latest feature.
Studio Ghibli co-founder Miyazaki’s comments from 2016 on AI-generated images resurfaced after the trend blew up last week.
“I am utterly disgusted,” Miyazaki had said after being shown an early render of an AI-generated.
“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”

Title: Myanmar junta should expand access for earthquake rescuers, aid and rights groups say as death toll nears 3,000
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 06:31:32 +0000
Content: Myanmar’s ruling junta should free up movement by international aid workers to help survivors of a devastating earthquake, even in areas controlled by groups battling it, aid and human rights groups said, as the death toll looks set to cross 3,000.
The military has struggled to run Myanmar since overthrowing the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, reducing to tatters the economy and basic services including healthcare.
With thousands injured and infrastructure crippled following Friday’s quake of magnitude 7.7, regional authorities were struggling to cope and desperately needed support, the groups said.
“The situation remains critical, with disrupted communications and road access hampering response efforts, particularly in Sagaing,” the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said, referring to one hard-hit area.
More than 28 million people live in the six regions affected by the quake, it added in a statement, saying it had $12 million in emergency funding for food, shelter, water, sanitation, mental health support, and other services.
China’s official Xinhua news agency said the death toll rose to 2,886 on Wednesday, with 4,639 injured, citing the junta.
The rural parts of hard-hit Sagaing were mostly under the control of armed resistance groups fighting the military government, the International Crisis Group said.
“They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict,” it added in a statement.
Even before the quake, the ICG said, information had been hard to gather from such areas, because of a junta blackout of internet and mobile phone networks as part of the conflict. The military has dismissed as misinformation accusations that it committed widespread atrocities as it fought against a multi-pronged rebellion that followed the coup.
UNFETTERED ACCESS
Human Rights Watch urged the junta to allow unfettered access for humanitarian aid and lift curbs impeding aid agencies, saying donors should channel aid through independent groups rather than only junta authorities.
“Myanmar’s junta cannot be trusted to respond to a disaster of this scale,” Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report.
“Concerned governments and international agencies need to press the junta to allow full and immediate access to survivors, wherever they are.”
Australia announced a further A$6.5 million ($4.1 million) in humanitarian support for Myanmar, supplied “through thoroughly vetted international and local partners.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, “We take proactive steps to ensure our assistance does not legitimise the military regime in Myanmar.”
The military council has rejected requests from international journalists to cover the quake devastation, citing the lack of water, electricity, and hotels.
In neighbouring Thailand, the death toll from the quake rose to 22 on Wednesday, with hundreds of buildings damaged.
Rescuers scoured for survivors in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, where the death toll is 15, with 72 missing.
The government is investigating the collapse and initial tests showed some steel samples from the site were substandard.

Title: Soccer: Wolves ease relegation worries with 1-0 win over West Ham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:48:08 +0000
Content: Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal of the game as they beat visitors West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday to make it two wins in a row and put some more daylight between them and the Premier League relegation places.
The win leaves Wolves in 17th spot on 29 points, 12 ahead of Ipswich Town in 18th and 19th-placed Leicester City, who are both in action on Wednesday against Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively. West Ham are 16th on 34 points.
The visitors almost took an early lead when Jarrod Bowen made his way down the right before putting in a low cross in the 13th minute, but the ball went just behind striker Evan Ferguson and he couldn’t get a clean shot away.
Wolves defender Toti Gomes also went close to breaking the deadlock three minutes later as he met a near-post free kick with a header that flashed towards goal and forced a great save from Alphonse Areola.
Strand Larsen finally broke the deadlock in the 21st minute, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and drilling a deflected effort past Areola for his 10th goal of the season, and six minutes later Marshall Munetsi should have made it two, but his shot came crashing back off the crossbar.
Hammers manager Graham Potter sent on striker Niclas Fuellkrug after the break, and though he gave a much-needed focal point to the visitors’ attack, the game descended into a bad-tempered affair punctuated by pushing, shoving and arguing for much of the second half.
The Hammers went on to dominate but they failed to create good goal-scoring chances, and the closest they came to an equaliser were a header off the crossbar by Fuellkrug and a late shot that Tomas Soucek fired just wide.
Strand Larsen, who had another good effort fly just wide in the second half, said he was delighted to reach double figures for the season, despite needing the help of a deflection to get on the scoresheet.
“I don’t care, the ball went in. It doesn’t matter how. I’m happy anyway,” he told Sky Sports.
“10 is always the goal for a striker, and we have eight games to go. People have been doubting me a bit so I think it’s nice to show them. Today I was a bit lucky, but that’s how it is,” he added.

Title: Soccer: Saka seals comeback with goal as Arsenal beat Fulham
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:32:48 +0000
Content: Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 in the Premier League on Tuesday thanks to another goal from stand-in striker Mikel Merino while Bukayo Saka struck a few minutes into his return from nearly four months out with injury.
Arsenal went ahead eight minutes before halftime when a cute ball from Jurrien Timber put Ethan Nwaneri round the back of the Fulham defence. He found Merino whose shot deflected beyond the reach of goalkeeper Bernd Leno into the corner.
The second half was a blizzard of chances for both sides.
Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard blazed over from a Gabriel Martinelli cross. Fulham then nearly equalised when Raul Jimenez had a breakaway chance well saved by goalkeeper David Raya with Leno doing the same at the other end from Timber.
Saka’s return brought the biggest roar from the Arsenal supporters when the 23-year-old nodded in a flicked-on cross in the 73rd minute not long after coming on.
Arsenal’s manager Mikel Arteta described it as “a beautiful moment” that showed how much “our people love, respect, and admire Bukayo.”
“It’s not a surprise to any of us… It lifted the stadium, the energy. It’s great to have him back.”
It wasn’t a perfect evening for the home side though. Rodrigo Muniz got a late consolation goal for Fulham, while Arsenal defenders Gabriel and Timber both went off with injuries, the former after just 15 minutes.
Arteta told reporters that both players would be assessed on Wednesday to see the extent of their problems.
“Gabby felt something in his hamstring, we don’t know how big that is,” Arteta said. “Jurrien was struggling very early in the game, he managed to continue but at some point, he couldn’t.”
Arsenal’s victory means they trail league leaders Liverpool by nine points with eight games remaining. Arne Slot’s side could widen the gap again when they play local rivals Everton on Wednesday.
Arsenal also play Everton in the Premier League on Saturday before hosting Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final next week.
Fulham manager Marco Silva said his team had not been aggressive enough to win the game and push towards a European competition qualification place, although they did have a string of chances in the second half.
“What decided the game was that we conceded two soft goals,” Silva said.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches ‘NITI NCAER states Economic Forum’ portal to strengthen fiscal data access
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 05:03:36 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday unveiled the “NITI NCAER States Economic Forum” portal in New Delhi. Developed by NITI Aayog in collaboration with the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), the portal serves as a comprehensive repository of State finances, providing data on social, economic, and fiscal parameters from 1990-91 to 2022-23, according to NITI Aayog.
Speaking at the launch event, Sitharaman highlighted the portal’s role in ensuring authentic and accessible financial data for states. She stated that the platform would enable states to make informed policy interventions, improve revenue management, and learn from peer experiences. She also stressed the need for balance in public finances, ensuring revenue generation without imposing excessive burdens on citizens.
Dr. Poonam Gupta, Director General of NCAER, underscored the significance of the portal in understanding the diverse fiscal trajectories of states. She noted that a centralized platform would allow policymakers to compare financial strategies and make well-informed decisions.
NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam described the initiative as a valuable public knowledge resource, promoting fiscal awareness and learning across states. He further termed the forum a “permanent asset for the nation”, aiding in data-driven economic policymaking.
Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Suman K Bery, emphasized that the forum represents a significant step toward data-driven research, particularly in public finance management.

Title: As Iran tensions build, US military moves warplanes to reinforce Middle East
Publication Date: Wed, 02 Apr 2025 04:58:57 +0000
Content: U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reinforced U.S. military capability in the Middle East with more warplanes, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, amid a more than two-week-old U.S. bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran.
The Pentagon’s brief statement did not specify which aircraft were being deployed or where precisely they were sent.
However, as many as six B-2 bombers have relocated in the past week or so to a U.S.-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, according to U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Experts say that puts the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest U.S. bombs and nuclear weapons, in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.
“Should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to defend our people,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.
The U.S. military’s Strategic Command has declined to say how many B-2s have reached Diego Garcia and noted that it does not comment on exercises or operations involving the B-2.
There is already considerable firepower in the Middle East and the U.S. military will soon have two aircraft carriers in the region.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran on Sunday with bombing and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.
While B-2 bombers have been employed to strike buried Houthi targets in Yemen, most experts say use of the stealthy bomber is overkill there and the targets aren’t buried so deeply.
However, the B-2 is equipped to carry America’s most potent bomb — the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator. That is the weapon that experts say could be used to strike Iran’s nuclear program.
There are only 20 B-2 bombers in the Air Force’s inventory so they are usually used sparingly.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the U.S. would receive a strong blow if Trump followed through with his threats.
Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Commander Amirali Hajizadeh threatened U.S. forces in the Middle East, noting American bases in the Middle East and adding: “They are in a glass house and should not throw stones.”
One official told Reuters that the U.S. military was also moving some air defense capabilities from Asia to the Middle East.
In his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions.
Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal’s limits on uranium enrichment.
Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
