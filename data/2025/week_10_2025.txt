Title: When National Platforms like Padma Awards are democratized by the govt and freed from the lobby system
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 13:16:57 +0000
Content: The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 with the vision of recognizing and honoring exceptional contributions by individuals in various fields of public service and excellence. The vision was to celebrate merit, selfless service, and outstanding achievements in disciplines such as art, literature, science, education, sports, medicine, social work, public affairs, and trade & industry, aiming to acknowledge excellence and dedication to public service without distinction of race, occupation, or sex. The key principles behind the awards is promoting National Pride – instil a sense of inspiration and patriotism, encouraging individuals to contribute to the nation’s growth and progress. The Padma Awards were divided into three categories – Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (for distinguished service of high order) and Padma Shri (for distinguished service in any field).
For a long period of time however, the Padma Awards were being primarily received by rich, famous, and established professionals, particularly those from prominent fields like politics, business, and entertainment. This trend led to perceptions of favoritism, since the awards were mostly bagged by high-profile individuals who were well-connected politically and socially. The process was criticized for being elitist, with a lack of diversity in the recipients’ backgrounds and contributions, favoring the privileged gentry over grassroots workers, which created a sense of exclusion for unsung heroes of the country. As of February 2016, data reveals a 30% surge in Padma Shri awards during election years, highlighting a notable trend in their distribution. Just seven states accounted for a staggering 63% of all Padma Shri recipients over the past 16 years, indicating a concentration of honors in select regions. Delhi & Maharashtra alone account for a third of all the Padma Shri awards while Bihar barely had 20 winners, less than 2% of all the awards.
Such exclusion leads to significant implications on the morale and faith of the common citizens, especially the marginalized sections of society. We must understand that every individual is a product of his or her opportunities, hard work is often not enough. For remotely placed individuals, the opportunities and exposure is limited. Despite achieving extraordinary milestones in their fields, they often face systemic barriers like lack of visibility and social exclusion. Prioritizing high-profile personalities over grassroots changemakers reinforce the notion that success and recognition are reserved for those with privilege, network, or celebrity status, rather than for genuine contribution or excellence.
Especially for marginalized communities, this reinforced a cycle of invisibility where their battles, often against overwhelming odds, went unnoticed. It hindered their belief in the possibility of upward mobility, fostering feelings of unfairness and disenchantment with a system that seemed to prioritize the elite. The lack of recognition not only stifled their confidence but also demotivated others in their communities, as it appeared that merit alone was insufficient for acknowledgment. Not that they stopped fighting, but there was certainly a sense of unbelonging. They perceived the government and the well-placed society as enemies who would use, and if required exploit them, but never recognise them. This created a deep divide between the privileged and the underrepresented, challenging the very idea of meritocracy and fair valuation for human resources in a diverse society like India.
Nominations for Padma awards this year 28 times more than 2014, said PM Narendra Modi in February 2025. The Modi government, since 2014, has worked towards democratizing the Padma Awards, making them more inclusive and reflective of the diverse contributions across Indian society. One of the most notable changes was the broadening of the criteria and focus to include individuals from marginalized communities, rural backgrounds, and fields that had often been overlooked in the past. The government emphasized recognizing grassroots changemakers, unsung heroes, and people making significant impacts at the local and regional levels, regardless of their fame or social standing. The nomination process was also made more transparent, with a greater push to involve citizens and organizations in suggesting potential awardees.
In 2016, the Modi government transformed the Padma Awards nomination process by opening it to the general public. For the first time, any Indian citizen could nominate deserving individuals online, ensuring that merit and genuine contributions take precedence over influence or connections. In 2025, over 50,000 nominations were received annually, a increase over 20 times from the 2,200 nominations in 2014. The nominations were meticulously reviewed by a high-level committee before being forwarded to the Prime Minister and President for approval. This initiative sought to eliminate the culture of cronyism, influence, and lobbying. The introduction of an online application portal and an electronic management system leveraged technology to ensure a more transparent and efficient nomination process. It helped shift the focus from established elites to ordinary individuals who were often doing incredible work but lacked the visibility or influence to be recognized through traditional channels. The awards began to reflect diverse sectors, including social work, environmental conservation, innovation in rural areas, and restoration of indigenous arts and culture.
By emphasizing merit over status, the Modi government transformed the Padma Awards into a people’s award, one that celebrates real, tangible contributions that reflect the true spirit of India’s diversity. This move restored faith in the awards’ ability to recognize those who, despite challenges, were working tirelessly for the nation’s progress. In 2019, the government highlighted a “historic selection” of 12 farmers from across 9 states, 14 doctors from 11 states, and 28 artists and social workers across the country. It was an emotional moment for the audience to celebrate 106-year-old environmentalist Saalumarada Thimmakka, affectionately known as the “Mother of Trees”, whose lifelong dedication to afforestation has left an indelible mark on India’s green landscape. Among the 2025 awardees, visionaries like L. Hangthing from Nagaland, also called the “Fruit Man” for transforming fruit cultivation and Bhim Singh Bhavesh from Bihar’s Buxar district revered as the guardian of the Musahar community, stand as shining examples of grassroots changemakers.
The exclusion of marginalized individuals and grassroots contributors from receiving Padma Awards before 2014 directly undermined the very vision of the awards, which was to recognize exceptional contributions across all walks of life. It was important to break this pattern, not only to celebrate the talents without any influential backgrounds but also to inject a spirit of equality among various socio-economic classes. India is a country where the caste system is very deep rooted. Many superstitions and age-old traditions alienate individuals. It was a treat to experience Tulasi Gowda in 2021, hailing from the Hakkali tribe of Karnataka, often called the ‘encyclopedia of the forest’ for planting more than 30,000 saplings, walk barefoot to receive the Padma awards, wearing beads and a saree without a blouse as per the custom of her community and thanking in her local language, on the same platform with say, P. V. Sindhu who was an English speaking woman, more formally dressed as per general perceptions.
The 2025 list found Gokul Chandra Das, a Dhak player from West Bengal who had overcome severe caste-related oppressions to popularize his art form and Bhajan singer Batool Begum from Rajasthan, who promotes Sadbhavana by singing devotional bhajans despite being from a Muslim community.
With such stories defeating the dark caves and shining bright in the sun, I am optimistic that the image make-over of the Padma awards would strongly and sensitively contribute in liberating the people from caste discriminations in the days to come. When the river has started flowing, maybe it will touch every valley. It remains a hope to see many other important national forums, strictly supervised by a selected few gatekeepers, bringing their walls down and opening themselves to create opportunities and recognitions for the deserving, instead of focusing on a selected few beneficiary groups. Because more people mean more dreams, more attempts to make it to the top, more aspirants, more achievers and more empowered societies inspiring each other.

Title: Technological Revolution of India: Overview of Direct Benefit Transfers
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 12:54:13 +0000
Content: The political economy of India, since its independence, can be understood as a struggle to break free from constraints inherited from centuries of foreign rule while aspiring to rise as a nation of global importance. Immediately afterward, the government of our nation emphasized centralized planning, coupled with the public provisioning of essential goods and services. However, even after several decades of this approach, the situation at the ground level did not improve as expected . The situation was marred with cases where citizens were unable to access the welfare transfers meant for them. The section of the population that was able to receive the benefits did not receive them in a timely manner. Furthermore, the entire process was a financial nightmare due to fund leakages at various levels of government. This problem was highlighted by Mr. Rajiv Gandhi during his tenure as Prime Minister in his famous remark: For every rupee spent by the government on welfare, only 15 paise is received by the intended beneficiaries .
The root cause of this issue lay in India’s limited state capacity and the lack of accountability among government officials responsible for the smooth functioning of these welfare programs . However, despite numerous efforts over the years to address these issues, no drastic improvement was observed. A breakthrough was achieved in 2014 during the initial months of the new government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. The solution involved a novel adoption of digital technologies which was called the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mission.
Rethinking Public Service Delivery in India
The inception of DBT can be traced back to 2013 as a pilot project, which spanned only 43 districts of the country and covered only 24 Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored (CSS) schemes. However, there were several challenges that were identified during the initial phase and the biggest among them was the low level of financial inclusion, especially in rural areas. This limited the reach of DBT in our country. In recognition of the problem at hand, the newly elected Prime Minister Modi launched the world’s biggest financial inclusion program in the form of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY).
PMJDY was a game changer right from its launch with more than 1.8 crore accounts being opened for people who were previously out of the formal banking system. This achievement was recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest number of bank accounts opened in a week. The progress showed no sign of stopping with more than 17 crore people benefited in the first year and according to the latest data over 54 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened. The biggest benefit of this scheme has been reaped by people residing in the rural and semi-urban areas with it accounting for more than 2/3 of the total bank accounts opened.
The success of PMJDY paved the way for the creation of the world’s biggest targeted payments framework. Commonly referred to as the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) Trinity, the platform leveraged the near universal adoption of Aadhar cards to uniquely identify beneficiaries, while Jan Dhan accounts enabled with mobile banking services ensured that government transfers reached the people directly, without any delay and with no financial leakages. In the last ten years, DBT enabled by JAM has transformed the landscape of public service delivery in India by ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency.
Transformational Impact
The impact of DBT has been realised since its inception. According to the official data , the total number of schemes using the DBT framework has increased by more than 11 times, from 28 schemes in 2013-14 to 323 schemes in 2024-25. The total funds transferred has also increased by nearly 1000 times, from around 7400 crores in 2013-14 to nearly 7 lakh crores in 2023-24. This has been estimated to have cumulatively saved the government exchequer around 3.5 lakh crores . A comprehensive analysis of the benefits of DBT can be understood in the following manner –
Reduction of Ghost Beneficiaries
In the previous regime, due to a complex chain of intermediaries, the financial resources released by the government would leak to people who were not the intended beneficiaries. However, DBT mission was able to solve this problem by eliminating fake or duplicate beneficiaries using data from Aadhar card as a unique identifier. Further, with the rise in financial inclusion levels, DBT is able to transfer benefits directly to the intended recipient by eliminating the intermediaries. Prominent success stories include schemes like PAHAL, MGNREGS, and PDS that have cumulatively eliminated more than 9.2 crore fake or duplicate beneficiaries.
Ensuring timely transfers of benefits
Another problem with public service delivery before DBT was the untimely transfer of benefits. This was prominent in various scholarships schemes aimed at promoting education and pension schemes operated under the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP). By leveraging the benefits of digital technologies, DBT has been able to ensure that funds are transferred automatically without any delay. This has also brought dignity to the beneficiaries as they don’t have to make rounds to government offices just to ensure a timely disbursal of their entitlements.
Rethinking welfare
The increased transparency and accountability brought in by DBT has also allowed the government to design programmes aimed at widening the understanding of welfare measures. Few examples include schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) which have been able to improve sanitation while also producing multiple secondary benefits like reduction in infant and early-age mortality rate and reduction in crimes against women . Additionally, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) has completely revamped public health insurance by increasing the coverage and removing exclusion clauses which were present in its predecessor. Another example has been the Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) which has been designed to bring dignity to farmers by providing an annual cash transfer of 6000 rupees which can be utilised as per the discretion of the beneficiary reducing the need for money borrowing from informal sources.
Aside from the impact mentioned above, DBT has also proven revolutionary during the COVID-19 crisis by ensuring continuity in government transfers. On top of this, DBT also became the perfect mechanism for delivering the stimulus package (Pradhan Mantri – Garib Kalyan Yojna) announced by the government in the wake of the pandemic. This feat would have been impossible in the era of public service delivery before DBT. 
Leveraging DBT for a More Inclusive Future
DBT mission is one of the biggest success stories in transforming public service delivery in our country. International organisations like the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the Asian Development Bank have lauded the policy instrument in its effort toward increasing the reach of government welfare measures while also curbing corruption and financial leakages. Going forward, the gains in efficiency brought in by DBT possess the ability to allow policy makers to bring more exiting schemes to utilise the DBT framework, while also providing them freedom to innovate with radical new policies aimed at addressing a more holistic concept of well-being. Working on this front will be critical for ensuring that India stays on its path of becoming a developed nation by 2047.

Title: Cholera outbreak kills over 200 people in Angola
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:15:20 +0000
Content: The number of people killed in the latest cholera outbreak in Angola has risen to 201, the country’s Health Ministry has announced.
A total of 5,574 people have been infected since early January, the ministry said.
Cholera cases have been reported in 13 of Angola’s 21 provinces. The outbreak originated in the capital province of Luanda, which has recorded the highest number of cases, followed by the neighbouring provinces of Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, Xinhua news agency reported.
Recently, the province of Cunene registered its first case, putting health services on alert.
According to the WHO, Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibro cholerae. It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases.
Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics.
Cholera can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea, which can be fatal within hours if untreated. Most people infected with Vibro cholerae do not develop symptoms but can spread the bacteria through their faeces for 1–10 days. Symptoms appear 12 hours to 5 days after infection.
Cholera has been known for many centuries. The first pandemic, or global epidemic, was recorded in the 19th century. Since then, six pandemics have killed millions of people worldwide. The current (seventh) pandemic started in South Asia in 1961 and continues to affect populations globally.

Title: India’s growth becoming more balanced as private consumption’s share in GDP rises
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:09:52 +0000
Content: India’s growth is becoming more balanced as private consumption’s share in GDP rose in fiscal 2025, according to a Crisil report.
The mild revision of 10 basis points (bps) in the second advanced estimate to 6.5 per cent takes the expected real GDP growth this fiscal closer to the average of 6.6 per cent seen in the decade pre-pandemic.
“And this is over a sharp upward revision of 100 bps in the previous year’s growth to 9.2 per cent,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, Crisil.
“We expect the GDP growth at 6.5 per cent next fiscal, supported by normal monsoons, lower food inflation and rate cuts of 75-100 basis points in the current cycle that began earlier this month,” he mentioned.
As anticipated, public and household investments were the faster-growing investment components in fiscal 2024.
The financial flexibility and low leverage that corporates enjoy are yet to translate into healthy investments.
The ongoing tariff wars and fear of dumping from China keep the corporate sector cautious on investments.
“The complexity of risks from tariff actions – already initiated and likely to be followed by more such measures in the coming months – is evolving and creates a downside bias to our forecasts,” said Joshi.
The GDP growth accelerated to 6.2 per cent in the third quarter (October-December) of 2024-25, up from a revised figure of 5.6 per cent in the second quarter of the financial year.
The growth rate for the financial year 2024-25 is now estimated at 6.5 per cent while the economic growth rate for 2023-24 has been revised to a 12-year high of 8.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit for the first 10 months of the current financial year (April-January) stood at Rs 11.70 lakh crore or 74.5 per cent of annual estimates.

Title: FAA OKs SpaceX Starship Flight 8 launch after Flight 7 mishap
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 09:29:09 +0000
Content: The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it cleared the SpaceX Starship vehicle to return to flight operations while an investigation into the January 16 Starship Flight 7 mishap remains open.
The FAA said it issued a license authorizing the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 launch for the combined Starship/Super Heavy vehicle from Boca Chica, Texas after the company completed a required safety review overseen by the agency.
The mission also includes a return to the launch site of the Super Heavy booster rocket for a catch attempt by the launch tower, and a water landing of the Starship vehicle in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.
SpaceX said it is preparing to launch as soon as Monday and said “several hardware and operational changes have been made to increase reliability of the upper stage.”
The FAA said SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the new suborbital test flight.
SpaceX’s Starship 7 rocket broke up minutes after launching, sending debris streaking over the northern Caribbean and forcing airlines to divert dozens of flights.
The upcoming flight “will fly the same suborbital trajectory as previous missions and will target objectives not reached on the previous test,” SpaceX said. It said Starship’s forward flaps “have been upgraded to significantly reduce their exposure to reentry heating while simplifying the underlying mechanisms and protective tiling.”
In September, the FAA proposed a $633,000 fine against SpaceX for failing to follow license requirements in 2023 before two launches.
SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, who is leading President Donald Trump’s effort to reform the U.S. government, last year called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker, who opted to step down when Trump took office.

Title: Rubio signs declaration to expedite delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 07:16:48 +0000
Content: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.
The Trump administration, which took office on January 20, has approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to Israel, Rubio said in a statement, adding that it “will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America’s long-standing commitment to Israel’s security, including means to counter security threats.”
Rubio said he had used emergency authority to expedite the delivery of military assistance to Israel to its Middle East ally, now in a fragile ceasefire with Hamas militants in their war in Gaza.
The Pentagon said on Friday that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel.
The administration notified Congress of those prospective weapons sales on an emergency basis, sidestepping a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress.
Friday’s announcements marked the second time in recent weeks that President Donald Trump’s administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also used emergency authority to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review.
On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order requiring it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has also eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid.
The January 19 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.
Hours after the first phase of the agreed ceasefire was set to expire, Israel said early on Sunday it would adopt a proposal by Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods.
Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end of the war.

Title: Five Powerful Lessons from India’s Electrification Success for ‘Mission 300’
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 06:00:18 +0000
Content: Powering 300 million lives across Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 isn’t just ambitious—it’s a game-changing mission that can redefine the region’s future. Mission 300, an initiative led by the World Bank and the African Development Bank, in collaboration with key partners, aims to bridge one of the world’s most pressing energy gaps. But can such a massive feat be achieved within just a few years?
The answer may lie in India’s electrification journey—a transformation so rapid and far-reaching that it rewrote the global playbook on energy access.
In 2014, only 75.8% of India’s population had electricity, trailing behind the global average of 83.2%. A combination of lack of awareness, high connection costs, infrastructure gaps, and logistical challenges left millions in the dark. Yet, in less than a decade, India pulled off what seemed impossible—achieving 100% electrification by 2021, surpassing the global average of 90.4%.
The real turning point came between 2017 and 2019, when India launched an electrification drive unlike anything seen before. In just 18 months, over 26 million households were connected to electricity—an effort so ambitious and efficient that it stands as one of the fastest electrification drives in history.
This wasn’t just a policy shift; it was a mission-driven movement, fueled by strong political leadership, financial innovation, and last-mile execution. While many countries have struggled with electrification for decades, India has shown that with the right intent and approach, progress can be achieved at an unprecedented pace.

Access at: https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity
So, what can Mission 300 learn from India’s experience? A lot. By adopting proven strategies, Mission 300 can fast-track electrification across Sub-Saharan Africa—achieving its goal of reaching 300 million people by 2030 in a way that is efficient, scalable, and sustainable.
Key Strategies and Lessons for Mission 300
1. Strong leadership as the driving force
India’s electrification success was not just about policy—it was about unwavering leadership from the top. Electricity access was treated as a national mission, not just an infrastructure project, ensuring that every stakeholder—from central to local governments—was fully aligned with a clear, time-bound goal.
The government set an ambitious target to electrify 18,452 villages in 1,000 days, announced by the Prime Minister on August 15, 2015. This meant maintaining a pace of 19 villages per day, despite difficult terrains, conflict zones, and bureaucratic obstacles like Right of Way (ROW), railway, and forest clearances.
Key programs like Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Saubhagya launched in 2014 and 2017 respectively were implemented with strict deadlines, direct political oversight, and a mission-mode approach. Unlike traditional development projects, these initiatives had no room for slow decision-making—delays were not tolerated, and leadership was held accountable at every stage.
Lesson for Mission 300: For Mission 300 to succeed, political leadership across Sub-Saharan Africa must own this mission at the highest levels—not as a development goal, but as a top national and regional priority. Governments, regional bodies, and development partners must commit to clear, non-negotiable deadlines, with direct oversight from heads of state and a mechanism to ensure accountability for delays.
2. Institutional strength matters
A key factor in India’s electrification success was the role of established national power agencies that spearheaded the implementation of large-scale electrification programs. These government-backed institutions provided technical expertise, financial oversight, and execution capacity, ensuring that schemes like DDUGJY and Saubhagya were delivered efficiently across states.
The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and the Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) played a pivotal role by coordinating efforts between national and state agencies, managing the disbursement of funds, and ensuring adherence to policy mandates. This centralized leadership with decentralized execution allowed for efficient last-mile delivery while maintaining policy consistency and accountability—key factors in achieving 100% electrification despite diverse regional challenges.
Lesson for Mission 300: For Mission 300 to succeed across multiple countries, it must build strong institutional capacity at the regional and national levels. A dedicated, well-resourced central agency or coordinating body—with clear mandates, technical expertise, and financial oversight—can drive implementation, ensuring that electrification efforts remain structured, scalable, and resilient against political and operational disruptions.
3. Digital tools for smarter execution
India’s electrification success was greatly enhanced by digital tools, ensuring real-time tracking, transparency, and accountability at every stage.
A key innovation was the GARV mobile app, which provided real-time electrification data at the national, state, district, and village levels. This replaced manual reporting, reducing delays and making progress tracking more efficient. The app also enabled milestone-based verification, where contractors uploaded photos of completed work, ensuring better quality control.
To improve on-the-ground monitoring, over 350 young electrical engineers (known as Gram Vidyut Abhiyanta) were deployed across 18,452 villages. Equipped with tablets installed with GARV App, they visited villages regularly, recorded progress according to checklist, updated the progress in GARV app, and flagged delays, ensuring real-time problem-solving.
India’s electrification drive also leveraged informal digital communication channels to enhance coordination and problem-solving. State-wise WhatsApp groups connected young electrical engineers with senior officials, allowing real-time issue resolution and guidance.
Additionally, a social media-driven grievance redressal system allowed citizens to report issues via Twitter, Facebook, and email, increasing public participation and holding authorities accountable. Features like Geographic Information System (GIS) asset mapping and village adoption tracking further strengthened oversight.
Lesson for Mission 300: To accelerate electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mission 300 should adopt a centralized real-time digital tracking system to monitor progress, verify milestones, and enhance accountability. Deploying local field engineers for real-time data collection and leveraging social media for public engagement can significantly improve transparency and responsiveness.

4. One Size Doesn’t Fit All
India’s electrification success was not just about expanding the grid—it was about adapting to diverse challenges through a hybrid model that combined grid extension, off-grid solar solutions, and decentralized mini-grids to ensure universal access.
The grid expansion strategy under Saubhagya played a central role, connecting over 26 million households through strengthened transmission and distribution networks. Special efforts were made to electrify challenging terrains, including Himalayan villages, Rajasthan’s deserts, and dense forests in the Northeast.
For households in remote and inaccessible areas, where grid extension was unviable, off-grid solar solutions were deployed. These included solar photovoltaic (SPV) standalone systems with 200–300W power packs, LED lights, a DC fan, a DC power plug, and five years of maintenance support.
While Saubhagya did not directly fund mini-grids, states like Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh ensured that their ongoing mini-grid projects complemented broader rural electrification efforts, which helped integrate decentralized energy solutions more effectively.
Lesson for Mission 300: A hybrid electrification model—grid expansion where feasible, mini-grids for underserved areas, and off-grid solar for remote households—is key to reaching the last mile. Mission 300 must prioritize both large-scale infrastructure and decentralized solutions to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity access.
Power to the People
Electrification is not just about infrastructure—it’s about ensuring that people adopt, use, and benefit from electricity in meaningful ways. In India, this was achieved through community-driven engagement strategies that created extensive awareness and fostered local ownership.
The government launched nationwide awareness campaigns, educating households on how electricity could improve livelihoods—boosting income generation, enhancing education, and reducing reliance on hazardous fuels like kerosene.
Saubhagya not only provided free electricity connections to poor households in rural and urban areas but also ensured affordability for others through a nominal fee of ₹500, payable in 10 monthly installments of ₹50. This small but structured payment plan ensured inclusion without burdening low-income families, resulting in higher acceptance and sustained usage.
Additionally, India leveraged grassroots networks, partnering with NGOs, women’s self-help groups, and local community organizations to promote adoption. These groups played a crucial role in building trust, assisting with administrative processes, and ensuring that newly electrified homes utilized the power available to them.
In states like Bihar and Jharkhand, women-led groups played a crucial role in driving electricity adoption, especially in regions where households were hesitant due to reliance on traditional fuels or cost concerns. They also helped transform newly electrified homes into micro-enterprises, showcasing the economic value of electricity access.
Lesson for Mission 300: Electrification must be demand-driven, not just supply-focused. Mission 300 should incorporate community outreach, financial support mechanisms, and grassroots partnerships to ensure widespread adoption and long-term impact. Simply bringing electricity to households is not enough—people must see tangible social and economic benefits to fully embrace it.
From India’s Success to Mission 300’s Execution
India’s electrification journey is more than just a success story—it is proof that universal energy access is achievable with the right mix of leadership, strategy, and execution. It demonstrates that scale and speed are possible when governance is strong, institutions are empowered, and innovation drives implementation.
For Mission 300, the challenge is immense—but so is the opportunity. With strong public financing commitments globally and regionally, alongside efforts to catalyze private and philanthropic investment, success will depend on turning investment into action, ensuring transparency, and fostering national ownership. The real test lies not in ambition but in execution, accountability, and the political will to see it through.
Sub-Saharan Africa is on the verge of an energy revolution. The blueprint exists, the tools are ready, and the momentum is building. What’s needed now is bold leadership, decisive action, and an unwavering commitment to power 300 million lives—perhaps even ahead of schedule.

Title: Ramzan Mubarak: PM Modi extends warm wishes as holy month begins
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 04:53:59 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his best wishes to all citizens on Sunday on the occasion of Ramzan, the sacred month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide.   
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “As the blessed month of Ramzan begins, may it bring peace and harmony in our society. This sacred month epitomises reflection, gratitude and devotion, also reminding us of the values of compassion, kindness and service. Ramzan Mubarak!”
Ramadan commenced in India on Sunday, marking the first day of fasting for Muslims throughout the country. The celebration has also started in various other countries following the sighting of the crescent moon.
On Friday, PM Modi attended the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau and extended his advance wishes for Ramzan. He also praised India’s Sufi tradition for its message of inclusivity and harmony.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also issued an official statement, greeting people on the holy occasion and highlighting the virtues of fasting and service to humanity during Ramadan.
“During these sacred days, good deeds such as fasting, self-discipline, patience, and worship foster values of tolerance, simplicity, and mutual brotherhood,” CM Yogi stated.
Ramadan is a month dedicated to fasting from dawn until sunset, ending with the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr. On Saturday, Maulana Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Mosque in Chandni Chowk, along with various religious organisations, announced that the holy month will commence on March 2, 2025.
According to the Islamic calendar, the sighting of the moon determines the beginning and end of a month, which typically lasts 30 days.
The Shahi Imam stated that because Saturday was the conclusion of the previous lunar month and the moon could not be seen due to poor weather conditions, Sunday was designated as the first day of fasting.
Throughout Ramadan, Muslims observe a fast from early morning until sunset and participate in special evening prayers called Tarawih, during which the entire Quran is recited throughout the month.
These prayers continue until the sighting of the Eid moon, marking the end of the fasting period and the beginning of celebrations.

Title: PM Modi embarks on lion safari at Gir National Park on World Wildlife Day
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gir National Park in Gujarat on Monday and embarked on a lion safari on the occasion of World Wildlife Day. Dressed in safari attire, the Prime Minister was seen capturing glimpses of the Asiatic lions with a camera.
Extending his wishes on World Wildlife Day, PM Modi emphasized the need for conservation efforts, stating, “Today, on World Wildlife Day, let’s reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet. Every species plays a vital role—let’s safeguard their future for generations to come! We also take pride in India’s contributions towards preserving and protecting wildlife.”
Asiatic lions currently inhabit approximately 30,000 square kilometers across 53 talukas in nine districts of Gujarat. The state government has undertaken several initiatives to protect these endangered big cats and conserve other wildlife species. As part of a national project, a National Referral Center for Wildlife is being established on over 20.24 hectares of land at New Pipalya in Junagadh district. Additionally, a high-tech wildlife monitoring center and a modern hospital have been set up in Sasan to bolster conservation efforts.
The Gujarat government has been actively working toward the conservation of Asiatic lions. In 2024, a total of 237 beat guards—162 men and 75 women—were recruited to patrol protected areas and safeguard lion habitats in Gir.
PM Modi has played a key role in the conservation and development of the Gir region. As the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2007, he personally visited Gir forest to assess the ground situation and gain insights into its biodiversity. 
A major step in this direction was the introduction of the Bruhad Gir concept, which expanded the conservation focus beyond Gir National Park and Sanctuary to a 30,000 sq. km area stretching from Barda to Botad, where Asiatic lions are also found.

Title: India emerges as world’s 3rd largest biofuel producer: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:15 +0000
Content: India has emerged as the world’s third-largest biofuel producer, driving the shift toward cleaner, renewable energy, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, said on Monday.
In a post on X, Puri highlighted that India has achieved 19.6% ethanol blending in petrol as of January and is on track to reach 20% very soon, five years ahead of its original 2030 target. This rapid progress is expected to reduce fuel imports and cut emissions.
“From the quiet town of Digboi to the world’s top energy markets, India’s petroleum journey is a story of resilience & progress, guided by the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Puri said.
Over the last decade, ethanol blending has contributed significantly to rural economic growth, increasing farmers’ incomes and creating jobs while reducing CO2 emissions, equivalent to planting 175 million trees, according to official estimates. The initiative has also saved the country Rs. 85,000 crore in foreign exchange.
Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum have introduced various ethanol-petrol blends nationwide and signed agreements with 131 ethanol plants, which are set to add an annual production capacity of 745 crore litres.
OMCs are also ramping up storage and infrastructure to handle higher ethanol blending percentages.
Puri also noted that Ethanol 100 (E100) fuel is now available at over 400 outlets nationwide. The petroleum minister had launched the high-octane E100 fuel at 183 Indian Oil outlets in March 2024.
According to Indian Oil, with an octane rating of 100-105, Ethanol 100 is ideal for high-performance engines. It improves efficiency and power output while environmental impact. E100 can be used in a wide range of vehicles, particularly flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on gasoline, ethanol, or a blend of both.
India has also become the fourth-largest in the world in LNG terminal capacity, ensuring stable energy supplies, Puri said.
He further noted that the country holds the fourth-largest global refining capacity and ranks as the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products.

Title: Navarro outclasses Arango with ‘double-bagel’ to claim Merida Open title
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:03 +0000
Content: Top seed Emma Navarro made light work of Colombian qualifier Emiliana Arango with a crushing 6-0 6-0 victory in the final of the Merida Open on Sunday as the American claimed her second career title.
World number 10 Navarro, who won the WTA 250 Hobart International last year, needed just 55 minutes to lift her first WTA 500 trophy, wrapping up a dominant run in the tournament in which she didn’t a set.
With a strong serve and powerful groundstrokes, Navarro never allowed Arango to reach a break point, while the U.S. Open semi-finalist won 71 percent of points on return.
The 23-year-old became only the fifth player this century to win a WTA final with a 6-0 6-0 scoreline, and the first since Iga Swiatek’s victory over Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Italian Open.
Arango, who will reach a career-high singles world ranking of 80 on Monday, could not find her stride following a nearly three-hour semi-final battle against fellow qualifier Daria Saville late on Saturday.
The Colombian world number 133 reached Sunday’s final on the back of an 11-match winning streak, including last week’s winning run at the WTA 125 Cancun Open, but had to play three sets in each of her last three matches.

Title: Tennis-Tsitsipas feeling refreshed after Dubai success with ‘mystery’ racket
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:50:47 +0000
Content: Stefanos Tsitsipas went nearly a year without a trophy before immediately reaping the rewards of changing his equipment as the Greek captured the Dubai Championships crown on Saturday while playing with a new “mystery” racket.
The 26-year-old’s first tour title since Monte Carlo last April ended his long drought in ATP 500 tournaments and vaulted him back into the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time since May.
“These are the things we’re fighting for as professional tennis players,” said Tsitsipas, who climbed to number nine in the world after the latest rankings were released on Monday.
“To be owning a spot in the top 10 is definitely one of the greatest feelings a tennis player can experience. It comes with hard work and sacrifices, but I’m happy that I’m in a position where I can really celebrate.”
Tsitsipas, who was ranked as high as number three in 2023 following a run to the Australian Open final that year, endured a worrying slump in recent months and lost in the opening round of his last two Grand Slams.
His all-court game was no longer a threat to opponents and losses against unheralded players began to mount, but changing his racket for Dubai added the firepower he needed to lift his 12th tour-level trophy.
Playing with a blacked out frame as players do when they trial new equipment, Tsitsipas defeated Lorenzo Sonego, Karen Khachanov, Matteo Berrettini and Tallon Griekspoor before downing Felix Auger Aliassime in the final.
“Comfort is one thing that it brings to my game,” Tsitsipas had said about his racket ahead of the final. “That’s something I was trying to add into my game.
“I’ve been receiving some of that extra help. I’ve spoken about how balls and courts have changed over the last couple of years. That’s just me trying to adapt to that.”
Tsitsipas, who will eye success at Indian Wells and Miami ahead of the European claycourt swing, said it would have been foolish of him not to seek ways to improve his game.
“These changes sometimes are necessary, because you don’t want to be stuck in the same pattern,” the former French Open runner-up added.
“I feel like it’s something refreshing and a good addition so far. It definitely brings that refreshing feeling and adds a bit of life and enthusiasm to my everyday going to work.”

Title: Tamil Nadu class 12 board exams begin; district collector and minister inspect centers
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:41:19 +0000

At Trichy Seva Sangam Girls Higher Secondary School, students began their exam day with prayers, seeking blessings before stepping into the examination halls.
Carrying admit cards in one hand and bags filled with essential stationery, students arrived at their respective centers, prepared to take on one of the most crucial academic milestones. The atmosphere was filled with anticipation as schools ensured all necessary arrangements for the smooth conduct of the exams.
In Trichy, District Collector Pradeep Kumar visited St. Philomena’s Girls Higher Secondary School to oversee the examination process, ensuring strict adherence to guidelines. The district witnessed the participation of 31,580 students, including 324 physically challenged students, reaffirming efforts to provide an inclusive and fair examination environment.
Elsewhere, Tamil Nadu’s Minister for School Education, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, visited an exam center in Nagapattinam, where he met students and extended his best wishes, encouraging them to perform with confidence.
Ahead of the exams, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also conveyed his encouragement to students appearing for board exams. In the 119th episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat on February 23, PM Modi urged students to stay positive and stress-free while approaching their papers.
“These are the times of board exams. I extend my best wishes to my young friends and the exam warriors for the upcoming exams. Approach your papers with a positive spirit, without any stress,” he said.
He also reflected on the growing impact of Pariksha Pe Charcha, an initiative aimed at easing exam-related stress among students. This year, the initiative featured eight expert-led episodes covering topics such as exam preparation, mental well-being, nutrition, and overall health care. Former toppers also shared insights and experiences to inspire students.
“Be happy and stress-free,” the Prime Minister emphasized, reinforcing the importance of a balanced mindset during exams.

Title: Bitcoin up by a fifth after Trump lists reserve tokens
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:39:06 +0000
Content: Bitcoin was trading up more than 20% from last week’s lows on Monday and several other cryptocurrencies that U.S. President Donald Trump said would be included in a new U.S. strategic reserve also rallied sharply.
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including bitcoin BTC=, ether, XRP, solana and cardano. The names had not previously been announced.
Bitcoin and ether will be at the heart of this reserve, he posted on Sunday.
The post sent the world’s largest cryptocurrency up by a fifth from the November lows it was trading at on Friday, helping flip sentiment on a token that has been sliding since mid-January on disappointment Trump has not followed through on pledges to loosen regulation.
It was last trading around $93,057, up from Friday’s $78,273.
Ether is up 10% from Friday’s close and was last at $2,450, XRP was up 31%, solana 15% and cardano was up 69%.
“Trump just gave the pump that crypto traders have been holding out for,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index.
“Any faith that was lost last week appears to have been restored,” and new highs could be made unless there was another wave of risk-off selling, he said.
Chris Weston, head of research at Australian online broker Pepperstone, said it was possible the rally will extend into the first White House Crypto Summit that Trump is hosting on Friday, with the risk that the bearishness in other markets could weigh on sentiment.
While Wall Street closed higher on Friday, the recent selloff in large technology bellwethers such as Nvidia has eroded confidence in bitcoin, which some see as an alternative tech proxy.
Bitcoin fell more than 17% in February, clocking its biggest monthly percentage fall since June 2022 and losing more than a third of its price since topping $105,000 in early January.
Its rally since Trump’s November election was spurred by optimism that the crypto-friendly president would champion a strategic bitcoin fund and end the previous Joe Biden administration’s crackdown on the industry.
But beyond a flurry of appointments of crypto-friendly officials when Trump took office, there has been little concrete news so far around that policy for investors.
“While this announcement has significantly boosted prices, it has also raised concerns,” wrote IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.
The funding for cryptocurrency purchases in the reserve could either come from U.S. taxpayers or the cryptocurrencies in the asset will be those seized in law enforcement actions, he said.
“The latter isn’t anywhere near as bullish as it simply represents a transfer between accounts rather than new buying entering the market.”

Title: Fresh snowfall in Kashmir’s higher reaches as rain showers lash J&K
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:29:24 +0000
Content: Kashmir’s higher reaches experienced fresh snowfall on Monday, while rain lashed the plains across Jammu and Kashmir, bringing relief from the prolonged dry spell that had raised concerns over water scarcity in the region.
According to the Meteorological (MeT) Department, light to moderate rain and snowfall were recorded in several areas, with the possibility of moderate to heavy snowfall in a few higher-altitude locations in north and central Kashmir. The weather is expected to remain mostly dry from March 4 to March 9, with another spell of rain and snow predicted between March 10 and March 12.
The recent precipitation has eased fears of drought, which had emerged due to an extended dry period over the past few weeks. The water levels in rivers, streams, lakes, and springs have improved significantly, reviving several perennial springs that had dried up following a 50-day-long dry spell in January and February.
Kashmir had witnessed only one major snowfall during ‘Chillai Kalan’—the 40-day-long harsh winter period from December 21 to January 30—raising concerns over water shortages in the summer months. The snowfall during this period is crucial for replenishing the region’s perennial water reservoirs, which serve as the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation during the hot summer season.
The dry winter had already begun affecting water availability in many areas, with the Jal Shakti department supplying potable water to localities where springs had dried up. However, the recent spell of rain and snowfall has helped restore water sources across the region.
On Monday, Srinagar recorded a minimum temperature of 4.9 degrees Celsius, while Gulmarg and Pahalgam registered minus 4.3 degrees and minus 0.8 degrees, respectively. In the Jammu region, Jammu city recorded a minimum of 12.4 degrees Celsius, Katra 7.8 degrees, Batote 4.7 degrees, Banihal 3.6 degrees, and Bhaderwah 3.4 degrees.

Title: Egypt says Gaza reconstruction plan ready, pushes efforts for ceasefire’s second phase
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:13:15 +0000
Content: Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Sunday that Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan, which ensures Palestinians remain in their land, is ready and will be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday.
Arab states, which were swift to reject President Donald Trump’s plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and resettle Palestinians, are scrambling to agree on a diplomatic offensive to counter the idea.
Trump’s plan, announced on February 4 amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, appeared to back away from longstanding U.S. Middle East policy focused on a two-state solution and sparked anger among Palestinians and Arab nations.
Abdelatty said Egypt would seek international backing and funding for the plan and emphasised Europe’s crucial role, particularly in the financing of Gaza’s reconstruction.
“We will hold intensive talks with major donor countries once the plan is adopted at the upcoming Arab Summit,” he said in a press conference with the EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Suica.
Israel on Sunday blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza as a standoff over the truce that has halted fighting for the past six weeks escalated. Abdelatty said the use of aid as a weapon of collective punishment could not be permitted.
The first phase of the fragile ceasefire agreement expired this weekend. Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase. “It will be difficult, but with goodwill and political determination, it can be achieved,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said earlier that it had adopted a U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods.
Abdelatty said after Tuesday’s summit, foreign ministers of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation would hold an urgent meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to present the plans.
“We will ensure that the results of the Arab summit are presented to the world in the best possible way,” he said.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also highlighted India’s crucial role in diversifying trade links and boosting Australia’s prosperity. The two nations are working on a new roadmap to help Australian businesses tap into India’s rapidly growing market, set to become the third-largest economy by 2030.
An extra USD 4 million will be allocated to expand the Maitri Grants program, strengthening business, cultural, and people-to-people ties. Australia’s existing free trade agreement with India has already delivered substantial financial benefits, with tariff savings expected to reach USD 2 billion by year-end, further enhancing the economic partnership.

Title: Rs 611 Cr FEMA Violations: ED issues notice to Paytm’s parent firm, managing director
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:30:41 +0000
Content: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday issued a show-cause notice to One97 Communications Ltd, the parent company of Paytm, its Managing Director Vijay Shekhar Sharma, and others for alleged violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) amounting to Rs 611 crore.
The notice was issued by the Special Director of Enforcement (Adjudication), New Delhi, to One97 Communications Ltd (OCL), Paytm’s flagship company, its Managing Director, and its subsidiaries—Little Internet Private Limited (LIPL) and Nearbuy India Private Limited (NIPL)—for contraventions of FEMA provisions totaling Rs 611 crore.
According to the ED’s investigation, OCL made foreign investments in Singapore but failed to report the creation of an overseas step-down subsidiary to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Further, OCL received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from overseas investors without adhering to RBI’s pricing guidelines.
OCL’s Indian subsidiary, Little Internet, also received FDI without complying with RBI’s pricing regulations, while another subsidiary, Nearbuy India Pvt Ltd, failed to report FDI transactions within the prescribed time frame.
The show-cause notice was issued to initiate adjudication proceedings under FEMA.
Earlier, Paytm stated that it would address the alleged FEMA contraventions related to two acquired subsidiaries—Little Internet Private Limited (LIPL) and Nearbuy India Private Limited (NIPL). The company said in a stock exchange filing that these alleged violations pertain to transactions made before the subsidiaries became part of Paytm.
Paytm added that it is seeking legal advice and evaluating appropriate remedies through available regulatory processes.

Title: Pharma sector in focus at India-Vietnam business meet in Ho Chi Minh city
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 12:31:20 +0000
Content: As many as 39 Indian pharma companies connected with more than 50 Vietnamese counterparts, holding productive discussions during an ‘India-Vietnam Business-to-Business (B2B)’ meeting on the pharmaceutical industry organised in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City on Monday.
Comprehensive discussions were held on Indo-Vietnam business ties at the event, which aimed to strengthen the pharmaceutical trade between India and Vietnam. The meeting was supported by the Consulate General of India in Ho Chi Minh, the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
During his visit to India in July 2024, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called for stronger economic cooperation between the two nations, setting an ambitious target of $20 billion in bilateral trade. Speaking at a Vietnam-India Business Forum in New Delhi, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Embassy of Vietnam, he outlined his nation’s economic achievements and invited Indian businesses to invest in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, digital technology, and pharmaceuticals.
He also invited Indian businesses to invest more in Vietnam, particularly in semiconductors, science and technology, innovation, digital transformation, green hydrogen, pharmaceuticals, renewables, and biotechnology. Vietnam currently sources 33 per cent of its pharmaceuticals from India and has expressed interest in establishing a proper pharmaceutical ecosystem in the country to help safeguard the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people.
India and Vietnam have age-old historical and civilizational ties, which were elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Vietnam in September 2016. India considers Vietnam a key pillar of its ‘Act East’ policy and an important partner in its Indo-Pacific vision.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games 2025 to commence in J&K’s Gulmarg from March 9
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:57:43 +0000
Content: The second leg of the 5th Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG), which was postponed due to insufficient snowfall, will now be held from March 9 to 12 after Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir, received significant snowfall.
The second leg, featuring four snow sports—Ski Mountaineering, Alpine Skiing, Snowboard, and Nordic Skiing—was initially set to be held in Gulmarg from February 22 to 25. However, authorities postponed the event due to insufficient snowfall on the ski slopes.
The Ski resort has received good snowfall during the last seven days, and even on Monday five to eight inches of fresh snowfall accumulated on the ground while it was still snowing at Gulmarg.
Officials on Monday said that the event will now start on March 9 and conclude on March 12. “More than 300 athletes from all over the country will compete in events like alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, ski mountaineering, snowboarding and ice hockey. Arrangements for 5th Khelo India winter games 2025 have already been finalised,” officials said.
The first leg of KIWG 2025 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating at Ladakh NDS Stadium and Guphuk Pond &amp; LSRC Army Rink.
The initiative is meant to promote winter sports in India by offering athletes a competitive platform in one of the country’s premier snow destinations. These winter sports provide Indian athletes with much-needed exposure to international level winter sports facilities.
Gulmarg has some of the world’s best ski slopes comparable to France, Switzerland and Italy. The second stage of the Gulmarg Gandola cable car ropeway, which has 36 cabins and 18 towers, takes skiers to a height of 3,980 m (13,058 ft) on Kongdoori Mountain, a shoulder of nearby Afarwat Peak (4,200 m (13,780 ft)
The ski resort also has the world’s highest golf course, where masters like Tiger Woods have teed off in the past.

Title: PM Modi chairs 7th National Board for Wildlife meeting in Gir
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:48:38 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the 7th meeting of the National Board for Wildlife at Gir National Park in Gujarat on Monday. The discussions focused on expanding protected areas, strengthening species-specific programs, and addressing human-wildlife conflict.
The meeting assessed the progress of flagship conservation projects, including Project Tiger, Project Elephant, and Project Snow Leopard. Conservation efforts for dolphins and Asiatic lions, along with the establishment of the International Big Cats Alliance, were also discussed.
During the session, the Prime Minister released a report on the country’s first riverine dolphin estimation, which recorded 6,327 dolphins across 28 rivers in eight states. Uttar Pradesh reported the highest population, followed by Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. The report highlighted the role of local communities in conservation, and the Prime Minister suggested initiatives to raise awareness, including exposure visits for schoolchildren to dolphin habitats.
The foundation stone for the National Referral Centre for Wildlife was laid in Junagadh, with the facility set to serve as a hub for wildlife health and disease management. The 16th Asiatic Lion population estimation cycle was also announced for 2025, following the last assessment in 2020.
The natural dispersal of Asiatic lions into Barda Wildlife Sanctuary was noted, with plans for prey augmentation and habitat improvement to support the growing population. Eco-tourism development was also discussed, focusing on improved travel access and connectivity for visitors.
To address human-wildlife conflict, a Centre of Excellence will be established at the Wildlife Institute of India’s campus in SACON (Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History), Coimbatore. This center will work with state governments and Union Territories to equip Rapid Response Teams with tracking technology, surveillance systems, and conflict mitigation strategies. The Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N) will collaborate with the Wildlife Institute of India to utilize remote sensing, geospatial mapping, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to monitor forest fires and human-animal interactions.
The meeting also addressed forest fire management, with the Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, and BISAG-N expected to collaborate on prediction, detection, and prevention measures in vulnerable protected areas.
The ongoing Cheetah reintroduction program will be expanded to new locations, including Gandhisagar Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh and Banni Grasslands in Gujarat. A conservation program focused on tiger populations outside protected reserves was also announced, aimed at managing human-tiger interactions and supporting co-existence with local communities.
Recognizing the declining gharial population, a new Project on Gharials was introduced to strengthen conservation efforts. A National Great Indian Bustard Conservation Action Plan was also announced to intensify efforts to protect the species.
The Prime Minister emphasized the need to document traditional knowledge and conservation practices from different regions for research and development. Various task forces will be set up for the conservation of Indian Sloth Bear, Gharial, and Great Indian Bustard.
Gir National Park’s success in lion and leopard conservation was highlighted as a model, with plans to document conservation techniques using artificial intelligence for wider application in other protected areas. India’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) was reiterated, with discussions on enhancing international cooperation.
The role of community reserves in conservation efforts was noted, with an increase in their number over the past decade. The Prime Minister also spoke about utilizing AI and other advanced technologies for wildlife monitoring and suggested further research on medicinal plants in forest areas to support animal health management.

Title: Kremlin says someone needs to force Zelenskiy to make peace after clash with Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:35:05 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that someone would have to force Volodymyr Zelenskiy to make peace and that the Ukrainian leader’s public clash with U.S. President Donald Trump had shown just how hard it would be to find a way to end the war.
Trump and Vice President JD Vance clashed with Zelenskiy in the Oval Office on Friday. Trump accused Zelenskiy of disrespecting the United States, said he was losing the war and risked triggering World War Three.
“What happened at the White House on Friday, of course, demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “The Kyiv regime and Zelenskiy do not want peace. They want the war to continue.”
“It is very important that someone forces Zelenskiy himself to change his position,” Peskov said. “Someone has to make Zelenskiy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honoured and praised.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.
Conflict in and over Ukraine had been building for years before his decision. Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 after a pro-Moscow president was ousted amid mass street protests in Kyiv. Russian-backed separatists then began fighting Ukraine’s armed forces in the country’s eastern Donbas region.
Peskov said Putin was familiar with the “unprecedented event” in the Oval Office, adding that it had demonstrated at the very least Zelenskiy’s lack of diplomatic skills.
Zelenskiy said on Sunday he believed he could salvage his relationship with Trump but that Ukraine would not concede any territory to Russia as part of a peace deal.
Russia currently controls just under a fifth of Ukraine – or about 113,000 square km – while Ukraine has seized about 450 square km of Russia in an incursion into neighbouring Kursk province, according to open source maps of the war and Russian estimates.
WESTERN ‘FRAGMENTATION’
After the clash in the Oval Office, European leaders leapt to Zelenskiy’s defence. At a summit in London on Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States.
Starmer also announced a new British 1.6 billion pound ($2 billion) deal that would allow Ukraine to purchase 5,000 air-defence missiles.
Responding to the summit, the Kremlin said the London summit was an attempt to continue the war, not to seek peace, but also noted the divisions between Europe and the United States.
“We see that… a fragmentation of the collective West has begun,” Peskov said.
“There remains a group of countries that rather constitutes the party of war, which declares its readiness to further back Ukraine in terms of supporting the war and ensuring the continuation of hostilities.”
The West and Ukraine describe Russia’s 2022 invasion as an imperial-style land grab.
Putin casts the conflict as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging the NATO military alliance and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.
Peskov said Russia would continue its dialogue with Washington on bilateral ties and would press on with what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.
Asked about Trump’s remarks that he had spoken to Putin on “numerous occasions”, Peskov said: “There have been no contacts that should have been made public” beyond a Feb. 12 phone call.

Title: Sensex closes above 73,000 in volatile trade, metal and realty stocks shine
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:50:59 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets ended nearly flat on Monday after a volatile trading session, influenced by mixed global cues. While early gains were erased by mid-session declines, strong buying in metal, realty, and IT stocks helped the indices recover.
 
The 30-share BSE Sensex settled at 73,085.94, down by 112.16 points (0.15%) after swinging between an intra-day high of 73,649.72 and a low of 72,784.54. The Nifty 50 closed at 22,119.30, slipping just 5.40 points (0.02%) after touching a high of 22,261 and a low of 22,004.
 
Market Performance and Sectoral Trends
Markets opened on a positive note but soon lost momentum, with both Sensex and Nifty dropping nearly 0.5% by noon. However, renewed buying interest in key sectors helped indices recover in the latter half of the session.
 
Among Nifty 50 constituents, 33 stocks ended in the green. Top gainers included Bharat Electronics, Grasim, Eicher Motors, JSW Steel, and UltraTech Cement, which saw gains of up to 4.65%.
 
Conversely, Reliance Industries declined by 2.17%, weighing on market sentiment.
 
The broader market witnessed a mixed trend. While the Nifty Midcap100 index edged up by 0.14%, the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 0.27%.
 
Sector-wise, performance remained mixed. Gains were seen in Nifty IT, Metal, Auto, Pharma, Realty, and Healthcare, with Nifty IT rising the most at 1.26%. However, banking, oil & gas, and media sectors faced losses of up to 1.10%.
 
Technical Analysis and Outlook
Following a prolonged downturn, Indian equities attempted a recovery after enduring their longest monthly losing streak since 1996.
 
Vatsal Bhuva of LKP Securities said that Nifty found strong support around the 22,000 mark and managed to close above the crucial 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 22,043, calculated from the 2022 low of 15,213 to its all-time high of 26,277.
 
However, he cautioned that the broader market trend remains bearish, with a sell-on-rise approach prevailing unless Nifty decisively breaks above 22,600.

Title: UK, France propose partial one-month Ukraine truce, Paris says
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:48:21 +0000
Content: France and Britain are proposing a partial one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine that would cover air, sea and energy infrastructure attacks but not include ground fighting, French President Emmanuel Macron and his foreign minister said.
The comments came amid a flurry of European diplomacy designed to shore up Western support for Ukraine following an acrimonious meeting between President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday.
“Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that’s when real peace negotiations could start,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday.
Under the Anglo-French proposal, European ground troops would only be deployed to Ukraine in a second phase, Macron said in an interview published in Le Figaro late on Sunday.
“There will be no European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks,” Le Figaro quoted Macron as saying as he flew to London for a meeting of European leaders, convened by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advance efforts at drawing up a Ukraine peace plan.
“The question is how we use this time to try to obtain a truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a (troop) deployment,” Macron said.
The French president did not elaborate on how air, sea and energy infrastructure could be monitored.
“In my eyes that can only be possible with NATO or at least NATO command and then Patriot systems, long-range missiles and aviation, which Ukraine does not have,” said a European diplomat. “And you have to negotiate with Russia so that it doesn’t carry out the massive attacks.”
The Kremlin, which has rejected the idea of Western troops being deployed to Ukraine, said on Monday the Oval Office clash between Trump and Zelenskiy showed how difficult it would be to reach a settlement on the conflict in Ukraine.
‘DIFFERENT OPTIONS’
Zelenskiy, asked if he was aware of the plan mentioned by Macron, told reporters in London: “I’m aware of everything.”
On Monday, however, UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard declined to confirm the ideas aired by Macron and Barrot, saying: “That’s not a plan that we currently recognise.”
“Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies at the moment. It’s probably not right for me at the moment to comment on each individual option as they occur,” Pollard told the BBC.
Starmer said on Sunday that European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States, without going into details.
Meanwhile, the parties in talks to form Germany’s new government are considering quickly setting up two special funds potentially worth hundreds of billions of euros, one for defence and a second for infrastructure, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Economists advising the parties that will likely form a new government coalition estimate around 400 billion euros ($415 billion) are needed for the defence fund, the people said.
Friday’s heated White House exchange between Zelenskiy and Trump has increased a sense of urgency in Berlin to act faster on spending for Germany’s own defence and for Ukraine, they said.
European Union leaders will meet for an extraordinary summit on March 6 to discuss additional support for Ukraine, European security guarantees and how to pay for European defence needs.

Title: Women in India driving financial growth, increasing credit awareness: NITI Aayog report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:41:25 +0000
Content: Women in India are increasingly taking charge of their financial futures by actively seeking credit and monitoring their credit scores, according to a report launched by NITI Aayog on Monday.
Titled “From Borrowers to Builders: Women’s Role in India’s Financial Growth Story”, the report was unveiled by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. It highlights a significant rise in financial awareness among women, with 27 million actively monitoring their credit as of December 2024—a sharp 42 percent increase from the previous year.
The report, jointly published by TransUnion CIBIL, the Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) of NITI Aayog, and MicroSave Consulting (MSC), underscores a positive trend in women’s participation in the financial ecosystem. Women’s share in the total self-monitoring credit base rose to 19.43 percent in December 2024, up from 17.89 percent in 2023. Notably, non-metro regions outpaced metro areas in self-monitoring growth, with a 48 percent rise compared to 30 percent in urban centers.
Geographically, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana accounted for 49 percent of self-monitoring women, with the southern region leading at 10.2 million. Northern and central states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, recorded the highest compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) in active women borrowers over the last five years.
The report also highlights a shift in borrowing patterns. Since 2019, women’s share in business loan origination has increased by 14 percent, while their share in gold loans has grown by 6 percent. By December 2024, women are projected to account for 35 percent of business borrowers, reinforcing their role as key contributors to India’s economic growth.
Despite this progress, challenges persist. The report identifies barriers such as credit aversion, poor banking experiences, lack of collateral, and difficulties in securing guarantors as obstacles limiting women’s full participation in the credit ecosystem.
At the report’s launch, NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam emphasized the critical role of financial access in empowering women entrepreneurs. “The government recognizes that access to finance is a fundamental enabler for women’s entrepreneurship. The Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) is committed to fostering financial literacy, expanding access to credit, and strengthening mentorship and market linkages,” he said.
Subrahmanyam also stressed the need for collaborative efforts to ensure equitable financial access. “Financial institutions must design inclusive products tailored to women’s needs. Policy initiatives addressing structural barriers will be instrumental in accelerating this momentum. Under the WEP initiative, we have established the Financing Women Collaborative (FWC), and we invite more financial sector stakeholders to join this mission,” he added.
Anna Roy, Principal Economic Advisor at NITI Aayog and Mission Director of WEP, reinforced the importance of promoting women’s entrepreneurship as a strategy for economic growth. “Encouraging women entrepreneurs can create employment opportunities for 150 to 170 million people while driving greater participation of women in the workforce,” she said.

Title: Bitcoin jumps 20% after Trump hints at new strategic reserve
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:39:06 +0000
Content: Bitcoin surged more than 20% from last week’s lows on Monday and several other cryptocurrencies also rallied sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of a new U.S. strategic reserve that would include a range of tokens.
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies, including bitcoin BTC=, ether, XRP, solana and cardano. The names had not previously been announced.
Bitcoin and ether will be at the heart of this reserve, he posted on Sunday.
The post sent the world’s largest cryptocurrency up by a fifth from the November lows it was trading at on Friday, helping flip sentiment on a token that has been sliding since mid-January on disappointment Trump had not followed through on pledges to loosen regulation.
It was last at around $91,605, up from Friday’s low of$78,273.
Ether ETH= was also up 20% from Friday’s lows to $2,351, a 7% drop from Sunday’s closing levels.
XRP XRP= and solana SOL=CCCL were up around 30% from Friday’s lowest levels, while cardano ADA=CCCL was up 60% from last week’s lows.
“Trump just gave the pump that crypto traders have been holding out for,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index.
“Any faith that was lost last week appears to have been restored,” and new highs could be made unless there was another wave of risk-off selling, he said.
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said it was possible the rally will extend into the first White House Crypto Summit that Trump is hosting on Friday, with the risk that the bearishness in other markets could weigh on sentiment.
While Wall Street closed higher on Friday, the recent selloff in large technology bellwethers such as Nvidia NVDA.O has eroded confidence in bitcoin, which some see as an alternative tech proxy.
Bitcoin fell more than 17% in February, clocking its biggest monthly percentage fall since June 2022 and losing more than a third of its price since topping $105,000 in early January.
Its rally since Trump’s November election was spurred by optimism that the crypto-friendly president would champion a strategic bitcoin fund and end the previous Joe Biden administration’s crackdown on the industry.
“Ironically, a currency that was designed to be isolated from government interference and decentralized, is now reliant on the US government for its fortunes,” Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB said, reiterating that the $100,000 level an “obvious target” for bitcoin.
Beyond a flurry of appointments of crypto-friendly officials when Trump took office, there has been little concrete news so far around that policy for investors.
“While this announcement has significantly boosted prices, it has also raised concerns,” wrote IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.
The funding for cryptocurrency purchases in the reserve could either come from U.S. taxpayers or the cryptocurrencies in the asset will be those seized in law enforcement actions, he said.
“The latter isn’t anywhere near as bullish as it simply represents a transfer between accounts rather than new buying entering the market.”

Title: President Droupadi Murmu inaugurates Visitor’s Conference in New Delhi
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:24:47 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu inaugurated the Visitor’s Conference 2024-25 at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday, underscoring the transformative role of higher education in shaping India’s future. Addressing heads of 184 Central Institutes of Higher Education, she emphasized that the true measure of a nation’s progress lies in the strength of its education system.
Stressing the need to prioritize research alongside academics, Murmu highlighted the National Research Fund, established to support groundbreaking studies. She expressed confidence that Indian institutions would make full use of this initiative, fostering innovation that could gain global recognition. She envisioned an academic landscape where Indian researchers earn international acclaim, patents from Indian institutions drive change worldwide, and students from developed countries seek India as a preferred destination for higher education.
The President acknowledged the significant contributions of Indian students across prestigious global institutions and advanced economies. However, she urged educational leaders to find ways to retain and utilize this talent within India. She asserted that India’s ambition to become a Global Knowledge Superpower would only be realized when innovations from Indian laboratories are eagerly adopted by the international community.
Beyond academic excellence, Murmu emphasized the importance of social inclusion in education. She called for a system where no student faces barriers—whether economic, social, or psychological—in accessing higher education. Encouraging faculty members to support students beyond academics, she urged them to eliminate insecurities, provide moral and emotional strength, and cultivate an atmosphere of positivity within campuses.
She also reflected on India’s deep-rooted tradition of scientific achievements, emphasizing the need for intensive research to rediscover and adapt indigenous knowledge systems to modern contexts. She placed the onus on academic institutions to integrate these organic knowledge streams into contemporary education, ensuring they remain relevant in today’s world.
During the conference, the President presented the eighth Visitor’s Awards to recognize outstanding contributions in innovation, research, and technology development. Prof. Saripella Srikrishna of Banaras Hindu University was honored for his groundbreaking work in quantum technology, which supports the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Prof. Ashwini Kumar Nangia from the University of Hyderabad received recognition for his pioneering research in high-bioavailability drugs, aimed at enhancing pharmaceutical efficacy at an affordable cost.
In the field of biological sciences, the award was jointly presented to Prof. Rina Chakrabarti from the University of Delhi, for her contributions to sustainable freshwater aquaculture, and Prof. Raj Kumar of the Central University of Punjab, for his research on cancer hallmarks and the development of synthetic anticancer molecules. The technology development award was conferred upon Dr. Venkateswarlu Chintala of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya, whose work on converting plastic waste into commercial-scale petrol and diesel has significant environmental and economic implications.
The second day of the conference will focus on key discussions, including flexibility in academic courses, international collaborations, translational research, effective student selection processes under the National Education Policy (NEP), and innovation commercialization. The conclusions from these deliberations will be presented to the President during the closing session.

The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister accused Anand of lacking political maturity and being influenced by his father-in-law, Ashok Siddharth, who was also expelled for “factionalism.” She said that Anand’s lengthy response following his removal was neither a sign of remorse nor political wisdom but was instead driven by arrogance.
Mayawati emphasized that Anand was expected to accept his removal with maturity. “In the BSP’s All-India meeting yesterday, Akash Anand was relieved from all responsibilities, including the post of National Coordinator, due to his continued influence under his father-in-law. For this, he should have repented and shown maturity,” she added.
A day after his removal, Akash Anand responded defiantly, stating that he remained undeterred and would continue his commitment to the Bahujan movement. Calling the decision “personally emotional” but a “big challenge,” he vowed to keep fighting for the rights of marginalized communities.
“The test is difficult, and the fight is long. Patience and determination are the true companions in such difficult times,” Anand posted on X. He added that the Bahujan movement was an idea that could not be suppressed and that “lakhs of Akash Anands” were ready to carry forward its legacy.
Following Anand’s ouster, Mayawati appointed Anand Kumar and Ramji Gautam as the new National Coordinators of the BSP. Meanwhile, Ashok Siddharth, Anand’s father-in-law, was also expelled from the party for allegedly causing divisions within the organization.

Title: ROHIT SHARMA UNFAZED BY AUSTRALIA AS INDIA PREPARES FOR SEMIFINAL
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:25:23 +0000
Content: India Cricket team captain Rohit Sharma exuded confidence ahead of his team’s ICC tournament semifinal clash against Australia, emphasising process over revenge despite their previous defeat to the same opposition in the 2023 World Cup final.
“It’s a great opposition to play against,” Sharma said during Monday’s press conference in Dubai. “Australia has been a great team over the years. We expect some fightbacks and some nervy moments in the middle.”
When asked if facing Australia in the semifinals provided extra motivation following their 2023 World Cup final loss, he remained measured. “All we need to do is stick to what we’ve been focusing on in the last three games. We have to approach this match in a similar fashion,” he explained.
The Indian skipper acknowledged the pressure of knockout cricket but stressed the importance of execution over the opposition. “Obviously, the pressure is on both teams to win. But it’s important for us to focus on what we need to do, keep executing our plans, and get the basics right. The results will follow if we stick to what we are supposed to do.”
Rohit Sharma also addressed India’s bowling strategy against Australia’s formidable batting lineup, particularly the possibility of retaining the four-spinner approach that had proven effective in the group stage.
“We need to consider whether playing four spinners is viable and how we can fit them in. If it’s not, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” he said. “We’ll assess the conditions and analyze Australia’s batting lineup to determine the best bowling combination against them.”
With uncertainty over which pitch will be used for the semifinal at Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the Indian captain emphasised the need for adaptability. “We don’t know which pitch will be used, but whatever happens, we have to adapt and respond to the conditions.”The semifinal between India and Australia is set for March 4, at Dubai, with the winner advancing to the tournament final.

Title: INDIA ADVANCES IMEEC TRADE CORRIDOR WITH KEY UAE DISCUSSIONS
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:01:43 +0000
Content: The ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEEC) gained significant momentum following high-level discussions between Indian and UAE officials in Abu Dhabi this week, marking a major step forward for the transcontinental connectivity project.
A delegation led by T.K. Ramachandaran, Secretary of India’s Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, held talks with Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports. The Indian delegation included Ambassador Sunjay Sudhir and senior officials from RITES Ltd, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority, and Deendayal Port Authority.
The IMEEC, launched during the G-20 Summit in New Delhi in September 2023, is a transcontinental connectivity initiative with signatories including India, UAE, USA, EU, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, and Germany. Together, these nations represent nearly 50% of global GDP.
A key focus of the discussions was the Master Application for International Trade and Regulatory Interface (MAITRI), which was launched during Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to India in September 2024. MAITRI aims to integrate existing trade portals from both countries, providing seamless and paperless connectivity.
The platform will incorporate India’s National Logistics Portal-Marine, Indian Customs Electronic Gateway, and Unified Logistics Interface Platform with corresponding UAE systems. Development responsibilities have been assigned to RITES and C-DAC, who are collaborating with major Indian ports.
MAITRI will support the Virtual Trade Corridor (VTC), another initiative launched during the Crown Prince’s visit. The VTC is expected to bolster bilateral trade between India and the UAE, which currently exceeds US$85 billion annually.
A preparatory workshop was held in Mumbai on February 27, with participation from India’s Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal, Abu Dhabi Ports, DP World, and other UAE stakeholders.The IMEEC project promises to be one of the shortest trade routes from India to Europe, supporting economic integration across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
Beyond transportation infrastructure, the corridor will facilitate energy and digital connectivity, including an electrical grid between the UAE and India for solar power transmission. Both countries are also advancing cooperation on green hydrogen and public digital infrastructure.
The UAE segment of the corridor will terminate at Ghweifat on the UAE-Saudi Arabia border, from where a rail link will transport cargo through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and into Israel.The project’s strategic importance was recently underscored during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with US President Donald Trump, with the corridor featuring prominently in the joint statement issued after their discussions.

The India-Austria Enhanced Partnership is poised to make steady progress in the years to come.” He further expressed his commitment to elevating India-Austria relations to new heights.
India and Austria have maintained close diplomatic ties since 1949, marking 70 years of bilateral relations in 2019. High-level visits have played a crucial role in strengthening this partnership. In September 2021, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla visited Vienna for the 5th World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, while in February 2019, Austria’s then Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl met with Sushma Swaraj in India to celebrate the diplomatic milestone.

Title: Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has lashed out at Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed for her remarks on Rohit Sharma, calling them “shameful and pathetic.”
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 07:25:49 +0000
Content: During India’s Champions Trophy Group A clash against New Zealand on Sunday, the Congress spokesperson took to X (formerly Twitter) to blatantly call the Indian captain “fat.”
“Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And, of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had,” Shama said in a post on X.
Her comments triggered widespread backlash, leading to a major controversy. As a result, the Congress party directed Mohamed to delete her social media post on the Indian skipper.
The sports minister responded strongly, urging political leaders to refrain from targeting athletes.
“Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic. Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,” Mandaviya said in a post on X.
So far in the ongoing tournament, Rohit remains the only top-order Indian batter yet to score a half-century, while Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer have been in top form. The 37-year-old has accumulated 76 runs across three innings at an average of 25.33 and a strike rate of 111.76, with a highest score of 68.
Riding on Varun Chakaravarthy’s five-wicket haul, India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs and finished at the top of Group A. They will now face Australia in the first semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday, while New Zealand will take on South Africa in the other semifinal in Lahore on Wednesday.
Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad also echoed the sports minister’s sentiments, calling Shama’s remarks “pathetic” and urging respect for Rohit’s contributions to Indian cricket.
“Rohit has maintained great dignity as a captain, led us to a T20 World Cup win eight months ago, and in the middle of an ICC tournament, body-shaming him is absolutely pathetic and uncalled for. There should be some respect for a person who has achieved so much through his skills and leadership over the years,” Prasad said on X.

“We have provided benefits to more than 98 lakh women under the Subhadra Scheme, nearing our target of 1 crore beneficiaries. On Thursday, assistance will be extended to 1.7 lakh more women. On Saturday, i.e. March 8, Rs. 5,000 crore will be distributed among 1 crore women,” Parida stated. 
The Subhadra Scheme, a transformative initiative for women’s empowerment, was first introduced by Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi in the state legislative assembly in August 2024. 
The scheme is aimed at enhancing financial support for women in Odisha between the ages of 21 and 60. A total of Rs. 55,825 crore has been allocated for the scheme, which will run from 2024 to 2029. 
Under Subhadra, eligible women will receive Rs. 10,000 per year in two installments of Rs. 5,000, paid on Raksha Bandhan and International Women’s Day. Over the course of five years, each beneficiary will receive a total of Rs. 50,000. 
To ensure transparency, payments will be directly credited to the beneficiaries’ Aadhaar-enabled bank accounts via the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System (APBS). Beneficiaries will also receive a Subhadra Debit Card. 
In a bid to promote digital transactions, 100 women with the highest digital transaction activity from each Gram Panchayat and Urban Local Body will be selected to receive an extra incentive of Rs. 500. 
The scheme is targeted toward economically disadvantaged women. Women from well-off families, government servants, income tax payees, and those already receiving financial assistance of Rs. 1,500 or more per month under other government schemes will not be eligible for Subhadra benefits.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates Vantara animal rescue center during Gujarat visit
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:47:09 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated Vantara, an animal rescue, conservation, and rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar, Gujarat, where he spent time interacting with a variety of rescued animals. The visit underscored his deep commitment to wildlife protection and conservation efforts.
The inauguration was attended by Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, along with Nita Ambani, Anant Ambani, and Radhika Merchant. The Prime Minister explored the centre’s extensive facilities, including its state-of-the-art wildlife hospital equipped with MRI, CT scan, and ICU services, aimed at providing advanced medical care to rescued animals.
During his visit, PM Modi was seen engaging with a range of animals, including Asiatic Lion cubs, a White Lion cub, a Clouded Leopard cub, and Caracal cubs. A video shared on his official YouTube handle captured heartwarming moments of him feeding and playing with these animals. The White Lion cub he fed was born at the centre after its mother was rescued, while the Caracals, once common in India but now a rare species, are being bred at Vantara under a captive breeding program for future release into the wild.
The Prime Minister also visited the MRI room, where he observed an Asiatic Lion undergoing an MRI scan. In the operation theatre, he witnessed a life-saving surgery on a Leopard that had been hit by a vehicle and brought to the centre for treatment. The rehabilitated animals at Vantara are housed in environments designed to closely mimic their natural habitats, ensuring their well-being and gradual reintegration into the wild. Some of the major conservation projects at the centre focus on species such as the Asiatic Lion, Snow Leopard, and One-Horned Rhinoceros.
Among the most striking moments of the visit was PM Modi’s encounter with a Golden Tiger and four Snow Tigers, who had been rescued from a circus where they were forced to perform tricks. He also sat face-to-face with a White Lion and a Snow Leopard. His interactions extended to a diverse range of animals, including Chimpanzees rescued from the pet trade, an Okapi, an Orangutan from an overcrowded facility, a Hippopotamus, crocodiles, and Zebras. He also fed a Giraffe and an orphaned One-Horned Rhino calf, whose mother had died at the facility.
At Vantara, PM Modi also saw some of the rarest species, including a two-headed snake, a two-headed turtle, a Tapir, Leopard cubs rescued from agricultural fields, Giant Otters, Bongos (a type of antelope), Seals, and Elephants enjoying a specialized jacuzzi therapy. The hydrotherapy pools at the centre aid elephants suffering from arthritis and foot problems, improving their mobility and overall health.
One of the most symbolic moments of the visit came when PM Modi released rescued parrots back into their natural habitat, a gesture reflecting the centre’s mission of rehabilitation and freedom for rescued wildlife. Throughout his time at Vantara, he engaged with veterinarians, caretakers, and staff, recognizing their dedication to managing and operating the expansive facility.

Title: Cyclone scraps Australian golf event, AFL matches
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:47:09 +0000
Content: A cyclone expected to hit the east coast of Australia this week has scrapped a golf event and prompted the Australian Football League (AFL) to postpone season-opening matches.
Golf officials called off the Ladies European Tour co-sanctioned WPGA Championship event on the Gold Coast amid forecasts for extreme wind and flooding.
“The decision has been made to ensure the safety of players, staff, fans and all stakeholders, which remains the priority,” organisers said in a statement on Tuesday.
Cyclone Alfred is expected to make landfall late on Thursday or early on Friday.
It could bring intense rainfall and life-threatening flash-flooding to the southeast of Queensland state and the northeast of New South Wales state, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest update.
The AFL, the top flight of Australian Rules football, has postponed two matches in southern Queensland, including Thursday’s season-opener in Brisbane between the reigning champion Brisbane Lions and Geelong Cats.
“Out of an abundance of caution … the AFL made the decision now to ensure the health and safety of clubs, players, officials and – importantly – the wider southeastern Queensland and northern NSW community remains the priority,” the AFL said in a statement.
The decision came after coaches urged the AFL to make an early call on the games.
“It sort of reminds me of the COVID situation,” Geelong coach Chris Scott told Australian media.
“It’s a bit unpalatable talking about when you prefer to play a game of footy when people are sandbagging their houses.”
Other professional sports may be impacted, including the National Rugby League match between the Dolphins and South Sydney Rabbitohs in Brisbane on Friday.
State soccer authority Football Queensland suspended all training and games in the state’s southeast on Wednesday.
Other sporting events were called off, including national championships of touch football in New South Wales.

Title: China to impose extra tariffs of 10%-15% on various US products
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:35:56 +0000
Content: China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh U.S. tariffs, announcing 10%-15% hikes to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products, and placing twenty-five U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions. 
LIU JINLU, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHER AT GUOYUAN FUTURES, BEIJING
“This news has raised concerns about tightening domestic agricultural supplies, benefiting the sector. China’s 10% tariff on U.S. soybeans will increase costs and reduce U.S. imports, leading China to boost imports from Brazil and other countries.
“However, South America, especially Brazil, is approaching its soybean export limit after years of growth (2024 exports are expected at 96 million tons). Currently in the harvest season, Brazilian soybeans have not yet arrived in large quantities at Chinese ports but are expected in Q2. With the additional U.S. tariffs, the already tight soybean stock will become even more strained.”
GENEVIEVE DONNELLON-MAY, RESEARCHER AT OXFORD GLOBAL SOCIETY, MELBOURNE
“While the new tariff announcement is not as heavy as the 25% in 2018, it does target many of the same agricultural products. In addition, the 10% tariff may provide Beijing with the opportunity to increase the tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods by another 10% or even 20% in the coming months and years.
“Soybeans were considered a weak link during the first Trump administration but Chinese policymakers have learned lessons from that time and are, in theory, much better prepared, due in part to Beijing’s food import diversification strategy.”
WANG ZHUO, PARTNER AT HEDGE FUND ZHUOZHU INVEST, SHANGHAI
Raising tariff on China “will likely hurt the U.S. itself as it needs cheap Chinese products to bring down inflation. Higher tariffs on U.S. agriculture products will also negatively impact China”, but countermeasures are politically necessary. “So, it would be wise to make some symbolic move without triggering an escalation in tensions.”
DENNIS VOZNESENSKI, ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH BANK, SYDNEY
“Chinese tariffs on U.S. wheat and corn imports should be supportive for demand for Australian wheat and barley exports. However, China’s recent slowdown in imports of feed grains from all origins should temper the excitement.”
WAN CHENGZHI, ANALYST, CAPITAL JINGDU FUTURES, DALIAN CITY
“Considering that China’s peak import period for U.S. soybeans has already passed, the impact of these countermeasures on the total volume of U.S. soybean imports is limited. Any price increases in the future are likely to be more of an emotional market response.”
OLE HOUE, DIRECTOR OF ADVISORY SERVICES, IKON COMMODITIES, SYDNEY
“It is broadly negative for U.S. agricultural markets. It is going to have a bearish influence on prices. There are enough corn and soybean supplies in the world for China to make the switch, it is more of an issue for the U.S., 30% of U.S. soybeans still go to China.”
EVEN PAY, AGRICULTURE ANALYST, TRIVIUM CHINA
“It’s notable that Beijing’s response is restrained. Trump has now imposed a total of 20% tariffs on all Chinese products. China’s tariffs impact a limited number of U.S. products, and remain below the 20% level. This is by design. China’s government is signalling that they do not want to escalate, they want to deescalate.
“It’s fair to say we’re in the early days of Trade War 2.0. There’s still time and space to avoid a protracted, entrenched trade war if Trump and Xi can strike a deal.”
ROSA WANG, ANALYST, SHANGHAI-BASED AGRO-CONSULTANCY JCI
“From the supply and demand perspective, the short-term impact on the domestic market won’t be significant. The reasons are: 1. It is currently the South American soybean season, while the U.S. soybean is in the off-season; 2. The amount of U.S. soybeans purchased by China has decreased, and the proportion of U.S. soybeans in China’s soybean imports has dropped to 17%.
“However, the large number of products involved this time will add further difficulties to China’s aquatic product exports to the U.S., especially tilapia exports. With the additional 10% tariff, the tariff on tilapia exports to the U.S. will reach 45%, making it basically impossible to export to the U.S.”

Title: India’s R&D spending doubles over the last decade, reaching Rs. 1.27 lakh crore: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:31:56 +0000
Content: India’s Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) has more than doubled over the past decade, rising from Rs. 60,196 crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 1.27 lakh crore, according to Union Minister Jitendra Singh. Speaking at the DISHA event at the India Habitat Centre on Monday, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology highlighted the significant growth in India’s R&D investments under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. He attributed this increase to the government’s commitment to fostering innovation in key sectors like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing.
“The future economy of India will be shaped by home-grown innovations in deep-tech areas such as AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing,” Singh said. He emphasised that government-backed initiatives have been instrumental in driving scientific advancements and positioning India as a global leader in technological innovation.
Singh also highlighted India’s evolving intellectual property (IP)-driven innovation ecosystem, which is supported by academia, industry, and startups. He credited the government’s push for research and development (R&D) as a key factor in this progress, stressing the importance of transitioning innovations from labs to industries in the pursuit of self-reliance, or ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat.’
Singh lauded the DISHA Program—an initiative aimed at Developing Innovations, Successful Harnessing, and Adoption—as a vital step toward creating a knowledge-based economy. The program supports faculty members and students working on disruptive technologies, ensuring India stays at the forefront of global innovation.
Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted that initiatives like DISHA support the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), which aims to bring together research across science, humanities, and social sciences. This combined effort will help Indian researchers work together across different fields, advancing discovery and application.
One of the key points in Singh’s address was the government’s policy shift to allow private sector participation in strategic fields like space technology and nuclear research. “What was once exclusively handled by government institutions is now open to private enterprises, leading to faster technological advancements, higher efficiency, and increased global competitiveness,” he said.
The minister highlighted the rise of innovation in India’s space sector, where startups are making significant contributions to satellite development, launch services, and space-based applications. He also pointed to the government’s recent decision to involve private companies in the nuclear energy sector, leveraging local expertise to enhance the country’s energy security and sustainability.
Addressing the impact of artificial intelligence in healthcare, Singh spoke about the success of AI-driven mobile telemedicine units in providing healthcare access to remote areas. “AI-powered diagnostics and telemedicine solutions are revolutionising patient care, making high-quality healthcare services more accessible and affordable,” he noted.
However, Singh underscored the importance of balancing AI with human expertise. “AI is here to complement human intelligence, not replace it. A hybrid approach will ensure that technology enhances the role of skilled professionals in critical fields such as healthcare,” he explained.
With India approaching its centenary of independence in 2047, Singh urged the next generation of innovators to lead the country’s technological progress. “The responsibility of building a technologically advanced India lies with our young innovators. What we invest in today will determine our standing in the global economy decades from now,” he said.

Title: India rolls out pilot projects for hydrogen-powered buses and trucks
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:26:44 +0000
Content: India has taken a significant step toward clean energy adoption with the launch of five pilot projects for hydrogen-fueled buses and trucks under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. The initiative aims to assess the viability of hydrogen as a transport fuel and pave the way for large-scale adoption.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) had earlier issued guidelines for implementing pilot projects in the transport sector, inviting proposals for hydrogen-based vehicles, refueling stations, and operational routes. After thorough evaluation, the ministry approved five pilot projects, comprising 37 vehicles—15 hydrogen fuel cell-based and 22 hydrogen internal combustion engine-based—along with nine hydrogen refueling stations.
These vehicles will operate on ten routes across the country, including Greater Noida–Delhi–Agra, Bhubaneshwar–Konark–Puri, Ahmedabad–Vadodara–Surat, among others. The projects have been awarded to leading industry players such as Tata Motors, Reliance Industries, NTPC, Ashok Leyland, HPCL, BPCL, and IOCL.
The central government has allocated ₹208 crore in financial support for these projects, which are expected to be commissioned within the next 18 to 24 months. The initiative aims to develop commercially viable hydrogen-powered transport solutions and establish the necessary infrastructure, including refueling stations.
The pilot projects will serve as a crucial testing ground to assess the safety, technical feasibility, and economic viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles under real-world conditions. The insights gained will help scale up hydrogen technology in India’s transport sector and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
The National Green Hydrogen Mission was launched on January 4, 2023, with an outlay of ₹19,744 crore until 2029-30. It aims to contribute to India’s goal of becoming ‘Aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) through clean energy and serve as an inspiration for the global clean energy transition.

Title: Smith confident as Australia prepares for spin challenge against unbeaten India
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 06:14:41 +0000
Content: Australian captain Steve Smith expressed quiet confidence ahead of his team’s high-stakes semifinal clash against India, acknowledging the challenge of facing an unbeaten opponent while emphasizing Australia’s readiness for the conditions at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
Despite an unusual tournament journey that included weather disruptions in Pakistan and a strategic early arrival in Dubai, Smith believes his team is well-prepared for today’s contest.
With spin expected to play a crucial role on Dubai’s dry surfaces, Smith identified middle-overs batting as the key battleground. “I think the game’s probably won and lost how we play this spin, particularly in the middle overs, the way we get through there,” he stated.
Australia’s own spin department has been depleted with the absence of Matt Short, but Smith pointed to several options at his disposal. “We’ve got Tanveer Sangha in our squad. We’ve got Maxwell, Travis Head can bowl, Marnus can bowl some overs, Cooper Connolly if we go down that path as well,” Smith explained, adding that Glenn Maxwell “is probably better than a part-timer.”
Despite missing several frontline bowlers, Smith has embraced the leadership challenge in this tournament. “It’s been fun captaining these boys the last couple of weeks. Obviously, our first objective was to make the semifinals. We’ve done that and now we’re coming up against a good Indian side,” he said.
Smith also highlighted the importance of opener Travis Head, who has been a consistent performer against India. “As we know, Travis has stood up in many big games in the past. He looked in great touch the other night against Afghanistan,” Smith said. “Hopefully he can get away in that power play and get us off to a nice start.”

Title: Egypt’s alternative to Trump’s ‘Gaza Riviera’ aims to sideline Hamas
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 05:21:54 +0000
Content: A plan for Gaza drawn up by Egypt as a counter to U.S. President Donald Trump’s ambition for a Middle East Riviera would sideline Hamas and replace it with interim bodies controlled by Arab, Muslim and Western states, Reuters reported on Monday.
The Egyptian vision for Gaza, which is due to be presented at an Arab League summit on Tuesday, does not specify whether the proposal would be implemented before or after any permanent peace deal to end the war triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.
Trump’s plan, which envisioned clearing Gaza of its Palestinian inhabitants, appeared to back away from long-standing U.S. Middle East policy focused on a two-state solution and sparked anger among Palestinians and Arab nations.
Who will run Gaza after the conflict remains the great unanswered question in negotiations over the future of the enclave. Hamas has so far rejected the idea of any proposal being imposed on Palestinians by other states.
Cairo’s plan does not tackle critical issues such as who will foot the bill for Gaza’s reconstruction or outline any specific details around how Gaza would be governed, nor how an armed group as powerful as Hamas would be pushed aside.
Under the Egyptian plan, a Governance Assistance Mission would replace the Hamas-run government in Gaza for an unspecified interim period and would be responsible for humanitarian aid and for kick-starting reconstruction of the enclave, which has been devastated by the war.
“There will be no major international funding for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza if Hamas remains the dominant and armed political element on the ground controlling local governance,” a preamble outlining the draft Egyptian plan’s objectives said.
Details of Egypt’s proposed framework for Gaza’s future have not been previously reported.
Egypt, Jordan and Gulf Arab states have for almost a month been scrambling to formulate a diplomatic offensive to counter Trump’s plan. A number of ideas have been proposed, with Egypt’s considered the frontrunner.
Reuters was unable to determine whether Arab leaders would support the plan presented by Egypt.
The plan does not specify who would run the governance mission. It said it would, “draw on the expertise of Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere to help Gaza recover as quickly as possible”.
The draft proposal was shared with Reuters by an official involved in Gaza negotiations who wished to remain anonymous because the draft has not yet been made public.
The plan firmly rejects the U.S. proposal for mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, which Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan see as a security threat.
“President Trump has been clear that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said when asked about Egypt’s Gaza plan and whether the U.S. would support it.
“While the President stands by his bold vision for a post-war Gaza, he welcomes input from our Arab partners in the region. It’s clear his proposals have driven the region to come to the table rather than allow this issue to devolve into further crisis,” Hughes said.
STABILISATION FORCE
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group knows of no such proposal by Egypt.
“The day after in Gaza must only be decided by the Palestinians,” he said. “Hamas rejects any attempt to impose projects or any form of non-Palestinian administration, or the presence of any foreign forces on the land of the Gaza Strip.”
The Egyptian draft does not mention future elections.
Egypt’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of Israel’s prime minister, whose support for any plan is seen as vital to secure a commitment that any future reconstruction will not be destroyed again.
Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has ruled the coastal enclave since 2007. It launched the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and started the Gaza war.
A January 19 ceasefire brought a temporary end to the fighting but the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday with no sign of an agreement to move to the second phase.
The Egyptian draft does not tackle the issue of what actions could be taken if Hamas refuses to disarm or step aside from politics.
The proposal envisions an International Stabilisation Force drawn primarily from Arab states that would take over the role of providing security from the militant group, with the eventual establishment of a new local police force.
Both security and governance bodies would be “arranged, guided and supervised” by a steering board. The draft said the board would comprise key Arab countries, members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the United States, Britain, the European Union and its member states, and others.
The plan does not detail a central governing role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which opinion polls show has little support among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
A Palestinian official told Reuters that, like the West Bank, Gaza falls under the PA’s jurisdiction – and it must be run by Palestinians.
“We agreed with the Egyptians on a committee made of Palestinian experts that will help the Palestinian Authority in running the Gaza Strip for six months. The committee is made of Palestinian experts and coordinates with the PA, and doesn’t answer to non-Palestinian bodies,” said the official, who asked not to be named for sensitivity.
RECONSTRUCTION BILL
Since Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza after a brief civil war in 2007, it has crushed all opposition there. Supported by Iran, it built an extensive security apparatus and military organization based around a vast network of tunnels – much of which Israel says it has now destroyed.
The plan does not say who would pay to rebuild Gaza, a bill estimated by the U.N. at more than $53 billion. Two sources have told Reuters that Gulf and Arab states would need to commit at least $20 billion in the initial phase of reconstruction.
Egypt’s proposal envisions that states on the steering board could establish a fund to support the interim governing body and arrange donor conferences to seek contributions for a longer-term reconstruction and development plan for Gaza.
The plan does not contain any specific financial pledges.
Oil- and gas-producing Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates could be vital sources of funding from the region.
The United Arab Emirates, for instance, sees Hamas and other militant groups as an existential threat and is unlikely to offer any funding until Hamas has been sidelined.
The foreign ministries in Qatar and the UAE and Saudi Arabia’s international media office did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Egypt’s plan, or to questions about their willingness to commit funds to rebuild Gaza.
The draft plan also calls on the steering board to coordinate with a Civil Society Advisory Board, consisting of academics, NGO leaders and other notable figures.

Title: Ukraine says it will do all it can to maintain US ties after Trump pauses aid
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 12:06:44 +0000
Content: Ukraine said on Tuesday it would do all it can to maintain its ties with the United States, after President Donald Trump paused military aid to Kyiv in the most dramatic step yet in his pivot towards closer ties with Russia.
Trump has upended U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia, culminating in an explosive confrontation at the White House on Friday, when Trump upbraided President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for being insufficiently grateful for Washington’s backing.
“President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” a U.S. official said on Monday.
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv still had the means to supply its frontline forces. U.S. military aid was precious and saving thousands of lives, he said, and Kyiv would do all it could to maintain relations with Washington.
“We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal told a press conference. “We only have one plan – to win and to survive. Either we win, or the plan B will be written by someone else.”
The Kremlin, for its part, said cutting off military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was still waiting to confirm Trump’s move.
Military experts say it could take time for the impact of missing U.S. aid to be felt on the battlefield. When U.S. assistance was held up for several months last year by Republicans in Congress, the most notable initial impact was shortages of air defences to shoot down incoming Russian missiles and drones. Later, Ukrainian forces in the east complained of shortages of ammunition, including for artillery.
The pause puts more pressure on European allies, led by Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week and have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up.
Europeans are racing to boost their own military spending and provide alternative support for Kyiv, including a plan to put troops on the ground to support any ceasefire, though they say they still need some form of U.S. support.
France condemned the aid freeze. Suspending arms to Ukraine made peace “more distant, because it only strengthens the hand of the aggressor on the ground, which is Russia,” said French junior minister for Europe, Benjamin Haddad.
Britain was more circumspect. A government spokesperson said London remained committed to securing peace in Ukraine.
Ukrainians, who have endured three years of war against a more powerful foe, were stunned by a move many described as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was “pushing us towards capitulation”.
“Yes, it is betrayal, let’s call it like it is,” said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47 in Kyiv. “But let’s hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to boost spending on defence in the EU, which she said could mobilise up to 800 billion euros ($840 billion). The EU is holding an emergency summit on Thursday.
‘KICKED THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR PUTIN’
Since Russia’s invasion three years ago, the U.S. Congress has approved $175 billion in total assistance for Ukraine, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The Trump administration inherited $3.85 billion worth of Congressionally approved authority to dip into U.S. arms stocks for Ukraine. Monday’s move also appeared to halt deliveries of military equipment approved by former President Joe Biden, including munitions, missiles and other systems.
Trump’s abrupt pivot towards Russia may be the most dramatic U.S. geopolitical shift in generations. Defending Europe from a hostile Kremlin has been the lodestar of U.S. foreign policy under both parties since the 1940s. Trump’s moves have appalled Democrats and some Republicans, although there has been little pushback from Republican leaders in Congress, including those who were once strong backers of Ukraine.
“By freezing military aid to Ukraine, President Trump has kicked the door wide open for Putin to escalate his violent aggression against innocent Ukrainians,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Trump suggested on Monday that a deal to open up Ukraine’s minerals to U.S. investment could still be agreed, and Shmyhal said Ukraine could still sign it. The deal was meant to be signed in Washington on Friday before Zelenskiy departed after the Oval Office bust-up.
When asked on Monday if the deal was dead, Trump said: “No, I don’t think so.”
In an interview on Fox News, Vice President JD Vance called on Zelenskiy to accept it.
“If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,” Vance said.
Zelenskiy has made clear that a ceasefire must carry explicit security guarantees from the West to ensure that Russia, which holds about 20% of Ukraine’s land, does not attack again. Trump has so far refused to give any such guarantees.

Title: UN appeals for funds to help contain Uganda Ebola outbreak
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 11:46:59 +0000
Content: The United Nations has launched an emergency appeal to raise $11.2 million to help fund Uganda’s response to an Ebola outbreak that has killed two people, after the country’s health budget was strained by U.S. cuts to foreign aid.
Uganda declared the outbreak of the highly infectious and often fatal haemorrhagic disease in January in the capital Kampala after the death of a male nurse at the East African country’s sole national referral hospital.
A second Ebola patient, a four-year-old child, died last week, the World Health Organization said, citing the country’s health ministry.
Uganda’s 10 confirmed cases have been linked to Ebola’s Sudan strain which does not have an approved vaccine.
In a statement sent out on Tuesday, the U.N. said the funds would cover the Ebola response from March to May in seven high-risk districts.
“The goal is to rapidly contain the outbreak and address its impact on public health as well as associated social-economic life of affected people,” said Kasonde Mwinga, Uganda representative for the World Health Organization (WHO), a U.N. agency.
Uganda has traditionally relied heavily on the U.S. for its health sector funding.
During the last Ebola outbreak in 2022-2023, the United States provided $34 million to fund case management, surveillance, diagnostics, laboratories, infection prevention and control among other activities, according to a U.S. Embassy report.
But President Donald Trump’s administration imposed an aid freeze and U.S. funding to Uganda’s health sector has been slashed, hitting the country’s public health budget, according to government officials.
Uganda’s Health Ministry spokesperson, Emmanuel Ainebyoona, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ebola symptoms include fever, headache and muscle pains. The virus is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue.

Content: India’s first-ever riverine dolphin estimation report has recorded 6,327 dolphins across 28 rivers in eight states. Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number, followed by Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the report during his visit to Gir National Park in Gujarat, where he chaired the 7th meeting of the National Board for Wildlife.
The dolphin population survey, conducted under Project Dolphin, spanned 8,500 kilometers across the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus river systems over two years.
In India, Ganges river dolphins inhabit the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system and its tributaries, while a small population of Indus river dolphins resides in the Indus River system.
During the meeting, PM Modi emphasized the importance of raising awareness about dolphin conservation by involving the local population and villagers in the affected areas. He also recommended organizing exposure visits for schoolchildren to dolphin habitats.
The survey, conducted from 2021 to 2023, was a joint effort by the Wildlife Institute of India, state forest departments of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan, and non-profit organizations including Aaranyak, World Wildlife Fund, Turtle Survival Alliance, and Wildlife Trust of India.

Title: South Africa, New Zealand seek limited-overs silverware in rare showdown
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:53:43 +0000
Content: South Africa will re-embark on an agonising quest for their first piece of ICC silverware since 1998 when they face New Zealand in Wednesday’s semi-final of the Champions Trophy in Lahore, the scene of a high-scoring tussle between the duo last month.
The pair have faced each other in the 50-over format just twice since 2019 – most recently in Lahore in a Tri-Series fixture on February 10.
South Africa batted first and posted 304 for six, but their inexperienced bowling line-up could not contain the New Zealanders, who won by six wickets with eight balls to spare.
South Africa will pack much more of a punch in the bowling department this time round, with fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen as well as wily spinner Keshav Maharaj in their attack.
“We know how strong South Africa are. They’ve got all bases covered in terms of batting, bowling and in the field. I’m sure it’ll be a fantastic game,” New Zealand batter Tom Latham said.
South Africa have reached the semi-finals or finals of ICC tournaments on 13 occasions across both limited-overs formats and only have the 1998 Champions Trophy title to show for it.
They made the semi-finals of the 50-over World Cup in 2023 but lost to Australia, and the final of last year’s T20 World Cup, where they lost to India despite seeming certain victors.
They will also play in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia at Lord’s in June.
This experience of reaching the knockouts of tournaments will hold them in good stead, according to all-rounder Jansen.
“I wouldn’t say the mindset changes, it’s just the occasion that’s probably a bit more hyped up,” Jansen said.
“You stick to your processes. It’s just having your steps or guides that you follow in every match, and then in the semi-finals, you try to execute them extraordinarily well.”
New Zealand’s record is not dissimilar. Their only ICC limited-overs tournament win came in the 2000 Champions Trophy, and there have also been several near misses down the years.
South Africa have called up spinning all-rounder George Linde as cover for Aiden Markram, who hurt his hamstring in the seven wicket win over England in their final pool game.
Linde arrives in Lahore on Tuesday night, so is highly unlikely to feature on Wednesday. His selection as a travelling reserve may be more looking ahead to a possible final against India on a slower track in Dubai on Sunday.

Title: Sensex, Nifty slip amid global trade concerns; Nifty holds 22,000 mark
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:42:45 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed flat on Tuesday, as investor sentiment took a hit following the implementation of US trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The impact of Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods further added to the cautious mood, leading to marginal declines in benchmark indices.
The Sensex ended the day at 72,989.93, slipping 96 points (0.13%), after fluctuating between 73,033.18 and 72,633.54 during the session. Meanwhile, the Nifty settled at 22,082.65, losing 36.65 points (0.17%), after touching an intraday high of 22,105.05 and a low of 21,964.60.
Despite the overall subdued sentiment, broader markets remained mixed. The Nifty Smallcap100 index rose by 0.69%, while the Nifty Midcap100 managed a slight 0.05% gain, indicating selective buying in smaller stocks.
Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 28 closed lower, with Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Tech, and Eicher Motors witnessing declines of up to 4.95%. On the flip side, 22 stocks gained, led by Adani Enterprises, State Bank of India (SBI), BPCL, Bharat Electronics, and Shriram Finance, which climbed by up to 3.03%.
Sector-wise, market movements were mixed. PSU Bank, Bank Nifty, financial services, consumer durables, media, metal, oil & gas, and realty indices saw gains of up to 2.37%. However, Nifty Auto, IT, Pharma, and FMCG sectors declined, with losses extending up to 1.31%. The Nifty Private Bank index also saw a minor dip of 0.08%.
Analysts attributed the recent weakness in small and midcap stocks to profit booking after a strong rally, coupled with global market uncertainties.
“The recent decline in small and midcap stocks reflects profit booking following a strong rally, compounded by global market uncertainties,” said Abhishek Jaiswal, Fund Manager at Finavenue. He emphasized that while short-term volatility is expected, India’s strong economic growth and ongoing structural reforms continue to support midcap companies with solid fundamentals.
Jaiswal advised investors to focus on businesses with strong balance sheets and sustainable earnings growth rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations.

Title: Rajnath Singh inaugurates DRDO-MHA conference, highlights emerging security challenges
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:36:26 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday inaugurated the DRDO-MHA Collaboration Conference-cum-Exhibition in the national capital, emphasizing the evolving nature of security threats and the need for adaptive policies.
Speaking at the Seminar on Advanced Technologies for Internal Security, Singh underscored the interconnectedness of internal and external security, stating that both are “two sides of the same coin.” He stressed the importance of understanding emerging challenges to shape effective security strategies.
“As far as internal security is concerned, we are facing threats like terrorism, separatist movements, left-wing extremism, communal tensions, trans-border illegal immigration, and organized crimes,” Singh said. “Externally, we have our own set of challenges.”
The Defence Minister noted that traditional security threats were primarily conventional, but modern challenges include hybrid warfare, cyber threats, and space-based vulnerabilities. “Earlier, these threats were only conventional, but in recent times, we are also seeing unconventional threats in large numbers,” he added.
Dr. Samir V Kamat, Secretary, DRDO, highlighted the significance of joint discussions between security agencies and technology developers. “This conference is crucial as it allows users and developers to openly discuss requirements and challenges,” Kamat said, adding that DRDO is working on both weapon systems and countermeasures to neutralize emerging threats.

Title: Afghanistan border clashes ease, thousands seek shelter
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:34:16 +0000
Content: Overnight clashes between Pakistani and Afghan security forces at the main border crossing between the countries caused thousands of people to flee their homes but the situation had calmed down by Tuesday morning, residents and officials said.
The conflict started on Monday, the first working day of Ramadan, when food imports from Pakistan usually peak in Afghanistan.
Around 15,000 local residents fled to Landi Kotal due to the clashes, an official said. Afghan border guards had opened fire without warning, targeting government buildings and civilians, and causing widespread panic.
“The tensions between the two countries and continuous closure of the border has been causing multiple problems to the people of the border area. People are very poor and dependent on their businesses related to the border,” Ali Shinwari, who lives in the border town, told Reuters.
Relatives and tribesmen in a nearby town have been hosting dozens of relatives since the border closure, he added.
The Torkham crossing has been shut since February 21 due to a dispute over the construction of a border-area outpost by Afghanistan, Pakistani officials said on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
The Taliban-run Afghan Interior Ministry said on Monday one Taliban fighter was killed and two injured, while Pakistani security officials reported that members of their forces had also been wounded.
The Torkham crossing is the main transit artery for travellers and goods between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan. Trade between the countries was worth over $1.6 billion in 2024, according to Pakistan’s foreign office.
The closure has stranded 5,000 trucks filled with essential goods and caused at least $15 million in losses, said Yousaf Afridi, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries for Pakistan’s Khyber district where the Torkham crossing is located.

Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 17:26:59 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, attended the official send-off ceremony for the 49-member Indian team set to compete in the Special Olympics World Winter Games. This marks the largest-ever Indian contingent for the prestigious event, which will be held in Turin, Italy, from March 7 to 17.
The Indian team comprises 30 athletes, three officials, and 16 support staff, including coaches. The athletes will compete in six disciplines—Alpine Skiing, Cross-Country Skiing, Floorball, Short Track Speed Skating, Snowboarding, and Snowshoeing.
Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of promoting inclusive sports, the Union Sports Ministry has placed a strong emphasis on supporting specially-abled athletes. As part of this initiative, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) organized 11 national coaching camps across multiple cities, including Chandigarh, Narkanda, New Delhi, Gwalior, Noida, and Gurugram, to prepare the athletes for the global event.
Additionally, SAI provided essential equipment for training and competition, while the Sports Ministry sanctioned funds to cover airfare, boarding, and lodging for the Indian contingent.
Turin 2025 is expected to bring together approximately 1,500 athletes from 100 nations, competing across eight winter sports—Alpine Skiing, Cross-Country Skiing, DanceSport, Figure Skating, Floorball, Short Track Speed Skating, Snowboarding, and Snowshoeing. The event will be supported by around 1,000 coaches and officials, with an estimated 2,000 volunteers ensuring its smooth execution.
In a significant step towards gender equity at the Special Olympics, 45.61% of athletes and Unified Partners—playing partners without intellectual disabilities—are female, a notable rise from 32% at the 2017 World Winter Games in Austria.

Title: Amit Shah to visit Tamil Nadu in two days: State BJP chief Annamalai
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:54:36 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah is set to visit Tamil Nadu in the next two days, state BJP president K Annamalai announced on Tuesday, hinting at potential political shifts in the state.
“Union Home Minister Amit Shah will visit Tamil Nadu in two days. A lot of changes may take place,” Annamalai said.
The visit comes at a time when tensions are escalating between the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government and the BJP-led Centre over the three-language policy and the contentious delimitation process.
Last month, during a BJP event in Coimbatore, Shah assured that southern states would not be negatively impacted by the delimitation exercise. However, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has called for an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss the issue, expressing concerns that seat redistribution based on population could reduce the number of Lok Sabha seats allocated to southern states.
In response, the BJP has decided to boycott the meeting, accusing Stalin of spreading “imaginary fears” and misrepresenting the delimitation process.
Speaking in Chennai, Annamalai criticized the all-party meeting, calling it “pointless” and without a clear agenda.
“Even when you attend a wedding, you know who is getting married. But here, the Tamil Nadu CM has called an all-party meeting based on imaginary fears. He is not addressing real issues affecting common people,” Annamalai said.
He reiterated that neither the Centre nor Amit Shah has linked delimitation to population size, dismissing Stalin’s claim that Tamil Nadu could lose 12 Lok Sabha seats.
“Amit Shah has clearly stated that delimitation will be done on a pro-rata basis, not based on population like the Congress model. Despite these clarifications, the Tamil Nadu CM continues to mislead people. Why should we waste our time attending such a meeting?” Annamalai added.

Title: Syrian forces search former Assad stronghold after suspected loyalist attacks
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:10:13 +0000
Content: Syrian security forces searched for suspects in the city of Latakia on Tuesday, residents said, after two defence ministry members were killed in an attack blamed by state media on remnants of Bashar al-Assad’s ousted government.
The coastal region of Latakia area has emerged as one of the main security challenges for Syria’s Islamist-led government as it works to consolidate control after seizing power in Damascus in December.
Assad drew support from among the region’s Alawite minority, to which his family belongs.
The Syrian state news agency SANA, citing a security source, reported that two members of the defence ministry had been killed in the Datour area of Latakia by “groups of Assad militia remnants”, and that security forces had mounted a campaign to arrest them.
Bursts of gunfire were heard through the night as government security forces deployed in the Datour district of Latakia.
A senior security official in the area told Reuters there had been an increase in hit-and-run attacks on security patrols and checkpoints in several towns in Latakia province over the last two weeks, blamed on former army personnel in hiding.
One Datour resident told Reuters there had been heavy gunfire in the early hours and that security forces in numerous of vehicles had surrounded the neighbourhood, before the situation calmed down in the morning.
“They have plenty of challenges, this is one of the big ones, not necessarily because there’s an insurgency – it seems marginal – but because it will drain resources if they have to keep running around these villages tamping down unrest,” said Aron Lund of the Century International think tank.
The senior security source blamed attacks in the Latakia region on a proliferation of arms in the hands of former security and army personnel who had refused to enter into reconciliation agreements with the new authorities.
The source said that Alawite elders have in some cases cooperated with security forces to hand over former personnel suspected of committing crimes during the Assad era, keen to stave off crack downs and potential civil unrest.
Last week, a police station was attacked during confrontations in Assad’s ancestral town of Qardaha, located in the mountains some 25 km (16 miles) to the east of Latakia.
Qardaha residents and activists said that the incident began when members of security forces tried to enter a house without permission, sparking opposition from residents. One person was killed by gunfire, with locals accusing the security forces of the shooting, two residents and Alawite activists said.
A statement issued at the time by the Latakia security chief made no mention of the shooting. It accused groups whom it said opposed the imposition of security of trying to prevent security forces from setting up a check point and attacking the police station.
Community sheikhs and notables from Qardaha issued a videoed statement after the incident accusing “strangers” of trying to “exploit gaps between the people of Qardaha and the authorities with the aim of disrupting” security.
They declared support for any step taken by the authorities with their agreement to preserve security and lives.

Title: Maharashtra Governor accepts Dhananjay Munde’s resignation
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:59:03 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Governor CP Radhakrishnan on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Dhananjay Munde, the Minister of Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, following Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s recommendation.
Munde, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA, submitted his resignation earlier in the day, citing health concerns as a key reason. His resignation was swiftly accepted by Fadnavis and forwarded to the Governor for approval.
In a post on X, Munde said that his health had deteriorated in recent days, prompting doctors to advise medical treatment. However, he also alluded to the ongoing controversy surrounding the brutal murder of Santosh Deshmukh in Beed district, expressing deep distress over recent developments in the case.
“My firm demand from the very first day has been that the accused in the brutal murder of late Santosh Deshmukh should receive the harshest possible punishment. Seeing the photos that emerged yesterday has deeply pained my heart,” he wrote. He further emphasized that a chargesheet had been filed and a judicial inquiry proposed, but given his health concerns, he had chosen to step down.
However, Maharashtra Minister Sanjay Shirsat hinted that Munde’s resignation might not solely be due to health reasons. “There could be other factors behind his decision. But action has been taken in the Beed incident—the accused has been arrested, and a chargesheet has been filed. As far as I know, Dhananjay Munde’s name is not in the chargesheet,” Shirsat said.
Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray also cast doubt on the resignation’s reasoning. “Munde cites health issues, but Ajit Pawar claims it was a moral decision. What is the real reason?” he questioned.
Meanwhile, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis confirmed the resignation, saying, “Dhananjay Munde has tendered his resignation today. I have accepted it and forwarded it to the Governor for further action.” Sources suggest that Fadnavis had personally urged Munde to step down.
Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray went further, arguing that Munde’s resignation was insufficient and calling for the dismissal of the entire Fadnavis-led government. “Mere resignation is not enough. This government should be dismissed. Over the past few years, law and order in Maharashtra have collapsed. If no action is taken, who would want to invest in Maharashtra? Neither women nor men are safe in this state,” he said.
Munde’s resignation comes in the wake of allegations surrounding his close aide, Walmik Karad, who was sent to judicial custody in January in connection with a ₹2 crore extortion case linked to the murder of Beed district sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.

Title: PM-SYM: Govt’s pension scheme for unorganised workers ensuring social security
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 14:18:54 +0000
Content: The Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM) is a pension scheme launched by the Government of India to provide financial security to workers in the unorganised sector. Recognizing their immense contribution to nearly 50% of the country’s GDP, this voluntary and contributory scheme guarantees a minimum monthly pension of ₹3,000 after the age of 60 to workers earning up to ₹15,000 per month.
Unorganised workers form the backbone of India’s economy, including home-based workers, street vendors, mid-day meal workers, domestic workers, construction laborers, agricultural laborers, beedi workers, handloom workers, rag pickers, cobblers, and many others engaged in similar occupations.
As per the e-Shram portal, over 30.51 crore such workers were registered as of December 31, 2024. The scheme is designed to benefit those who are not covered under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), or National Pension Scheme (NPS). Income taxpayers and individuals receiving benefits from any other government pension scheme are also not eligible for PM-SYM.
Launched in the Interim Budget of 2019, PM-SYM is administered by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in collaboration with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and Common Service Centres (CSC SPV). LIC functions as the Pension Fund Manager and is responsible for the pension disbursement. Enrolment is facilitated through CSCs and the Maandhan portal, ensuring accessibility for workers across the country.
One of the key features of PM-SYM is the government’s contribution, which matches the worker’s contribution on a 1:1 basis. The contribution amount depends on the worker’s age at the time of enrolment.
For instance, an 18-year-old worker contributes ₹55 per month, which the government matches with an equal amount. A 40-year-old worker contributes ₹200 per month, with the government making an equal contribution. Upon reaching 60 years of age, the worker starts receiving a fixed pension of ₹3,000 per month for life. In case of the subscriber’s death, the spouse receives 50% of the pension amount as a family pension.
The enrolment process for PM-SYM is simple. Eligible workers can visit a Common Service Centre with their Aadhaar card and a savings bank account. After biometric authentication, they need to make the first contribution in cash and opt for an auto-debit facility for future contributions. Upon successful enrolment, a PM-SYM card is issued. Workers can also register online through the Maandhan portal.
To enhance the scheme’s implementation and outreach, the government has taken several steps, including periodic review meetings with States and Union Territories, regular interactions with state CSC heads, and the introduction of new features such as Voluntary Exit, Revival Module, Claim Status, and Account Statement.
The account revival period has been extended from one year to three years, allowing greater flexibility for workers facing financial difficulties. Additionally, the integration of PM-SYM with the e-Shram portal and SMS campaigns has been initiated to raise awareness.
Given the uncertain employment conditions of unorganised workers, the scheme offers flexible exit provisions. If a subscriber exits before completing 10 years, the contributed amount is refunded with savings bank interest. If they exit after 10 years but before reaching 60, they receive their contribution along with accrued interest.
In case of death before 60 years, the spouse can either continue the scheme or withdraw the contribution with interest. If both the subscriber and spouse pass away, the entire corpus is credited back to the fund. To accommodate those who miss contributions, provisions have been made for regularizing payments with outstanding dues and penalty charges as decided by the government.

Title: Ukraine says it will do all it can to maintain US ties after Trump pauses aid
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 12:06:44 +0000
Content: Ukraine said on Tuesday it would do all it can to maintain its ties with the United States, after President Donald Trump paused military aid to Kyiv in the most dramatic step yet in his pivot towards closer ties with Russia.
Trump has upended U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia, culminating in an explosive confrontation at the White House on Friday, when Trump upbraided President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for being insufficiently grateful for Washington’s backing.
“President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” a U.S. official said on Monday.
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv still had the means to supply its frontline forces. U.S. military aid was precious and saving thousands of lives, he said, and Kyiv would do all it could to maintain relations with Washington.
“We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal told a press conference. “We only have one plan – to win and to survive. Either we win, or the plan B will be written by someone else.”
The Kremlin, for its part, said cutting off military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was still waiting to confirm Trump’s move.
Military experts say it could take time for the impact of missing U.S. aid to be felt on the battlefield. When U.S. assistance was held up for several months last year by Republicans in Congress, the most notable initial impact was shortages of air defences to shoot down incoming Russian missiles and drones. Later, Ukrainian forces in the east complained of shortages of ammunition, including for artillery.
The pause puts more pressure on European allies, led by Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week and have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up.
Europeans are racing to boost their own military spending and provide alternative support for Kyiv, including a plan to put troops on the ground to support any ceasefire, though they say they still need some form of U.S. support.
France condemned the aid freeze. Suspending arms to Ukraine made peace “more distant, because it only strengthens the hand of the aggressor on the ground, which is Russia,” said French junior minister for Europe, Benjamin Haddad.
Britain was more circumspect. A government spokesperson said London remained committed to securing peace in Ukraine.
Ukrainians, who have endured three years of war against a more powerful foe, were stunned by a move many described as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was “pushing us towards capitulation”.
“Yes, it is betrayal, let’s call it like it is,” said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47 in Kyiv. “But let’s hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to boost spending on defence in the EU, which she said could mobilise up to 800 billion euros ($840 billion). The EU is holding an emergency summit on Thursday.
‘KICKED THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR PUTIN’
Since Russia’s invasion three years ago, the U.S. Congress has approved $175 billion in total assistance for Ukraine, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The Trump administration inherited $3.85 billion worth of Congressionally approved authority to dip into U.S. arms stocks for Ukraine. Monday’s move also appeared to halt deliveries of military equipment approved by former President Joe Biden, including munitions, missiles and other systems.
Trump’s abrupt pivot towards Russia may be the most dramatic U.S. geopolitical shift in generations. Defending Europe from a hostile Kremlin has been the lodestar of U.S. foreign policy under both parties since the 1940s. Trump’s moves have appalled Democrats and some Republicans, although there has been little pushback from Republican leaders in Congress, including those who were once strong backers of Ukraine.
“By freezing military aid to Ukraine, President Trump has kicked the door wide open for Putin to escalate his violent aggression against innocent Ukrainians,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Trump suggested on Monday that a deal to open up Ukraine’s minerals to U.S. investment could still be agreed, and Shmyhal said Ukraine could still sign it. The deal was meant to be signed in Washington on Friday before Zelenskiy departed after the Oval Office bust-up.
When asked on Monday if the deal was dead, Trump said: “No, I don’t think so.”
In an interview on Fox News, Vice President JD Vance called on Zelenskiy to accept it.
“If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,” Vance said.
Zelenskiy has made clear that a ceasefire must carry explicit security guarantees from the West to ensure that Russia, which holds about 20% of Ukraine’s land, does not attack again. Trump has so far refused to give any such guarantees.

Title: PM Modi to visit Uttarakhand on Thursday
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:29:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Uttarakhand on March 6, where he will take part in religious rituals and flag off key tourism initiatives. His visit comes as part of the state’s Winter Tourism Programme, which aims to promote religious tourism and boost the local economy.
According to the official itinerary, the Prime Minister will begin his visit by offering prayers at the temple in Mukhwa, which is regarded as the winter abode of Goddess Ganga since the main shrine in Gangotri becomes inaccessible during the harsh winter months.
Following the religious ceremony, at around 10:40 AM, PM Modi will flag off a trek and bike rally in Harsil, a scenic Himalayan town known for its spiritual and natural beauty. He will also address a public gathering in Harsil, where he is expected to highlight the government’s efforts to strengthen tourism and local livelihoods in Uttarakhand.
The Winter Tourism Programme, launched by the Uttarakhand government this year, has already drawn thousands of devotees to the winter seats of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. The initiative aims to promote year-round pilgrimage tourism, benefiting local businesses, homestays, and tourism-related enterprises.

Title: Suicide bombing at Pakistan military site kills 12
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:27:11 +0000
Content: A pair of suicide bombers drove two vehicles filled with explosives into a security installation in northwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, killing at least 12 civilians, among them six children, police and rescue services said.
The blast brought down the roof of a nearby mosque soon after residents had broken their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in a market teeming with shoppers, a military official said on condition of anonymity.
Security forces foiled the militants’ bid to enter the military facility after the blast, the official said, adding that six of them were killed in an exchange of fire.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Recent years have seen growing attacks by the Pakistani Taliban known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Islamist militant group on police and military in areas near the Afghan border.
Twelve people were killed and 30 wounded in Tuesday’s attack, said Muhammad Nauman, a spokesperson for a nearby hospital, all of them civilians caught under collapsed buildings and walls.
The tally of children killed was revised down to six on Wednesday from seven in a hospital list the previous day, Nauman added.
Rescue services said they were searching for more casualties under the debris of collapsed buildings, as video images from the scene showed people sifting piles of bricks and clearing metal scaffolding.
“The evil ambitions of the enemies of Pakistan will never be allowed to succeed,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement condemning the attack.
Ali Amin Gandapur, the chief minister of the border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the blast happened, condemned the incident.

Title: Trudeau dismisses ‘very dumb’ tariffs, says Trump wants to ruin Canadian economy
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:00:59 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday that his tariffs on Canadian imports were “a very dumb thing to do” and said Ottawa was striking back immediately at its closest ally.
Trudeau, who is stepping down at the end of the week, also accused Trump of wanting to ruin the Canadian economy.
Speaking hours after Trump launched a trade war against Mexico and Canada, Trudeau announced immediate 25% tariffs on C$30 billion worth of U.S. imports. If need be, Canada will target another C$125 billion worth in 21 days’ time, he said.
“There is absolutely no justification or need whatsoever for these tariffs,” Trudeau told reporters, adding that Canada would challenge the U.S. measures at the World Trade Organization and through a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement already in place.
“Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake,” he said.
Trump responded by saying the Canadian retaliatory tariffs would be met with immediate reciprocal tariffs of the same size.
Trump has accused Canada of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the deadly fentanyl opioid and its precursor chemicals into the U.S., an argument Trudeau called “completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false.”
Trudeau’s relations with Trump, which have never been warm, deteriorated in recent months after the president repeatedly talked of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state and mockingly referred to Trudeau as its “governor” rather than prime minister.
Trump says he is unhappy with the trilateral U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal that he signed in his first term. Trudeau played down the idea of opening talks ahead of a review scheduled for 2026.
“Given that he is choosing to want to ruin the Canadian economy, I don’t know whether to bring forward negotiations, given the situation of such bad faith that we’re in,” said Trudeau, who warned Canadians that tough times were coming.
Economists say Canada, which sends 75% of all exports to the United States, will plunge into a recession unless the tariffs are lifted quickly.
Trudeau said Americans would suffer as well, given how tightly the two economies are connected, and he referred to a Wall Street Journal editorial in late January that said Trump would be launching “the dumbest trade war in history” if he went ahead with tariffs.
“It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do,” said Trudeau, who will step down as prime minister after the ruling Liberal Party chooses a new leader on Sunday.
The Canadian government will help by expanding employment insurance benefits and giving direct support to businesses, he said.
Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the country’s premiers in a virtual meeting later in the day that he will soon announce an initial package of support to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Canadian workers, families and businesses, Trudeau’s office said in a readout of the meeting.
Trudeau and the premiers also discussed ways to reduce internal trade barriers and labour mobility within Canada, according to the readout.
ALCOHOL OFF SHELVES
Trump’s unprecedented actions threaten to severely damage relations between the three trading partners.
Trudeau said Canada would also look at non-tariff measures but did not answer directly when asked whether Ottawa might curb exports of crude oil or potash.
“Our focus has to be on getting these tariffs lifted as quickly as possible,” he said.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was forged under Trump during his first term in the White House and which updated the North American Free Trade Agreement, allows for duty-free trade between the three countries. The pact carries provisions for rules of origin for autos and auto parts and steel-intensive products, among others, and also allows for exceptions related to security.
Canada’s two most populous provinces, Quebec and Ontario, are taking U.S. alcohol off the shelves of provincially run liquor stores.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford said if U.S. tariffs persisted, the province would also impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota.
“We need to make sure America feels the pain,” he said.
Tensions are so high that Canadian sports fans have begun booing U.S. teams at ice hockey games.
“We’re going to choose to try to buy Canadian products and forgo bourbon and other classic American products. And yeah, we’re probably going to keep booing the American anthem,” Trudeau said.
“But let me tell Americans, we’re not booing you, we’re not booing your teams, we’re not booing your players. We’re booing a policy that is designed to hurt us. And we’re insulted and we’re angry … we’re going to fight and we’re going to win.”

Title: PM Modi pays tribute to Biju Patnaik on his 109th birth anniversary
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 06:59:12 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday paid homage to Bijayananda Patnaik, the former Chief Minister of Odisha, fondly remembered as Biju Babu, on his 109th birth anniversary. Recognizing his legacy, the Prime Minister lauded Biju Patnaik’s contributions to Odisha’s development and his unwavering commitment to democracy.
In a post on X,  PM Modi said, “Remembering Biju Babu on his birth anniversary. We fondly recall his contribution towards Odisha’s development and empowering people. He was also staunchly committed to democratic ideals, strongly opposing the Emergency.”
Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi also paid tribute, acknowledging Patnaik’s pivotal role in shaping the state’s progress. “Humble tributes to the former Chief Minister of Odisha, the legendary Biju Patnaik, on his birth anniversary. His efforts in empowering people and shaping the state’s development remain an inspiration. He will always be remembered as a great politician, freedom fighter, and nationalist leader,” Majhi wrote on X.
The Chief Minister further honored the leader by garlanding his statue on the Assembly premises. Speaking to reporters, Majhi described Biju Patnaik as a visionary leader whose policies transformed Odisha. “From increasing the number of districts from 13 to 30 for better administration to formulating the state’s industrial policy and developing Paradip Port, his contributions are immense. The new government will work towards realizing his vision for Odisha’s growth, and we will celebrate his birth anniversary with full enthusiasm,” he stated.
Leader of Opposition Naveen Patnaik, Biju Patnaik’s son, also paid his respects, recalling his father’s efforts in strengthening the Panchayati Raj system and championing women’s empowerment. “I pay my tributes to the great leader, former Chief Minister, and legendary Biju Patnaik. His bravery and contributions in making Odisha a leading state continue to inspire us. We remain committed to safeguarding the interests and self-esteem of the people of Odisha,” Naveen Patnaik wrote on X.
For the past three decades, March 5 has been observed as Panchayati Raj Diwas in recognition of Biju Patnaik’s pioneering role in strengthening the system in Odisha. However, the BJP-led Odisha government recently decided to shift the observance of Panchayati Raj Diwas from March 5 to April 24, a move that has sparked political controversy. Adding to the dispute, the state government has also scrapped the official holiday on Biju Patnaik’s birth anniversary, drawing sharp reactions from opposition leaders and supporters of the late leader’s legacy.
As Odisha remembers one of its most celebrated leaders, tributes continue to pour in from across the political spectrum, reflecting Biju Patnaik’s enduring impact on the state and the nation.

In a post on X, PM Modi expressed his best wishes, saying, “Heartiest birthday wishes to Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji, a hardworking leader of BJP and my colleague in the government. He is playing an important role in the development of villages along with the welfare of the country’s agriculture and farmer brothers and sisters.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended his wishes, acknowledging Chouhan’s dedication to farmers’ welfare. He wrote on X, “Heartiest birthday wishes to my colleague in the Union Cabinet, @ChouhanShivrajji. Under the leadership of Modi ji, you are making a commendable contribution towards the welfare of farmers. I pray to Baba Mahakal for your healthy, long, and happy life.”
Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav also joined in celebrating Chouhan’s birthday. Om Birla, in his message, wished him a healthy, long, and prosperous life, while CM Yadav called him a respected leader and prayed for his well-being and continued success.
Expressing gratitude for the overwhelming wishes, Shivraj Singh Chouhan thanked everyone for their heartfelt messages and support.
Before taking on his current role in the Union Cabinet, Chouhan held the distinction of being the longest-serving Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, leading the state for nearly 16 years since 2005.
His deep connection with the people earned him immense popularity, making him one of the most influential Chief Ministers in the state’s history. His government also launched the ‘Ladli Behan Yojana’, a welfare scheme aimed at empowering women, which played a crucial role in the BJP’s electoral success in the 2023 Assembly elections.
As a dedicated leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Chouhan has held key positions, including serving as the party’s general secretary and the president of the Madhya Pradesh unit. His association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) dates back to his teenage years, having joined the organization at just 13 years old.
A seasoned politician, Chouhan has been elected to Parliament five times, representing Vidisha in the Lok Sabha since 1991, before assuming the role of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister in 2005.

Title: Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari and Pralhad Joshi flag off hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck trials
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 05:55:55 +0000
Content: In a significant move toward India’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari and Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday launched the trial run of the country’s first fleet of hydrogen-powered trucks, developed by Tata Motors. This milestone represents a major advancement in India’s green energy transition, particularly in the transportation sector.
Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, underscored hydrogen’s transformative potential in reducing emissions and boosting India’s energy self-reliance. He praised Tata Motors for leading the initiative, stating, “Hydrogen is the fuel of the future, accelerating the shift to sustainable heavy-duty trucking and driving us towards a low-carbon future.”
Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, hailed the initiative as a key component of the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), emphasizing its importance in achieving energy independence and reducing carbon emissions. “This trial is a crucial step in demonstrating the role of green hydrogen in decarbonizing our transport sector,” he said.
The trials, which will span 24 months, will test 16 hydrogen-powered trucks equipped with Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines (H2-ICE) and Fuel Cells (H2-FCEV) on major freight routes, including Mumbai, Pune, Delhi-NCR, and Surat. The aim is to assess the commercial viability of hydrogen-powered long-distance transportation. The fleet will be supported by hydrogen refuelling stations established by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL).
Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pioneering clean mobility solutions. He expressed gratitude to the Indian government, saying, “We are proud to lead the transition to zero-emission long-haul transportation.”
Minister Joshi also highlighted India’s leadership in the global green energy transition under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The National Green Hydrogen Mission, with an allocation of Rs.19,744 crore, positions India as a key player in hydrogen production, storage, and application. He noted significant progress, including the award of 4,12,000 TPA of Green Hydrogen production and 3 GW of electrolyser manufacturing capacity annually. Additionally, seven pilot projects have been launched across various sectors, along with the publication of 88 standards for safety and scalability.
Looking ahead, India’s 2030 targets include producing 5 million metric tons of Green Hydrogen annually, installing 60-100 GW of electrolyser capacity, and adding 125 GW of renewable energy dedicated to hydrogen production. These efforts are expected to cut 50 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually, save Rs.1 lakh crore in imports, and attract Rs.8 lakh crore in investments.

Title: Trump says Ukraine willing to negotiate, Russia ‘ready for peace’
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 05:42:24 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he received a letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the Ukrainian leader expressed willingness to come to the negotiating table over the Russia-Ukraine war.
“Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,” Trump said in an address to Congress on Tuesday while quoting from the letter.
Trump also said he had been in “serious discussions with Russia” and had “received strong signals that they are ready for peace”.
“Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” he said. “It’s time to stop this madness. It’s time to halt the killing. It’s time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars you have to talk to both sides.”
Trump was expected to further outline his plans for Ukraine and Russia in the speech to Congress, but did not reveal any further details on how he plans to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two.
Trump said Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing for Ukraine’s defense.
Four sources told Reuters that the Trump administration and Ukraine plan to sign the deal in return for military aid, which Trump has paused. But later on Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, “There is no signing planned,” according to a post on X by a Fox reporter.
Trump gave no further details on the minerals deal, leaving its fate unclear.
Early on Tuesday, Zelenskiy pledged to repair relations with the U.S. after what he described as a “regrettable” Oval Office clash with Trump last week.
Zelenskiy said he wanted to “make things right” and was ready “any time and in any convenient format” to sign the minerals deal, which he left on the table during a visit to Washington after the Oval Office argument with Trump.
His statement came a day after Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, his latest move to upend U.S. policy and adopt a more conciliatory stance toward Russia.
“My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” Zelenskiy said in his statement on X. The statement made no mention of the pause in U.S. military supplies.
Zelenskiy’s statement was clearly aimed at stressing Kyiv’s gratitude following the explosive confrontation at the White House, at which Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded Zelenskiy as insufficiently appreciative.
“We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,” Zelenskiy wrote. “Our meeting in Washington … did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right.”
Zelenskiy outlined a path towards a peace agreement, which he said could begin with a release of prisoners and a halt to air and sea attacks, if Russia did the same.
“Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal.”
GEOPOLITICAL SHIFT
Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine’s forces could hold their own on the battlefield against Russian troops, but that Kyiv would do everything possible to continue cooperating with the U.S.
“We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal said. “We only have one plan – to win and to survive.”
In Moscow, the Kremlin said cutting off U.S. military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was waiting to confirm Trump’s move.
U.S. Democrats have raised an outcry over Trump’s abrupt pivot towards Russia, the most dramatic geopolitical shift in generations for Washington, where governments under both parties since the 1940s have prioritized defending Europe from a hostile Moscow.

PRESSURE ON EUROPE
The pause in U.S. military aid puts more pressure on European allies who have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up. Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week, have offered troops to help guard a potential ceasefire.
On Tuesday, Germany’s conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals to set up a 500 billion euro ($531 billion) fund to help ramp up defence spending.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to mobilise up to 800 billion euros for EU defence spending. The 27-nation bloc holds an emergency summit on Thursday.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said the president had spoken with both the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders and welcomed Zelenskiy’s will to re-engage with Trump.
But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was sharply critical of Trump’s move to pause military supplies.
“Suspending aid during a war to a country under attack means abandoning the country under attack and accepting or hoping that the aggressor will win,” he said during a parliamentary debate.
Ukrainians were stunned and many described Washington’s move as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was “pushing us towards capitulation”.
“Yes, it is betrayal, let’s call it like it is,” said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47, in Kyiv. “But let’s hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.”

Title: India’s circular economy poised to generate $2 trillion and 10 million jobs by 2050: Bhupendra Yadav
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 05:34:40 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Tuesday said that India’s circular economy could generate a market value exceeding $2 trillion and create nearly 10 million jobs by 2050.
Speaking at the 12th Regional 3R and Circular Economy Forum in Asia and the Pacific, Yadav emphasized that the transition to a circular economy represents one of the most profound shifts in business since the Industrial Revolution nearly 250 years ago.
“The circular economy challenges the traditional ‘take, make, waste’ model, opening doors to a sustainable system that could contribute an additional $4.5 trillion to the global economy by 2030,” Yadav said.
During the forum, he also announced India’s candidacy to host the World Circular Economy Forum in 2026, expressing the country’s commitment to leading global efforts in sustainability. The 2025 edition of the forum is set to take place in São Paulo, Brazil, and India has formally expressed its willingness to host the event the following year.
Yadav reaffirmed India’s commitment to tackling plastic waste and its environmental consequences, citing the Plastic Waste Management Rules (2016) as a crucial framework. “We have taken decisive steps, including the 2022 ban on single-use plastics, and through initiatives like the Mission LiFE, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) has introduced Eco-Mark Rules to promote energy efficiency and environmentally friendly products,” he said.
One of the major highlights was the launch of the SBM Waste to Wealth PMS Portal, a digital platform developed under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) to enhance project monitoring, data management, and resource sharing.
The session marked the release of the IFC Document Reference Guide: Business Models and Economic Assistance for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Projects. The guide provides detailed insights into waste-to-electricity, biomethanation, and bioremediation, offering valuable resources for municipalities and private enterprises looking to implement effective waste management projects.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) to bolster scientific collaboration in waste management.
The forum also saw the unveiling of ‘India’s Circular Sutra: A Compendium of Best Practices in 3R & Circular Economy,’ which compiles successful case studies and innovative approaches in the Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (3R) framework. The compendium aims to serve as a guiding document for urban local bodies and stakeholders committed to advancing circular economy principles.
The Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW) presented its latest study on solid waste management in cities with populations exceeding one million, offering strategic insights into decentralized waste solutions, circular economy implementation, and sustainable waste management practices.

Title: China will work to firmly advance ‘reunification’ with Taiwan, premier says
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 05:22:26 +0000
Content: Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday China would “firmly advance” the push for “reunification” with Taiwan while opposing external interference, and strive to work with regular Taiwanese to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, despite the objection of the government in Taipei, and has ramped up its military pressure against the island in recent years, including holding several rounds of major war games.
“We will firmly advance the cause of China’s reunification and work with our fellow Chinese in Taiwan to realise the glorious cause of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Li wrote in his annual work report to China’s parliament.
In his work report last year, Li reiterated a call for “reunification” with Taiwan, but added emphasis that it wants to “be firm” in doing so and dropped the descriptor “peaceful”, which had been used in previous reports.
Beijing has consistently pushed for reunification with Taiwan, and again said it would “resolutely oppose” separatist activities pushing for Taiwan independence. But its appeal to work with “fellow Chinese in Taiwan” to help rejuvenate the Chinese nation wasn’t mentioned in the work report last year.
Taiwan President Lai Ching-te says only Taiwan’s people can decide their future. He has repeatedly offered talks with China, which has rebuffed him, saying he is a “separatist”.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
Amid geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. and as President Donald Trump ratchets up pressure on Beijing including through tariffs, China said it opposed “external interference” on the Taiwan issue. It said it was committed to a foreign policy of peace to “oppose hegemonism and power politics, oppose unilateralism and protectionism in all forms.”
Taiwan’s top China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council was not immediately available to comment.
A senior Taiwan official familiar with the government’s China policy said Beijing’s tone on Taiwan hadn’t changed much, signalling Taiwan wasn’t at the top of its political agenda which had prioritised the economy and relations with the U.S.
“They want to reiterate their agenda of the ‘big exchange across the strait’,” the official said, pointing out the paragraph on Taiwanese people as a sign of possible ramping up of China’s tactics to bolster Beijing’s reach abroad including co-opting Taiwanese through various exchanges including culture and religion.
“But they only allow cross-strait exchanges that serve their political agenda and block those who don’t. It’s obvious that those exchanges are just political means.”
March marks the 20th anniversary of China’s “anti-secession” law, which gives Beijing the legal authority to use force on Taiwan if it secedes or if the “possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted”, but the law is vague and does not give details.

Title: Participation of Indian women in workforce rises from 23% to 42% in six years
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:17:38 +0000
Content: The labour force participation rate for women in India has risen from 23% in 2017-18 to around 42% in 2023-24, with a notable increase in educated women joining the workforce, Union Labour and Employment Secretary Sumita Dawra said on Wednesday.
In her address at the Women in Services Sector CII Dialogue 2025, Dawra highlighted the significant strides made by women in India’s economic landscape, finding employment across various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
She reiterated the government’s commitment to achieving the goal set in the Union Budget 2025-26, aiming for 70% of women to participate in economic activities by 2047, aligning with the vision of a developed India.
Dawra emphasised the importance of mentorship programmes to prepare women for leadership roles and the need to create safe, inclusive workplaces. She underscored the potential of sectors like STEM, entrepreneurship, and startups for further women’s involvement.
Maharani Shailja Katoch, of the royal family of Kangra-Lambagraon (Himachal Pradesh), emphasised the importance of women in society, calling them the backbone of change, nurturing communities while balancing multiple responsibilities. On education, she expressed confidence in India’s progressive policies, stating that women with determination can achieve success.
She cited examples of girls from Himachal Pradesh excelling in diverse fields, including civil services and corporate roles. Regarding cultural preservation in the digital age, she stressed the need to make heritage appealing to younger generations by integrating modern elements like audiovisual storytelling, social media, and contemporary product adaptations.
CII Task Force on Art & Culture Advisor Tarana Sawhney elaborated on the pivotal role of women in shaping India’s cultural landscape. She highlighted that historically, women have been the unseen architects of India’s cultural fabric—storytellers, artisans, performers, designers, and curators—whose contributions are now gaining long-overdue recognition. Notable figures such as Amrita Sher-Gil, whose works continue to achieve record sales, and contemporary artists like Mrinalini Mukherjee, Zarina Hashmi, and Nalini Malani have made significant international impacts, with exhibitions at prestigious venues, including the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the National Gallery in London.
Within the commercial sphere, women lead top contemporary art galleries in India, actively participate in global institutions, and mentor emerging artists. Despite these advancements, challenges such as unequal pay, limited institutional support, and sociocultural biases persist. She advocated equipping women with technological tools and resources to further their artistic and entrepreneurial endeavours, envisioning a future where gender is an afterthought and equal opportunity is a reality.
Fashion designer Rina Dhaka emphasised the pivotal role women play in the fashion industry, contributing significantly across design, production, retail, and entrepreneurship.
She advocated the establishment of skill-building initiatives and training programmes for female tailors, machine operators, and CAD designers to enhance employment opportunities and promote fair compensation. She urged collaboration between the government and industry to provide mentorship, tailored policies, and financial support, especially for small-scale, women-led businesses.
She observed the significant evolution of India’s fashion industry, which has grown from a handful of designers to thousands of successful businesses, expanding its presence to small towns as well.

Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:49:01 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the revision of the Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme (LHDCP) with a total outlay of ₹3,880 crore.
The scheme consists of two components: the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) and Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC). Additionally, a new component, Pashu Aushadhi, has been introduced.
“LH&DC has three sub-components: the Critical Animal Disease Control Programme (CADCP), the Establishment and Strengthening of existing Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries – Mobile Veterinary Unit (ESVHD-MVU), and Assistance to States for Control of Animal Diseases (ASCAD). The Pashu Aushadhi is a new component added to the LHDCP scheme,” according to a Cabinet communiqué.
“The total outlay of the scheme is ₹3,880 crore for two years, 2024-25 and 2025-26, which includes a provision of ₹75 crore to provide good quality and affordable generic veterinary medicine and incentives for the sale of medicines under the Pashu Aushadhi component,” it added.
The scheme aims to boost livestock productivity, which is adversely impacted by diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), classical swine fever (CSF), and lumpy skin disease, among others.
“The implementation of the LHDCP will help reduce these losses by preventing diseases through immunization,” said the Cabinet.
The scheme also supports doorstep delivery of livestock healthcare through mobile veterinary units (ESVHD-MVU). Additionally, it will improve the availability of generic veterinary medicine under Pashu Aushadhi through a network of PM-Kisan Samriddhi Kendras and Cooperative Societies.
It will help prevent and control livestock diseases through vaccination, surveillance, and the upgradation of healthcare facilities, the Cabinet said.
The initiative is also expected to enhance productivity, generate employment, encourage entrepreneurship in rural areas, and prevent economic losses for farmers due to the disease burden.

Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 10:59:32 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets staged a strong recovery on Wednesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty closing over 1% higher. The rebound came after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated the possibility of tariff relief for Mexico and Canada, sparking optimism among investors that broader trade restrictions could be reconsidered.
The 30-share Sensex surged 740.30 points, or 1.01%, to settle at 73,730.23, after touching an intra-day high of 73,933.80. Meanwhile, the Nifty broke its ten-day losing streak, climbing 254.65 points, or 1.15%, to close at 22,337.30. Earlier in the session, Nifty fluctuated between 22,394.90 and 22,067.80, recovering from the 877-point decline it had suffered over the past ten trading days.
The rally was driven by strong buying in auto, power, and technology stocks, as market sentiment turned optimistic following the latest developments on trade policy. Analysts pointed to a bullish technical setup, with Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. noting that Nifty had formed a bullish belt hold candlestick pattern, signaling strength in the market. He suggested that as long as the index holds above the 21,800 support level, further gains toward the 22,300-22,500 range could be possible.
Investor confidence remained robust, with 46 out of the 50 Nifty stocks ending in positive territory. Among the top gainers were Adani Ports, Tata Steel, Adani Enterprises, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Power Grid Corporation, which saw gains of up to 5.15%.

He highlighted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had entered a bullish crossover, suggesting further upside potential. In the near term, Nifty is expected to maintain its positive trend, with a possible move towards 22,700 or higher, while support remains firm at the 22,000-22,100 levels.

Title: Cabinet approves Rs. 2,730 crore ropeway project to Hemkund Sahib
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 10:41:46 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday approved the construction of a 12.4 km ropeway connecting Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib, a revered pilgrimage site at an altitude of 15,000 feet in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district.
The project, to be developed under the Design, Build, Finance, Operate, and Transfer (DBFOT) model, is estimated to cost Rs. 2,730.13 crore.
Hemkund Sahib, a Gurudwara dedicated to the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, is open for about five months each year, from May to September, drawing between 1.5 and 2 lakh pilgrims annually.
Currently, reaching Hemkund Sahib involves a strenuous 21-km uphill trek from Govindghat, which pilgrims typically navigate on foot or using ponies and palanquins. The new ropeway will significantly ease this journey, providing all-weather last-mile connectivity for devotees and tourists visiting Hemkund Sahib and the nearby Valley of Flowers.

Title: Long-term use of anti-inflammatory pills may lower dementia risk: study
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 10:39:45 +0000
Content: A study published on Wednesday suggests that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications may reduce the risk of developing dementia.
Previous research has suggested that inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of dementia. NSAID medications, due to their anti-inflammatory effects, may help protect against dementia, which affects more than 55 million people worldwide.
“Our study provides evidence on possible preventive effects of anti-inflammatory medication against the dementia process,” said M. Arfan Ikram of Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
The researchers focused their study on 11,745 adults with an average follow-up of 14.5 years. Of these, 9,520 participants had used NSAIDs at any given time, and 2,091 developed dementia.
The results, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, showed that long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12 percent reduced risk of developing dementia.
Short- and intermediate-term use did not show protective effects. Additionally, a higher cumulative dose of NSAIDs was not linked to a reduced dementia risk, the team said.
The findings suggest that prolonged, rather than intensive, use of anti-inflammatory medications may help protect against dementia.
“There is a need for more studies to further consolidate this evidence and possibly develop preventive strategies,” Ikram said.
A recent study published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions analyzed health data from over 130 million individuals and found that antibiotics, antivirals, vaccinations, and anti-inflammatory medications were associated with a reduced risk of dementia.
This finding supports the hypothesis that common dementias may be triggered by viral or bacterial infections.
According to data from the World Health Organization, nearly 10 million new cases of dementia occur every year. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally.
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60-70 percent of cases.

Title: India imposes import restrictions on platinum alloys to curb misuse of trade agreements
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 10:06:59 +0000
Content: India has imposed restrictions on the import of platinum alloys with less than 99% purity, aiming to curb potential misuse of trade agreements and prevent unfair trade practices.
According to a notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), platinum in unwrought and powder form, along with other categories, has been reclassified from “free” to “restricted” for imports. However, platinum alloys with 99% or higher purity remain exempt from these restrictions.
The decision comes amid allegations that platinum alloys were being blended with gold to exploit a tariff differential of 2 percentage points, allowing traders to gain undue advantages. The move is also seen as an effort to plug loopholes in concessional duty imports from the UAE under the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).
During the Joint Committee (JC) meeting under CEPA in October, India flagged concerns over a surge in imports of silver products, platinum alloys, and dry dates from the UAE, urging verification of compliance with rules of origin norms to prevent circumvention. The UAE had acknowledged the concerns and agreed to review the matter.

Title: US cuts off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:07:55 +0000
Content: The U.S. has cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, said CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday, in a move that could seriously hamper the Ukrainian military’s ability to target Russian forces.
The decision to cut off intelligence-sharing and military aid to Ukraine starkly illustrates the Trump administration’s willingness to play hardball with an ally to force it to the negotiating table.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he received a letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the Ukrainian leader expressed willingness to come to the negotiating table over the Russia-Ukraine war.
“I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause (that prompted Ukraine’s president to respond) I think will go away,” Ratcliffe told Fox Business Network.
“I think we’ll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have to push back on the aggression that’s there, but to put the world in a better place for these peace negotiations to move forward,” he said.
Three sources familiar with the situation also confirmed that U.S. intelligence-sharing had stopped. It was not immediately clear to what extent the U.S. had cut back on the sharing.
One of the sources said that intelligence-sharing had only “partially” been cut, but was unable to provide more detail.
Since the start of the war in 2022, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting purposes.
U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told reporters Wednesday morning that the U.S. “had taken a step back” and that the administration was “reviewing all aspects” of its intelligence relationship with Ukraine.
Waltz also said that the U.S. was actively engaged in talks with Ukraine about moving negotiations forward on a minerals deal and a potential peace deal with Russia.
“I think we’re going to see movement in very short order,” he said.

Title: Poonch boosts dairy sector with inauguration of automatic milk collection units
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:12:38 +0000
Content: In a significant move to advance Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of doubling farmers’ incomes, District Development Deputy Commissioner of Poonch, Vikas Kundal, inaugurated two Automatic Milk Collection Units (AMCU) on Wednesday.
The units, established under the Dairy Development Initiative, aim to boost the dairy sector in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.
The inauguration took place in Tehsil Haveli, with one unit at the Khanetar Dairy Cooperative Society, Kanuiyan Poonch, and the other at the Sai Baba Self-Help Group, Bandi Chechian Poonch. The ceremony was attended by Sheikh Mohammad Younis, Chief Animal Husbandry Officer, Poonch, and Vikas Kundal, who cut the ribbon to mark the occasion.
Vikas Kundal highlighted the importance of the initiative, praising local dairy farmers and self-help groups for their dedication. He emphasized that the establishment of these units was a major step toward realizing the Prime Minister’s goal of increasing farmers’ income and improving milk production, thereby uplifting rural livelihoods.
He further said that milk, being perishable, requires proper storage and quality maintenance.
“We have provided equipment and fertilizers to ensure the quality of the milk is preserved. Our aim is to store milk for longer periods, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s dream of doubling farmers’ income,” he said.
Haji Barf Din, the head of the unit, expressed his gratitude for the introduction of these facilities in Poonch, a remote and border area. He explained that the automatic collection system would ensure that milk and its products remain safe for up to 48 hours.
“I want to express my gratitude to PM Modi. We’ve been waiting for this for a long time. However, we are facing one issue — we don’t have the necessary licenses and dealerships. If we are granted these, we could bring cattle from Haryana. With these resources, we can improve our situation and work towards eradicating poverty,” he concluded.

Title: PMAY brings smiles to Samastipur as beneficiaries receive keys to their new homes
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:08:30 +0000
Content: A wave of happiness swept across Samastipur as 35,114 beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) received the first installment of funds to build their homes, marking a significant milestone in Bihar’s housing program.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar distributed the first installment and handed over keys to 4,509 beneficiaries, bringing their dreams of homeownership to life. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which aims to provide housing for the homeless, has made significant progress in Samastipur. On Wednesday, through a video conference, Chief Minister Kumar transferred the first installment of ₹40,000 each to the bank accounts of 35,114 beneficiaries from various blocks of the district, officially kickstarting the construction of their new homes.
This installment is part of a larger initiative, with a total of ₹94.68 crore allocated for housing construction under PMAY in Samastipur.
The funds were distributed to beneficiaries in a simple yet meaningful ceremony at the Collectorate, symbolizing the first step toward building a brighter future for these families.
District Deputy Development Commissioner (DDC) Sandeep Shekhar Priyadarshi stated that Samastipur’s target for the 2024-25 financial year is to construct 44,477 houses, with 38,286 homes already approved in two phases. Of these, 26,206 homes were approved in the second phase, and the first installment has been successfully disbursed to 23,517 beneficiaries.
Samastipur now holds the distinction of having the highest number of beneficiaries in the state. Additionally, 4,509 homes have already been completed, and their keys were distributed to their rightful owners.
Among them, five beneficiaries from the Samastipur block were invited to the Collectorate to receive the keys to their new homes after completing physical verification.
Expressing their joy and gratitude upon receiving the keys, beneficiaries shared their experiences.
Kumari Anju, a beneficiary, said: “Earlier, we didn’t have a house. My husband runs a handcart, and with the money from the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, we’ve built a home. Now, I’m holding the keys to our own house.”
Another beneficiary, Vibha Devi, added: “My husband is a laborer, and we had no money to build a house. Thanks to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, we now have a roof over our heads. Our family will now live happily under this roof for the rest of our lives.”
Launched on June 25, 2015, the PMAY is part of the government’s ambitious mission to provide housing for all in urban areas. The initiative offers central assistance to states and Union Territories to build homes for eligible families, with a target of constructing 1.12 crore houses. While the minimum size for a house under PMAY is set at 30 square meters, states have the flexibility to enhance this based on local needs.

Title: Vishwas Bill 2.0 to decriminalise over 100 provisions, simplify business processes: FM Sitharaman
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:12:31 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday that the government is committed to encouraging global economic partnerships, leveraging technology to strengthen traditional sectors, and significantly enhancing India’s export potential.
Addressing a post-budget webinar on the theme Regulatory, Investment, and Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Reforms, she said the government will now introduce the Vishwas Bill 2.0 to decriminalise more than 100 provisions in various laws. This will further simplify processes for businesses, the minister stated.
The Finance Minister emphasised that the government remains committed to ensuring the timely implementation of all budget announcements for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
Highlighting the focus on capital expenditure (capex), Sitharaman stated that the path to reforms is complemented by the government’s unwavering commitment to capex as a driver of economic growth. For 2025-26, the total effective capex is proposed at Rs 15.48 lakh crore, which constitutes 4.3 per cent of the GDP. Out of this, Rs 11.21 lakh crore has been allocated as core capital expenditure by the Centre, amounting to 3.1 per cent of GDP. This unprecedented investment in infrastructure development is already creating jobs, strengthening industries, and laying the foundation for private sector participation in India’s growth story.
The Finance Minister also highlighted that budget announcements for 2024-25, such as the hike in the MUDRA loan limit from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh and the new MSME Credit Assessment Model, have already been implemented. As many as 11 public sector banks have extended the revised limit to existing customers, while seven banks have made it available to new customers as well. Additionally, 21 new SIDBI branches have been opened in MSME clusters for 2024-25, aligning with the budget announcement.
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has also implemented a pilot project for the PM Internship Scheme, which was announced in the 2024-25 budget. The scheme aims to create over 1.25 lakh internship opportunities in top companies, with over 6 lakh applicants already registered. The government remains steadfast in reducing regulatory burdens and enhancing trust-based governance to improve ease of doing business.
Sitharaman underscored that the decriminalisation of business-related laws reduces legal risks, allowing industries to operate with greater confidence. She stated that a robust manufacturing sector, free from unnecessary regulatory bottlenecks, will attract both domestic and foreign investments, drive economic growth, and position India as a trusted global player. Since 2014, the government has removed over 42,000 compliance requirements and decriminalised more than 3,700 legal provisions. Under the Jan Vishwas Act 2023, over 180 legal provisions were decriminalised.
During a thematic session of the post-budget webinar, M. Nagaraju, Secretary, Department of Financial Services, stated that under the MUDRA Scheme, Rs 33 lakh crore in loans has been sanctioned. Under the Stand-Up India initiative, Rs 59,000 crore has been disbursed to 2.62 lakh accounts. Additionally, under the PM SVANidhi scheme, Rs 14,000 crore has been sanctioned across 99 lakh accounts.
The Finance Minister noted that Wednesday’s webinar brought together stakeholders from ministries such as the Ministry of Finance, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, along with regulators, state governments, public sector banks, insurance companies, SIDBI, NABARD, and industry associations to ensure smooth policy implementation.
She appreciated the valuable inputs received during the discussions and assured that they would be examined carefully. These insights, she added, will help refine strategies, address potential implementation challenges, and ensure that budgetary announcements translate efficiently into tangible actions.

Title: India boosts R&D with ₹20,000 Cr investment, ranks 3rd in global startups
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:06:43 +0000
Content: Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted India’s rapid progress in research and innovation, announcing a ₹20,000 crore allocation for R&D in Budget 2025-26. Speaking at the Post-Budget Webinar on “Investing in Innovation,” he emphasized India’s emergence as a global leader in science and technology.
Dr. Singh said that India now ranks 3rd globally in startups and scientific research, with the country’s position in the Global Innovation Index improving from 81st to 39th over the past decade. He also pointed to a 17-fold surge in patent grants, underscoring the government’s focus on deep-tech and sunrise sectors.
The ₹20,000 crore investment builds on last year’s ₹1 lakh crore corpus aimed at accelerating private-sector R&D, particularly in fields like semiconductor manufacturing, AI, 5G, and quantum computing. The government is also tripling Prime Minister’s Research Fellowships (PMRF) to support 10,000 young researchers over the next five years.
In the agricultural sector, India is set to establish a National Enlarged Gene Bank Replica, enhancing crop security. The country’s existing National Gene Bank is the world’s second-largest, safeguarding over 4.7 lakh germplasm accessions.
Dr. Singh also announced the launch of the Gyan Bharatam Mission, a large-scale initiative to digitize over one crore ancient manuscripts, ensuring their preservation and accessibility.
“These steps align with our vision for ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’—investing in innovation today will empower young minds and cement India’s global leadership in science and technology,” he said.

Title: SAIL and Indian steel stocks surge as China announces plans to reduce output
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:48:23 +0000
Content: Shares of Indian steel companies surged on Wednesday following China’s announcement to restructure its steel industry and reduce total production. This move is anticipated to curb the dumping of cheap steel into the Indian market, providing a significant boost to domestic steelmakers.
Steel Authority of India (SAIL) shares jumped 4.43% or Rs 4.77, closing at Rs 112.43 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) during intra-day trading.
Tata Steel, one of the largest players in the industry, saw its stock rise by 4.55% or Rs 6.34 to settle at Rs 145.68, marking a solid recovery from its 52-week low of Rs 122.62 reached in January.
Jindal Stainless Steel also experienced gains, with shares rising 3.45% or Rs 20.5 to finish the session at Rs 615.45, bouncing back from its 52-week low of Rs 568.05 recorded in February 2025.
Welspun Corporation surged over 7% to close at Rs 758 per share on March 5, a significant climb from its 52-week low of Rs 440, hit last June.
APL Apollo Tubes shares rose over 3%, while JSW Steel gained more than 2%.
This rise in steel stock prices helped propel the Nifty Metal Index by over 4%, reaching 8,685.20, with Tata Steel driving much of the rally.
The surge in Indian steel stocks comes when domestic companies have been advocating for policies to protect them from the impact of cheap steel imports, especially from China.
In February, Tata Steel CEO TV Narendran mentioned that the Indian government is working on addressing concerns from steel manufacturers regarding these imports, with some positive outcomes expected soon.
The rally in steel stocks coincides with a broader market recovery, with both Sensex and Nifty bouncing back after weeks of selloffs, signaling renewed market optimism.

Title: India’s high net-worth population set to reach 93,753 in the next 3 Years: report
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:31:39 +0000
Content: The number of India’s high net-worth individuals (HNWIs), with assets exceeding $10 million, is expected to increase by 9.4 percent from an estimated 85,698 in 2024 to 93,753 by 2028, reflecting the country’s expanding wealth landscape, according to Knight Frank’s The Wealth Report 2025 released on Wednesday.
In 2024, the number of Indian HNWIs increased by 6 percent year-on-year to 85,698 from 80,686 in 2023. India is home to 3.7 percent of wealthy individuals globally and currently stands in the 4th position after the US (905,413 HNWIs), China (471,634 HNWIs), and Japan (122,119 HNWIs).
The country’s billionaire population has also seen a strong year-on-year growth of 12 percent in 2024 over the previous year. India is now home to 191 billionaires of which 26 joined the ranks in just the last year which was pegged at just 7 in 2019. The combined wealth of Indian billionaires is estimated at US$ 950 billion, ranking the country third globally, behind the US (US$5.7 trillion) and Mainland China ($1.34 trillion), according to the report.
The number of HNWIs globally rose by 4.4 percent year-on-year in 2024 to 2,341,378 from 2,243,300 a year earlier. While North America leads in HNWI numbers this year, growth was recorded across all world regions. Asia saw the second-highest increase at 5 percent, followed by Africa at 4.7 percent, Australasia at 3.9 percent, the Middle East at 2.7 percent, Latin America at 1.5 percent, and Europe at 1.4 percent YoY growth. At the $10+ million level, the US is home to almost 39 percent of all wealthy individuals globally, nearly twice the level of China.
The report notes that the billionaire landscape is now more global, with new hubs emerging outside the traditional powerhouses. Manufacturing has produced more new billionaires than tech over the past 10 years. Half are in China, reflecting the nation’s industrial strength. Despite recent challenges, China also leads in the creation of new tech billionaires over the same period. The age gap between new billionaires and the overall list has widened from two years in 2014 to six today, peaking at nine years in 2020 amid an IPO boom. Tomorrow’s billionaires may skew younger. Similarly, in 2024, over 82 percent of new billionaires were male, down from 90 percent four years ago. Of the billionaires under 30, nearly 47 percent were female last year, potentially pointing the way to a more balanced future.
Knight Frank India Chairman & Managing Director Shishir Baijal said: “India’s growing wealth underscores its economic resilience and long-term growth potential. The country is witnessing an unprecedented rise in high-net-worth individuals, driven by entrepreneurial dynamism, global integration, and emerging industries.”
Knight Frank’s global head of research Liam Bailey said: “While the global economy slowed through 2024, the resilience of the US helped prop up investor confidence. The trends powering wealth creation, including growth in financial markets led by equity markets and the bitcoin run, continued through 2024. And despite geopolitical tensions, resilient global trade further contributed to growth.”

Title: No season should be off-season for Uttarakhand, says PM Modi
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 07:14:06 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday stressed the need for year-round tourism in Uttarakhand, stating that “no season should be off-season” for the region.
Speaking at a public gathering in Harsil, he highlighted the economic benefits of sustained tourism and expressed his government’s commitment to strengthening the state’s economy through tourism development.
At the outset, the Prime Minister extended his condolences to the families affected by the recent tragic incident in Mana. He acknowledged the resilience and support of the people, stating that their unity had provided immense strength to those grieving their losses.
During his visit to Mukhwa, the winter abode of Goddess Ganga, PM Modi spoke about Uttarakhand’s deep spiritual significance. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to visit the sacred site, describing it as a place filled with divine energy. Reflecting on his personal connection with the state, he attributed his journey of public service to the blessings of Maa Ganga.
He recalled how he had been given the chance to serve Uttarakhand and later Kashi, believing it was through the goddess’s guidance. He further described his visit to Mukhwa as a homecoming, as he has always felt that Maa Ganga had adopted him.
The Prime Minister also reminisced about his bond with the people of Uttarakhand, especially the women who affectionately send him local produce.
“I fondly remember my ‘didi-bhulis’ (sisters) from here. They keep sending me the famous red grams of Harsil and other local products. I am truly grateful for your love,” he added.
He also highlighted the importance of winter tourism in Uttarakhand, emphasizing the need to break away from the seasonal nature of tourism, which peaks from March to June. He pointed out that after the monsoon, the number of visitors drops, leading to economic challenges. He stressed the necessity of keeping tourism active throughout the year, ensuring a steady flow of visitors and economic opportunities.
Speaking about the state’s potential, PM Modi described winter as a particularly special time to experience Uttarakhand. He spoke about the adventure activities the region offers, such as trekking and skiing, and how many pilgrimage sites hold unique rituals during the colder months. He also highlighted the cultural richness of village life, where age-old religious ceremonies continue to thrive.
He said that while much of the country is covered in fog during winter, Uttarakhand enjoys bright sunlight. He suggested branding winter tourism in Garhwali as “Gham taapo pariyatan,” meaning sun-bathe tourism, to attract visitors seeking a unique seasonal experience.
Praising the Uttarakhand government’s vision for year-round tourism, he said this initiative would provide travelers with diverse experiences while boosting local businesses. He pointed to the rapid infrastructure development in the state over the past decade, including the Char Dham All-Weather Road, modern expressways, expanded railway networks, air travel facilities, and helicopter services.
PM Modi also highlighted the Kedarnath and Hemkund ropeway projects, which will make religious travel more accessible, especially for elderly pilgrims, women, and children.

Title: PM Modi highlights investment in people as key to India’s development
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 06:47:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Post-Budget Webinar on employment, focusing on the theme “Investing in People, Economy, and Innovation,” on Wednesday. The event brought together officials from 29 ministries, 100 panelists, and over 25,000 participants to discuss key aspects of the Union Budget 2025-26.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said the budget serves as a blueprint for India’s future, giving equal priority to investing in people, the economy, and innovation alongside infrastructure and industry. He stressed the need to enhance investment in capacity-building and talent development, calling on stakeholders to contribute, as these efforts are essential for both economic progress and organizational success.
PM Modi outlined three pillars for investment in people—education, skill development, and healthcare. He announced that the budget includes 10,000 additional medical seats, with a target of adding 75,000 seats over the next five years. He also spoke about expanding telemedicine services to all Primary Health Centres and establishing Day Care Cancer Centres (DCCCs) to improve access to healthcare.
Discussing India’s potential in medical tourism, he mentioned the “Heal in India” initiative, which is attracting international patients. He encouraged stakeholders in the healthcare sector to invest in wellness tourism, particularly in areas like yoga and traditional medicine, to position India as a global hub for healthcare services.
Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda also addressed the webinar, emphasizing the government’s focus on a holistic healthcare approach. He announced that the government will establish DCCCs in all district hospitals over the next three years, with 200 planned for this year. These centres aim to make cancer treatment more accessible by offering services closer to patients’ homes. He highlighted the expansion of healthcare infrastructure, including Ayushman Aarogya Mandirs and voluntary health screenings for conditions such as cancer, hypertension, and diabetes.
Nadda said that the number of medical colleges has increased from 387 in 2014 to 780 today. He also pointed out the rise in undergraduate and postgraduate medical seats, with a 130% and 135% increase, respectively. He discussed faculty development and training, proposing measures like pooling faculty among medical institutions and hiring retired teachers to address staffing challenges.
NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr. V.K. Paul highlighted that India has seen a 102% rise in medical colleges over the past decade, with government institutions now outnumbering private ones. He spoke about initiatives aimed at integrating district hospitals with medical education to provide hands-on experience for postgraduate medical students.
Dr. Paul also discussed efforts to address the growing burden of cancer. He outlined a nationwide screening initiative that has reached millions of people for early detection of oral, breast, and cervical cancer. He said the government is working on expanding DCCCs, with a goal to have one in every district. He added that the Ayushman Bharat scheme has significantly improved access to cancer treatment, with a 90% rise in patients receiving care within 30 days of diagnosis.
Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava spoke about the need for better coordination between central and state governments in implementing cancer care programs. She highlighted the challenge of overcrowding in tertiary hospitals, noting that nearly half of all cancer patients seek treatment at these facilities. The government aims to decentralize cancer treatment by strengthening district-level care, improving referral systems, and training healthcare workers in chemotherapy administration.
A breakout session on cancer care was held during the webinar, focusing on the expansion of DCCCs. Experts discussed the need for standardized treatment protocols, efficient drug supply chains, and training programs for medical staff. Officials from Tamil Nadu and Odisha shared their experiences in developing decentralized cancer care models, which have improved early diagnosis and treatment while reducing patient migration to larger cities.

Title: South Korea air force jets accidentally drop bombs on homes, injuring 15
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 06:42:05 +0000
Content: Fifteen people were injured in South Korea on Thursday after bombs dropped by fighter jets landed in a civilian district, damaging houses and a church during military exercises in Pocheon, the Air Force and the fire department said.
The Gyeonggi-do Bukbu Fire Services said in a statement that 15 people were wounded, out of which two were seriously hurt.
Pocheon is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northeast of Seoul, near the heavily militarised border with North Korea.
South Korea’s Air Force said eight 500-pound (225kg) Mk82 bombs from KF-16 jets fell outside the shooting range during joint live-fire exercises.
“We are sorry for the damage caused by the abnormal drop accident, and we wish the injured a speedy recovery,” the Air Force said in a statement.
Residents in the area have protested about the disturbance and potential danger from nearby training grounds for years.
Residents were evacuated around midday as authorities checked whether there were any unexploded bombs, Yonhap news agency said.
Reuters’ photographs from the scene showed shattered windows and a church building strewn with debris.
The defence ministry said earlier on Thursday that South Korea and U.S. forces were holding their first joint live-fire exercises in Pocheon, linked to annual military drills due to start next week.
South Korea and the United States will kick off their annual Freedom Shield exercise on Monday, said Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
The joint drills, which will run until March 20, aim to strengthen the readiness of the alliance for threats such as North Korea, the JCS said.
This year’s drills will reflect “lessons learned from recent armed conflicts” and North Korea’s growing partnership with Russia, it added.
“Our planners look across the globe and identify the trends that are changing and we look at how we can incorporate that into our exercises,” Ryan Donald, a spokesperson for the United States Forces Korea (USFK), told a media briefing on Thursday.
About 70 combined field training sessions are scheduled for this year’s exercise, said Lee Sung-jun, a spokesperson for Seoul’s JCS.

Title: Liverpool’s Elliott nabs last-gasp winner against dominant PSG
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 06:29:55 +0000
Content: Liverpool substitute Harvey Elliott scored a last-gasp winner 47 seconds after coming on to earn a fortunate 1-0 win against Paris St Germain who outplayed their visitors during Wednesday’s Champions League last-16 first leg match.
Elliott slotted home in the 87th minute against the run of play after a layoff from fellow substitute Darwin Nunez for a scarcely-deserved victory in Paris after goalkeeper Alisson had kept Liverpool in the game with a string of magnificent saves.
Liverpool’s goal was their first shot on target and second attempt compared to PSG’s 28.
“To go away with a win from here was probably a bit more than we deserved,” acknowledged Slot.
Luis Enrique’s PSG, who had won 18 and drawn two of their last 20 games, were left to rue missed chances as they contemplate a tough return leg at Anfield next Tuesday.
“We’re going to show the team we are, we’re going to show our character. We’re going to win there,” said their midfielder Vitinha. “With the game we played, the win was more than deserved. We had plenty of chances … we just couldn’t score.”
The aggregate winner will face either Aston Villa or Club Brugge in the Champions League last eight.
DOMINANT HOSTS
PSG got off to a strong start with Liverpool’s attempt at a high press not lasting long.
The hosts had the first clear chance in the 16th minute when Joao Neves skied his attempt over the bar from Dembele’s cutback after the France forward had outpaced two defenders.
Alarm bells were ringing for Liverpool and they again escaped punishment in the 20th when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s superb curled effort was ruled out for offside after a VAR review.
Bradley Barcola went down after a challenge from Ibrahima Konate, prompting another video check for a potential red card, but the visitors stayed with 11 men.
With Liverpool in survival mode, Alisson parried Neves’ 25-metre strike before denying Dembele. The ball went into the path of Barcola, whose first strike was blocked before his second flew over.
The Brazilian keeper’s firm hand was there again to stop Kvaratskhelia and he made saves left, right and centre early in a one-sided second half. “Without him, I don’t know where we’d be,” said goalscorer Elliott.
SUBSTITUTE THE SAVIOUR
Slot sent Curtis Jones and Nunez on for Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota hoping to shift the momentum but PSG stayed a notch above.
Alisson, again, stretched to tip away Desire Doue’s missile 10 minutes from time and he also played a key role in the buildup to the goal.
With the clock ticking down, Nunez showed his strength to win Alisson’s long ball and played perfectly into the path of Elliott, who calmly slid the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma.
“You could see they (PSG) had become a bit tired at the end,” added Elliott. “It was down to me to put the opportunity away and fortunately it went in.”
Alisson, who was named man of the match, said it was the performance of his life. “We had to be ready to suffer … It was a tough night for us with a happy end,” he said.
“We worked hard. We gave away so many chances … And then at the end Harvey coming in and scoring the goal. It’s unbelievable. A great story. A great night for us.”

Title: Osaka crashes out of Indian Wells first round
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 06:21:19 +0000
Content: Former champion Naomi Osaka was sent packing from Indian Wells after a 6-4 6-4 first-round defeat by Colombia’s Camila Osorio on Wednesday.
The Japanese four-time Grand Slam champion never looked comfortable against Osorio’s dynamic shotmaking and piled up the unforced errors on a cool evening in the California desert.
After a near flawless first set from Osorio, Osaka fended off a match point at 5-3 in the second to stay alive, much to the delight of the fans.
Nerves appeared to get to Osorio as she attempted to serve out the match in the next game, where she double faulted twice and fell behind 0-40.
She regrouped, however, saving four break points in the game and crushing a forehand winner that caught the line to advance, celebrating with a dance on the court under the lights.
“First, good evening everyone, I’m Camila Osorio,” she said with a laugh in an on-court interview.
“It’s crazy for me, it’s a dream come true. I really wanted to play on this court and was really excited and looking forwards to playing a champion like Naomi, so I can’t believe it.”
World number 53 Osorio becomes the first Colombian woman to beat a former world number one. She takes on 22nd seed Clara Tauson of Denmark in the second round.
It was Osaka’s first match since withdrawing from the Australian Open third round due to an abdominal strain.
Osaka, who beat Daria Kasatkina in the Indian Wells final in 2018 for her first career title, appeared to struggle with the consistency of her ball tosses and accuracy off both wings.
KVITOVA OUT
Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova also made an early exit, losing 4-6 6-3 6-4 to France’s Varvara Gracheva.
The loss leaves Kvitova searching for her first win since returning to the tour following the birth of her first child last July. She also lost in the first round in Austin last week in her first tournament following a 16-month absence.
The Czech grabbed the first set as both players struggled to control their serve but Gracheva settled in to level the match before jumping out to a 3-1 lead in the decider.
Kvitova won three straight games to take a 4-3 lead but Gracheva took control from there, dominating the final three games to dispatch the tournament wildcard and set up a meeting with Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.
Gracheva said she wanted to congratulate Kvitova for juggling the demands of motherhood and being a professional athlete.
“Because she had a child quite recently and I’m so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding,” she added.
“It’s very inspiring for sports, athletes, women – it’s just amazing. Petra, my admiration to you – you’re the best.”
Gracheva’s fellow Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia also advanced to the second round with a 6-3 6-4 win over American Bernarda Pera and will next play defending champion Iga Swiatek.
Belarusian Victoria Azarenka battled past American Clervie Ngounoue 6-4 7-6(7) to get her campaign for a third Indian Wells crown off to a winning start.
On the men’s side, Kei Nishikori emerged the victor in a rollercoaster match with Spain’s Jaume Munar to advance 6-2 5-7 7-6(3). The Japanese player will face 18th seeded Frenchman Ugo Humbert in the second round.
Britain’s Cam Norrie thrashed Italy’s Luca Nardi 6-0 6-3 in the evening to set up a second round meeting with Czech 23rd seed Jiri Lehecka.
American qualifier Colton Smith celebrated his 22nd birthday with his first ATP Tour main draw win, beating Flavio Cobolli 3-6 6-2 6-2.
Smith converted seven of his nine break point opportunities and was serenaded with “Happy Birthday” from the fans after downing the Italian.
American Marcos Giron, Russian Roman Safiullin and Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands were among the other players who advanced to the second round of the Masters 1000 event.

Title: It is what it is, New Zealand focused only on winning Champions Trophy
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:57:03 +0000
Content: Kane Williamson is too long in the tooth to get dragged into the debate over India getting to play the Champions Trophy final in Dubai and the batter is focused only on the chance of New Zealand grabbing silverware after reaching the title-decider.
The 34-year-old scored his 15th one-day century, and Rachin Ravindra his fifth, as New Zealand beat South Africa by 50 runs in the semi-finals at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Wednesday.
The Black Caps must now pack their bags for Sunday’s final in Dubai, where India have played all their matches in the tournament because of their refusal to go to Pakistan.
“It is what it is,” Williamson told reporters.
“You know, it’s just not something we’re really looking too closely at. It’s about the cricket that we want to play, and we’ll take into account, obviously, the opposition, but be nice and smart come that final.”
Williamson and his teammates have already played India in Dubai during the tournament, losing by 44 runs in the final group match last Sunday as Rohit Sharma unleashed a four-pronged spin attack on a turning wicket.
“Obviously, we played India once there, the conditions are different,” Williamson added.
“So it’s important that we try and take away some of those positives and be nice and clear about how we’re trying to operate come two or three days’ time in the final.”
New Zealand have an injury concern over paceman Matt Henry, who injured his shoulder against South Africa, but Ravindra’s form since his return from a concussion sustained in a warm-up match has been a big plus.
“We missed him while he had his little injury for a while there,” said Williamson, whose partnership of 164 with Ravindra laid the platform for Wednesday’s win.
“But he just took a couple of weeks off and came back and is batting beautifully. Great to watch. Best seat in the house at the other end, for sure.”
Daryl Mitchell also fended off questions about whether India had an advantage playing all their games at the same ground but thought last week’s loss would have little bearing on Sunday’s final.
“We’ve got some pretty good spinners ourselves,” said the batsman, who scored 49 runs against South Africa.
“Look, the final’s a new day. We’ll adapt to whatever surface and conditions that we get on the day.
“We’ll try and find little ways to win moments throughout that game and hopefully we can put some pressure on them and walk away with a white jacket, be quite nice.”

Title: India’s social security coverage doubles to 48.8%: Minister
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:51:06 +0000
Content: India’s social security coverage has seen a significant rise, doubling from 24.4% to 48.8%, according to Union Minister for Labour and Employment and Youth Affairs and Sports, Mansukh Mandaviya. Speaking at the post-budget webinar on ‘Investing in People,’ Mandaviya emphasized the government’s commitment to skilling and empowering India’s youth, ensuring that their talent makes a global impact.
Citing the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) World Social Security Report 2024-26, the minister highlighted the progress made in expanding social security benefits across the workforce. The e-Shram Portal, which now covers over 30.67 crore unorganised workers, and the inclusion of gig workers under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) underscore the government’s efforts in workforce welfare. Additionally, 12 key welfare schemes have been integrated into the e-Shram platform, which is now available in 22 Indian languages.
Mandaviya also pointed to advancements in healthcare for workers, announcing that 10 new Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) medical colleges have been approved, with another 10 in the pipeline. He reaffirmed the government’s vision for Viksit Bharat 2047, stating that investing in people is not just an economic priority but a social, moral, and cultural commitment toward building an educated, healthy, and empowered society.
Highlighting employment initiatives, the minister revealed that 17.1 crore jobs were created between 2014 and 2024, with 4.6 crore generated in the past year alone. The unemployment rate has declined from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24, while female workforce participation has seen a notable increase from 22% to 40.3%. Mandaviya attributed these achievements to the government’s progressive policies aimed at fostering economic growth and social security.
Further elaborating on labour reforms, Labour Secretary Sumita Dawra noted the modernization of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which has enrolled over 6.2 crore new members in the past six-and-a-half years. She also highlighted improvements such as the centralised pension processing system, automated settlement of PF claims, and enhanced IT infrastructure.
Dawra detailed the expansion of ESIC services, which have grown from 2.03 crore insured persons in 2014 to 3.72 crore in 2024. The healthcare network under ESIC has also expanded significantly, now comprising 165 hospitals and 1,590 dispensaries across the country.
The government’s continued focus on strengthening social security, employment opportunities, and healthcare accessibility signals a transformative shift in workforce welfare, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive and sustainable development.

Title: Hong Kong’s top court quashes convictions of pro-democracy Tiananmen group
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:44:19 +0000
Content: Hong Kong’s top court unanimously overturned on Thursday the convictions of three former members of a pro-democracy group that organised an annual candlelight vigil to mark China’s 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, citing a miscarriage of justice.
The ruling is a rare victory for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement in which scores of activists have been jailed or forced into exile, with many liberal and popular civil society groups shuttered.
In their judgment, the five judges of the Court of Final Appeal, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, said government prosecutors had redacted key facts.
That had “deprived the appellants of a fair trial, so that their convictions involved a miscarriage of justice,” they added.
The now disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China used to organise the annual candlelight vigil to commemorate those who died in the bloody crackdown in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Former vice-chairperson Chow Hang Tung, 40, and two other former executive committee members Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were sentenced to 4-1/2 months in March 2023.
They had been found guilty of not complying with a national security police request for information on the Alliance’s members, donors and finances.
Chow’s mother expressed gratitude for the ruling.
“I hope the world will become better,” Media Chow Lau added. “Everyone should be kind and uphold justice persistently.”
Tang welcomed the ruling, saying, “Today we can prove that the Alliance is not a foreign agent … justice is in the hearts of the people,” in remarks to reporters outside the court.
The group was designated a “foreign agent” for an unidentified organisation after being accused of receiving HK$20,000 from it.
But some key details of the case, such as the identity of overseas organisations and individuals alleged to have ties to the group, were redacted, drawing criticism from the judges.
“By redacting the only potential evidential basis for establishing such facts, the prosecution disabled itself from proving its case,” the judges wrote.
The national security law imposed by Beijing allows the police chief to seek information believed to be necessary for the prevention and investigation of offences.
During the appeal hearing, however, Chow, who represented herself, said the claim that the Alliance was a foreign agent had been difficult to prove because it was untrue.
“A deer cannot become a horse just because someone believes it to be,” she added.
Chow urged the courts to end complicity in police abuse.
“A police state is created by the complicity of the court in endorsing such abuses,” she said. “This kind of complicity must stop now.”
Detained since September 2021, Chow has also been charged with incitement to subversion, along with two former Alliance leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan.

Title: Peace, tranquility in border areas essential for relationship to grow: EAM Jaishankar on China
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:42:35 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday stressed that India seeks a stable relationship with China, one where India’s interests are respected and its sensitivities acknowledged.
Jaishankar made these remarks during a discussion with Chatham House Director Bronwen Maddox, held in collaboration with the High Commission of India.
“The key issue is how to create a stable equilibrium and transition into the next phase of equilibriums. We want a stable relationship where our interests are respected, our sensitivities are recognized, and where it works for both of us. That is really the main challenge in our relationship,” Jaishankar said.
Jaishankar also discussed the disruption in India-China relations due to China’s actions along the Line of Actual Control in 2020. However, he noted that many urgent issues, including troop disengagement, were resolved by October 2024. He mentioned meetings between leaders and officials from both sides and ongoing discussions to make the relationship more stable and positive.
The foreign minister outlined ongoing talks on issues such as the resumption of pilgrimages to Mount Kailash, direct flights, and trans-border river mechanisms that were halted after 2020. He acknowledged challenges but expressed hope for a resolution in the near future.
The external affairs minister emphasized that India and China share a “very unique relationship,” noting that both countries are the only ones with populations exceeding a billion. He highlighted that the challenge lies in balancing their rising trajectories while managing their shared border.

Title: Kane double as Bayern outclass error-prone Leverkusen 3-0
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:25:55 +0000
Content: Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane scored in each half to guide his team to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Bayer Leverkusen in the all-German Champions League round of 16 first-leg match on Wednesday.
The Bavarians earned their first victory in the last seven matches against Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen and will take a significant advantage into next week’s return.
For the visitors, second in the league behind Bayern, it was a bitterly disappointing evening, filled with mistakes and sloppy defending in their worst performance of the season.
“We did a lot of things right, otherwise you cannot beat such a team,” Bayern coach Vincent Kompany told reporters. “We have to repeat what we did well today next week.
“It’s only the first half, we have to play them again and we need to deliver the same performance. It was the most important game of the season so far, but hopefully we’ll get more important games.”
The Bundesliga leaders, knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen, shot out of the blocks and established a ninth-minute lead through Kane’s powerful header.
Kane’s 30th goal across all competitions ended the striker’s four-game goal drought.
In a pulsating start, the visitors almost hit back five minutes later but Jeremie Frimpong, alone in front of goal, could not beat Manuel Neuer, making his 150th Champions League appearance, from close range.
Bayern had control of the game and came close to a second goal when Jamal Musiala headed against the crossbar.
Error-prone Leverkusen, with top strikers Victor Boniface and Patrick Schick left on the bench, were a shadow of the team who dominated Bayern in their goalless league draw just over two weeks ago.
Leverkusen keeper Matej Kovar gifted the hosts a second in the 54th minute after he dropped the ball from a Joshua Kimmich cross to allow Jamal Musiala to tap home.
Things got worse for the visitors when Nordi Mukiele was sent off following a second booking and Kane sealed Bayern’s comfortable win with a well-taken 75th-minute penalty and his 31st goal across all competitions.
“It will take time to process this game,” Alonso said. “A lot went against us today, but that was our own fault. We didn’t have good control and made big mistakes.
“But it’s not over until it’s over. The craziest things have already happened in football and we’ll fight to make something happen next week,” the Spaniard added.
The only sour note on an otherwise perfect evening for Bayern came in the 58th minute when Neuer had to be taken off injured.
The winners will face Feyenoord or Inter Milan in the last eight.

Title: India accelerates digital and AI growth with focus on infrastructure and innovation
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:56:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized India’s commitment to shaping its digital future through advancements in Digital Public Infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and semiconductor manufacturing. Urging citizens to engage with a detailed article by Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Prime Minister’s Office underscored the nation’s technological strides in a social media post.
India is poised to emerge as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital public infrastructure as it charts an ambitious course toward its centenary of independence in 2047. With a strong emphasis on innovation, research, and indigenous development, the country is actively working to integrate AI into governance, industry, and public services, ensuring equitable access to technology for its citizens.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently highlighted AI as a key driver of economic growth and national security. Under his leadership, the government has launched initiatives such as the IndiaAI mission, aimed at fostering AI research, nurturing startups, and building a robust AI ecosystem that aligns with the country’s broader digital transformation agenda.
The government’s approach underscores a vision that balances technological advancement with ethical considerations, ensuring responsible AI development that safeguards privacy, transparency, and fairness.
India’s success in digital public infrastructure (DPI) serves as a strong foundation for its AI ambitions. The implementation of Aadhaar, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and CoWIN has demonstrated the transformative potential of technology in governance and public service delivery.
These initiatives have not only enhanced efficiency but have also positioned India as a model for other nations seeking to develop inclusive digital ecosystems. The next phase of this digital expansion includes the integration of AI-driven solutions to optimize service delivery in sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and finance.
A key component of India’s AI strategy is the focus on indigenous research and talent development. The country is investing in AI centers of excellence, collaborations between academia and industry, and skilling programs to equip its workforce with expertise in AI and emerging technologies.
By nurturing a skilled talent pool, India aims to become self-reliant in AI development, reducing dependence on foreign technology while fostering innovation tailored to its unique socio-economic landscape.
The regulatory framework surrounding AI is also under active consideration, with policymakers working to establish guidelines that encourage innovation while addressing concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and national security.
By adopting a balanced approach, India seeks to create an AI ecosystem that is both dynamic and responsible, ensuring that technology serves the public good without compromising ethical standards.

Title: Delhi Metro will have longest single-city network in world by Dec: Manohar Lal
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:45:34 +0000
Content: Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Manohar Lal on Thursday said that by December 2025, the network of Delhi Metro will become the longest for a single city, surpassing New York Metro’s 399-km record.
“With the opening of the 12-km Aerocity-Tughlakabad stretch of the Golden Line, Delhi Metro’s network will become the longest single-city metro network in the world,” said Manohar Lal at a tunnel breakthrough event for the Golden Line, held at Vasant Kunj metro station.
At present, Delhi Metro’s operational network is 394 km long, he said.
The Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs said Metro networks are operational or projects are in the pipeline across 29 states of the country and the network length today is around 1,000 km, which is the third-largest in the world.
“Very soon, we will become a country with the second-largest Metro network, behind China,” he said.
On February 25, Delhi Metro achieved a major construction milestone in Phase 4 with the completion of an underground tunnel between Chhatarpur Mandir and IGNOU Station on the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor.
The breakthrough of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) at the IGNOU Station site of the Delhi Metro took place in the presence of Anand Mohan Bajaj, Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General, Commercial, Pramod Kumar, Additional Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General, Vikas Kumar, MD, DMRC, and other senior officials.
A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) broke through at IGNOU station after boring a 1,475-metre-long tunnel. This tunnel breakthrough was achieved using a mammoth 97-metre-long TBM.
Two parallel circular tunnels for up and down movement are being constructed on this stretch as part of the Aerocity–Tughlakabad corridor.
This new tunnel has been constructed at an average depth of approximately 26.0 metres, making it one of Delhi Metro’s deepest tunnels. The tunnel on the Magenta Line at Hauz Khas has been built at a depth of about 30 metres. About 1,048 rings have been installed in the tunnel, with an inner diameter of 5.8 metres.
The tunnel has been built using the proven technology of EPBM (Earth Pressure Balancing Method) with a concrete lining made of precast tunnel rings. These tunnel rings were cast at a fully mechanised casting yard set up at Mundka. The concrete segments were cured with a steam curing system to achieve early strength.
The tunnelling drive began on December 4, 2023. Challenges such as a steep gradient and varied geological conditions, including mica and hard rock, caused damage to the screw auger, which had to be replaced during the process.
All necessary safety precautions were taken during the construction of the tunnel below the existing viaduct and built-up structures. Ground movements were monitored with highly sensitive instruments fixed on nearby structures, ensuring that there was no settlement anywhere.
As part of the Phase 4 work approved so far, 40.109 km of underground lines are being constructed. The Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor has underground sections totalling 19.343 km.
A TBM is a machine used to excavate tunnels with a circular cross-section through various soil and rock strata. They can be designed to bore through anything from hard rock to sand. TBMs have revolutionized tunnel construction worldwide, allowing excavation without disturbing buildings or surface structures.
TBMs are particularly useful for underground tunnelling work in congested urban areas.
DMRC has been using TBMs for its tunnelling work since Phase 1 was kicked off in 1998. The first operational section opened on December 25, 2002, connecting Shahdara to Tis Hazari. The entire Phase 1 was operational by 2006, and Delhi Metro’s Phase 2 construction began in 2006, Phase 3 in 2011, and Phase 4 in 2019.
In Phase 3, when approximately 50 km of underground sections were built, about 30 TBMs were deployed in the national capital.

Title: EU leaders to back defence surge, support Zelenskiy after US aid freeze
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:06:46 +0000
Content: European leaders are expected to agree to ramp up defence spending and reaffirm support for Ukraine at a summit on Thursday, after Donald Trump’s suspension of military aid to Kyiv fuelled concerns the EU can no longer rely on U.S. protection.
Leaders of the European Union’s 27 countries will be joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at a summit in Brussels, although Hungary’s nationalist leader Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, may veto a unanimous statement backing Kyiv.
While the summit will offer words of support and plan for an increase in defence spending, Europe is not expected to be able to fully replace suspended U.S. aid. Washington provided more than 40% of military aid to Ukraine last year, according to NATO, some of which Europe could not easily provide.
The meeting takes place against a backdrop of dramatic defence policy decisions driven by fears that Russia, emboldened by its war in Ukraine, may attack an EU country next and that Europe cannot rely on the U.S. to come to its aid.
“I want to believe that the United States will stand by us. But we have to be ready if that is not the case,” French President Emmanuel  Macron  said of the war in Ukraine in an address to the French nation on the eve of the summit.
In a sign of the gravity of the moment, Macron said France is open to discussing extending the protection offered by its nuclear arsenal to its European partners. He stressed that Russia had become a threat for all of Europe.
“Faced with this world of danger, remaining a spectator would be madness,” Macron said.
On Tuesday, the parties aiming to form Germany’s next government agreed to loosen borrowing limits to allow billions of euros of extra defence spending.
The European Commission – the EU’s executive body – also unveiled proposals that it said could mobilise up to 800 billion euros ($860 billion) for European defence, including a plan to borrow up to 150 billion euros ($160 billion) to lend to EU governments.
“It gives more fiscal space to member states for military expenditure and it gives the possibility for joint procurement on a European level,” Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. “And also very importantly, it also benefits Ukraine.”
WELCOME EXPECTED
Trump has said Europe must take more responsibility for its security and previously suggested the U.S. would not protect a NATO ally that did not spend enough on defence.
His decision to shift from staunch U.S. support for Ukraine to a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow has deeply alarmed Europeans who see Russia as the biggest threat to their security.
Diplomats expect leaders at the summit to give the Commission’s proposals a broad welcome and instruct officials to quickly turn them into draft legislation. EU members will then have to agree on the nitty-gritty, which will not be straightforward.
On Ukraine, almost all EU leaders are keen to reassure Zelenskiy that he can still rely on Europe for support after his bruising Oval Office clash with Trump last week.
But EU members have so far not been able to agree on a proposal by foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas to put a figure on the military aid they will pledge to Ukraine this year.
It is unclear whether the text on Ukraine will be endorsed by all 27 leaders, due to a veto threat from Orban, who has kept friendly ties to the Kremlin and endorsed Trump’s approach on Ukraine.
In a letter to European Council President Antonio Costa dated Saturday, Orban said there were “strategic differences in our approach to Ukraine that cannot be bridged”.
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has also rejected military aid to Ukraine, repeated that he wanted a mention of reopening Russian gas transit through Ukraine – a major route of energy for Slovakia which Kyiv stopped this year – as part of summit conclusions.
“If that is there we have no reason, of course, to block conclusions,” Fico said before heading to the summit.

Title: Meta, Google urged to crack down on illegal online gambling in India: report
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:52:51 +0000
Content: Big tech companies like Meta and Google must take stronger action against the rapidly growing illegal online gambling and betting market on their platforms in India, a new report said on Thursday.
The Digital India Foundation report revealed that illegal gambling networks lure users through digital ads, social media, messaging platforms, and cryptocurrency-based payment systems. It called for stricter regulations and active collaboration between Indian regulators and tech companies to curb the rising issue.
Between October and December 2024, four major gambling platforms—Parimatch, Stake, 1xBet, and Battery Bet—recorded a staggering 1.6 billion visits, the report noted. Social media alone contributed to 42.8 million visits through direct paid ads, influencer promotions, and engagement campaigns.
While the government has attempted to curb these activities by blocking websites and issuing advisories, illegal operators continue to thrive, constantly adapting their strategies to evade restrictions. The report suggested a more comprehensive approach, holding all key enablers, including tech platforms, accountable while enforcing strict compliance measures.
Globally, regulators have worked closely with social media and digital advertising platforms to monitor and remove illegal gambling content. A European Union study in 2018 found that 19 out of 24 national regulators had established partnerships with Meta, X, and Google to take down such ads and lower the search rankings of gambling sites.
In the US, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) targets payment processors to block financial transactions linked to illegal online betting, rather than individual users.
In India, aggressive advertising is driving illegal gambling. According to the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), there has been a surge in gambling ads across digital platforms, often using exaggerated claims to attract players.
Google search trends from 2021 to 2024 show a sharp rise in searches for betting sites like Dafabet, 1xBet, and Parimatch, especially during Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons. Operators employ aggressive SEO tactics to secure top rankings for IPL betting and online casino searches.
The report also found that referral traffic from adult sites, sports-related websites, and streaming services generated 247.5 million visits to illegal gambling sites.
In addition, messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram play a major role in promoting these sites. Influencers with millions of followers use “Channels” to broadcast gambling ads, reaching a massive audience instantly.
The report recommended that regulatory bodies like the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre work with digital platforms to proactively monitor and remove illegal gambling content.

Title: PM Modi’s approval ratings at 68%, strongest support from North and West: Ipsos IndiaBus survey
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:39:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to maintain a strong approval rating, with significant support from citizens, particularly in the Northern and Western regions of the country, according to the latest Ipsos IndiaBus PM’s Approval Rating survey.
The survey revealed that PM Modi’s approval ratings for February 2025 stood at 68%, reflecting sustained public confidence in his leadership. Support was particularly pronounced in North India, where 86% of respondents expressed approval of his governance. The Western region also showed strong backing, with 74% of respondents endorsing the government’s performance.
Urban populations in Tier 1 cities displayed a high level of confidence in the Modi government, with 78% approval, a trend likely driven by infrastructural development and improved quality of life.
However, the survey highlighted a stark regional contrast in approval ratings. In the Southern states, only 32% of respondents supported the Modi government, suggesting a preference for local and regional leadership over the central administration.
Parijat Chakraborty, Group Service Line Leader at Ipsos India, attributed the Prime Minister’s strong ratings to economic stability and key policy measures. “The government’s budget provided relief to the middle class through tax breaks, ensuring greater disposable income. Additionally, the recent 25-basis-point cut in the RBI’s repo rate has made borrowing more affordable. The extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) for five years from January 1, 2024, under Amrit Kaal, has also significantly benefited citizens,” he noted.
The survey assessed the government’s performance across multiple sectors, including education, sanitation, healthcare, corruption, and pollution. Education emerged as the most highly rated area, with 65% of respondents approving of the Modi government’s initiatives. Sanitation and hygiene followed, garnering positive feedback from 49% of participants.
Chakraborty pointed to the government’s education policies as a major factor in public approval. “Initiatives such as promoting education for the girl child, free mid-day meals in Aanganwadis, the establishment of new education hubs, specialized courses in urban centers, and the Skill India program to enhance employability have contributed to the positive perception of Modi’s governance,” he said.
As the political landscape evolves, the Ipsos survey underscores PM Modi’s continued strong public support, particularly in key regions, while also highlighting the contrasting political preferences across different parts of the country.

Title: Odisha’s CM residence gets new occupant after 25 years, Majhi moves in with family
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:35:33 +0000
Content: For the first time in almost 25 years, the official residence of Odisha’s Chief Minister in Bhubaneswar has a new occupant. On Thursday, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, along with his family, moved into the residence following the traditional ‘Gruha Pravesh’ ceremony.
The auspicious housewarming ceremony was conducted with great reverence, with 11 Brahmin priests from Puri presiding over the rituals.
The ceremony began with the worship of two cows, a customary practice in Hindu traditions believed to bring prosperity and positive energy to a new home.
Following this, the Gruha Pravesh was performed, marking CM Majhi’s formal entry into the residence with his family at 10:47 a.m., a time deemed astrologically favorable.
The two-storey official residence, located strategically between Raj Bhavan and AG Square, has remained unoccupied for over twenty years. Since 2000, when Naveen Patnaik became Chief Minister, the house has been vacant, as he chose to live in his own private residence instead.
Odisha Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Naveen Patnaik, during his 24-year tenure, operated from his personal home, Naveen Niwas, when he was the Chief Minister of the state. For a quarter-century, all official and administrative work was conducted from Naveen Niwas — a palatial mansion built by his father and former Chief Minister Biju Patnaik.
Before Patnaik’s tenure, the CM quarters were home to former Chief Ministers J.B. Patnaik and Giridhar Gamang.
Given the prolonged disuse of the CM residence, the government undertook a major renovation project that lasted eight months before making the residence habitable once again.
The refurbished CM House now boasts multiple conference rooms, a watchtower for security, and a sprawling garden in the front, providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.
With Mohan Charan Majhi now formally moving in, the Chief Minister’s residence in Bhubaneswar is once again a hub of political activity after a quarter-century of dormancy.

Title: India’s economy poised for 6.5% growth in fiscal 2026 despite global uncertainties: crisil
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:34:47 +0000
Content: India’s real GDP growth is expected to hold steady at 6.5% in fiscal 2026, even as geopolitical uncertainties and trade-related disruptions, particularly US tariff actions, pose challenges, according to a report by Crisil released on Thursday.
The forecast relies on two key assumptions—another normal monsoon season and stable commodity prices. Factors such as easing food inflation, tax benefits outlined in the Union Budget 2025-26, and lower borrowing costs are likely to boost discretionary consumption, the report stated.
With fiscal stimulus normalizing and the impact of a high base gradually fading, economic growth is now stabilizing at pre-pandemic levels. Despite global headwinds, high-frequency data from the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indicates that India continues to outperform major economies.
Crisil Managing Director and CEO Amish Mehta noted that India’s economic resilience is being tested once again. However, the country has built certain safeguards against external shocks, including strong GDP growth, a low current account deficit, manageable external public debt, and robust forex reserves, which provide significant policy flexibility. While external factors may create volatility, domestic demand—both rural and urban—will remain crucial in sustaining short-term growth.
In the medium term, continued investments and efficiency improvements are expected to drive expansion. Crisil projects that both manufacturing and services will contribute to economic growth through fiscal 2031. Manufacturing growth is anticipated to average 9% annually between fiscals 2025 and 2031, compared to 6% in the pre-pandemic decade. The services sector will remain the dominant force behind economic expansion, leading to an increase in the manufacturing sector’s GDP share from 17% in fiscal 2025 to 20%.
Lower inflation and ongoing fiscal consolidation have created room for policy rate cuts. Crisil expects a 50-75 basis point reduction in interest rates over the next fiscal year, although the pace of US Federal Reserve rate cuts and weather-related risks could influence the timing and extent of these adjustments.
India has continued to widen its growth premium over advanced economies through large-scale infrastructure development and economic reforms. However, despite strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the country is not entirely insulated from external shocks. Crisil’s Chief Economist Dharmakirti Joshi cautioned that while India’s economic buffers offer stability, risks to the 6.5% growth forecast remain tilted to the downside due to uncertainties arising from the US-led tariff war.

Title: India’s engineering exports to US reach $1.62 billion in January despite global challenges
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:28:26 +0000
Content: India’s engineering goods exports grew robustly in January, with the US as the top destination. Exports to the US saw an 18% year-on-year increase, reaching $1.62 billion, while total engineering exports grew by 7.44% to $9.42 billion in January 2025, compared to $8.77 billion last year, according to the Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC).
Despite geopolitical tensions and growing protectionism, India’s engineering exports have shown positive growth for the ninth consecutive month. EEPC India Chairman Pankaj Chadha noted that the sector managed to thrive despite global turmoil and protectionist measures by key export destinations.
This comes as U.S. President Donald Trump announced a hike in tariffs on Indian exports from April 2 as part of a reciprocal tariff policy. Chadha emphasized that changing trade policies and rising protectionism are pressuring global businesses, and the Indian government’s support in export credit and technology would be crucial for competitiveness.
India’s top engineering export destinations, such as Germany, Mexico, Turkey, and South Africa, saw growth in January, but exports to the UK, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, China, Italy, and Spain declined.
January’s growth was mainly driven by exports of aircraft, electric machinery, automobiles, industrial machinery, iron and steel products, and medical instruments. Cumulatively, India’s engineering exports for the April-January period of FY25 reached $96.75 billion, a 9.82% increase from the previous year.
Engineering goods accounted for 25.86% of India’s total merchandise exports in January. The sector, which contributes 3.53% of India’s GDP, has seen remarkable growth, fueled by infrastructure investments and industrial production.
India has been a permanent member of the Washington Accord since June 2014, an agreement promoting the mobility of engineers and international standards in engineering education.

Title: Stock market continues upward trend for 2nd straight session
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 10:32:55 +0000
Content: The Indian stock markets continued their upward momentum for the second straight session on Thursday, with both the Sensex and Nifty closing in the green. Investor sentiment remained positive as the benchmark indices sustained their rally, extending the gains seen in the previous session.
The 30-share BSE Sensex touched an intra-day high of 74,390.80 before settling at 74,340.09, marking a gain of 609.86 points or 0.83 percent. Meanwhile, the NSE Nifty climbed 207.40 points, or 0.93 percent, to close at 22,544.70, after trading within a range of 22,556.45 to 22,245.85 during the session.
A broad-based recovery was evident across the market, with 38 out of the 50 Nifty stocks closing higher.
Among the top gainers were Asian Paints, Coal India, BPCL, Hindalco, and Reliance Industries, which saw gains of up to 4.75 percent. On the other hand, some stocks struggled, with Tech Mahindra, Bharat Electronics, Trent, Britannia, and Kotak Mahindra Bank declining by as much as 2.35 percent.
The rally extended beyond the benchmark indices, as broader markets also witnessed gains. The Nifty Smallcap100 index led the charge, jumping 1.32 percent, while the Nifty Midcap100 index ended in positive territory with a 0.37 percent increase. Sectoral indices largely reflected the positive trend, with most sectors closing higher, except for the Nifty Realty index, which was the only sector to end in the red.
Market analysts pointed to technical indicators suggesting continued strength. Rupak De of LKP Securities said that Nifty is filling a recent gap on the daily chart, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) recovering from a historically low level and forming a bullish crossover. “In the short term, sentiment appears to favour the bulls. The index could move towards 23,750–23,800 on the higher end, as long as it remains above 22,300,” he said.
The ongoing market rebound follows a strong recovery on March 5, when the Sensex and Nifty surged over 1 percent after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted at potential tariff relief for Mexico and Canada. This development raised hopes that broader tariff reconsiderations could further boost investor confidence.
Meanwhile, in the commodities market, gold continues to face strong resistance at $2,920–$2,930 in COMEX, triggering profit booking. In the MCX, Rs 86,000 remains a key resistance level, with support at Rs 84,500–Rs 84,000, according to experts.

Title: It was not ideal: David Miller slams Champions Trophy scheduling after semi-final loss to New Zealand
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 10:21:33 +0000
Content: Senior South Africa batter David Miller has voiced his displeasure at the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the scheduling of the 2025 Champions Trophy.
Miller’s comments came after South Africa’s defeat to New Zealand in the semi-finals on Wednesday. The strange scheduling of the Champions Trophy forced both Australia and South Africa to travel from Pakistan to Dubai after the group stage, in preparation for a possible semi-final clash against India.
“It’s only a 1 hour and 40-minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,” Miller said after South Africa’s exit from the tournament. The South African team flew from Karachi to Dubai on Sunday afternoon and returned to Lahore on Monday.
“It was early morning, right after a game, and we had to fly. We got to Dubai at 4:00 pm, and by 7:30 am, we had to return. It wasn’t the best situation. It’s not like we flew five hours and had enough time to recover and recuperate; it was just not an ideal scenario,” he added.
Miller, who scored an impressive unbeaten 67-ball century, including 10 fours and four sixes, saw his efforts go in vain as South Africa fell short by 50 runs in their chase of a Champions Trophy record total of 363 runs.
The 2025 Champions Trophy final between India and New Zealand is scheduled for Sunday, March 9, at the Dubai International Stadium.

Title: India sets ambitious targets, witnessing rapid progress: PM Modi
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 18:00:35 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asserted that India has evolved into a powerhouse driving global growth, setting high targets and delivering significant results. Speaking at the Republic Plenary Summit 2025, he highlighted the country’s rapid advancements in various sectors, particularly in solar energy.
PM Modi emphasized that the world now acknowledges this era as “India’s century,” attributing it to the nation’s remarkable achievements that have raised global aspirations and expectations. “India has now emerged as a driving force propelling global growth forward,” he said.
Discussing the government’s efforts to uplift the poor, PM Modi revealed that over the last decade, more than ₹42 lakh crore has been directly transferred to beneficiaries’ bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system. “Every rupee sent from Delhi reaches the intended recipients without any intermediaries,” he added.
Reflecting on India’s economic transformation, the Prime Minister said that the country’s annual GDP in 2007 stood at ₹1 lakh crore, an amount that is now generated within a single quarter.

Title: Women in small-town India see 34% salary increase in three years: report
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:39:24 +0000
Content: As more women from Tier-II and Tier-III cities in India enter the workforce, their median salary has risen by 34% over the past three years, according to a new report released on Thursday.
The report by job and professional networking platform Apna.co highlights that the number of women job seekers from smaller cities has quadrupled between 2021 and 2024.
Job applications from these regions have also tripled, reaching 12.8 million in 2024. This trend reflects a significant shift in employment patterns beyond major metro cities.
Several factors have driven this trend, including increased job opportunities, improved digital accessibility, and evolving employer hiring strategies. These developments have encouraged more women from non-metro areas to explore different career paths and join the workforce.
Sales, business development, administrative roles, and customer support have emerged as the most popular job sectors for women in smaller cities, accounting for 55% of total job applications. Additionally, many women are pursuing careers in marketing, banking, retail, human resources, hospitality, teaching, and healthcare.
A growing number of women are also entering unconventional roles, with nearly 600,000 applications in field sales, 250,000 in delivery and logistics, and 150,000 in security services in 2024.
Cities such as Lucknow, Jaipur, Indore, Bhopal, Surat, Nagpur, and Coimbatore have become major job hubs for women, contributing to 45% of total job applications. Other cities like Kanpur, Bhubaneswar, Ranchi, Chandigarh, Patna, Ludhiana, Vadodara, and Guwahati are also emerging as key employment centers.
A key trend is the rising participation of fresh graduates. Data from Apna.co shows that the number of freshers among women job seekers in Tier-II and III cities has increased 2.5 times, reaching nearly 900,000 in 2024. This indicates that more young women are actively seeking jobs immediately after completing their education.
Digital job platforms have been instrumental in connecting fresh graduates with employment opportunities, making it easier for them to enter the workforce.

Title: EU leaders pledge defence surge, support Zelenskiy after US aid freeze
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:03:46 +0000
Content: European leaders on Thursday said they would stand by Ukraine and spend more on defencein a world upended by Donald Trump‘s reversal of U.S. policies.
“Europe must take up this challenge, this arms race. And it must win it,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said as he arrived at the summit in Brussels.
“Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia – we are simply stronger,” Tusk said.
Many EU leaders hailed the European Commission’s proposals this week to give them fiscal flexibility on defence spending, and to jointly borrow up to 150 billion euros ($160 billion) to lend to EU governments to spend on their militaries.
“We are here to defend Ukraine,” the chairman of the meeting Antonio Costa said as he and European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen, both smiling broadly, warmly welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in sharp contrast with the clash between Trump and Zelenskiy in the Oval Office last week.
But decades of reliance on U.S. protection, divergences on funding and on how France’s nuclear deterrence could be used for Europe showed how difficult it would be for the EU to fill the void left by Washington after it froze military aid to Ukraine.
Washington provided more than 40% of military aid to Ukraine last year, according to NATO, some of which Europe could not easily replace. Someleaders still held out hope, in public at least, that Washington could be coaxed back into the fold.
“We must ensure, with cool and wise heads, that U.S. support is also guaranteed in the coming months and years, because Ukraine is also dependent on their support for its defence,” Germany’s outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.
Adding to the EU‘s difficulties, Hungary’s nationalist leader Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, may veto a unanimous statement backing Kyiv, though he made clear he would support measures for an increase in spending on Europe’s own defence.
NUCLEAR DETERRENCE?
The Brussels summit takes place against a backdrop of dramatic defence policy decisions driven by fears that Russia, emboldened by its war in Ukraine, may attack an EU country next and that Europe cannot rely on the U.S. to come to itsaid.
“I want to believe that the United States will stand by us. But we have to be ready if that is not the case,” French President Emmanuel  Macron  said in an address to the French nation on the eve of the summit.
He stressed that Russia had become a threat for all of Europe, remarks that drew strong criticism from Moscow.
NUCLEAR UMBRELLA
In a sign of the gravity of the moment, Macron said France was open to discussing extending the protection offered by its nuclear arsenal to itsEuropean partners.
This was met with mixed reaction. Some, like Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda, said such a “nuclear umbrella would serve as really very serious deterrence toward Russia.” Poland said the idea was worth discussing while others, like Germany, stressed the need to keep the U.S. involved.
Trump has said Europe must take more responsibility for its security and that the U.S. would not protect a NATO ally that did not spend enough ondefence.
His decision to shift from staunch U.S. support for Ukraine to a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow has deeply alarmed Europeans who see Russia as the biggest threat.
Underlining the level of concern, the parties aiming to form Germany’s next government on Tuesday agreed to liftconstitutional limits on borrowing to fund defence spending.

Title: US weekly jobless claims fall more than expected
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 15:35:49 +0000
Content: The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting that the labor market remained stable in February, though turbulence lies ahead from tariffs on imports and deep government spending cuts.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended March 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 235,000 claims for the latest week.
Applications surged in the prior week amid snowstorms in many parts of the country and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around the Presidents Day holiday.
A separate unemployment compensation for federal employees (UCFE) program, which is reported with a one-week lag, showed an increase amid mass layoffs of probationary federal government workers, fired by tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
President Donald Trump has described the federal government as bloated and wasteful.
Global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday it had tracked 62,242 announced job cuts by the federal government from 17 different agencies in February. Most of the federal layoffs have been in Washington D.C., which has lost 61,795 jobs so far this year compared to only 60 in 2024.
Contractors have also been caught in the DOGE crossfire, extending the job losses to the private sector. Challenger said the “DOGE impact” was blamed for 63,583 of the announced 172,017 layoffs last month, including contractors.
For now, the overall labor market continues to plod along.
The Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book” report on Wednesday described employment as having “nudged slightly higher on balance” since mid-January. Labor market stability is critical to the U.S. central bank’s ability to keep interest rates unchanged while policymakers monitor the economic impact of tariffs and an immigration crackdown.
The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range in January, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it embarked on its policy easing cycle. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, advanced 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.897 million during the week ending February 22, the claims report showed.
The federal government layoffs are not expected to show up in February’s employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as the layoffs happened outside the survey week.
But the hiring and funding freezes could have an impact on government and contractor employment.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 160,000 jobs after rising 143,000 in January, a Reuters survey of economists showed. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.0%.

In the realm of agriculture, PM Modi recommended cooperative farming as a more sustainable model and urged the use of digital public infrastructure, like Agristack, to improve access to services for farmers. He also proposed the introduction of cooperative courses in educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and IIMs, to inspire future generations and encourage young graduates to contribute to the sector.
The meeting also focused on the National Cooperation Policy, with PM Modi being briefed on its development. The policy, which has been formulated after extensive consultations, aims to drive the comprehensive development of the cooperative sector, with an emphasis on rural economic growth and prioritizing the empowerment of women and youth.
As part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen the cooperative movement, the Ministry of Cooperation has launched 60 initiatives across seven key areas. These initiatives include the digitization of cooperative institutions, with projects like the National Cooperative Database and the Computerization Projects, and the strengthening of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS). The Ministry has also worked on enhancing the sustainability of cooperative sugar mills.
The Indian government has integrated over 15 schemes from more than 10 ministries at the PACS level, leading to diversified cooperative businesses and increased opportunities for income generation. Annual targets have been set for the formation of new cooperatives to improve accessibility to government schemes in rural areas.
To further promote cooperative education and research, a Bill has been introduced in Parliament to convert IRMA Anand into “Tribhuvan Cooperative University,” which will become an Institution of National Importance.
The cooperative sector currently plays a vital role in India’s economy, especially in agriculture, rural development, and economic inclusion. One-fifth of India’s population is associated with cooperatives, which include over 8.2 lakh institutions spanning more than 30 sectors, with a membership of over 30 crore individuals.
The meeting was attended by Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah, Secretary of the Ministry of Cooperation Dr. Ashish Kumar Bhutani, Principal Secretary to PM Dr. PK Mishra, Principal Secretary-2 to PM Shaktikanta Das, Advisor to PM Amit Khare, and other senior officials.

Title: Delhi Metro will have longest single-city network in world by Dec: Manohar Lal
Publication Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:45:34 +0000
Content: Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Manohar Lal on Thursday said that by December 2025, the network of Delhi Metro will become the longest for a single city, surpassing New York Metro’s 399-km record.
“With the opening of the 12-km Aerocity-Tughlakabad stretch of the Golden Line, Delhi Metro’s network will become the longest single-city metro network in the world,” said Manohar Lal at a tunnel breakthrough event for the Golden Line, held at Vasant Kunj metro station.
At present, Delhi Metro’s operational network is 394 km long, he said.
The Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs said Metro networks are operational or projects are in the pipeline across 29 states of the country and the network length today is around 1,000 km, which is the third-largest in the world.
“Very soon, we will become a country with the second-largest Metro network, behind China,” he said.
On February 25, Delhi Metro achieved a major construction milestone in Phase 4 with the completion of an underground tunnel between Chhatarpur Mandir and IGNOU Station on the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor.
The breakthrough of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) at the IGNOU Station site of the Delhi Metro took place in the presence of Anand Mohan Bajaj, Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General, Commercial, Pramod Kumar, Additional Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General, Vikas Kumar, MD, DMRC, and other senior officials.
A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) broke through at IGNOU station after boring a 1,475-metre-long tunnel. This tunnel breakthrough was achieved using a mammoth 97-metre-long TBM.
Two parallel circular tunnels for up and down movement are being constructed on this stretch as part of the Aerocity–Tughlakabad corridor.
This new tunnel has been constructed at an average depth of approximately 26.0 metres, making it one of Delhi Metro’s deepest tunnels. The tunnel on the Magenta Line at Hauz Khas has been built at a depth of about 30 metres. About 1,048 rings have been installed in the tunnel, with an inner diameter of 5.8 metres.
The tunnel has been built using the proven technology of EPBM (Earth Pressure Balancing Method) with a concrete lining made of precast tunnel rings. These tunnel rings were cast at a fully mechanised casting yard set up at Mundka. The concrete segments were cured with a steam curing system to achieve early strength.
The tunnelling drive began on December 4, 2023. Challenges such as a steep gradient and varied geological conditions, including mica and hard rock, caused damage to the screw auger, which had to be replaced during the process.
All necessary safety precautions were taken during the construction of the tunnel below the existing viaduct and built-up structures. Ground movements were monitored with highly sensitive instruments fixed on nearby structures, ensuring that there was no settlement anywhere.
As part of the Phase 4 work approved so far, 40.109 km of underground lines are being constructed. The Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor has underground sections totalling 19.343 km.
A TBM is a machine used to excavate tunnels with a circular cross-section through various soil and rock strata. They can be designed to bore through anything from hard rock to sand. TBMs have revolutionized tunnel construction worldwide, allowing excavation without disturbing buildings or surface structures.
TBMs are particularly useful for underground tunnelling work in congested urban areas.
DMRC has been using TBMs for its tunnelling work since Phase 1 was kicked off in 1998. The first operational section opened on December 25, 2002, connecting Shahdara to Tis Hazari. The entire Phase 1 was operational by 2006, and Delhi Metro’s Phase 2 construction began in 2006, Phase 3 in 2011, and Phase 4 in 2019.
In Phase 3, when approximately 50 km of underground sections were built, about 30 TBMs were deployed in the national capital.

Title: Women’s employment rate in urban India jumps 10 pc in six years: Report
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 07:29:07 +0000
Content: Women’s employment in urban India has jumped 10 per cent in the last six years (2017-18 to 2023-24), according to a report, ahead of the International Women’s Day 2025, on Friday.
The white paper launched by Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, showed that urban women in their forties have the highest employment rate among women in urban India — 38.3 per cent in 2023-24.
It also warned of pressing challenges including the underutilisation of educated women’s skills and the looming risk of a diversity backlash.
More than 89 million urban Indian women still remained out of the labour market during 2023-24, said the report. Factors such as caregiving responsibilities, lack of flexible work arrangements, and commuting challenges continue to prevent many highly qualified women from fully participating in the economy.
The findings also highlighted gender gaps even in highly educated households. Even among dual-income, highly educated couples, gender disparities remain stark.
In 62 per cent of such families, husbands earn more, despite equal educational qualifications. Additionally, wives continue to take on the primary responsibility for household work in 41 per cent of homes, compared to just 2 per cent of husbands.
Meanwhile, the balance remains elusive for urban mothers with access to remote work — 86 per cent report spending up to three workday hours on childcare while working. Yet only 44 per cent feel they have adequate support.
This reinforces the need for stronger workplace policies that acknowledge and address the realities of working mothers.

Title: Maharastra achieves record FDI inflow of ₹1.39 lakh crore in just nine months
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 07:19:01 +0000
Content: Maharashtra has recorded its highest annual foreign direct investment (FDI) in a decade within just the first nine months of the financial year 2024-25, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced on Friday. Citing data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), he revealed that the state has received a total FDI inflow of ₹1,39,434 crore between April and December 2024.
The cumulative FDI equity inflow into Maharashtra from October 2019 to December 2024 has reached ₹6,71,863 crore, accounting for 31% of the total FDI equity inflow in India. With this, Maharashtra has outpaced other leading states, including Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana, solidifying its position as the country’s top investment destination.
In a post on X, Chief Minister Fadnavis highlighted this remarkable achievement, saying, “Record foreign investment in the last 10 years has come to Maharashtra in just nine months! The DPIIT report for December 2024 confirms that Maharashtra has received the highest annual foreign investment in the past decade within a single financial year.”
He further said that Maharashtra’s Grand Alliance government has surpassed its own previous record set in the financial year 2016-17, while emphasizing that the final quarter of the current fiscal year is still pending.
The Chief Minister’s announcement follows recent remarks by Governor C.P. Radhakrishnan, who, during his address to the Assembly, reaffirmed Maharashtra’s status as a preferred destination for FDI. He highlighted that the state contributes over 14% to India’s total GDP, underscoring its role as one of the country’s leading industrial hubs.
Maharashtra’s investment appeal was further reinforced at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2025, where the state government signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) worth approximately ₹15.72 lakh crore with 63 national and international companies. These investments are expected to generate over 15 lakh employment opportunities across the state.
To sustain this growth momentum, the government has also planned to disburse an Investment Promotion Subsidy of approximately ₹5,000 crore to various industries. Additionally, legislation enacted last year aims to streamline the investment process through an effective single-window system, ensuring swift approvals and a hassle-free experience for investors.

Title: Trump signs order to establish strategic bitcoin reserve
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 07:15:03 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House.
The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House crypto czar, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X.
Attendees at Friday’s White House crypto summit expect the event to serve as a stage for Trump to formally announce his plans to build a strategic reserve containing bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies.
Earlier this week, Trump announced the names of five digital assets he expects to include in this reserve, spiking the market value of each. The five are bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, the president said.
It is not clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit taxpayers. Sacks said the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings in such a reserve, without offering details.
“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold’,” Sacks said.
Trump’s executive order directed the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no “incremental costs” on taxpayers.
There will also be a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile”, consisting of tokens other than bitcoin, but the government will not add to the stockpile “beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings”, Sacks said.
Bitcoin BTC= briefly tumbled more than 5% to below $85,000 following Sacks’ post, and last changed hands at $88,109.
Trump’s promise of a strategic reserve and expectations for easier industry regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high at $109,071.86 in January.
“This is the most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week,” Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, wrote in a post on X.
“No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the Govt. This is a pig in lipstick.”
Trump’s moves to support the crypto industry, which spent millions of dollars backing him and other Republicans in the November elections, have drawn concern from some conservatives and crypto backers over giveaways to an already wealthy community and delegitimizing the digital currency industry.
Proponents argue that a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto’s price growth.
Sacks estimated the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin and premature sale of the cryptocurrency has cost the American taxpayer $17 billion. It was not clear how Sacks arrived at these estimates.
The president’s support for the crypto industry has also sparked conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump’s family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins, and the president also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform.
His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.

Title: Australia tells thousands to evacuate as tropical cyclone Alfred nears
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:56:57 +0000
Content: Australia ordered thousands of people in its easternregions to evacuate before Tropical Cyclone Alfred hits land on Saturday, as the storm brought heavy rain, huge waves and strong winds that cut off power, swamped beaches and shut airports.
Alfred’s slow progress toward the coast fed concern it could bring a prolonged period of heavy rain and is expected to hit land as a Category 2 storm north of Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city, the Bureau of Meteorology said.
“The evacuation centres are a last resort,” Queensland Premier David Crisafulli told a news conference on Friday, adding that dozens had been opened.
“Have an evacuation plan if you are in one of those areas,” he urged those in the cyclone’s path, advising them to secure their homes before evacuating.
“If in doubt, go and stay with friends and families.”
Wind gusts of more than 100 kph (62 mph) lashed the coastal regions of Queensland and New South Wales states overnight.
The storm moved slowly west 120 km (75 miles)from Brisbane and 85 kilometres (53 miles) from the tourist city Gold Coast, the weather bureau said.
It brought turmoil that snapped power links to more than 80,000 homes across the two states, electricity firms said, around half of them in Gold Coast.

Television images showed surfers riding the huge seas and people strolling near beaches, forcing officials to warn residents to stay indoors or prepare to evacuate.
“This isn’t a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it’s like to experience these conditions firsthand,” said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “Please stay safe. Be sensible.”
Albanese told reporters that 120 defence personnel would help emergency crews in rescue and relief efforts.
FLOOD IMPACT
Heavy rains dumped more than 400 mm (16 inches) of rain in some parts of northern New South Wales over the last 48 hours, exceeding the mean total for March, data showed, as residents scrambled to save properties from the risk of floods.
New South Wales business owner Thomas Gough was busy stacking sandbags at his shop in Lismore, a rural town about 700 km (440 miles) north of Sydney, which was devastated by major floods in 2022.
“It’s a beautiful place to live most of the time, but it feels like we have one-in-100-year events every five years – there’s nothing we can do about it,” Gough told broadcaster ABC News.
Brisbane Airport shut operations on Thursday and the city suspended public transport. More than 1,000 schools in southeast Queensland and 280 in northern New South Wales have been closed.
Officials have described Alfred as a “very rare event” for Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, which was last hit by a cyclone more than half a century ago in 1974. The city of about 2.7 million had near misses from cyclones in 1990 and 2019.

Title: Europe’s Ariane 6 deploys spy satellite in first full mission
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 06:28:19 +0000
Content: Europe’s new Ariane 6 rocket successfully deployed a French spy satellite in its first fully operational launch on Thursday, completing a return to space for a continent facing questions over its role amid a security rift with the United States.
The uncrewed launcher lifted off from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, at 1:24 p.m. local time (1624 GMT). Controllers later said its CSO-3 reconnaissance satellite had separated smoothly, completing a trio of military platforms.
The twice-postponed launch gave a symbolic boost to European efforts to expand its autonomy on a day that European leaders were holding a summit to sharply boost European defence, though Ariane launch capacity remains dwarfed by U.S. rival SpaceX.
“We are consolidating our independent access to space and helping to guarantee sovereignty on behalf of our citizens,” David Cavailloles, CEO of launch operator Arianespace, said.
European nations agreed in 2014 to develop Ariane 6 for commercial and institutional launches in response to growing competition. But its arrival, originally due in 2020, was repeatedly delayed.
The delays left Europe relying on Elon Musk’s SpaceX for some launches including part of its Galileo positioning system.
COMMERCIAL DEBUT
Since the retirement of the workhorse Ariane 5 in 2023, Europe has had little independent access to space, with war in Ukraine cutting Western ties to Russian Soyuz rockets and Italy’s Vega C grounded for two years until last December.
European Space Agency chief Josef Aschbacher has repeatedly warned of a “crisis” in European space access.
Ariane 6 had staged a partially successful inaugural test flight on July 9 last year, carrying out a series of trials but leaving its upper stage in orbit after a software glitch.
Thursday’s launch was carried out for the French Air Force’s Space Command.
Although carrying a military payload, the journey was technically considered a commercial debut because it was handled by Arianespace, rather than the European Space Agency.
Ariane 6 is built by ArianeGroup, co-owned by Airbus and Safran.
Airbus also built the satellite, while its high-definition optical instrument was built by Franco-Italian Thales Alenia Space (TAS), controlled by Thales and Leonardo.
Airbus and TAS are discussing setting up a new venture to combine money-losing satellite activities as part of their target telecoms market shifts to Musk’s Starlink in lower orbit. Thales CEO Patrice Caine said this week talks remained “exploratory”.

The IndiaAI Mission, approved in March 2024, aims to democratize AI access and strengthen ethical AI practices. Vaishnaw underscored India’s commitment to data integrity, stating, “AIKosha will ensure ethically sourced, consent-based datasets, reducing dependence on foreign and synthetic data.” The platform currently hosts over 300 datasets and 80 AI models, fostering the development of diverse and unbiased AI solutions.
MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan emphasized the mission’s broad impact, noting that nearly 45% of its Rs. 10,372 crore funding has been allocated to the AI Compute Portal. “This initiative will revolutionize AI deployment across sectors and propel economic growth,” he said. He also stressed the need for structured AI investment, aligning with the Prime Minister’s vision of a technologically advanced India by 2047.
A range of new initiatives were introduced, including iGOT-AI, an AI-powered learning system for government officials, and the IndiaAI Startups Global Acceleration Program in collaboration with Station F and HEC Paris. The acceleration program will provide ten Indian AI startups with a four-month immersive experience in Paris, offering mentorship and market expansion opportunities.
The IndiaAI Innovation Challenge, which received over 900 submissions, has shortlisted 30 AI solutions aimed at addressing key challenges in healthcare, governance, agriculture, and climate change. Additionally, the IndiaAI FutureSkills Fellowship has been launched to support AI students at undergraduate, master’s, and PhD levels. IndiaAI Data Labs are also being set up in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities to provide foundational AI training.
The launch of AIKosha, the AI Compute Portal, and other IndiaAI initiatives signals a decisive step toward fostering an inclusive and responsible AI ecosystem. Vaishnaw hailed the progress, stating, “India is witnessing unprecedented growth in AI, thanks to the Prime Minister’s long-term vision for technological advancement. These initiatives will propel us into the league of the world’s top AI nations.”

Title: Jan Aushadhi Diwas 2025: Advancing affordable healthcare and access to quality medicines
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:58:53 +0000
Content: Jan Aushadhi Diwas, observed annually on March 7, celebrates the promotion and accessibility of affordable generic medicines under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP).
A week-long celebration, held from March 1 to 7, highlights the initiative’s pivotal role in providing cost-effective, high-quality healthcare to the public.
Launched in 2008 by the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, PMBJP addresses the issue of expensive branded medicines by offering affordable, generic alternatives.
Its goal is to ensure that quality healthcare is accessible to all, especially the economically disadvantaged, through a nationwide network of over 15,000 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs).
A key objective of the PMBJP is to educate the public on the affordability and efficacy of generic medicines, countering the common misconception that higher prices equate to better quality.
The scheme demonstrates that generic drugs offer the same therapeutic value as their branded counterparts, but at a fraction of the cost. The initiative also encourages healthcare professionals, particularly in government hospitals, to prescribe these affordable alternatives, promoting cost-effective treatments.
Expanding Access to Affordable Healthcare
India, a global leader in generic medicine exports, continues to face challenges with domestic access to affordable medication.
Branded drugs are often sold at significantly higher prices, despite offering the same therapeutic benefits as generics. By providing essential generic medicines at 50%-80% lower prices than branded alternatives, PMBJP ensures that quality healthcare products reach every section of society, with a focus on marginalized communities.
One of the key products offered under the scheme is the Jan Aushadhi Suvidha Oxo-biodegradable Sanitary Napkin, launched in August 2019. Priced at just Rs 1 per pad, it addresses women’s health and hygiene needs across the country. As of January 2025, over 720 million of these sanitary napkins have been sold through Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
In addition, the Jan Aushadhi SUGAM mobile application, launched in August 2019, enhances access to PMBJP services. The app allows users to locate nearby Janaushadhi Kendras, search for generic medicines, and compare prices between generic and branded drugs, offering a convenient tool for managing healthcare costs.
Medicines provided under the Jan Aushadhi scheme are sourced exclusively from WHO-GMP certified manufacturers, with each batch undergoing testing at NABL-accredited laboratories to ensure safety and effectiveness.
The initiative also supports entrepreneurship by providing financial incentives to entrepreneurs, particularly in remote areas, and offers opportunities for marginalized groups, such as women and ex-servicemen, to operate PMBJKs.
Celebrating Jan Aushadhi Diwas 2025
The 2025 celebration of Jan Aushadhi Diwas began on March 1, with Union Health Minister JP Nadda inaugurating a nationwide awareness campaign in the National Capital Region (NCR). The first day saw the launch of promotional vehicles spreading awareness about PMBJP across NCR. On the second day, more than 500 health camps were organized alongside heritage walks and Jan Arogya Melas. The third day focused on children’s health, distributing nutraceuticals, while the fourth day highlighted women’s health and promoted Jan Aushadhi Suvidha sanitary napkins.
Pharmacist awareness seminars were held in 30 cities on the fifth day, followed by the Jan Aushadhi Mitra Volunteer Registration Campaign on the sixth day, encouraging community involvement in the initiative.

Title: Man United draw 1-1 at Sociedad, Spurs lose 1-0 at Alkmaar
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:44:23 +0000
Content: Manchester United took the lead through Joshua Zirkzee but were held to a 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday as Tottenham Hotspur suffered a 1-0 defeat at AZ Alkmaar.
Rangers won 3-1 at Fenerbahce with Vaclav Cerny scoring twice, and Olympique Lyonnais secured a 3-1 victory at Romanian side Steaua Bucharest thanks to two late goals from Malick Fofana.
Manchester United had the only real chance of the first half against Sociedad when Bruno Fernandes had a goal-bound shot blocked and Zirkzee’s follow-up effort was saved.
Alejandro Garnacho hit a shot into the side netting but 12 minutes into the second half he pulled a pass back to the unmarked Zirkzee on the edge of the area and the Dutch forward drove a first-time shot past keeper Alex Remiro.
Sociedad pushed for an equaliser with Brais Mendez bending a shot just wide of the post and they were awarded a penalty for a handball by Fernandes which Mikel Oyarzabal converted to level the tie with 20 minutes remaining.
As the hosts grew in confidence, Mendez forced United keeper Andre Onana into a fine save and substitute Orri Oskarsson put a close-range effort wide but United hung on to remain the only unbeaten side in the competition this season.
Spurs went behind in the 18th minute when Lucas Bergvall put the ball into his own net from a corner and the visitors failed to register a shot on target in the opening half.
Bergvall tried to make amends after the break, hitting a shot from distance just wide but that was as close as Tottenham came to an equaliser.
Rangers went ahead through Cyriel Dessers in the sixth minute and substitute Alexander Djiku pulled Fenerbahce level on the half hour mark but the visitors were back in front three minutes from the break through Cerny.
Dessers had two goals ruled out for offside in the second half before Cerny wrapped up the win nine minutes from time.
Nicolas Tagliafico put Lyon ahead after half an hour in Romania and Alexandru Baluta levelled for the hosts with 22 minutes left but Fofana netted twice in the final four minutes to give the French side a two-goal cushion.

Title: Saudis welcome chance to host US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah next week
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 13:03:43 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia welcomed on Friday the chance to host a meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine next week, its foreign ministry said, adding that the kingdom would continue to do its utmost to help end the Ukraine-Russia war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday for a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ahead of talks later in the week with U.S. officials.
A brief Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S.-Ukrainian talks would be held in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.
“The foreign ministry confirms the kingdom’s continued efforts to achieve lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.”
U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had also said he was in discussions with Ukraine for a deal framework to end the three-year war with Russia, and a meeting was planned next week with the Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia.
In February, Riyadh hosted a meeting between U.S. and Russian officials to discuss ways to halt the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Ukraine was not included in those talks, raising concern in Kyiv and among its European allies.
Zelenskiy met Trump at the White House on February 28 but the encounter descended into acrimony when they clashed in front of the world’s media over their approaches to peacemaking.
Days after the meeting, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine as well as intelligence-sharing with Kyiv.
Overnight on Friday, Russian forces damaged Ukrainian energy and gas infrastructure in their first major missile attack since Trump’s move, piling pressure on Kyiv to accept a swift end to the war sought by the U.S. president.

Title: Nigeria to receive leprosy drugs after a year-long delay
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:50:33 +0000
Content: The World Health Organization says it will send leprosy drugs to Nigeria this weekend after resolving testing hold-ups that contributed to a year-long delay in thousands of patients, including children, getting the medicine they need to prevent irreversible disability.
Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria reports over 1,000 cases of leprosy yearly, a disease caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae, and mainly affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, and eyes. It is curable with multi-drug therapy, but without treatment, the disease progresses and causes disfiguring sores and disabilities like blindness and paralysis. Patients also face significant stigma. But Nigeria ran out of stock of the multi-drug therapy in early 2024 as a bureaucratic delay in supplies and new domestic testing regulations on imported medicines held up the drugs in India, where one of the components is made.A WHO spokesperson told Reuters that Nigeria had run out of leprosy medications, and the U.N. health agency, which organises shipments of the drug, had asked for a one-time waiver on the new testing policy. In January that waiver was granted. “A dispatch of leprosy drugs from India has been confirmed for 8 March, with arrival in Nigeria on 9 March,” the spokesperson said by email.
The delay, which caused significant suffering in Nigeria, is just one example of the vulnerability of a global system that has seen stockouts in countries including India, Brazil and Indonesia in recent years, the U.N. special rapporteur for leprosy told Reuters.
‘THE PAIN IS WORSE’ At ERCC Hospital in Nasarawa state, 200 km (124 miles) west of the capital Abuja, only two leprosy patients were admitted when Reuters visited in February, after 26 others had been sent home since last year due to the shortage, raising the risk of spreading the infectious disease, which is thought to spread through respiratory droplets and prolonged contact. Awwal Musa, one of the patients, said her health had deteriorated in the past year since her treatment stopped. All her fingers were clawed and her legs discharged pus.”Before last year, my wounds were getting healed but now they are getting worse. The pain is worse,” she told Reuters during a visit to the health facility.Health workers at ERCC said their goal in the past year was to prevent patients from being permanently disabled.”If they lose their fingers, where are you going to get the fingers and give them again? If they lose their sight, who will give them sight? The complications are increasing day by day,” said Kuzeh Thomas, a director at the hospital.WHO data shows that Nigeria is one of 12 countries reporting between 1,000 to 10,000 cases annually, behind Brazil, India and Indonesia.Each country requests leprosy doses, a capsular medication, administered over a period of 12 months, from the WHO every year. Health sources said Nigeria’s request was late.Nigeria’s National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control did not respond to a request for comment.The drugs are made by Novartis and donated for free to a WHO programme. Health sector sources said Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control required additional testing for doses produced by Sandoz, a spin-off company of Novartis, when the shipment reached Nigeria, because that component was made in Indian facilities.
Sandoz did not respond to requests for comment. Novartis said it “remained committed to work towards the eradication of this disease” without giving further detail. Quontrol, an India-based laboratory, told Reuters that it inspected the drugs but did not release the results of the inspection. The drugs were submitted for testing in Nigeria in November, and got approval in December 2024. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, Beatriz Miranda-Galarza, told Reuters that “while the MDT (multi-drug therapy) distribution system appears well-structured on paper, in practice, it faces significant structural and political challenges.”Sunday Udoh, head of non-profit Leprosy Mission Nigeria added: “This is the first time we are seeing this kind of very strange, very painful situation where leprosy patients who belong to the poorest of the poor are not able to access this life-saving medication.”

Title: Cadaver dogs and robotic experts deployed in Telangana tunnel rescue
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:25:08 +0000
Content: Rescue operations in the partially collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel in Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district entered their 14th day on Friday, with the deployment of cadaver dogs from Kerala and a team of robotic experts to locate eight missing workers.
The highly trained cadaver dogs, known for their ability to detect human remains even in challenging conditions, arrived with their handlers by an Army helicopter on Thursday. The special dog squad held a meeting with Nagarkurnool District Collector Badavath Santosh and officials from the Disaster Management Authority before conducting an initial assessment inside the tunnel. Their role is expected to be crucial in the search for the missing workers, who have been trapped since February 22, when a portion of the tunnel’s roof collapsed.
Alongside the canine units, a four-member robotic expert team from ANVI Robotics was also deployed to assist in the operation. Accompanied by a professor from IIT Madras, the team entered the tunnel to conduct a detailed inspection using robotic technology. The experts, who had assessed the tunnel’s surroundings on Thursday, returned on Friday to continue their evaluation. Their robotic assistance is helping authorities analyze conditions deep inside the tunnel, aiding in rescue efforts.
The decision to introduce robotic technology was made following Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s visit to the site on Sunday, during which he directed officials to explore all possible means to expedite the rescue. Meanwhile, Disaster Management Secretary Arvind Kumar has been coordinating the efforts, ensuring a steady flow of updates and resources for the ground teams. Upon receiving reports about battery issues and the need for a rock cutter, he arranged for a locomotive to deliver the required equipment into the tunnel.
Rescue workers have been using water jets to clear debris and slush from the accident site. Personnel from multiple agencies, including the Army, Navy, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Singareni Collieries, HYDRAA, and specialized rat-hole miners, have been working relentlessly to remove the obstructions.
The collapse occurred along a 150-meter stretch inside the tunnel, where around 50 workers had been engaged in excavation using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) roughly 14 kilometers from the entrance. While most of the workers managed to escape, eight remained trapped as the tunnel filled with water and debris, complicating rescue efforts.

Title: SEBI issues warning to Nestle India for insider trading violation
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:24:56 +0000
Content: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued an administrative warning to FMCG major Nestle India for violating insider trading regulations, the company informed exchanges on Friday.
The warning, issued by SEBI’s Deputy General Manager, was addressed to the company’s Compliance Officer (CCO).
Nestle India disclosed in a stock exchange filing that it received SEBI’s letter on March 6, 2025.
The violation was committed by a designated person within the company. However, Nestle India clarified that this issue does not have any material impact on its financial, operational, or other business activities.
According to SEBI, the violation involved a “contra trade.” This happens when an insider buys or sells shares within six months of a previous transaction in the same security, aiming for short-term profits.
SEBI regulations strictly prohibit such trades for insiders and their immediate relatives to prevent the misuse of unpublished price-sensitive information. The six-month restriction period is counted from the date of the initial transaction.
Despite the warning, Nestle India’s stock showed resilience in the market. On Friday, the stock rose over 2 per cent to Rs 2,245.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) before giving up some gains.
Meanwhile, the FMCG company posted a 5 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs 688 crore in Q3 of the current financial year (FY25), compared to Rs 655 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal (Q3 FY24).
According to its exchange filing on January 31, the key reason behind the profit was higher sales of its powdered and liquid beverages, including the popular Nescafe coffee brand.
Its total revenue from operations for the quarter reached Rs 4,779 crore, marking a 4 per cent increase from Rs 4,600 crore in the corresponding quarter of last year (Q3 FY24).
Nestle India, a subsidiary of Swiss multinational Nestle S.A., is known for its popular brands such as Nescafe, Maggi, and KitKat. The company manufactures and markets a wide range of food and beverage products.

Title: Indian stock market ends flat, smallcap stocks extend rally
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:09:04 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market experienced a volatile trading session on Friday, with benchmark indices managing to hold steady despite fluctuations. Gains in metal stocks provided some support, while small-cap stocks extended their rally, continuing their recent upward momentum. This followed two consecutive bullish sessions, during which the market had closed in the green.
The Sensex ended marginally lower at 74,332.58, slipping by just 7.51 points or 0.01 percent. Throughout the session, the 30-share index fluctuated between an intra-day high of 74,586.43 and a low of 74,038.03. Meanwhile, the Nifty managed to close slightly higher at 22,552.50, gaining 7.80 points or 0.03 percent. The index touched a high of 22,633.80 but also fell to an intra-day low of 22,464.75.
The markets opened on a weaker note but recovered as buying interest emerged in select blue-chip stocks, including Tata Motors. Oil and gas stocks also contributed to the rebound, supporting market sentiment. However, the broader market outperformed, with the small-cap index climbing 1.1 percent, marking its fourth consecutive session of gains.
According to Krishna Appala from Capitalmind Research, the strength in the market was driven by a broad-based recovery. “Nifty 50 has stabilised near fair valuations, while mid and small-cap stocks continued to witness buying after recent corrections. Sustaining this rally will depend on earnings recovery and broader market sentiment,” he said.
Among the top gainers in the Nifty pack were Tata Motors, Bharat Electronics, Nestle India, and Bajaj Auto. However, some IT and banking stocks faced mild selling pressure, including IndusInd Bank, Shriram Finance, NTPC, BPCL, and Infosys.
The Nifty Smallcap 100 index continued its upward trend, closing 0.67 percent higher, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index slipped by 0.32 percent. Sectoral performance on the NSE was mixed, with Nifty Auto, PSU Bank, Metal, Media, and Oil & Gas indices posting gains of up to 1.83 percent, while other sectors remained subdued.
Over the past week, the Nifty has gained 2.1 percent, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 250 surged by 2.9 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. The market now awaits further cues from corporate earnings and broader economic developments to sustain its momentum.\

Title: Dubai’s Ramadan cannon tradition continues to mark holy month
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:00:40 +0000
Content: The holy month of Ramadan is once again being marked by the distinctive boom of ceremonial cannons echoing across Dubai at sunset. This tradition, known locally as “midfa al iftar,” signals to Muslims throughout the city that it’s time to break their daily fast.
Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic lunar calendar, is a period when Muslims worldwide fast from sunrise to sunset for 30 days. This practice represents one of the five pillars of Islam, serving both as an exercise in spiritual discipline and as a reminder to cultivate compassion for those less fortunate.
The tradition of cannon firing is believed to have originated in 10th-century Egypt as a practical method to announce iftar time. In Dubai, the practice dates back to the 1960s, when it served as an essential community service before modern loudspeaker systems were installed in mosques.
The iftar cannon is an essential part of the UAE’s culture and traditions, still observed in many parts of the country. In Dubai, the iftar cannon is fired from Burj Khalifa, using a replica of the original antique cannon that signaled the end of fast in earlier times.
Beyond its practical purpose, the iftar cannon serves as a unifying force for Dubai’s diverse population. It brings together people from different walks of life, regardless of nationality or religion, to celebrate the holy month. The cannon firing has become a moment of collective celebration, with communities gathering across the city to break their fast together.
Dubai Police now oversee this ceremonial firing at several locations throughout the emirate, including near the Burj Khalifa and at prayer grounds in Al Mankhool and Al Baraha.
The protocol follows specific traditions: two consecutive cannon fires announce the beginning of Ramadan, while a single shot marks iftar each evening. When Ramadan concludes with Eid Al Fitr, cannons are fired twice to announce the festival’s beginning and twice again on Eid morning.
Despite technological advances that have made the cannon unnecessary as a timekeeping device – with mosques now using modern speaker systems for the call to prayer, or “adhan” – this beloved tradition continues to thrive as a cultural touchstone connecting Dubai’s rapid modernization with its rich heritage.

Title: India’s growth outlook strong, RBI likely to cut rates again in April: HSBC report
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:53:34 +0000
Content: India’s long-term economic outlook remains robust, with the investment cycle on a steady medium-term uptrend, according to HSBC Mutual Fund’s Market Outlook Report 2025, released on Friday. The report attributes this positive trajectory to government-led infrastructure and manufacturing investments, rising private sector investments, and a recovering real estate cycle.
The report anticipates increased private investments in renewable energy, high-tech manufacturing, and deeper integration into global supply chains, all of which are expected to accelerate India’s economic growth.
Following recent market corrections, the report suggests that Nifty valuations are now aligned with their five- and ten-year averages. “Post the recent correction, Nifty valuations are now in line with its 5/10-year average. We remain constructive on Indian equities supported by the more robust medium-term growth outlook,” the report stated.
Currently, Nifty trades at an 18.1x one-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, reflecting a 7% discount to its five-year average while aligning with its ten-year average. Additionally, valuations in the midcap and smallcap segments have moderated after sharp corrections in January and February.
Macroeconomic Challenges and Growth Outlook
Despite a challenging global macroeconomic environment marked by geopolitical and economic uncertainties, India’s GDP growth reached 6.2% year-on-year in Q3 FY25.
The report acknowledges that while the government has attempted to address slowing private consumption through income tax reductions in the Union Budget, private capital expenditure (capex) remains crucial for sustaining economic momentum. Government capex, which has been a key driver of growth, is expected to moderate, with spending growth projected at 7% year-on-year in FY25 and 10% in FY26.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its efforts to support economic growth through monetary easing. HSBC projects another 25-basis-point rate cut in April, citing the growth-inflation balance and signals from recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussions.
“The real economy, as of now, has evinced resilience to global developments. Based on growth-inflation trends, the MPC’s last policy action, and the latest MPC minutes, we believe the RBI-MPC would deliver another 25 bps cut at its April policy while continuing to stay nimble and flexible on its liquidity strategy,” the report stated.
A potential third rate cut will depend on factors such as the inflation trajectory, monsoon conditions, and global economic developments, which will be key considerations for the RBI’s June policy review.
On the debt outlook, the report notes that after a sharp decline in January, currency levels showed improvement in February, aided by the RBI’s policy measures, including foreign exchange (FX) buy/sell USD swap windows.

Title: Bangladesh police use tear gas to disperse Islamist march in Dhaka
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:46:13 +0000
Content: Police in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka used tear gas and sound grenades on Friday to disperse hundreds of members of the banned militant group Hizb-ut-Tahrir seeking to march to demand the country’s secular democracy be replaced by an Islamic caliphate.
Hundreds of activists chanting “Khilafat, Khilafat” gathered for the ‘March for Khilafat’ procession at the Baitul Mukarram Mosque after Friday prayers, defying police barricades.
Police were unable to control the crowd and had to use tear gas and sound grenades to disperse them, witnesses said. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police had warned banned organisations on Thursday against holding public meetings and rallies.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir, banned in Bangladesh since October 2009 for posing a threat to national security, has frequently organised protests and marches in defiance of a government ban on public gatherings.
The London-based Hizb-ut-Tahrir seeks to unite Muslims in a pan-Islamic state but says its means are peaceful.
The Muslim-majority country of 170 million people is one of the world’s largest and poorest democracies.
It has been grappling with political unrest since an interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, took over following protests that drove then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina out of the country.

Content: The Fisheries Startup Conclave 2.0 will be organised on 8th March 2025 in Hyderabad, Telangana, by the Department of Fisheries under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying (MoFAH&D). The event will be attended by key figures, including Union Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Minister of State George Kurian, and Minister of State Prof. S.P. Singh Baghel. 
The conclave aims to bring together key stakeholders to promote innovation in the fisheries sector, with a particular focus on startup opportunities in fisheries and aquaculture.
The conclave will also serve as the platform for the launch of the National Fisheries Digital Platform Mobile App. This initiative will streamline access to fisheries-related services and resources, facilitating easier engagement for entrepreneurs and startups in the sector.
Along with the app launch, the Fisheries Startup Grand Challenge 2.0 will be unveiled to encourage innovation and technological advancements within the fisheries industry. The event will also feature the distribution of Entrepreneur Model approvals to fisheries startups, providing recognition and support to emerging enterprises in the sector.
In addition to the official launches, the conclave will include technical sessions and discussions on the evolving fisheries ecosystem in India. Stakeholders, including government officials and fisheries startups, will exchange feedback and insights on key initiatives undertaken by the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). This will also be a platform for startups to share their experiences and innovations.
India’s fisheries and aquaculture sector is a significant contributor to the nation’s economy, sustaining over 3 crore livelihoods and creating employment across various segments of the value chain.
Since 2015, the government has invested ₹38,572 crore in the sector through initiatives like the Blue Revolution Scheme, Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). This investment has led to the growth of over 300 fisheries startups that utilize advanced technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and AI to address challenges, enhance productivity, and improve the value chain.

Title: Namami Gange Programme achieves major milestones in river Ganga restoration
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 18:31:44 +0000
Content: The Namami Gange Programme, launched by the Government of India in 2014, has marked significant progress in its mission to rejuvenate the sacred River Ganga. With an integrated approach encompassing pollution abatement, ecological restoration, capacity building, and community engagement, the initiative stands as a testament to India’s commitment to preserving its most revered river.
The programme, backed by a financial outlay of Rs. 42,500 crore, is designed as a long-term investment, ensuring sustainability through annuity payments and operational maintenance over a 17-year cycle. Of the Rs. 20,424.82 crore allocated between 2014-15 and 2023-24, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has disbursed Rs. 16,648.49 crore, amounting to 82% of the total budget.
The adoption of the Hybrid Annuity Model has played a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and longevity of sewage treatment plants (STPs), ensuring that pollution control measures remain effective in the years to come.
The achievements of the programme are evident in the significant expansion of sewage treatment capacity, which has surged to 3,446 MLD—an astonishing thirtyfold increase compared to pre-2014 levels. Over the past eight years, 127 projects and 152 STPs have been completed, contributing immensely to restoring the purity of the Ganga.
Financial contributions from the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF) have further bolstered efforts, with donations pouring in from individuals, non-resident Indians, and corporate entities. Notably, individual citizens form the backbone of this funding initiative, accounting for 95% of contributions, while private corporations and public sector enterprises make up the remaining 5%.
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported remarkable improvements in water quality across multiple states. In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, the stretch of the Ganga from Kannauj to Varanasi, which was classified under PRS III in 2015 due to high biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels, has now improved to PRS V, reflecting significantly reduced pollution. Over 90% of the state’s 135 operational STPs are now compliant with pollution control norms. Bihar has witnessed similar progress, with the river stretch from Buxar to Bhagalpur improving from PRS II in 2015 to PRS IV in 2022.
Meanwhile, in West Bengal, the Triveni to Diamond Harbour stretch has also shown positive results, advancing from PRS III to PRS IV. The impact is equally visible in Prayagraj, where treatment capacity has increased from 268 MLD in 2017 to 348 MLD in 2024, and all previously untapped drains have now been addressed. In Varanasi, treatment capacity has quadrupled from 100 MLD to 420 MLD, with only one drain remaining partially untapped.
Beyond pollution control, the ecological revival of the river is evident in the resurgence of the Gangetic Dolphin population. According to a study conducted by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the dolphin population has grown from 3,330 (+/- 630) in 2018 to 3,936 (+/- 763) in 2024.

Title: PM Modi launches Surat food security saturation campaign, expands food security benefits
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:26:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched the Surat Food Security Saturation Campaign, reaffirming the government’s commitment to ensuring comprehensive food security for the underprivileged. As part of the initiative, he distributed benefits under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to approximately 2 lakh eligible beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).
Following a roadshow in Surat, Modi was felicitated by Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Union Minister CR Patil. The campaign is part of a larger effort to strengthen food security by expanding coverage under the NFSA and PMGKAY, ensuring that no eligible individual is left without access to subsidized food grains.
The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide free, high-quality food grains to economically weaker families. In Gujarat alone, more than 76 lakh NFSA cards have been issued, covering approximately 3.72 crore people.
The Gujarat government has taken additional steps to classify beneficiaries under various social security schemes—such as the Ganga Swaroopa Aarthik Sahay Yojana for widows, the Vruddh Pension Sahay Yojana for the elderly, and the Divyang Sahay Yojana for persons with disabilities—as priority households under the NFSA, regardless of their income. This move ensures that they receive both subsidized food grains and additional free food grains under PMGKAY.
Under PM Modi’s scheme saturation approach and CM Bhupendra Patel’s commitment to Antyodaya Kalyan (upliftment of the underprivileged), the Surat District Food Security Saturation Campaign was launched to bring more eligible beneficiaries under the scheme.
Special efforts were made to identify and include marginalized groups, including widowed women, elderly individuals, persons with disabilities, and daily wage earners who were not previously covered.
The district administration conducted a detailed survey to map existing beneficiaries and identify those still excluded. Taluka and zonal-level teams worked in mission mode over the past year to ensure that all eligible individuals were brought under NFSA coverage.
As a result, approximately 2 lakh beneficiaries have now been identified and included under the scheme, ensuring that they receive regular food security benefits.
As per NFSA provisions, each cardholder is entitled to 5 kilograms of food grains, including wheat and rice, per person per month. In addition to this, the Gujarat government provides further nutritional support through subsidized essential food items.
Beneficiaries receive Toor Dal at ₹50 per kg, Chana (chickpeas) at ₹30 per kg, and Sugar at ₹15 per kg for Antyodaya Anna Yojana beneficiaries, while Below Poverty Line beneficiaries receive sugar at ₹22 per kg. Double-Fortified Salt is also made available at ₹1 per kg to enhance nutritional security.
To further support beneficiaries during festive periods, the state government provides additional rations. During Janmashtami and Diwali, NFSA cardholders receive an extra 1 kg of sugar per card and 1 litre of double-filtered groundnut oil at a subsidized rate of ₹100 per litre.

Content: India and Bhutan on Friday discussed boundary-related field matters while expressing satisfaction at the work completed by respective field survey teams and other stakeholders on the issue.
The two sides also discussed the potential for technological and capacity-building collaboration relating to survey and boundary-related work, as per the priorities of both governments, during the two-day meeting held between officials from the Government of India and Bhutan’s Office of International Boundaries in New Delhi to review matters relating to boundary-related fieldwork.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the Indian side was led by Surveyor General of India Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, while Dasho Letho T. Tangbi, Secretary, International Boundaries, in the Government of Bhutan, headed the delegation from the neighbouring country.
Both sides also finalised the work plan for the next three field seasons.
“India and Bhutan enjoy unique ties of friendship and cooperation, underpinned by mutual trust, shared values, and utmost goodwill at all levels. The meeting was held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere and is in keeping with the tradition of regular dialogues in all sectors of bilateral cooperation,” read a statement issued by the MEA.
India and Bhutan share a common perception of their strategic interests and cooperate closely on security issues and border management. India is also Bhutan’s largest trade and development partner and the source of supplies of most of the essential commodities imported by Bhutan.
External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar stated last month how India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy since 2014 has made significant progress, whether it is Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, or Myanmar.
“We have seen new roads, checkpoints, rail links, waterways, power grids, fuel pipelines, and transit facilities. And there is much more to come in the days ahead,” said Jaishankar in a session titled ‘Act East, Act Fast and Act First’ organised during the Advantage Assam 2.0 summit on February 25.
During his landmark visit to Bhutan last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appreciated the Bhutanese King’s vision of the Gelephu Mindfulness City, which will lead to economic prosperity and development in Bhutan and in the region in a sustainable manner, and further strengthen economic and investment linkages between India and Bhutan.
“Be it a new airport for better air connectivity, be it new rail links between Gelephu to Kokrajhar and Samtse to Banarhat, be it operations of waterways through the Brahmaputra, we will soon see these projects completed swiftly. Integrated Check Posts will also be built to strengthen trade infrastructure,” said PM Modi after being conferred with Bhutan’s highest National Award, the ‘Order of the Druk Gyalpo,’ by the King of Bhutan in Thimphu on March 22, 2024.

Title: Trump says he is considering putting banking sanctions, tariffs on Russia
Publication Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:18:12 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is “strongly considering” imposing sanctions, including ones on banking, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace agreement is reached with Ukraine.`
Trump has also paused military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to accept a ceasefire deal after an explosive Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a week ago.
“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Trump said. “To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”
Trump has faced criticism for doubling down on Ukraine, including his comment last month that Kyiv, not Russia, was responsible for starting the war.
Trump’s threat to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russia comes days after Reuters reported that the White House was drawing up a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief as part of the administration’s push to end the war and improve diplomatic and economic relations with Moscow.
Russia, one of the world’s biggest oil producers, is subject to wide-ranging sanctions imposed by the United States and partners after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
U.S. sanctions on Russia include measures aimed at limiting its oil and gas revenues, including a cap of $60 per barrel on Russia’s oil exports.
Former President Joe Biden also hit Moscow with designations on Russian energy companies and vessels that shipped its oil, including Washington’s toughest-yet measures, on January 10 shortly before leaving office.

Title: India gears up for 2028 Olympics, strengthens bid for 2036 Games at Chintan Shivir

Content: The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports convened a two-day Chintan Shivir on Friday in Telangana to strategize for India’s participation in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and reinforce its bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics. Chaired by Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, the event brought together sports ministers from various states and union territories, senior officials, and sports experts to discuss a roadmap for India’s rise as a global sporting powerhouse.
Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse, also attended the session, which focused on key areas such as talent identification, the impact of the Khelo India initiative, infrastructure development, and corporate partnerships. Dr. Mandaviya highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a leading sporting nation and called for a collaborative approach to achieve Olympic success.
The discussions at Chintan Shivir centered on talent scouting, training methodologies, and the expansion of Khelo India centers. Dr. Mandaviya announced that over 2,800 Khelo India academies have been established, with 937 out of 1,045 centers currently operational. He stressed the importance of a national athlete repository with unique IDs to track and nurture talent systematically.
“We cannot afford to let talent slip through the cracks. A scientific approach to athlete identification and development is essential for our Olympic mission,” he said, emphasizing the role of National Sports Federations in streamlining the process.
Recognizing the need to strengthen grassroots sports, the Minister proposed new initiatives under Khelo India, including beach games, water sports, and indigenous sports, to encourage wider participation. Special attention will be given to identifying and training young athletes aged 9-14 for long-term Olympic preparation.
The discussions also addressed the optimization of existing sports infrastructure across states, public sector units, and private entities. The need for a sustainable model for stadium utilization and the establishment of District-Level Sports Schools (DLSSs) was emphasized to enhance grassroots-level scouting and training.
A significant part of the deliberations focused on sports governance, with an emphasis on transparency in National Sports Federations to ensure fair selection processes. Dr. Mandaviya noted that improving coordination among stakeholders and fostering an athlete-centric governance model would be critical in building confidence among young aspirants and their families.
Apart from strategic discussions, the event included a meditation session led by Padma Bhushan awardee Daaji to promote mindfulness and focus among participants. In the evening, a cultural program showcased India’s rich heritage through traditional music and dance performances, reflecting the spirit of unity and sportsmanship.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with Lakhpati Didis on Saturday in Gujarat’s Navsari district. He was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Union Jal Shakti Minister C.R. Patil on the occasion of International Women’s Day.  
A Lakhpati Didi is a member of a Self-Help Group (SHG) who earns an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh, calculated over four agricultural seasons and/or business cycles. To qualify, the member must have a sustainable average monthly income exceeding ₹10,000.  
The Lakhpati initiative promotes diversified livelihood activities by ensuring convergence among various government departments, ministries, private sector entities, and market players. Its strategy includes focused planning, implementation, and monitoring at all levels.  
As part of the event, PM Modi will felicitate five Lakhpati Didis with Lakhpati Didi Certificates and address the gathering. He will also launch the G-SAFAL (Gujarat Scheme for Antyodaya Families for Augmenting Livelihoods) and G-MAITRI (Gujarat Mentorship and Acceleration of Individuals for Transforming Rural Income) programmes of the Gujarat government.  
The G-MAITRI scheme aims to support startups focused on creating a conducive environment for rural livelihoods through financial assistance and mentorship. Meanwhile, G-SAFAL will provide financial aid and entrepreneurial training to SHG women from Antyodaya families in two aspirational districts and thirteen aspirational blocks of Gujarat.  
On the occasion, PM Modi paid tribute to Nari Shakti, acknowledging the strength and contributions of women. In a post on X, he announced that his social media platforms would be taken over by women from diverse fields to highlight their achievements.  
“We bow to our Nari Shakti on #WomensDay! Our government has always worked towards empowering women, as reflected in our schemes and programmes. Today, as promised, my social media platforms will be taken over by women making a mark in various fields,” the Prime Minister said.

Title: US President Donald Trump threatens Russia with sanctions
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 05:58:23 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened sweeping sanctions against Russia until a ceasefire and a final settlement are reached with Ukraine.
“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.
“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.”
Russia launched a wave of aerial bombings early Friday, striking Ukraine with 67 missiles and 194 drones, according to Kyiv. While most were intercepted, some managed to get through, hitting gas and power facilities.
These threats mark Trump’s first strong warnings to Russia. During his 2024 election campaign, he had claimed the war would end the day he took office—or even before. He also asserted that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had remained president. While the latter claim cannot be tested, the former—his confidence in ending the war—is now being put to the test, as the conflict has continued for two months into his second term.
President Trump has successfully pressured Ukraine into preparing for a ceasefire and a final settlement. After a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky during an Oval Office meeting, he announced a pause in all U.S. aid to Ukraine, halting even intelligence sharing.
Following a letter of “regret” from Ukraine, Trump has expressed his willingness to work with Zelensky toward peace. Officials from both sides are set to meet next week for talks, including discussions on a U.S.-Ukraine agreement that would grant Washington rights to Ukraine’s rich reserves of rare earth minerals.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025: Tickets for India vs New Zealand final in Dubai sold out

Content: The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final between India and New Zealand, set to take place on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium, has generated massive interest. All 25,000 tickets for the marquee event’s final match have been sold out.  
Ticket prices ranged from AED 250 for general admission to AED 12,000 for the exclusive Sky Box hospitality, generating an estimated AED 9 million in ticket sales.  
India, unbeaten in the tournament so far, will face New Zealand, who have been solid with both bat and ball under Mitchell Santner’s captaincy. The clash is set to be a thrilling sequel to the 2000 ICC Champions Trophy final, where New Zealand emerged victorious. The Men in Blue will also seek to avenge their defeats to the Black Caps in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup semifinal and the 2021 ICC World Test Championship final.  
India did not travel to Pakistan due to security concerns and played all their matches in Dubai, unlike other teams that had to shuttle between Pakistan and Dubai during the league stage and semifinals. This scheduling has sparked controversy, with former cricketers like Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton arguing that India had an advantage due to minimal travel, consistent playing conditions, and a squad selected specifically for Dubai’s pitches.  
New Zealand, who finished second in Group A, will be keen to learn from their previous encounter with India in the tournament. In that match, India secured a 44-run victory, posting 249 runs in 50 overs and bowling out New Zealand for 205 in the 46th over.  
While spin has been a major talking point in the UAE, it was Matt Henry who stood out for New Zealand with figures of 5/42 in eight overs. For India, Shreyas Iyer top-scored with 79 off 98 balls. Kane Williamson fought valiantly for the Kiwis with an 81 off 120 balls but lacked middle-order support. India’s spinners took nine wickets, with ‘secret weapon’ Varun Chakaravarthy claiming 5/42—matching Henry’s figures—in just his second One Day International.

Title: We love you, coming up to get you: Trump to astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore

Content: US President Donald Trump has announced that he has authorized Elon Musk to bring back American astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) since June last year.  
Speaking to the media at the Oval Office on Friday, Trump said, “We love you (astronauts), and we’re coming up to get you. You shouldn’t have been up there for so long. The most incompetent president in our history allowed this to happen to you, but this president won’t let that happen. We’re going to get you out. I’ve authorized Elon because they’ve been left up there. I hope they like each other—maybe they’ll love each other, I don’t know. But they’ve been left up there.”  
Commenting on Sunita Williams, Trump said, “And I see the woman with the wild hair—a good, solid head of hair she’s got. There’s no kidding, no games with her hair. But, you know, there’s a danger up there, too. They could face failures, which would be very bad. We’ve got to get them out. So, I authorized Elon a week ago. I told him, ‘We have two people up there that Biden and Kamala left behind.’ And he knows it very well. I asked, ‘Are you equipped to get them?’ He said, ‘Yeah, he’s got a Starship,’ and they’re preparing it right now.”  
Trump also said that he would personally greet the astronauts upon their return. “Well, when they come back, I’ll greet them. How about that? No, no, we’re going to get them out. I’ve authorized Elon Musk to go and get them, and he’s prepared to do so.”  
Williams and Wilmore have been stranded at the ISS since June 2024 due to an issue with Boeing’s Starliner capsule, which returned to Earth without them, according to the New York Post.  
The report further noted that SpaceX launched a Crew Dragon capsule in September to rescue the pair, and it successfully docked at the ISS. However, NASA opted to delay their return. In December, NASA announced that the astronauts would have to wait for another SpaceX rescue vehicle, expected to arrive with replacement crew members “no earlier than late March,” followed by a handover period before their departure.

The programme, backed by a financial outlay of Rs. 42,500 crore, is designed as a long-term investment, ensuring sustainability through annuity payments and operational maintenance over a 17-year cycle. Of the Rs. 20,424.82 crore allocated between 2014-15 and 2023-24, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has disbursed Rs. 16,648.49 crore, amounting to 82% of the total budget.
The adoption of the Hybrid Annuity Model has played a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and longevity of sewage treatment plants (STPs), ensuring that pollution control measures remain effective in the years to come.
The achievements of the programme are evident in the significant expansion of sewage treatment capacity, which has surged to 3,446 MLD—an astonishing thirtyfold increase compared to pre-2014 levels. Over the past eight years, 127 projects and 152 STPs have been completed, contributing immensely to restoring the purity of the Ganga.
Financial contributions from the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF) have further bolstered efforts, with donations pouring in from individuals, non-resident Indians, and corporate entities. Notably, individual citizens form the backbone of this funding initiative, accounting for 95% of contributions, while private corporations and public sector enterprises make up the remaining 5%.
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported remarkable improvements in water quality across multiple states. In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, the stretch of the Ganga from Kannauj to Varanasi, which was classified under PRS III in 2015 due to high biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels, has now improved to PRS V, reflecting significantly reduced pollution. Over 90% of the state’s 135 operational STPs are now compliant with pollution control norms. Bihar has witnessed similar progress, with the river stretch from Buxar to Bhagalpur improving from PRS II in 2015 to PRS IV in 2022.
Meanwhile, in West Bengal, the Triveni to Diamond Harbour stretch has also shown positive results, advancing from PRS III to PRS IV. The impact is equally visible in Prayagraj, where treatment capacity has increased from 268 MLD in 2017 to 348 MLD in 2024, and all previously untapped drains have now been addressed. In Varanasi, treatment capacity has quadrupled from 100 MLD to 420 MLD, with only one drain remaining partially untapped.
Beyond pollution control, the ecological revival of the river is evident in the resurgence of the Gangetic Dolphin population. According to a study conducted by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the dolphin population has grown from 3,330 (+/- 630) in 2018 to 3,936 (+/- 763) in 2024. These endangered species have even been spotted in previously unrecorded locations, indicating improved aquatic health in multiple regions.
The Namami Gange Programme has also garnered international recognition, earning a place among the Top 10 World Restoration Flagship Initiatives under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in December 2022. Further strengthening its global standing, the International Water Association has honored the NMCG as a Climate Smart Utility, underscoring India’s commitment to sustainable water management.

Title: Himachal Pradesh Board cancels Class 12 english exam over alleged paper leak
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 13:12:04 +0000
Content: The Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education (HPBOSE) has cancelled the Class 12 English exam for the March 2025 session across all centres in the state following reports of a possible paper leak.  
The issue came to light at a Government Senior Secondary School in Chowari, Chamba district, where teachers inadvertently opened the Class 12 English question paper instead of the Class 10 paper. The Board received anonymous complaints on March 7 via the “Exam Mitra App,” alleging that the paper had been accessed before the scheduled date and time.  
Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education Secretary Vishal Sharma said on Friday that the Board took the matter seriously. 
Exercising powers under Section 2.1.2 of the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education Examination Regulations, 1993 (amended up to July 2017), the Board’s chairman ordered the immediate cancellation of the exam across the state.  
The “Exam Mitra App” was introduced for the first time during this examination session to enhance monitoring and ensure transparency.

Title: Women pioneers take over PM Modi’s social media, share inspiring stories
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 12:23:16 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday praised six inspiring women who took over his social media accounts on International Women’s Day, highlighting their remarkable journeys and contributions to the nation.  
In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “Since morning, you’ve all seen inspiring posts by extraordinary women sharing their journeys and motivating others. These women come from different parts of India and have excelled in diverse fields, but one common thread unites them—the prowess of India’s Nari Shakti.” He further emphasised that their determination and success exemplify the limitless potential of women, adding, “Today and every day, we celebrate their contributions in shaping a Viksit Bharat.”  
This unique initiative, first announced by PM Modi during his Mann Ki Baat address on February 23, provided an opportunity for six accomplished women to share their stories through his social media platforms. The selected women, representing different regions and fields, showcased empowerment through their achievements.  
Among them was Vaishali Rameshbabu from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, a Chess Grandmaster who has been competing at the highest level since the age of six. Her dedication to the sport culminated in earning the prestigious Grandmaster title in 2023. She continues to make India proud on the global chess stage with her strategic brilliance.  
Anita Devi from Nalanda, Bihar, known as the Mushroom Lady of Bihar, also shared her journey. Overcoming hardships, she established the Madhopur Farmers Producers Company in 2016, empowering hundreds of rural women through mushroom cultivation. Her initiative has helped women achieve financial independence and provided employment opportunities in the region.  
Elina Mishra from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and Shilpi Soni from Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, narrated their experiences as leading scientists contributing to India’s progress in research and technology. Mishra serves as a nuclear scientist at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, while Soni is a space scientist at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Their contributions highlight the growing influence of Indian women in scientific advancements.  
Ajaita Shah from Rajasthan, the Founder and CEO of Frontier Markets, has been instrumental in transforming rural entrepreneurship. Through her initiative, over 35,000 digitally skilled women entrepreneurs have been empowered, helping bridge the gap between local markets and economic development by distributing essential goods and services.  
Dr Anjlee Agarwal from Delhi, a longtime advocate for universal accessibility, also shared her story. As the founder of Samarthyam Centre for Universal Accessibility, she has spent more than three decades working toward inclusive mobility and barrier-free infrastructure, ensuring that schools and public spaces become more accessible for people with disabilities.  
The stories of these women serve as a testament to the strength, resilience, and determination of Indian women in shaping the nation’s future. Their achievements reinforce the belief that women are not just participants but pioneers in various fields, contributing significantly to the vision of a Viksit Bharat.  
Through this initiative, PM Modi successfully highlighted the inspiring journeys of these exceptional women, encouraging others to follow their path and contribute to India’s progress.

Title: Memory impairment in aged rats after three days of high-fat diet: Study
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 11:52:39 +0000
Content: A study conducted at The Ohio State University suggests that consuming a high-fat diet for just three days can lead to memory impairments and brain inflammation in older rats, even before obesity develops.  
Researchers fed separate groups of young and old rats a high-fat diet for either three days or three months to analyze how quickly diet-induced changes occur in the brain compared to the rest of the body. After three months, all rats on the high-fat diet showed metabolic issues, gut inflammation, and altered gut bacteria compared to those on a standard laboratory diet. However, after just three days, no significant metabolic or gut changes were observed.  
Notably, brain inflammation and memory deficits appeared only in older rats, regardless of whether they had been on the high-fat diet for three days or three months. 
These findings challenge the assumption that diet-related brain inflammation in aging is solely linked to obesity, said senior study author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator at Ohio State’s Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research.  
“Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable. We found that within just three days—long before obesity sets in—significant neuroinflammatory changes occur,” said Barrientos, who is also an associate professor at Ohio State’s College of Medicine.  
The study, published in Immunity & Ageing, highlights the rapid impact of unhealthy dietary choices on brain health, particularly in aging populations.

Title: Delhi govt approves Mahila Samridhi Yojana to provide Rs 2,500 to women
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 11:28:03 +0000
Content: Union Minister and BJP President JP Nadda on Saturday launched the ‘Mahila Samridhi Yojana,’ a direct cash transfer scheme for women in Delhi.
Addressing a public event on International Women’s Day in the national capital, Nadda announced that the scheme, which provides ₹2,500 to women in Delhi, has been approved.  
“I am happy today and congratulate Chief Minister Rekha Gupta and others for allocating ₹5,100 crore to implement the Mahila Samridhi Yojana in Delhi,” Nadda said.  
He also acknowledged the role of women in the BJP’s electoral success in Delhi. “On Women’s Day, I salute women’s empowerment and thank the women of Delhi for their significant contribution in forming the BJP government. This victory has been possible only with their blessings and support,” he added.  
Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva confirmed that ₹5,100 crore has been sanctioned for one year to implement the scheme. “We will now begin registration, and the scheme will be rolled out soon,” he stated.  
Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa added, “The scheme has been approved, and its portal will soon be activated for women to apply. Information regarding eligibility criteria and other details will be provided. A committee of three ministers—Kapil Mishra, Ashish Sood, and Pravesh Verma—has been formed to finalize the criteria and other aspects of the scheme. I congratulate everyone on this initiative.”  
Addressing the gathering, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta assured that the BJP-led government in the national capital would fulfill all its promises. “Women from across the country, from North to South and from Gujarat to the Northeast, are sending their congratulations. Women from different fields are happy,” she said.  
She also highlighted the Modi government’s commitment to women’s welfare. “The only government that approved 33 percent reservation for women is Narendra Modi’s government. We will work to ensure women’s welfare and security. We will fulfill all our promises. We have also built pink toilets in Delhi to enhance women’s safety,” she added.  
Ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, which concluded earlier this year, the BJP had pledged to provide ₹2,500 to women in Delhi as part of its campaign promises.

Title: Cooling inflation could pave way for RBI rate cuts: report
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 08:58:34 +0000
Content: India’s inflation fell to 4.31 per cent in January from 5.22 per cent, approaching the RBI’s 4 per cent target after four months above 5 per cent and this trend reinforces the case for potential rate cuts, with the repo rate at 6.25 per cent, a new report showed on Saturday. 
The observed market trajectory suggests a cautious sentiment among investors, potentially influenced by macroeconomic conditions, sector-specific developments, and global financial market trends, according to the Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund report.
The Nifty 500 Index declined by 7.88 per cent in February, reflecting contractions across multiple sectors. Factor-based strategies reflected broader market movement, while fixed-income instruments, including Nifty 5 year Benchmark G-Sec (+0.53 per cent), exhibited relative stability.
Globally, developed markets displayed mixed movements, where Switzerland (+3.47 per cent) and United Kingdom (+3.08 per cent) registered gains, while Japan (-1.38 per cent) showed a contraction, the report mentioned.
The US CPI inflation stood at 3 per cent, reflecting marginal increase from 2.90 per cent in the prior month.
Another HSBC report mentioned that India’s long-term outlook remains strong and the investment cycle is projected to be on a medium-term uptrend supported by government investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, pickup in private investments, and a recovery in the real estate cycle.
The HSBC Mutual Fund’s ‘Market Outlook Report 2025’ expects higher private investments in renewable energy and related supply chains, localisation of higher-end technology components, and India becoming a more meaningful part of global supply chains to support faster growth.
The real economy, as of now, has evinced resilience to global developments.
“Basis the growth-inflation numbers, the MPC’s last policy action as well as the MPC minutes, we believe the RBI-MPC would deliver another 25 bps cut at its April policy while continuing to stay nimble and flexible on its liquidity strategy,” the report projected.
For a third rate cut, inflation trajectory, monsoon outlook and global developments will possibly be key inputs going into the June policy meeting

Title: I am wealthiest person because my account is filled with blessings of mothers and sisters: PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 08:32:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday emphasized that respecting women is the foundation of a nation’s development, and in this spirit, Bharat has embraced the path of women-led growth.  
Addressing a public gathering after launching various schemes, including G-SAFAL and G-MAITRI in Navsari, PM Modi said, “I am the wealthiest person because my account is filled with the blessings of mothers and sisters, and these blessings continue to grow.”
“Women have been called ‘Narayani.’ Respecting women is the first step toward a nation’s development. That is why, to build a developed India and accelerate national growth, India has now taken the path of women-led development. Our government prioritizes both the dignity and convenience of women in their daily lives. We have built toilets for crores of women, enhancing their dignity, and connected crores of women to the banking system by opening bank accounts for them,” he said.  
The Prime Minister also highlighted his government’s efforts to provide Ujjwala cylinders to free women from the hardships of smoke exposure.  
“Working women previously received only 12 weeks of maternity leave. Our government increased this to 26 weeks. For years, our Muslim sisters demanded the abolition of triple talaq. By enacting a law against it, our government saved the lives of lakhs of Muslim women from distress. When Article 370 was in place in Kashmir, women and daughters there were deprived of several rights. If they married someone from outside the state, they lost their right to ancestral property. After the abrogation of Article 370, women in Jammu and Kashmir now enjoy all their rights,” PM Modi said.  
“Modi showed how to respect the Constitution by abrogating Article 370,” he added.  
Furthermore, Prime Minister Modi stressed that women today are participating at the highest levels in major institutions and across various sectors.  
“Since 2014, women’s participation in key positions across the country has grown significantly. After 2014, the central government appointed the highest number of women ministers. The representation of women in Parliament has also increased notably. In 2019, for the first time, 78 women MPs were elected. This time, there are also 74 women MPs,” he said.  
PM Modi also noted the increasing presence of women in the judiciary.  
“In district courts, women now constitute over 35 percent of the workforce. In several states, more than 50 percent of newly appointed civil judges are women. Today, India is the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, with women investors playing a crucial role in nearly half of these startups,” he said.  
“India is reaching new heights in space science, with many major missions being led by women scientists. We take pride in the fact that India has the highest number of women pilots in the world,” PM Modi said.

Title: India, New Zealand set for Dubai showdown: Recent clashes fuel Champions Trophy final anticipation
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 07:38:06 +0000
Content: Dubai is buzzing with anticipation as India and New Zealand prepare to face off in the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 final on March 9th. 
Recent ODI encounters between these cricketing powerhouses have set the stage for a compelling showdown. India enters the final with a strong record, having secured a decisive 44-run victory over New Zealand in the tournament’s group stage just a week prior. That win, fueled by a dominant all-round performance, solidified India’s position at the top of the group.
The two teams also clashed in the 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup semi-final in Mumbai, where India emerged victorious by 70 runs. India’s batting lineup, led by explosive starts from Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, and bolstered by centuries from Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, posted a formidable total. While New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell and Kane Williamson mounted a spirited chase, Mohammed Shami’s exceptional bowling spell ultimately sealed India’s place in the final. Prior to that, in the 2023 Cricket World Cup group stage in Dharamshala, India secured a four-wicket victory, continuing their successful home tournament run.
New Zealand’s last ICC ODI victory against India came in the 2019 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup semi-final in Manchester. In that match, New Zealand defended a total of 239/8, with key knocks from Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson. Despite a valiant fightback from Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni, India fell short by 18 runs.
While India has demonstrated dominance in recent matches, New Zealand’s ability to perform under pressure remains a significant factor. The 2019 victory serves as a reminder of their capacity to upset the odds. The upcoming final promises a high-stakes contest, with India’s powerful batting facing off against New Zealand’s experienced bowling attack. Both teams will draw on their past experiences as they vie for the Champions Trophy title.

Title: Gujarat: PM Modi interacts with ‘Lakhpati Didis’ in Navsari on International Women’s Day
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 06:36:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with Lakhpati Didis on Saturday in Gujarat’s Navsari district. He was accompanied by Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Union Jal Shakti Minister C.R. Patil on the occasion of International Women’s Day.  
A Lakhpati Didi is a member of a Self-Help Group (SHG) who earns an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh, calculated over four agricultural seasons and/or business cycles. To qualify, the member must have a sustainable average monthly income exceeding ₹10,000.  
The Lakhpati initiative promotes diversified livelihood activities by ensuring convergence among various government departments, ministries, private sector entities, and market players. Its strategy includes focused planning, implementation, and monitoring at all levels.  
As part of the event, PM Modi will felicitate five Lakhpati Didis with Lakhpati Didi Certificates and address the gathering. He will also launch the G-SAFAL (Gujarat Scheme for Antyodaya Families for Augmenting Livelihoods) and G-MAITRI (Gujarat Mentorship and Acceleration of Individuals for Transforming Rural Income) programmes of the Gujarat government.  
The G-MAITRI scheme aims to support startups focused on creating a conducive environment for rural livelihoods through financial assistance and mentorship. Meanwhile, G-SAFAL will provide financial aid and entrepreneurial training to SHG women from Antyodaya families in two aspirational districts and thirteen aspirational blocks of Gujarat.  
On the occasion, PM Modi paid tribute to Nari Shakti, acknowledging the strength and contributions of women. In a post on X, he announced that his social media platforms would be taken over by women from diverse fields to highlight their achievements.  
“We bow to our Nari Shakti on #WomensDay! Our government has always worked towards empowering women, as reflected in our schemes and programmes. Today, as promised, my social media platforms will be taken over by women making a mark in various fields,” the Prime Minister said.

Title: US President Donald Trump threatens Russia with sanctions
Publication Date: Sat, 08 Mar 2025 05:58:23 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened sweeping sanctions against Russia until a ceasefire and a final settlement are reached with Ukraine.
“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.
“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.”
Russia launched a wave of aerial bombings early Friday, striking Ukraine with 67 missiles and 194 drones, according to Kyiv. While most were intercepted, some managed to get through, hitting gas and power facilities.
These threats mark Trump’s first strong warnings to Russia. During his 2024 election campaign, he had claimed the war would end the day he took office—or even before. He also asserted that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had remained president. While the latter claim cannot be tested, the former—his confidence in ending the war—is now being put to the test, as the conflict has continued for two months into his second term.
President Trump has successfully pressured Ukraine into preparing for a ceasefire and a final settlement. After a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky during an Oval Office meeting, he announced a pause in all U.S. aid to Ukraine, halting even intelligence sharing.
Following a letter of “regret” from Ukraine, Trump has expressed his willingness to work with Zelensky toward peace. Officials from both sides are set to meet next week for talks, including discussions on a U.S.-Ukraine agreement that would grant Washington rights to Ukraine’s rich reserves of rare earth minerals.
