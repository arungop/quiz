Title: When National Platforms like Padma Awards are democratized by the govt and freed from the lobby system
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 13:16:57 +0000
Content: The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 with the vision of recognizing and honoring exceptional contributions by individuals in various fields of public service and excellence. The vision was to celebrate merit, selfless service, and outstanding achievements in disciplines such as art, literature, science, education, sports, medicine, social work, public affairs, and trade & industry, aiming to acknowledge excellence and dedication to public service without distinction of race, occupation, or sex. The key principles behind the awards is promoting National Pride – instil a sense of inspiration and patriotism, encouraging individuals to contribute to the nation’s growth and progress. The Padma Awards were divided into three categories – Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (for distinguished service of high order) and Padma Shri (for distinguished service in any field).
For a long period of time however, the Padma Awards were being primarily received by rich, famous, and established professionals, particularly those from prominent fields like politics, business, and entertainment. This trend led to perceptions of favoritism, since the awards were mostly bagged by high-profile individuals who were well-connected politically and socially. The process was criticized for being elitist, with a lack of diversity in the recipients’ backgrounds and contributions, favoring the privileged gentry over grassroots workers, which created a sense of exclusion for unsung heroes of the country. As of February 2016, data reveals a 30% surge in Padma Shri awards during election years, highlighting a notable trend in their distribution. Just seven states accounted for a staggering 63% of all Padma Shri recipients over the past 16 years, indicating a concentration of honors in select regions. Delhi & Maharashtra alone account for a third of all the Padma Shri awards while Bihar barely had 20 winners, less than 2% of all the awards.
Such exclusion leads to significant implications on the morale and faith of the common citizens, especially the marginalized sections of society. We must understand that every individual is a product of his or her opportunities, hard work is often not enough. For remotely placed individuals, the opportunities and exposure is limited. Despite achieving extraordinary milestones in their fields, they often face systemic barriers like lack of visibility and social exclusion. Prioritizing high-profile personalities over grassroots changemakers reinforce the notion that success and recognition are reserved for those with privilege, network, or celebrity status, rather than for genuine contribution or excellence.
Especially for marginalized communities, this reinforced a cycle of invisibility where their battles, often against overwhelming odds, went unnoticed. It hindered their belief in the possibility of upward mobility, fostering feelings of unfairness and disenchantment with a system that seemed to prioritize the elite. The lack of recognition not only stifled their confidence but also demotivated others in their communities, as it appeared that merit alone was insufficient for acknowledgment. Not that they stopped fighting, but there was certainly a sense of unbelonging. They perceived the government and the well-placed society as enemies who would use, and if required exploit them, but never recognise them. This created a deep divide between the privileged and the underrepresented, challenging the very idea of meritocracy and fair valuation for human resources in a diverse society like India.
Nominations for Padma awards this year 28 times more than 2014, said PM Narendra Modi in February 2025. The Modi government, since 2014, has worked towards democratizing the Padma Awards, making them more inclusive and reflective of the diverse contributions across Indian society. One of the most notable changes was the broadening of the criteria and focus to include individuals from marginalized communities, rural backgrounds, and fields that had often been overlooked in the past. The government emphasized recognizing grassroots changemakers, unsung heroes, and people making significant impacts at the local and regional levels, regardless of their fame or social standing. The nomination process was also made more transparent, with a greater push to involve citizens and organizations in suggesting potential awardees.
In 2016, the Modi government transformed the Padma Awards nomination process by opening it to the general public. For the first time, any Indian citizen could nominate deserving individuals online, ensuring that merit and genuine contributions take precedence over influence or connections. In 2025, over 50,000 nominations were received annually, a increase over 20 times from the 2,200 nominations in 2014. The nominations were meticulously reviewed by a high-level committee before being forwarded to the Prime Minister and President for approval. This initiative sought to eliminate the culture of cronyism, influence, and lobbying. The introduction of an online application portal and an electronic management system leveraged technology to ensure a more transparent and efficient nomination process. It helped shift the focus from established elites to ordinary individuals who were often doing incredible work but lacked the visibility or influence to be recognized through traditional channels. The awards began to reflect diverse sectors, including social work, environmental conservation, innovation in rural areas, and restoration of indigenous arts and culture.
By emphasizing merit over status, the Modi government transformed the Padma Awards into a people’s award, one that celebrates real, tangible contributions that reflect the true spirit of India’s diversity. This move restored faith in the awards’ ability to recognize those who, despite challenges, were working tirelessly for the nation’s progress. In 2019, the government highlighted a “historic selection” of 12 farmers from across 9 states, 14 doctors from 11 states, and 28 artists and social workers across the country. It was an emotional moment for the audience to celebrate 106-year-old environmentalist Saalumarada Thimmakka, affectionately known as the “Mother of Trees”, whose lifelong dedication to afforestation has left an indelible mark on India’s green landscape. Among the 2025 awardees, visionaries like L. Hangthing from Nagaland, also called the “Fruit Man” for transforming fruit cultivation and Bhim Singh Bhavesh from Bihar’s Buxar district revered as the guardian of the Musahar community, stand as shining examples of grassroots changemakers.
The exclusion of marginalized individuals and grassroots contributors from receiving Padma Awards before 2014 directly undermined the very vision of the awards, which was to recognize exceptional contributions across all walks of life. It was important to break this pattern, not only to celebrate the talents without any influential backgrounds but also to inject a spirit of equality among various socio-economic classes. India is a country where the caste system is very deep rooted. Many superstitions and age-old traditions alienate individuals. It was a treat to experience Tulasi Gowda in 2021, hailing from the Hakkali tribe of Karnataka, often called the ‘encyclopedia of the forest’ for planting more than 30,000 saplings, walk barefoot to receive the Padma awards, wearing beads and a saree without a blouse as per the custom of her community and thanking in her local language, on the same platform with say, P. V. Sindhu who was an English speaking woman, more formally dressed as per general perceptions.
The 2025 list found Gokul Chandra Das, a Dhak player from West Bengal who had overcome severe caste-related oppressions to popularize his art form and Bhajan singer Batool Begum from Rajasthan, who promotes Sadbhavana by singing devotional bhajans despite being from a Muslim community.
With such stories defeating the dark caves and shining bright in the sun, I am optimistic that the image make-over of the Padma awards would strongly and sensitively contribute in liberating the people from caste discriminations in the days to come. When the river has started flowing, maybe it will touch every valley. It remains a hope to see many other important national forums, strictly supervised by a selected few gatekeepers, bringing their walls down and opening themselves to create opportunities and recognitions for the deserving, instead of focusing on a selected few beneficiary groups. Because more people mean more dreams, more attempts to make it to the top, more aspirants, more achievers and more empowered societies inspiring each other.

Title: Technological Revolution of India: Overview of Direct Benefit Transfers
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 12:54:13 +0000
Content: The political economy of India, since its independence, can be understood as a struggle to break free from constraints inherited from centuries of foreign rule while aspiring to rise as a nation of global importance. Immediately afterward, the government of our nation emphasized centralized planning, coupled with the public provisioning of essential goods and services. However, even after several decades of this approach, the situation at the ground level did not improve as expected . The situation was marred with cases where citizens were unable to access the welfare transfers meant for them. The section of the population that was able to receive the benefits did not receive them in a timely manner. Furthermore, the entire process was a financial nightmare due to fund leakages at various levels of government. This problem was highlighted by Mr. Rajiv Gandhi during his tenure as Prime Minister in his famous remark: For every rupee spent by the government on welfare, only 15 paise is received by the intended beneficiaries .
The root cause of this issue lay in India’s limited state capacity and the lack of accountability among government officials responsible for the smooth functioning of these welfare programs . However, despite numerous efforts over the years to address these issues, no drastic improvement was observed. A breakthrough was achieved in 2014 during the initial months of the new government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. The solution involved a novel adoption of digital technologies which was called the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mission.
Rethinking Public Service Delivery in India
The inception of DBT can be traced back to 2013 as a pilot project, which spanned only 43 districts of the country and covered only 24 Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored (CSS) schemes. However, there were several challenges that were identified during the initial phase and the biggest among them was the low level of financial inclusion, especially in rural areas. This limited the reach of DBT in our country. In recognition of the problem at hand, the newly elected Prime Minister Modi launched the world’s biggest financial inclusion program in the form of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY).
PMJDY was a game changer right from its launch with more than 1.8 crore accounts being opened for people who were previously out of the formal banking system. This achievement was recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest number of bank accounts opened in a week. The progress showed no sign of stopping with more than 17 crore people benefited in the first year and according to the latest data over 54 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened. The biggest benefit of this scheme has been reaped by people residing in the rural and semi-urban areas with it accounting for more than 2/3 of the total bank accounts opened.
The success of PMJDY paved the way for the creation of the world’s biggest targeted payments framework. Commonly referred to as the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) Trinity, the platform leveraged the near universal adoption of Aadhar cards to uniquely identify beneficiaries, while Jan Dhan accounts enabled with mobile banking services ensured that government transfers reached the people directly, without any delay and with no financial leakages. In the last ten years, DBT enabled by JAM has transformed the landscape of public service delivery in India by ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency.
Transformational Impact
The impact of DBT has been realised since its inception. According to the official data , the total number of schemes using the DBT framework has increased by more than 11 times, from 28 schemes in 2013-14 to 323 schemes in 2024-25. The total funds transferred has also increased by nearly 1000 times, from around 7400 crores in 2013-14 to nearly 7 lakh crores in 2023-24. This has been estimated to have cumulatively saved the government exchequer around 3.5 lakh crores . A comprehensive analysis of the benefits of DBT can be understood in the following manner –
Reduction of Ghost Beneficiaries
In the previous regime, due to a complex chain of intermediaries, the financial resources released by the government would leak to people who were not the intended beneficiaries. However, DBT mission was able to solve this problem by eliminating fake or duplicate beneficiaries using data from Aadhar card as a unique identifier. Further, with the rise in financial inclusion levels, DBT is able to transfer benefits directly to the intended recipient by eliminating the intermediaries. Prominent success stories include schemes like PAHAL, MGNREGS, and PDS that have cumulatively eliminated more than 9.2 crore fake or duplicate beneficiaries.
Ensuring timely transfers of benefits
Another problem with public service delivery before DBT was the untimely transfer of benefits. This was prominent in various scholarships schemes aimed at promoting education and pension schemes operated under the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP). By leveraging the benefits of digital technologies, DBT has been able to ensure that funds are transferred automatically without any delay. This has also brought dignity to the beneficiaries as they don’t have to make rounds to government offices just to ensure a timely disbursal of their entitlements.
Rethinking welfare
The increased transparency and accountability brought in by DBT has also allowed the government to design programmes aimed at widening the understanding of welfare measures. Few examples include schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) which have been able to improve sanitation while also producing multiple secondary benefits like reduction in infant and early-age mortality rate and reduction in crimes against women . Additionally, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) has completely revamped public health insurance by increasing the coverage and removing exclusion clauses which were present in its predecessor. Another example has been the Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) which has been designed to bring dignity to farmers by providing an annual cash transfer of 6000 rupees which can be utilised as per the discretion of the beneficiary reducing the need for money borrowing from informal sources.
Aside from the impact mentioned above, DBT has also proven revolutionary during the COVID-19 crisis by ensuring continuity in government transfers. On top of this, DBT also became the perfect mechanism for delivering the stimulus package (Pradhan Mantri – Garib Kalyan Yojna) announced by the government in the wake of the pandemic. This feat would have been impossible in the era of public service delivery before DBT. 
Leveraging DBT for a More Inclusive Future
DBT mission is one of the biggest success stories in transforming public service delivery in our country. International organisations like the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the Asian Development Bank have lauded the policy instrument in its effort toward increasing the reach of government welfare measures while also curbing corruption and financial leakages. Going forward, the gains in efficiency brought in by DBT possess the ability to allow policy makers to bring more exiting schemes to utilise the DBT framework, while also providing them freedom to innovate with radical new policies aimed at addressing a more holistic concept of well-being. Working on this front will be critical for ensuring that India stays on its path of becoming a developed nation by 2047.

Title: Cholera outbreak kills over 200 people in Angola
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:15:20 +0000
Content: The number of people killed in the latest cholera outbreak in Angola has risen to 201, the country’s Health Ministry has announced.
A total of 5,574 people have been infected since early January, the ministry said.
Cholera cases have been reported in 13 of Angola’s 21 provinces. The outbreak originated in the capital province of Luanda, which has recorded the highest number of cases, followed by the neighbouring provinces of Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, Xinhua news agency reported.
Recently, the province of Cunene registered its first case, putting health services on alert.
According to the WHO, Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibro cholerae. It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases.
Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics.
Cholera can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea, which can be fatal within hours if untreated. Most people infected with Vibro cholerae do not develop symptoms but can spread the bacteria through their faeces for 1–10 days. Symptoms appear 12 hours to 5 days after infection.
Cholera has been known for many centuries. The first pandemic, or global epidemic, was recorded in the 19th century. Since then, six pandemics have killed millions of people worldwide. The current (seventh) pandemic started in South Asia in 1961 and continues to affect populations globally.

Title: India’s growth becoming more balanced as private consumption’s share in GDP rises
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:09:52 +0000
Content: India’s growth is becoming more balanced as private consumption’s share in GDP rose in fiscal 2025, according to a Crisil report.
The mild revision of 10 basis points (bps) in the second advanced estimate to 6.5 per cent takes the expected real GDP growth this fiscal closer to the average of 6.6 per cent seen in the decade pre-pandemic.
“And this is over a sharp upward revision of 100 bps in the previous year’s growth to 9.2 per cent,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, Crisil.
“We expect the GDP growth at 6.5 per cent next fiscal, supported by normal monsoons, lower food inflation and rate cuts of 75-100 basis points in the current cycle that began earlier this month,” he mentioned.
As anticipated, public and household investments were the faster-growing investment components in fiscal 2024.
The financial flexibility and low leverage that corporates enjoy are yet to translate into healthy investments.
The ongoing tariff wars and fear of dumping from China keep the corporate sector cautious on investments.
“The complexity of risks from tariff actions – already initiated and likely to be followed by more such measures in the coming months – is evolving and creates a downside bias to our forecasts,” said Joshi.
The GDP growth accelerated to 6.2 per cent in the third quarter (October-December) of 2024-25, up from a revised figure of 5.6 per cent in the second quarter of the financial year.
The growth rate for the financial year 2024-25 is now estimated at 6.5 per cent while the economic growth rate for 2023-24 has been revised to a 12-year high of 8.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit for the first 10 months of the current financial year (April-January) stood at Rs 11.70 lakh crore or 74.5 per cent of annual estimates.

Title: FAA OKs SpaceX Starship Flight 8 launch after Flight 7 mishap
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 09:29:09 +0000
Content: The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it cleared the SpaceX Starship vehicle to return to flight operations while an investigation into the January 16 Starship Flight 7 mishap remains open.
The FAA said it issued a license authorizing the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 launch for the combined Starship/Super Heavy vehicle from Boca Chica, Texas after the company completed a required safety review overseen by the agency.
The mission also includes a return to the launch site of the Super Heavy booster rocket for a catch attempt by the launch tower, and a water landing of the Starship vehicle in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.
SpaceX said it is preparing to launch as soon as Monday and said “several hardware and operational changes have been made to increase reliability of the upper stage.”
The FAA said SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the new suborbital test flight.
SpaceX’s Starship 7 rocket broke up minutes after launching, sending debris streaking over the northern Caribbean and forcing airlines to divert dozens of flights.
The upcoming flight “will fly the same suborbital trajectory as previous missions and will target objectives not reached on the previous test,” SpaceX said. It said Starship’s forward flaps “have been upgraded to significantly reduce their exposure to reentry heating while simplifying the underlying mechanisms and protective tiling.”
In September, the FAA proposed a $633,000 fine against SpaceX for failing to follow license requirements in 2023 before two launches.
SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, who is leading President Donald Trump’s effort to reform the U.S. government, last year called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker, who opted to step down when Trump took office.

Title: Rubio signs declaration to expedite delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 07:16:48 +0000
Content: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.
The Trump administration, which took office on January 20, has approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to Israel, Rubio said in a statement, adding that it “will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America’s long-standing commitment to Israel’s security, including means to counter security threats.”
Rubio said he had used emergency authority to expedite the delivery of military assistance to Israel to its Middle East ally, now in a fragile ceasefire with Hamas militants in their war in Gaza.
The Pentagon said on Friday that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel.
The administration notified Congress of those prospective weapons sales on an emergency basis, sidestepping a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress.
Friday’s announcements marked the second time in recent weeks that President Donald Trump’s administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also used emergency authority to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review.
On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order requiring it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has also eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid.
The January 19 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.
Hours after the first phase of the agreed ceasefire was set to expire, Israel said early on Sunday it would adopt a proposal by Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods.
Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end of the war.

Title: Five Powerful Lessons from India’s Electrification Success for ‘Mission 300’
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 06:00:18 +0000
Content: Powering 300 million lives across Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 isn’t just ambitious—it’s a game-changing mission that can redefine the region’s future. Mission 300, an initiative led by the World Bank and the African Development Bank, in collaboration with key partners, aims to bridge one of the world’s most pressing energy gaps. But can such a massive feat be achieved within just a few years?
The answer may lie in India’s electrification journey—a transformation so rapid and far-reaching that it rewrote the global playbook on energy access.
In 2014, only 75.8% of India’s population had electricity, trailing behind the global average of 83.2%. A combination of lack of awareness, high connection costs, infrastructure gaps, and logistical challenges left millions in the dark. Yet, in less than a decade, India pulled off what seemed impossible—achieving 100% electrification by 2021, surpassing the global average of 90.4%.
The real turning point came between 2017 and 2019, when India launched an electrification drive unlike anything seen before. In just 18 months, over 26 million households were connected to electricity—an effort so ambitious and efficient that it stands as one of the fastest electrification drives in history.
This wasn’t just a policy shift; it was a mission-driven movement, fueled by strong political leadership, financial innovation, and last-mile execution. While many countries have struggled with electrification for decades, India has shown that with the right intent and approach, progress can be achieved at an unprecedented pace.

Access at: https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity
So, what can Mission 300 learn from India’s experience? A lot. By adopting proven strategies, Mission 300 can fast-track electrification across Sub-Saharan Africa—achieving its goal of reaching 300 million people by 2030 in a way that is efficient, scalable, and sustainable.
Key Strategies and Lessons for Mission 300
1. Strong leadership as the driving force
India’s electrification success was not just about policy—it was about unwavering leadership from the top. Electricity access was treated as a national mission, not just an infrastructure project, ensuring that every stakeholder—from central to local governments—was fully aligned with a clear, time-bound goal.
The government set an ambitious target to electrify 18,452 villages in 1,000 days, announced by the Prime Minister on August 15, 2015. This meant maintaining a pace of 19 villages per day, despite difficult terrains, conflict zones, and bureaucratic obstacles like Right of Way (ROW), railway, and forest clearances.
Key programs like Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Saubhagya launched in 2014 and 2017 respectively were implemented with strict deadlines, direct political oversight, and a mission-mode approach. Unlike traditional development projects, these initiatives had no room for slow decision-making—delays were not tolerated, and leadership was held accountable at every stage.
Lesson for Mission 300: For Mission 300 to succeed, political leadership across Sub-Saharan Africa must own this mission at the highest levels—not as a development goal, but as a top national and regional priority. Governments, regional bodies, and development partners must commit to clear, non-negotiable deadlines, with direct oversight from heads of state and a mechanism to ensure accountability for delays.
2. Institutional strength matters
A key factor in India’s electrification success was the role of established national power agencies that spearheaded the implementation of large-scale electrification programs. These government-backed institutions provided technical expertise, financial oversight, and execution capacity, ensuring that schemes like DDUGJY and Saubhagya were delivered efficiently across states.
The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and the Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) played a pivotal role by coordinating efforts between national and state agencies, managing the disbursement of funds, and ensuring adherence to policy mandates. This centralized leadership with decentralized execution allowed for efficient last-mile delivery while maintaining policy consistency and accountability—key factors in achieving 100% electrification despite diverse regional challenges.
Lesson for Mission 300: For Mission 300 to succeed across multiple countries, it must build strong institutional capacity at the regional and national levels. A dedicated, well-resourced central agency or coordinating body—with clear mandates, technical expertise, and financial oversight—can drive implementation, ensuring that electrification efforts remain structured, scalable, and resilient against political and operational disruptions.
3. Digital tools for smarter execution
India’s electrification success was greatly enhanced by digital tools, ensuring real-time tracking, transparency, and accountability at every stage.
A key innovation was the GARV mobile app, which provided real-time electrification data at the national, state, district, and village levels. This replaced manual reporting, reducing delays and making progress tracking more efficient. The app also enabled milestone-based verification, where contractors uploaded photos of completed work, ensuring better quality control.
To improve on-the-ground monitoring, over 350 young electrical engineers (known as Gram Vidyut Abhiyanta) were deployed across 18,452 villages. Equipped with tablets installed with GARV App, they visited villages regularly, recorded progress according to checklist, updated the progress in GARV app, and flagged delays, ensuring real-time problem-solving.
India’s electrification drive also leveraged informal digital communication channels to enhance coordination and problem-solving. State-wise WhatsApp groups connected young electrical engineers with senior officials, allowing real-time issue resolution and guidance.
Additionally, a social media-driven grievance redressal system allowed citizens to report issues via Twitter, Facebook, and email, increasing public participation and holding authorities accountable. Features like Geographic Information System (GIS) asset mapping and village adoption tracking further strengthened oversight.
Lesson for Mission 300: To accelerate electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mission 300 should adopt a centralized real-time digital tracking system to monitor progress, verify milestones, and enhance accountability. Deploying local field engineers for real-time data collection and leveraging social media for public engagement can significantly improve transparency and responsiveness.

4. One Size Doesn’t Fit All
India’s electrification success was not just about expanding the grid—it was about adapting to diverse challenges through a hybrid model that combined grid extension, off-grid solar solutions, and decentralized mini-grids to ensure universal access.
The grid expansion strategy under Saubhagya played a central role, connecting over 26 million households through strengthened transmission and distribution networks. Special efforts were made to electrify challenging terrains, including Himalayan villages, Rajasthan’s deserts, and dense forests in the Northeast.
For households in remote and inaccessible areas, where grid extension was unviable, off-grid solar solutions were deployed. These included solar photovoltaic (SPV) standalone systems with 200–300W power packs, LED lights, a DC fan, a DC power plug, and five years of maintenance support.
While Saubhagya did not directly fund mini-grids, states like Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh ensured that their ongoing mini-grid projects complemented broader rural electrification efforts, which helped integrate decentralized energy solutions more effectively.
Lesson for Mission 300: A hybrid electrification model—grid expansion where feasible, mini-grids for underserved areas, and off-grid solar for remote households—is key to reaching the last mile. Mission 300 must prioritize both large-scale infrastructure and decentralized solutions to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity access.
Power to the People
Electrification is not just about infrastructure—it’s about ensuring that people adopt, use, and benefit from electricity in meaningful ways. In India, this was achieved through community-driven engagement strategies that created extensive awareness and fostered local ownership.
The government launched nationwide awareness campaigns, educating households on how electricity could improve livelihoods—boosting income generation, enhancing education, and reducing reliance on hazardous fuels like kerosene.
Saubhagya not only provided free electricity connections to poor households in rural and urban areas but also ensured affordability for others through a nominal fee of ₹500, payable in 10 monthly installments of ₹50. This small but structured payment plan ensured inclusion without burdening low-income families, resulting in higher acceptance and sustained usage.
Additionally, India leveraged grassroots networks, partnering with NGOs, women’s self-help groups, and local community organizations to promote adoption. These groups played a crucial role in building trust, assisting with administrative processes, and ensuring that newly electrified homes utilized the power available to them.
In states like Bihar and Jharkhand, women-led groups played a crucial role in driving electricity adoption, especially in regions where households were hesitant due to reliance on traditional fuels or cost concerns. They also helped transform newly electrified homes into micro-enterprises, showcasing the economic value of electricity access.
Lesson for Mission 300: Electrification must be demand-driven, not just supply-focused. Mission 300 should incorporate community outreach, financial support mechanisms, and grassroots partnerships to ensure widespread adoption and long-term impact. Simply bringing electricity to households is not enough—people must see tangible social and economic benefits to fully embrace it.
From India’s Success to Mission 300’s Execution
India’s electrification journey is more than just a success story—it is proof that universal energy access is achievable with the right mix of leadership, strategy, and execution. It demonstrates that scale and speed are possible when governance is strong, institutions are empowered, and innovation drives implementation.
For Mission 300, the challenge is immense—but so is the opportunity. With strong public financing commitments globally and regionally, alongside efforts to catalyze private and philanthropic investment, success will depend on turning investment into action, ensuring transparency, and fostering national ownership. The real test lies not in ambition but in execution, accountability, and the political will to see it through.
Sub-Saharan Africa is on the verge of an energy revolution. The blueprint exists, the tools are ready, and the momentum is building. What’s needed now is bold leadership, decisive action, and an unwavering commitment to power 300 million lives—perhaps even ahead of schedule.

Title: Ramzan Mubarak: PM Modi extends warm wishes as holy month begins
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Mar 2025 04:53:59 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his best wishes to all citizens on Sunday on the occasion of Ramzan, the sacred month of fasting observed by Muslims worldwide.   
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “As the blessed month of Ramzan begins, may it bring peace and harmony in our society. This sacred month epitomises reflection, gratitude and devotion, also reminding us of the values of compassion, kindness and service. Ramzan Mubarak!”
Ramadan commenced in India on Sunday, marking the first day of fasting for Muslims throughout the country. The celebration has also started in various other countries following the sighting of the crescent moon.
On Friday, PM Modi attended the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau and extended his advance wishes for Ramzan. He also praised India’s Sufi tradition for its message of inclusivity and harmony.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also issued an official statement, greeting people on the holy occasion and highlighting the virtues of fasting and service to humanity during Ramadan.
“During these sacred days, good deeds such as fasting, self-discipline, patience, and worship foster values of tolerance, simplicity, and mutual brotherhood,” CM Yogi stated.
Ramadan is a month dedicated to fasting from dawn until sunset, ending with the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr. On Saturday, Maulana Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Mosque in Chandni Chowk, along with various religious organisations, announced that the holy month will commence on March 2, 2025.
According to the Islamic calendar, the sighting of the moon determines the beginning and end of a month, which typically lasts 30 days.
The Shahi Imam stated that because Saturday was the conclusion of the previous lunar month and the moon could not be seen due to poor weather conditions, Sunday was designated as the first day of fasting.
Throughout Ramadan, Muslims observe a fast from early morning until sunset and participate in special evening prayers called Tarawih, during which the entire Quran is recited throughout the month.
These prayers continue until the sighting of the Eid moon, marking the end of the fasting period and the beginning of celebrations.

Title: PM Modi embarks on lion safari at Gir National Park on World Wildlife Day
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gir National Park in Gujarat on Monday and embarked on a lion safari on the occasion of World Wildlife Day. Dressed in safari attire, the Prime Minister was seen capturing glimpses of the Asiatic lions with a camera.
Extending his wishes on World Wildlife Day, PM Modi emphasized the need for conservation efforts, stating, “Today, on World Wildlife Day, let’s reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet. Every species plays a vital role—let’s safeguard their future for generations to come! We also take pride in India’s contributions towards preserving and protecting wildlife.”
Asiatic lions currently inhabit approximately 30,000 square kilometers across 53 talukas in nine districts of Gujarat. The state government has undertaken several initiatives to protect these endangered big cats and conserve other wildlife species. As part of a national project, a National Referral Center for Wildlife is being established on over 20.24 hectares of land at New Pipalya in Junagadh district. Additionally, a high-tech wildlife monitoring center and a modern hospital have been set up in Sasan to bolster conservation efforts.
The Gujarat government has been actively working toward the conservation of Asiatic lions. In 2024, a total of 237 beat guards—162 men and 75 women—were recruited to patrol protected areas and safeguard lion habitats in Gir.
PM Modi has played a key role in the conservation and development of the Gir region. As the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2007, he personally visited Gir forest to assess the ground situation and gain insights into its biodiversity. 
A major step in this direction was the introduction of the Bruhad Gir concept, which expanded the conservation focus beyond Gir National Park and Sanctuary to a 30,000 sq. km area stretching from Barda to Botad, where Asiatic lions are also found.

Title: India emerges as world’s 3rd largest biofuel producer: Hardeep Puri
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:15 +0000
Content: India has emerged as the world’s third-largest biofuel producer, driving the shift toward cleaner, renewable energy, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, said on Monday.
In a post on X, Puri highlighted that India has achieved 19.6% ethanol blending in petrol as of January and is on track to reach 20% very soon, five years ahead of its original 2030 target. This rapid progress is expected to reduce fuel imports and cut emissions.
“From the quiet town of Digboi to the world’s top energy markets, India’s petroleum journey is a story of resilience & progress, guided by the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Puri said.
Over the last decade, ethanol blending has contributed significantly to rural economic growth, increasing farmers’ incomes and creating jobs while reducing CO2 emissions, equivalent to planting 175 million trees, according to official estimates. The initiative has also saved the country Rs. 85,000 crore in foreign exchange.
Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum have introduced various ethanol-petrol blends nationwide and signed agreements with 131 ethanol plants, which are set to add an annual production capacity of 745 crore litres.
OMCs are also ramping up storage and infrastructure to handle higher ethanol blending percentages.
Puri also noted that Ethanol 100 (E100) fuel is now available at over 400 outlets nationwide. The petroleum minister had launched the high-octane E100 fuel at 183 Indian Oil outlets in March 2024.
According to Indian Oil, with an octane rating of 100-105, Ethanol 100 is ideal for high-performance engines. It improves efficiency and power output while environmental impact. E100 can be used in a wide range of vehicles, particularly flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on gasoline, ethanol, or a blend of both.
India has also become the fourth-largest in the world in LNG terminal capacity, ensuring stable energy supplies, Puri said.
He further noted that the country holds the fourth-largest global refining capacity and ranks as the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products.

Title: Navarro outclasses Arango with ‘double-bagel’ to claim Merida Open title
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:12:03 +0000
Content: Top seed Emma Navarro made light work of Colombian qualifier Emiliana Arango with a crushing 6-0 6-0 victory in the final of the Merida Open on Sunday as the American claimed her second career title.
World number 10 Navarro, who won the WTA 250 Hobart International last year, needed just 55 minutes to lift her first WTA 500 trophy, wrapping up a dominant run in the tournament in which she didn’t a set.
With a strong serve and powerful groundstrokes, Navarro never allowed Arango to reach a break point, while the U.S. Open semi-finalist won 71 percent of points on return.
The 23-year-old became only the fifth player this century to win a WTA final with a 6-0 6-0 scoreline, and the first since Iga Swiatek’s victory over Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Italian Open.
Arango, who will reach a career-high singles world ranking of 80 on Monday, could not find her stride following a nearly three-hour semi-final battle against fellow qualifier Daria Saville late on Saturday.
The Colombian world number 133 reached Sunday’s final on the back of an 11-match winning streak, including last week’s winning run at the WTA 125 Cancun Open, but had to play three sets in each of her last three matches.

Title: Tennis-Tsitsipas feeling refreshed after Dubai success with ‘mystery’ racket
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:50:47 +0000
Content: Stefanos Tsitsipas went nearly a year without a trophy before immediately reaping the rewards of changing his equipment as the Greek captured the Dubai Championships crown on Saturday while playing with a new “mystery” racket.
The 26-year-old’s first tour title since Monte Carlo last April ended his long drought in ATP 500 tournaments and vaulted him back into the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time since May.
“These are the things we’re fighting for as professional tennis players,” said Tsitsipas, who climbed to number nine in the world after the latest rankings were released on Monday.
“To be owning a spot in the top 10 is definitely one of the greatest feelings a tennis player can experience. It comes with hard work and sacrifices, but I’m happy that I’m in a position where I can really celebrate.”
Tsitsipas, who was ranked as high as number three in 2023 following a run to the Australian Open final that year, endured a worrying slump in recent months and lost in the opening round of his last two Grand Slams.
His all-court game was no longer a threat to opponents and losses against unheralded players began to mount, but changing his racket for Dubai added the firepower he needed to lift his 12th tour-level trophy.
Playing with a blacked out frame as players do when they trial new equipment, Tsitsipas defeated Lorenzo Sonego, Karen Khachanov, Matteo Berrettini and Tallon Griekspoor before downing Felix Auger Aliassime in the final.
“Comfort is one thing that it brings to my game,” Tsitsipas had said about his racket ahead of the final. “That’s something I was trying to add into my game.
“I’ve been receiving some of that extra help. I’ve spoken about how balls and courts have changed over the last couple of years. That’s just me trying to adapt to that.”
Tsitsipas, who will eye success at Indian Wells and Miami ahead of the European claycourt swing, said it would have been foolish of him not to seek ways to improve his game.
“These changes sometimes are necessary, because you don’t want to be stuck in the same pattern,” the former French Open runner-up added.
“I feel like it’s something refreshing and a good addition so far. It definitely brings that refreshing feeling and adds a bit of life and enthusiasm to my everyday going to work.”

Title: Tamil Nadu class 12 board exams begin; district collector and minister inspect centers
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:41:19 +0000

At Trichy Seva Sangam Girls Higher Secondary School, students began their exam day with prayers, seeking blessings before stepping into the examination halls.
Carrying admit cards in one hand and bags filled with essential stationery, students arrived at their respective centers, prepared to take on one of the most crucial academic milestones. The atmosphere was filled with anticipation as schools ensured all necessary arrangements for the smooth conduct of the exams.
In Trichy, District Collector Pradeep Kumar visited St. Philomena’s Girls Higher Secondary School to oversee the examination process, ensuring strict adherence to guidelines. The district witnessed the participation of 31,580 students, including 324 physically challenged students, reaffirming efforts to provide an inclusive and fair examination environment.
Elsewhere, Tamil Nadu’s Minister for School Education, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, visited an exam center in Nagapattinam, where he met students and extended his best wishes, encouraging them to perform with confidence.
Ahead of the exams, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also conveyed his encouragement to students appearing for board exams. In the 119th episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat on February 23, PM Modi urged students to stay positive and stress-free while approaching their papers.
“These are the times of board exams. I extend my best wishes to my young friends and the exam warriors for the upcoming exams. Approach your papers with a positive spirit, without any stress,” he said.
He also reflected on the growing impact of Pariksha Pe Charcha, an initiative aimed at easing exam-related stress among students. This year, the initiative featured eight expert-led episodes covering topics such as exam preparation, mental well-being, nutrition, and overall health care. Former toppers also shared insights and experiences to inspire students.
“Be happy and stress-free,” the Prime Minister emphasized, reinforcing the importance of a balanced mindset during exams.

Title: Bitcoin up by a fifth after Trump lists reserve tokens
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:39:06 +0000
Content: Bitcoin was trading up more than 20% from last week’s lows on Monday and several other cryptocurrencies that U.S. President Donald Trump said would be included in a new U.S. strategic reserve also rallied sharply.
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including bitcoin BTC=, ether, XRP, solana and cardano. The names had not previously been announced.
Bitcoin and ether will be at the heart of this reserve, he posted on Sunday.
The post sent the world’s largest cryptocurrency up by a fifth from the November lows it was trading at on Friday, helping flip sentiment on a token that has been sliding since mid-January on disappointment Trump has not followed through on pledges to loosen regulation.
It was last trading around $93,057, up from Friday’s $78,273.
Ether is up 10% from Friday’s close and was last at $2,450, XRP was up 31%, solana 15% and cardano was up 69%.
“Trump just gave the pump that crypto traders have been holding out for,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index.
“Any faith that was lost last week appears to have been restored,” and new highs could be made unless there was another wave of risk-off selling, he said.
Chris Weston, head of research at Australian online broker Pepperstone, said it was possible the rally will extend into the first White House Crypto Summit that Trump is hosting on Friday, with the risk that the bearishness in other markets could weigh on sentiment.
While Wall Street closed higher on Friday, the recent selloff in large technology bellwethers such as Nvidia has eroded confidence in bitcoin, which some see as an alternative tech proxy.
Bitcoin fell more than 17% in February, clocking its biggest monthly percentage fall since June 2022 and losing more than a third of its price since topping $105,000 in early January.
Its rally since Trump’s November election was spurred by optimism that the crypto-friendly president would champion a strategic bitcoin fund and end the previous Joe Biden administration’s crackdown on the industry.
But beyond a flurry of appointments of crypto-friendly officials when Trump took office, there has been little concrete news so far around that policy for investors.
“While this announcement has significantly boosted prices, it has also raised concerns,” wrote IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.
The funding for cryptocurrency purchases in the reserve could either come from U.S. taxpayers or the cryptocurrencies in the asset will be those seized in law enforcement actions, he said.
“The latter isn’t anywhere near as bullish as it simply represents a transfer between accounts rather than new buying entering the market.”

Title: Fresh snowfall in Kashmir’s higher reaches as rain showers lash J&K
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:29:24 +0000
Content: Kashmir’s higher reaches experienced fresh snowfall on Monday, while rain lashed the plains across Jammu and Kashmir, bringing relief from the prolonged dry spell that had raised concerns over water scarcity in the region.
According to the Meteorological (MeT) Department, light to moderate rain and snowfall were recorded in several areas, with the possibility of moderate to heavy snowfall in a few higher-altitude locations in north and central Kashmir. The weather is expected to remain mostly dry from March 4 to March 9, with another spell of rain and snow predicted between March 10 and March 12.
The recent precipitation has eased fears of drought, which had emerged due to an extended dry period over the past few weeks. The water levels in rivers, streams, lakes, and springs have improved significantly, reviving several perennial springs that had dried up following a 50-day-long dry spell in January and February.
Kashmir had witnessed only one major snowfall during ‘Chillai Kalan’—the 40-day-long harsh winter period from December 21 to January 30—raising concerns over water shortages in the summer months. The snowfall during this period is crucial for replenishing the region’s perennial water reservoirs, which serve as the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation during the hot summer season.
The dry winter had already begun affecting water availability in many areas, with the Jal Shakti department supplying potable water to localities where springs had dried up. However, the recent spell of rain and snowfall has helped restore water sources across the region.
On Monday, Srinagar recorded a minimum temperature of 4.9 degrees Celsius, while Gulmarg and Pahalgam registered minus 4.3 degrees and minus 0.8 degrees, respectively. In the Jammu region, Jammu city recorded a minimum of 12.4 degrees Celsius, Katra 7.8 degrees, Batote 4.7 degrees, Banihal 3.6 degrees, and Bhaderwah 3.4 degrees.

Title: Egypt says Gaza reconstruction plan ready, pushes efforts for ceasefire’s second phase
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:13:15 +0000
Content: Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Sunday that Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan, which ensures Palestinians remain in their land, is ready and will be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday.
Arab states, which were swift to reject President Donald Trump’s plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and resettle Palestinians, are scrambling to agree on a diplomatic offensive to counter the idea.
Trump’s plan, announced on February 4 amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, appeared to back away from longstanding U.S. Middle East policy focused on a two-state solution and sparked anger among Palestinians and Arab nations.
Abdelatty said Egypt would seek international backing and funding for the plan and emphasised Europe’s crucial role, particularly in the financing of Gaza’s reconstruction.
“We will hold intensive talks with major donor countries once the plan is adopted at the upcoming Arab Summit,” he said in a press conference with the EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Suica.
Israel on Sunday blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza as a standoff over the truce that has halted fighting for the past six weeks escalated. Abdelatty said the use of aid as a weapon of collective punishment could not be permitted.
The first phase of the fragile ceasefire agreement expired this weekend. Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase. “It will be difficult, but with goodwill and political determination, it can be achieved,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said earlier that it had adopted a U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods.
Abdelatty said after Tuesday’s summit, foreign ministers of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation would hold an urgent meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to present the plans.
“We will ensure that the results of the Arab summit are presented to the world in the best possible way,” he said.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also highlighted India’s crucial role in diversifying trade links and boosting Australia’s prosperity. The two nations are working on a new roadmap to help Australian businesses tap into India’s rapidly growing market, set to become the third-largest economy by 2030.
An extra USD 4 million will be allocated to expand the Maitri Grants program, strengthening business, cultural, and people-to-people ties. Australia’s existing free trade agreement with India has already delivered substantial financial benefits, with tariff savings expected to reach USD 2 billion by year-end, further enhancing the economic partnership.

Title: Rs 611 Cr FEMA Violations: ED issues notice to Paytm’s parent firm, managing director
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:30:41 +0000
Content: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday issued a show-cause notice to One97 Communications Ltd, the parent company of Paytm, its Managing Director Vijay Shekhar Sharma, and others for alleged violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) amounting to Rs 611 crore.
The notice was issued by the Special Director of Enforcement (Adjudication), New Delhi, to One97 Communications Ltd (OCL), Paytm’s flagship company, its Managing Director, and its subsidiaries—Little Internet Private Limited (LIPL) and Nearbuy India Private Limited (NIPL)—for contraventions of FEMA provisions totaling Rs 611 crore.
According to the ED’s investigation, OCL made foreign investments in Singapore but failed to report the creation of an overseas step-down subsidiary to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Further, OCL received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from overseas investors without adhering to RBI’s pricing guidelines.
OCL’s Indian subsidiary, Little Internet, also received FDI without complying with RBI’s pricing regulations, while another subsidiary, Nearbuy India Pvt Ltd, failed to report FDI transactions within the prescribed time frame.
The show-cause notice was issued to initiate adjudication proceedings under FEMA.
Earlier, Paytm stated that it would address the alleged FEMA contraventions related to two acquired subsidiaries—Little Internet Private Limited (LIPL) and Nearbuy India Private Limited (NIPL). The company said in a stock exchange filing that these alleged violations pertain to transactions made before the subsidiaries became part of Paytm.
Paytm added that it is seeking legal advice and evaluating appropriate remedies through available regulatory processes.

Title: Pharma sector in focus at India-Vietnam business meet in Ho Chi Minh city
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 12:31:20 +0000
Content: As many as 39 Indian pharma companies connected with more than 50 Vietnamese counterparts, holding productive discussions during an ‘India-Vietnam Business-to-Business (B2B)’ meeting on the pharmaceutical industry organised in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City on Monday.
Comprehensive discussions were held on Indo-Vietnam business ties at the event, which aimed to strengthen the pharmaceutical trade between India and Vietnam. The meeting was supported by the Consulate General of India in Ho Chi Minh, the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
During his visit to India in July 2024, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called for stronger economic cooperation between the two nations, setting an ambitious target of $20 billion in bilateral trade. Speaking at a Vietnam-India Business Forum in New Delhi, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Embassy of Vietnam, he outlined his nation’s economic achievements and invited Indian businesses to invest in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, digital technology, and pharmaceuticals.
He also invited Indian businesses to invest more in Vietnam, particularly in semiconductors, science and technology, innovation, digital transformation, green hydrogen, pharmaceuticals, renewables, and biotechnology. Vietnam currently sources 33 per cent of its pharmaceuticals from India and has expressed interest in establishing a proper pharmaceutical ecosystem in the country to help safeguard the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people.
India and Vietnam have age-old historical and civilizational ties, which were elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Vietnam in September 2016. India considers Vietnam a key pillar of its ‘Act East’ policy and an important partner in its Indo-Pacific vision.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games 2025 to commence in J&K’s Gulmarg from March 9
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:57:43 +0000
Content: The second leg of the 5th Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG), which was postponed due to insufficient snowfall, will now be held from March 9 to 12 after Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir, received significant snowfall.
The second leg, featuring four snow sports—Ski Mountaineering, Alpine Skiing, Snowboard, and Nordic Skiing—was initially set to be held in Gulmarg from February 22 to 25. However, authorities postponed the event due to insufficient snowfall on the ski slopes.
The Ski resort has received good snowfall during the last seven days, and even on Monday five to eight inches of fresh snowfall accumulated on the ground while it was still snowing at Gulmarg.
Officials on Monday said that the event will now start on March 9 and conclude on March 12. “More than 300 athletes from all over the country will compete in events like alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, ski mountaineering, snowboarding and ice hockey. Arrangements for 5th Khelo India winter games 2025 have already been finalised,” officials said.
The first leg of KIWG 2025 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating at Ladakh NDS Stadium and Guphuk Pond &amp; LSRC Army Rink.
The initiative is meant to promote winter sports in India by offering athletes a competitive platform in one of the country’s premier snow destinations. These winter sports provide Indian athletes with much-needed exposure to international level winter sports facilities.
Gulmarg has some of the world’s best ski slopes comparable to France, Switzerland and Italy. The second stage of the Gulmarg Gandola cable car ropeway, which has 36 cabins and 18 towers, takes skiers to a height of 3,980 m (13,058 ft) on Kongdoori Mountain, a shoulder of nearby Afarwat Peak (4,200 m (13,780 ft)
The ski resort also has the world’s highest golf course, where masters like Tiger Woods have teed off in the past.

Title: PM Modi chairs 7th National Board for Wildlife meeting in Gir
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:48:38 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the 7th meeting of the National Board for Wildlife at Gir National Park in Gujarat on Monday. The discussions focused on expanding protected areas, strengthening species-specific programs, and addressing human-wildlife conflict.
The meeting assessed the progress of flagship conservation projects, including Project Tiger, Project Elephant, and Project Snow Leopard. Conservation efforts for dolphins and Asiatic lions, along with the establishment of the International Big Cats Alliance, were also discussed.
During the session, the Prime Minister released a report on the country’s first riverine dolphin estimation, which recorded 6,327 dolphins across 28 rivers in eight states. Uttar Pradesh reported the highest population, followed by Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. The report highlighted the role of local communities in conservation, and the Prime Minister suggested initiatives to raise awareness, including exposure visits for schoolchildren to dolphin habitats.
The foundation stone for the National Referral Centre for Wildlife was laid in Junagadh, with the facility set to serve as a hub for wildlife health and disease management. The 16th Asiatic Lion population estimation cycle was also announced for 2025, following the last assessment in 2020.
The natural dispersal of Asiatic lions into Barda Wildlife Sanctuary was noted, with plans for prey augmentation and habitat improvement to support the growing population. Eco-tourism development was also discussed, focusing on improved travel access and connectivity for visitors.
To address human-wildlife conflict, a Centre of Excellence will be established at the Wildlife Institute of India’s campus in SACON (Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History), Coimbatore. This center will work with state governments and Union Territories to equip Rapid Response Teams with tracking technology, surveillance systems, and conflict mitigation strategies. The Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N) will collaborate with the Wildlife Institute of India to utilize remote sensing, geospatial mapping, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to monitor forest fires and human-animal interactions.
The meeting also addressed forest fire management, with the Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, and BISAG-N expected to collaborate on prediction, detection, and prevention measures in vulnerable protected areas.
The ongoing Cheetah reintroduction program will be expanded to new locations, including Gandhisagar Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh and Banni Grasslands in Gujarat. A conservation program focused on tiger populations outside protected reserves was also announced, aimed at managing human-tiger interactions and supporting co-existence with local communities.
Recognizing the declining gharial population, a new Project on Gharials was introduced to strengthen conservation efforts. A National Great Indian Bustard Conservation Action Plan was also announced to intensify efforts to protect the species.
The Prime Minister emphasized the need to document traditional knowledge and conservation practices from different regions for research and development. Various task forces will be set up for the conservation of Indian Sloth Bear, Gharial, and Great Indian Bustard.
Gir National Park’s success in lion and leopard conservation was highlighted as a model, with plans to document conservation techniques using artificial intelligence for wider application in other protected areas. India’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) was reiterated, with discussions on enhancing international cooperation.
The role of community reserves in conservation efforts was noted, with an increase in their number over the past decade. The Prime Minister also spoke about utilizing AI and other advanced technologies for wildlife monitoring and suggested further research on medicinal plants in forest areas to support animal health management.

Title: Kremlin says someone needs to force Zelenskiy to make peace after clash with Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:35:05 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that someone would have to force Volodymyr Zelenskiy to make peace and that the Ukrainian leader’s public clash with U.S. President Donald Trump had shown just how hard it would be to find a way to end the war.
Trump and Vice President JD Vance clashed with Zelenskiy in the Oval Office on Friday. Trump accused Zelenskiy of disrespecting the United States, said he was losing the war and risked triggering World War Three.
“What happened at the White House on Friday, of course, demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “The Kyiv regime and Zelenskiy do not want peace. They want the war to continue.”
“It is very important that someone forces Zelenskiy himself to change his position,” Peskov said. “Someone has to make Zelenskiy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honoured and praised.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.
Conflict in and over Ukraine had been building for years before his decision. Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 after a pro-Moscow president was ousted amid mass street protests in Kyiv. Russian-backed separatists then began fighting Ukraine’s armed forces in the country’s eastern Donbas region.
Peskov said Putin was familiar with the “unprecedented event” in the Oval Office, adding that it had demonstrated at the very least Zelenskiy’s lack of diplomatic skills.
Zelenskiy said on Sunday he believed he could salvage his relationship with Trump but that Ukraine would not concede any territory to Russia as part of a peace deal.
Russia currently controls just under a fifth of Ukraine – or about 113,000 square km – while Ukraine has seized about 450 square km of Russia in an incursion into neighbouring Kursk province, according to open source maps of the war and Russian estimates.
WESTERN ‘FRAGMENTATION’
After the clash in the Oval Office, European leaders leapt to Zelenskiy’s defence. At a summit in London on Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States.
Starmer also announced a new British 1.6 billion pound ($2 billion) deal that would allow Ukraine to purchase 5,000 air-defence missiles.
Responding to the summit, the Kremlin said the London summit was an attempt to continue the war, not to seek peace, but also noted the divisions between Europe and the United States.
“We see that… a fragmentation of the collective West has begun,” Peskov said.
“There remains a group of countries that rather constitutes the party of war, which declares its readiness to further back Ukraine in terms of supporting the war and ensuring the continuation of hostilities.”
The West and Ukraine describe Russia’s 2022 invasion as an imperial-style land grab.
Putin casts the conflict as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging the NATO military alliance and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.
Peskov said Russia would continue its dialogue with Washington on bilateral ties and would press on with what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.
Asked about Trump’s remarks that he had spoken to Putin on “numerous occasions”, Peskov said: “There have been no contacts that should have been made public” beyond a Feb. 12 phone call.

Title: Sensex closes above 73,000 in volatile trade, metal and realty stocks shine
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:50:59 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets ended nearly flat on Monday after a volatile trading session, influenced by mixed global cues. While early gains were erased by mid-session declines, strong buying in metal, realty, and IT stocks helped the indices recover.
 
The 30-share BSE Sensex settled at 73,085.94, down by 112.16 points (0.15%) after swinging between an intra-day high of 73,649.72 and a low of 72,784.54. The Nifty 50 closed at 22,119.30, slipping just 5.40 points (0.02%) after touching a high of 22,261 and a low of 22,004.
 
Market Performance and Sectoral Trends
Markets opened on a positive note but soon lost momentum, with both Sensex and Nifty dropping nearly 0.5% by noon. However, renewed buying interest in key sectors helped indices recover in the latter half of the session.
 
Among Nifty 50 constituents, 33 stocks ended in the green. Top gainers included Bharat Electronics, Grasim, Eicher Motors, JSW Steel, and UltraTech Cement, which saw gains of up to 4.65%.
 
Conversely, Reliance Industries declined by 2.17%, weighing on market sentiment.
 
The broader market witnessed a mixed trend. While the Nifty Midcap100 index edged up by 0.14%, the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 0.27%.
 
Sector-wise, performance remained mixed. Gains were seen in Nifty IT, Metal, Auto, Pharma, Realty, and Healthcare, with Nifty IT rising the most at 1.26%. However, banking, oil & gas, and media sectors faced losses of up to 1.10%.
 
Technical Analysis and Outlook
Following a prolonged downturn, Indian equities attempted a recovery after enduring their longest monthly losing streak since 1996.
 
Vatsal Bhuva of LKP Securities said that Nifty found strong support around the 22,000 mark and managed to close above the crucial 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 22,043, calculated from the 2022 low of 15,213 to its all-time high of 26,277.
 
However, he cautioned that the broader market trend remains bearish, with a sell-on-rise approach prevailing unless Nifty decisively breaks above 22,600.

Title: UK, France propose partial one-month Ukraine truce, Paris says
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:48:21 +0000
Content: France and Britain are proposing a partial one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine that would cover air, sea and energy infrastructure attacks but not include ground fighting, French President Emmanuel Macron and his foreign minister said.
The comments came amid a flurry of European diplomacy designed to shore up Western support for Ukraine following an acrimonious meeting between President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday.
“Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that’s when real peace negotiations could start,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday.
Under the Anglo-French proposal, European ground troops would only be deployed to Ukraine in a second phase, Macron said in an interview published in Le Figaro late on Sunday.
“There will be no European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks,” Le Figaro quoted Macron as saying as he flew to London for a meeting of European leaders, convened by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advance efforts at drawing up a Ukraine peace plan.
“The question is how we use this time to try to obtain a truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a (troop) deployment,” Macron said.
The French president did not elaborate on how air, sea and energy infrastructure could be monitored.
“In my eyes that can only be possible with NATO or at least NATO command and then Patriot systems, long-range missiles and aviation, which Ukraine does not have,” said a European diplomat. “And you have to negotiate with Russia so that it doesn’t carry out the massive attacks.”
The Kremlin, which has rejected the idea of Western troops being deployed to Ukraine, said on Monday the Oval Office clash between Trump and Zelenskiy showed how difficult it would be to reach a settlement on the conflict in Ukraine.
‘DIFFERENT OPTIONS’
Zelenskiy, asked if he was aware of the plan mentioned by Macron, told reporters in London: “I’m aware of everything.”
On Monday, however, UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard declined to confirm the ideas aired by Macron and Barrot, saying: “That’s not a plan that we currently recognise.”
“Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies at the moment. It’s probably not right for me at the moment to comment on each individual option as they occur,” Pollard told the BBC.
Starmer said on Sunday that European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States, without going into details.
Meanwhile, the parties in talks to form Germany’s new government are considering quickly setting up two special funds potentially worth hundreds of billions of euros, one for defence and a second for infrastructure, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Economists advising the parties that will likely form a new government coalition estimate around 400 billion euros ($415 billion) are needed for the defence fund, the people said.
Friday’s heated White House exchange between Zelenskiy and Trump has increased a sense of urgency in Berlin to act faster on spending for Germany’s own defence and for Ukraine, they said.
European Union leaders will meet for an extraordinary summit on March 6 to discuss additional support for Ukraine, European security guarantees and how to pay for European defence needs.

Title: Women in India driving financial growth, increasing credit awareness: NITI Aayog report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:41:25 +0000
Content: Women in India are increasingly taking charge of their financial futures by actively seeking credit and monitoring their credit scores, according to a report launched by NITI Aayog on Monday.
Titled “From Borrowers to Builders: Women’s Role in India’s Financial Growth Story”, the report was unveiled by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. It highlights a significant rise in financial awareness among women, with 27 million actively monitoring their credit as of December 2024—a sharp 42 percent increase from the previous year.
The report, jointly published by TransUnion CIBIL, the Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) of NITI Aayog, and MicroSave Consulting (MSC), underscores a positive trend in women’s participation in the financial ecosystem. Women’s share in the total self-monitoring credit base rose to 19.43 percent in December 2024, up from 17.89 percent in 2023. Notably, non-metro regions outpaced metro areas in self-monitoring growth, with a 48 percent rise compared to 30 percent in urban centers.
Geographically, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana accounted for 49 percent of self-monitoring women, with the southern region leading at 10.2 million. Northern and central states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, recorded the highest compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) in active women borrowers over the last five years.
The report also highlights a shift in borrowing patterns. Since 2019, women’s share in business loan origination has increased by 14 percent, while their share in gold loans has grown by 6 percent. By December 2024, women are projected to account for 35 percent of business borrowers, reinforcing their role as key contributors to India’s economic growth.
Despite this progress, challenges persist. The report identifies barriers such as credit aversion, poor banking experiences, lack of collateral, and difficulties in securing guarantors as obstacles limiting women’s full participation in the credit ecosystem.
At the report’s launch, NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam emphasized the critical role of financial access in empowering women entrepreneurs. “The government recognizes that access to finance is a fundamental enabler for women’s entrepreneurship. The Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) is committed to fostering financial literacy, expanding access to credit, and strengthening mentorship and market linkages,” he said.
Subrahmanyam also stressed the need for collaborative efforts to ensure equitable financial access. “Financial institutions must design inclusive products tailored to women’s needs. Policy initiatives addressing structural barriers will be instrumental in accelerating this momentum. Under the WEP initiative, we have established the Financing Women Collaborative (FWC), and we invite more financial sector stakeholders to join this mission,” he added.
Anna Roy, Principal Economic Advisor at NITI Aayog and Mission Director of WEP, reinforced the importance of promoting women’s entrepreneurship as a strategy for economic growth. “Encouraging women entrepreneurs can create employment opportunities for 150 to 170 million people while driving greater participation of women in the workforce,” she said.

Title: Bitcoin jumps 20% after Trump hints at new strategic reserve
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:39:06 +0000
Content: Bitcoin surged more than 20% from last week’s lows on Monday and several other cryptocurrencies also rallied sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of a new U.S. strategic reserve that would include a range of tokens.
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies, including bitcoin BTC=, ether, XRP, solana and cardano. The names had not previously been announced.
Bitcoin and ether will be at the heart of this reserve, he posted on Sunday.
The post sent the world’s largest cryptocurrency up by a fifth from the November lows it was trading at on Friday, helping flip sentiment on a token that has been sliding since mid-January on disappointment Trump had not followed through on pledges to loosen regulation.
It was last at around $91,605, up from Friday’s low of$78,273.
Ether ETH= was also up 20% from Friday’s lows to $2,351, a 7% drop from Sunday’s closing levels.
XRP XRP= and solana SOL=CCCL were up around 30% from Friday’s lowest levels, while cardano ADA=CCCL was up 60% from last week’s lows.
“Trump just gave the pump that crypto traders have been holding out for,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index.
“Any faith that was lost last week appears to have been restored,” and new highs could be made unless there was another wave of risk-off selling, he said.
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said it was possible the rally will extend into the first White House Crypto Summit that Trump is hosting on Friday, with the risk that the bearishness in other markets could weigh on sentiment.
While Wall Street closed higher on Friday, the recent selloff in large technology bellwethers such as Nvidia NVDA.O has eroded confidence in bitcoin, which some see as an alternative tech proxy.
Bitcoin fell more than 17% in February, clocking its biggest monthly percentage fall since June 2022 and losing more than a third of its price since topping $105,000 in early January.
Its rally since Trump’s November election was spurred by optimism that the crypto-friendly president would champion a strategic bitcoin fund and end the previous Joe Biden administration’s crackdown on the industry.
“Ironically, a currency that was designed to be isolated from government interference and decentralized, is now reliant on the US government for its fortunes,” Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB said, reiterating that the $100,000 level an “obvious target” for bitcoin.
Beyond a flurry of appointments of crypto-friendly officials when Trump took office, there has been little concrete news so far around that policy for investors.
“While this announcement has significantly boosted prices, it has also raised concerns,” wrote IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.
The funding for cryptocurrency purchases in the reserve could either come from U.S. taxpayers or the cryptocurrencies in the asset will be those seized in law enforcement actions, he said.
“The latter isn’t anywhere near as bullish as it simply represents a transfer between accounts rather than new buying entering the market.”

Title: President Droupadi Murmu inaugurates Visitor’s Conference in New Delhi
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:24:47 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu inaugurated the Visitor’s Conference 2024-25 at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday, underscoring the transformative role of higher education in shaping India’s future. Addressing heads of 184 Central Institutes of Higher Education, she emphasized that the true measure of a nation’s progress lies in the strength of its education system.
Stressing the need to prioritize research alongside academics, Murmu highlighted the National Research Fund, established to support groundbreaking studies. She expressed confidence that Indian institutions would make full use of this initiative, fostering innovation that could gain global recognition. She envisioned an academic landscape where Indian researchers earn international acclaim, patents from Indian institutions drive change worldwide, and students from developed countries seek India as a preferred destination for higher education.
The President acknowledged the significant contributions of Indian students across prestigious global institutions and advanced economies. However, she urged educational leaders to find ways to retain and utilize this talent within India. She asserted that India’s ambition to become a Global Knowledge Superpower would only be realized when innovations from Indian laboratories are eagerly adopted by the international community.
Beyond academic excellence, Murmu emphasized the importance of social inclusion in education. She called for a system where no student faces barriers—whether economic, social, or psychological—in accessing higher education. Encouraging faculty members to support students beyond academics, she urged them to eliminate insecurities, provide moral and emotional strength, and cultivate an atmosphere of positivity within campuses.
She also reflected on India’s deep-rooted tradition of scientific achievements, emphasizing the need for intensive research to rediscover and adapt indigenous knowledge systems to modern contexts. She placed the onus on academic institutions to integrate these organic knowledge streams into contemporary education, ensuring they remain relevant in today’s world.
During the conference, the President presented the eighth Visitor’s Awards to recognize outstanding contributions in innovation, research, and technology development. Prof. Saripella Srikrishna of Banaras Hindu University was honored for his groundbreaking work in quantum technology, which supports the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Prof. Ashwini Kumar Nangia from the University of Hyderabad received recognition for his pioneering research in high-bioavailability drugs, aimed at enhancing pharmaceutical efficacy at an affordable cost.
In the field of biological sciences, the award was jointly presented to Prof. Rina Chakrabarti from the University of Delhi, for her contributions to sustainable freshwater aquaculture, and Prof. Raj Kumar of the Central University of Punjab, for his research on cancer hallmarks and the development of synthetic anticancer molecules. The technology development award was conferred upon Dr. Venkateswarlu Chintala of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya, whose work on converting plastic waste into commercial-scale petrol and diesel has significant environmental and economic implications.
The second day of the conference will focus on key discussions, including flexibility in academic courses, international collaborations, translational research, effective student selection processes under the National Education Policy (NEP), and innovation commercialization. The conclusions from these deliberations will be presented to the President during the closing session.

The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister accused Anand of lacking political maturity and being influenced by his father-in-law, Ashok Siddharth, who was also expelled for “factionalism.” She said that Anand’s lengthy response following his removal was neither a sign of remorse nor political wisdom but was instead driven by arrogance.
Mayawati emphasized that Anand was expected to accept his removal with maturity. “In the BSP’s All-India meeting yesterday, Akash Anand was relieved from all responsibilities, including the post of National Coordinator, due to his continued influence under his father-in-law. For this, he should have repented and shown maturity,” she added.
A day after his removal, Akash Anand responded defiantly, stating that he remained undeterred and would continue his commitment to the Bahujan movement. Calling the decision “personally emotional” but a “big challenge,” he vowed to keep fighting for the rights of marginalized communities.
“The test is difficult, and the fight is long. Patience and determination are the true companions in such difficult times,” Anand posted on X. He added that the Bahujan movement was an idea that could not be suppressed and that “lakhs of Akash Anands” were ready to carry forward its legacy.
Following Anand’s ouster, Mayawati appointed Anand Kumar and Ramji Gautam as the new National Coordinators of the BSP. Meanwhile, Ashok Siddharth, Anand’s father-in-law, was also expelled from the party for allegedly causing divisions within the organization.

Title: ROHIT SHARMA UNFAZED BY AUSTRALIA AS INDIA PREPARES FOR SEMIFINAL
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:25:23 +0000
Content: India Cricket team captain Rohit Sharma exuded confidence ahead of his team’s ICC tournament semifinal clash against Australia, emphasising process over revenge despite their previous defeat to the same opposition in the 2023 World Cup final.
“It’s a great opposition to play against,” Sharma said during Monday’s press conference in Dubai. “Australia has been a great team over the years. We expect some fightbacks and some nervy moments in the middle.”
When asked if facing Australia in the semifinals provided extra motivation following their 2023 World Cup final loss, he remained measured. “All we need to do is stick to what we’ve been focusing on in the last three games. We have to approach this match in a similar fashion,” he explained.
The Indian skipper acknowledged the pressure of knockout cricket but stressed the importance of execution over the opposition. “Obviously, the pressure is on both teams to win. But it’s important for us to focus on what we need to do, keep executing our plans, and get the basics right. The results will follow if we stick to what we are supposed to do.”
Rohit Sharma also addressed India’s bowling strategy against Australia’s formidable batting lineup, particularly the possibility of retaining the four-spinner approach that had proven effective in the group stage.
“We need to consider whether playing four spinners is viable and how we can fit them in. If it’s not, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” he said. “We’ll assess the conditions and analyze Australia’s batting lineup to determine the best bowling combination against them.”
With uncertainty over which pitch will be used for the semifinal at Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the Indian captain emphasised the need for adaptability. “We don’t know which pitch will be used, but whatever happens, we have to adapt and respond to the conditions.”The semifinal between India and Australia is set for March 4, at Dubai, with the winner advancing to the tournament final.

Title: INDIA ADVANCES IMEEC TRADE CORRIDOR WITH KEY UAE DISCUSSIONS
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:01:43 +0000
Content: The ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEEC) gained significant momentum following high-level discussions between Indian and UAE officials in Abu Dhabi this week, marking a major step forward for the transcontinental connectivity project.
A delegation led by T.K. Ramachandaran, Secretary of India’s Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, held talks with Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports. The Indian delegation included Ambassador Sunjay Sudhir and senior officials from RITES Ltd, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority, and Deendayal Port Authority.
The IMEEC, launched during the G-20 Summit in New Delhi in September 2023, is a transcontinental connectivity initiative with signatories including India, UAE, USA, EU, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, and Germany. Together, these nations represent nearly 50% of global GDP.
A key focus of the discussions was the Master Application for International Trade and Regulatory Interface (MAITRI), which was launched during Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to India in September 2024. MAITRI aims to integrate existing trade portals from both countries, providing seamless and paperless connectivity.
The platform will incorporate India’s National Logistics Portal-Marine, Indian Customs Electronic Gateway, and Unified Logistics Interface Platform with corresponding UAE systems. Development responsibilities have been assigned to RITES and C-DAC, who are collaborating with major Indian ports.
MAITRI will support the Virtual Trade Corridor (VTC), another initiative launched during the Crown Prince’s visit. The VTC is expected to bolster bilateral trade between India and the UAE, which currently exceeds US$85 billion annually.
A preparatory workshop was held in Mumbai on February 27, with participation from India’s Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal, Abu Dhabi Ports, DP World, and other UAE stakeholders.The IMEEC project promises to be one of the shortest trade routes from India to Europe, supporting economic integration across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
Beyond transportation infrastructure, the corridor will facilitate energy and digital connectivity, including an electrical grid between the UAE and India for solar power transmission. Both countries are also advancing cooperation on green hydrogen and public digital infrastructure.
The UAE segment of the corridor will terminate at Ghweifat on the UAE-Saudi Arabia border, from where a rail link will transport cargo through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and into Israel.The project’s strategic importance was recently underscored during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with US President Donald Trump, with the corridor featuring prominently in the joint statement issued after their discussions.
