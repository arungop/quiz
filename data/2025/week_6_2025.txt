Title: PM Modi virtually attends Maha Kumbhabhishekam of Jakarta Murugan Temple in Indonesia
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 12:23:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday virtually participated in the Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony of Shri Sanathana Dharma Aalayam, also known as the Jakarta Murugan Temple, Indonesia’s first-ever temple dedicated to Lord Murugan.
PM Modi described the temple as a beacon of spirituality, culture, and unity and also expressed his heartfelt connection to the event despite being miles away.
“It is my privilege to be part of this historic Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony at the Murugan Temple in Jakarta. My brother, President Prabowo’s presence makes it even more special for me. While I may be hundreds of kilometres away, my heart is as close to this moment,” he said.
Addressing the gathering virtually, PM Modi highlighted historical and cultural connection between India and Indonesia.
“Just a few days ago, President Prabowo Subianto carried the love of 140 crore Indians to Indonesia, and I am confident that through him, all of you can feel the warm wishes of every Indian. I congratulate everyone — crores of devotees in India, Indonesia, and across the world — on this sacred occasion,” he said.
Stressing the age-old ties between the two nations, he remarked, “India and Indonesia’s connection is not just geopolitical. We are bound by thousands of years of shared culture, history, faith, devotion, and spirituality. Our bond is linked with Lord Murugan, Lord Sri Ram, and Lord Buddha.”
“When an Indian visits Indonesia and prays at the Prambanan Temple, the experience is as spiritual as visiting Kashi or Kedarnath. Similarly, when Indians learn about the Kakawin and Serat Ramayan, they feel the same connection as when reading Valmiki’s Ramayan,” he added.
Reflecting on the significance of the Bali Yatra festival, PM Modi pointed out how Indonesia’s cultural identity remains intertwined with India.
“When people travel on Garuda Indonesia (Indonesian airlines), they experience our shared heritage. These connections remind us of our deep historical ties,” he said.
He hailed the temple’s inauguration as a monumental milestone, stating, “Today, a new golden chapter is being added to our centuries-old heritage. This temple is not just a centre of spirituality but also a testament to our shared cultural values. I have been informed that in addition to Lord Murugan, idols of various other deities have been installed here. This reflects the richness and diversity of our traditions.”
Speaking on the cultural philosophy shared by both nations, he emphasised, “Indonesia follows the tradition of ‘Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,’ which means ‘Unity in Diversity.’ In India, we uphold the same belief. It is because of this shared ethos that people of different communities live in harmony in both our countries. This sacred day reinforces the message of unity in diversity.”
PM Modi also underscored the growing people-to-people ties between the two nations.
“India and Indonesia’s connection is getting stronger due to our shared cultural initiatives. We have committed to protecting and preserving the Prambanan and Borobudur Buddhist Temples together. Such efforts need to be further encouraged, and I am confident that our bilateral ties will continue to strengthen in the future,” he said.
The Jakarta Murugan Temple’s foundation stone was laid on February 14, 2020, with a puja led by revered priests from India and Malaysia. This gathering symbolised the unity and solidarity of Indonesia’s diverse communities.
The temple stands as a remarkable confluence of Indian, Javanese and Balinese traditions while embracing the values of Pancasila.
Beyond being a spiritual sanctuary, it serves as a centre for cultural exchange and tourism, further deepening Indonesia’s ties with India.
The Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony is being conducted in Indonesia, with the support of 72 Gurukals from India.

Title: At Delhi poll rally, PM Modi promises ‘Vikas ka naya Basant’ for residents
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 11:38:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Delhi is set to witness a “Vikas ka Naya Basant” (New spring of development) after the upcoming Assembly elections, comparing it to the seasonal change brought by Basant Panchami.
Addressing a massive public gathering in Delhi’s R.K. Puram, PM Modi extended his greetings the the people on the occasion of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Calling R.K. Puram a true representation of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,” he highlighted how people from various parts of the country live together in the area, many of whom are government employees.
“With Basant Panchami, the weather starts changing. Similarly, on February 5, Delhi will experience a ‘Vikas ka Naya Basant.’ This time, the BJP government is set to be formed in Delhi. The entire city is saying, ‘Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar’!” PM Modi said, as the crowd chanted his name.
Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), PM Modi accused it of ruining Delhi over the last 11 years.
“The AAPda party has wasted precious time for Delhi. I appeal to every family to give us a chance to serve. I guarantee that I will do everything possible to resolve your problems. Whether poor or middle class, the double-engine government will work to make every family’s life happy. We need a government that serves, not one that constantly makes excuses,” he said.
Taking aim at AAP’s leadership, he added, “You have already given a strong government to the country. Now, not even by mistake should the AAP-da government, which has destroyed Delhi, return to power.”
PM Modi also mocked AAP’s election symbol, saying, “Even before the elections, the broom (Jhaadu) is falling apart. Their leaders are quitting because they see the public’s anger on the ground. AAPda is so shaken that they are making false announcements every hour.”
Amid loud sloganeering of “Jhoot Nahi Sahenge”, PM Modi described BJP’s governance as superior to that of AAP dispensation.
“On one side, you have the false promises of AAPda, and on the other, Modi’s guarantee. Modi’s guarantee means 100 per cent fulfilment. Whatever I promise, I deliver,” he asserted.
He cited the recent Union Budget as proof of his government’s commitment to the people. “The four pillars of a Viksit Bharat — Gareeb, Kisaan, Naujawan, and Naari Shakti — are at the centre of this budget. Over the years, we have provided free food, healthcare, and permanent housing to the poor.”
Speaking about India’s economic growth, PM Modi said, “India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy. This means people’s incomes are increasing. In the past, this money would have been lost in scams, but today, an honest BJP government is using it for the welfare of citizens.”
He highlighted that under the budget, manufacturing of essential goods like clothes, shoes, TVs, and mobile phones will become cheaper, boosting ‘Make in India.’
“Our middle class plays a crucial role in development, and BJP is the only party that truly respects them. This budget is being called the most middle-class-friendly budget ever,” he stated.
Elaborating on tax reforms, he recalled the burdens of past governments, “Earlier, just hearing about an upcoming budget would make the middle class anxious for five days, and after the budget, they couldn’t sleep for a whole year. But this time, the budget has filled every Indian family with happiness. Now, earnings up to Rs 12 lakh per year are tax-free, saving thousands for the middle class.”
Comparing today’s tax policies to past Congress governments, he said, “During Nehru’s time, if you earned Rs 12 lakh annually, one-fourth of your salary was taken as tax. During Indira Gandhi’s rule, you would be shocked to know that nearly Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 12 lakh went into taxes. This was their reality.”
He further announced that income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 24 lakh will now be taxed at significantly lower rates, saving Rs 1.1 lakh per year for those in that bracket.
Addressing the senior citizens, he promised additional benefits. “Millions of elderly citizens will gain from this budget. Retired government employees will see reduced taxes and increased pensions. Once BJP forms the government in Delhi, we will introduce a pension of Rs 2,500 for senior citizens and provide free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh.”
During the rally, PM Modi also had a heartwarming interaction with a young girl in the crowd who had drawn a sketch for him. Promising to write her a letter, he shared the moment with the audience, adding an emotional touch to his campaign.

Title: India beat SA to retain U19 Women’s T20 WC title
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:53:06 +0000
Content: Trisha Gongadi put out a sparkling all-round performance as a dominant India retained their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title with a nine-wicket win over South Africa in the summit clash at the Bayuemas Oval on Sunday.
A stellar bowling performance, with the spinners taking nine wickets – three of which went to Trisha – along with fielders stepping up nicely helped Niki Prasad-led India apply the squeeze on South Africa and bowl them out for 82 on a slow pitch.
In the chase, Trisha made 44 not out off 33 balls while Sanika Chalke slammed an unbeaten 26 off 22 deliveries to help India complete the chase in 11.2 overs to clinch the title yet again after winning it in 2023 in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
India’s second successive triumph in the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup yet again showed the gulf that exists between them and teams of other nations at the U19 women’s level, as they also became the first side to win the title without losing any game.
Chasing 83, India got going with Trisha edging wide of the keeper for four Nthabiseng Nini. She then thumped Fay Cowling over covers twice for fours, before G Kamalini began by clearing mid-on with ease off Kayla Reyneke for her first boundary of the final.
Trisha took a special liking to Seshnie Naidu’s leg-spin by rocking back to cut between cover and point, steering past short third region and swinging the full toss over fine leg to collect three fours, as India reached 36 for nil in just four overs.
Kamalini fell for eight in the fifth over when she stepped out to hit Kayla over the boundary ropes, but ended up hitting to long-on. After Sanika Chalke was off the mark with a magnificent drive between cover and mid-off, Trisha bisected the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on for four more.
With Sanika hammering one over Ashleigh van Wyk’s head and beating a valiant dive from long-off to get another boundary, it brought India just 25 runs away from reaching the target. The duo took their time and rotated strike well, before Sanika clipped Jemma Botha for four. \
Trisha steered Jemma past the keeper for four, and was followed by Sanika heaving Monalisa for a boundary to the square leg to get the winning runs for India.
Brief Scores: South Africa 82 all out (Mieke van Voorst 23, Fay Cowling 15; Trisha Gongadi 3-15, Parunika Sisodia 2-6) lost to India 84/1 in 11.2 overs (Trisha Gongadi 44 not out, Sanika Chalke 26 not out; Kayla Reyneke 1-14) by nine wickets

Title: 54 killed, 158 injured in paramilitary attack on market in Sudan’s Omdurman: Ministry
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 08:01:58 +0000
Content: The death toll from shelling by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a crowded market in Omdurman, north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, has risen to 54, Sudan’s Ministry of Health announced.
The ministry said in a statement that health institutions reported 54 deaths and 158 injuries in the deadly attack on Sabreen Market in the Karari locality, Xinhua news agency reported.
It condemned the attack against civilians, saying, “This constitutes a breach of international norms and laws.”
Khalid Ali Aleisir, Sudan’s minister of information and government spokesperson, also slammed the attack as it resulted in massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction of private and public property.
Earlier, a medical source at Al-Nao Hospital in Omdurman told Xinhua that “the situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word. We need blood donors and medical supplies.”
A Xinhua correspondent in Omdurman reported the shelling simultaneously targeted residential areas near the market.
The RSF has not commented on the incident yet.
The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) frequently accuses the RSF of bombing the Karari locality from its positions in Bahri, a city in Khartoum State. Karari is the only area in Omdurman that remains densely populated and fully under army control.
Military confrontations between the SAF and the RSF have intensified recently in Khartoum.
Sudan has been gripped by a devastating conflict between the two parties since mid-April 2023, which claimed at least 29,683 lives and displaced over 15 million people, either inside or outside Sudan, according to the latest estimates by international organisations.

Content: The Netherlands’ privacy watchdog AP on Friday said it will launch an investigation into Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek’s data collection practices and urged Dutch users to exercise caution with the company’s software.
“The AP is (issuing this) warning because of the serious concerns that there are over DeepSeek’s privacy policies … and the way in which it appears to use personal information,” Chairman Aleid Wolfsen said in a statement. The agency added that European citizens’ personal data can only be stored abroad under strict conditions that DeepSeek must adhere to.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday conveyed his best wishes to the nation on Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “Best wishes on the auspicious occasions of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended his heartfelt greetings, stating, “Heartiest greetings to all the countrymen on the sacred festival of Basant Panchami.”
“I wish that Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom and discretion, brings happiness and prosperity in everyone’s life,” he added.
Union Minister and BJP National President J.P. Nadda also took to social media and posted, “Heartiest greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, the festival dedicated to the worship of Maa Saraswati, the goddess of learning, wisdom and knowledge and love for nature.”
“May Goddess Saraswati illuminate the life of all of you with the light of knowledge and provide happiness, prosperity and good health,” he added.
Extending greetings, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar posted, “Warm greetings on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Basant Panchami, also known as Vasanta Panchami and Saraswati Puja, is a festival dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, heralding the arrival of spring. It is celebrated across various Indian regions with distinct customs.

Title: Trump launches trade war with tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:47:45 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered sweeping tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China, demanding they stanch the flow of fentanyl – and illegal immigrants in the case of Canada and Mexico – into the United States, kicking off a trade war that could dent global growth and reignite inflation.
Mexico and Canada, the top two U.S. trading partners, immediately vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would challenge Trump’s move at the World Trade Organization and take other “countermeasures.”
In three executive orders, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, starting on Tuesday.
He vowed to keep the duties in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the U.S. ends. The White House provided no other parameters for determining what might satisfy Trump’s demands.
Responding to concerns raised by oil refiners and Midwestern states, Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada, with Mexican energy imports facing the full 25% tariff.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would respond with 25% tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect Tuesday and $125 billion 21 days later.
Trudeau warned U.S. citizens that Trump’s tariffs would raise their grocery and gasoline costs, potentially shutting down auto assembly plants and limiting supplies of goods such as nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminum. He urged his own citizens to forego travel to the U.S. and to boycott U.S. products.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a post on X, said she was instructing her economy minister to implement retaliatory tariffs but gave no details.
Canada and Mexico said they were working together to face Trump’s tariffs.
China’s Commerce Ministry did not specify its planned countermeasures. Its statement left open the door for talks between Washington and Beijing.
“China hopes that the US will view and handle its own fentanyl and other issues in an objective and rational manner,” it said, adding that Beijing wanted to “engage in frank dialogue, strengthen cooperation and manage differences.”
A White House fact sheet said the tariffs would stay in place “until the crisis alleviated,” but gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new steep tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
The tariff announcement makes good Trump’s repeated threat during the 2024 presidential campaign and since taking office, defying warnings from top economists that a new trade war with the top U.S. trade partners would erode U.S. and global growth, while raising prices for consumers and companies.
Republicans welcomed the news, while industry groups and Democrats issued stark warnings about the impact on prices.
National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said Trump’s move threatened to raise the costs of “everything from avocados to automobiles” and urged the U.S., Canada and Mexico to find a quick solution to avoid escalation.
The three countries should work together to “gain a competitive advantage and facilitate American companies’ ability to export to global markets,” Colvin said in a statement.
Provincial officials and business executives in Canada also reacted with outrage, calling for forceful tariffs on imports from the U.S.
Roughly 90 minutes after Trump’s announcement, the American national anthem was booed in the nation’s capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
U.S. tariff collections are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump’s written order. But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. Saturday would be exempt from the duties.
Trump declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to back the tariffs, which allow the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump was once again testing the limits of U.S. legislation and the tariffs could face legal challenges, while Democratic lawmakers Suzan DelBene and Don Beyer decried what they called “a blatant abuse of executive power.”
White House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs and if Canada, Mexico or China retaliated against American exports, Trump would likely increase the U.S. duties.
Nova Scotia’s Premier Tim Houston said he directed that all alcohol imported from the U.S. be removed from the province’s store shelves.
The White House officials said that Canada specifically would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.
LONG-PROMISED TARIFFS
Trump spoke extensively about the tariffs on Friday, acknowledging they could lead to disruptions and hardships for Americans. He said additional tariffs were planned against steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
The Republican president was not scheduled to speak to reporters about the tariffs after the announcement.
Trump’s tariff move was led by Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a forceful hawk on illegal immigration, and Trump’s nominee to head the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, who flew to Florida with Trump on Friday, a White House official said.
Less than two weeks into his second term, Trump is upending the norms of how the United States is governed and interacts with its neighbors and wider world.
A model gauging the economic impact of Trump’s tariff plan from EY Chief Economist Greg Daco suggests it would reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” at home.
“Steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock – a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse – while also triggering financial market volatility,” Daco wrote on Saturday.
That volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfill his threats. U.S. stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.

Title: Delhi’s air quality plummets to ‘very poor’ category
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 03:59:06 +0000
Content: The air quality in Delhi has significantly deteriorated, as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surged to 341 on Sunday at 6 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), falling into the ‘very poor’ category.
Air quality across Delhi remains concerning as several areas reporting high AQI levels with Anand Vihar reaching an alarming 418, Vivek Vihar at 407, and Wazirpur at 401, Ashok Vihar stands at 384, Jahangirpuri at 372, and Punjabi Bagh at 375, all in the ‘very poor’ category. Patparganj records 367, while Bawana and Rohini are at 338 and 367, respectively. R K Puram has an AQI of 358, and Najafgarh, though lower, still has a ‘poor’ AQI of 282.
The increase in AQI levels has been attributed to a combination of unfavourable meteorological conditions. The calm winds, low ventilation coefficients, and smoggy conditions are contributing to the slow dispersion of pollutants, trapping them over the city.
Meanwhile, the weather in Delhi has been undergoing a shift, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a yellow alert for moderate to dense fog on Sunday. Despite the fog, temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild, with a maximum of 24 degrees Celcius and a minimum of 9 degrees Celcius.
The IMD has observed that the city’s temperatures are transitioning from the cold winter range of 22-26 degrees Celcius for maximum and 10-12 degrees Celcius for minimum, indicating the onset of milder weather.
While mornings and nights are still chilly, the daytimes are showing warmer trends, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celcius.
In response to the rising pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) activated Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) earlier on January 29. These measures are aimed at curbing air pollution by imposing stricter controls on construction activities, vehicular emissions, and other pollution sources.
As Delhi continues to battle the dual challenge of poor air quality and fluctuating weather, residents are urged to take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, wearing masks, and using air purifiers to mitigate the health risks associated with the deteriorating air quality.

Title: EU leaders to huddle on defence against Russia and handling Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 07:25:15 +0000
Content: European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent’s defences against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.
At a royal palace-turned-conference centre in Brussels, the leaders of the EU’s 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defence policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions.
The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures.
Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defence, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance.
Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States – and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand – has also added strains to transatlantic ties.
The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects.
“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defence,” Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defence actor.”
FINDING FUNDING
The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes.
Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defence. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed.
One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defence projects, according to some diplomats.
European countries have ramped up defence spending in recent years, particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU’s borders.
But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defence – a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches.
Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defence – about 326 billion euros ($334.48 billion), according to EU estimates.
That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries.
Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defence spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less – about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.

Title: DeepSeek gives Europe’s tech firms a chance to catch up in global AI race
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:57:51 +0000
Content: Hemanth Mandapati, boss of German startup Novo AI, was an early adopter of DeepSeek chatbots when he switched to the Chinese AI model from OpenAI’s ChatGPT two weeks ago.
“If you have built your application using OpenAI, you can easily migrate to the other ones … it took us minutes to switch,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the GoWest conference for venture capitalists in Gothenburg, Sweden.
DeepSeek’s emergence is changing the landscape for AI, offering companies access to the technology at a fraction of the cost, according to interviews with more than a dozen startup executives and investors. It also has the potential to push other AI companies to improve their models and bring down prices.
“There was an offer from DeepSeek which was five times lower than their actual prices,” said Mandapati. “I am saving a lot of money and users don’t see any kind of a difference.”
Europe’s tech startups had struggled to adopt the new technology at the same rate as U.S. rivals, which have easier access to funding. But executives say DeepSeek could be a game changer.
“It marks a significant step forward in democratising AI and levelling the playing field with Big Tech,” said Seena Rejal, chief commercial officer of British firm NetMind.AI, another early adopter of DeepSeek.
Analysts at Bernstein estimate that DeepSeek’s pricing is 20 to 40 times cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI.
OpenAI charges $2.5 for 1 million input tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, while DeepSeek is currently charging $0.014 for the same number of tokens.
Concerns have been raised by regulators about whether DeepSeek is copying OpenAI data or censoring answers that could portray China in a bad light. It is currently being investigated in different European countries.
“While the future of DeepSeek as a business is difficult to predict, the structural impact seems quite pervasive,” said Sanjot Malhi, partner at venture capital firm Northzone.
WAKE-UP CALL
Nearly $100 billion was invested by venture capitalists in AI companies in 2024 in the U.S. compared with about $15.8 billion in Europe, according to data from PitchBook.
Just on Jan. 22, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI project called Stargate, a joint venture backed by OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle.
Investment in Europe has been more modest.
Only France’s Mistral features among the list of top foundational models dominated by the likes of OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and Google.
China’s DeepSeek attracted attention after writing in a paper last month that the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips. It has since overtaken ChatGPT to become the top-rated productivity application available on Apple’s App Store.
“This is a wake-up call that bigger isn’t always better,” said Fabrizio Del Maffeo, CEO of Axelera AI. “By making models more attainable to everyone, the total cost of ownership and barriers to building innovative tech are lowered which can be a catalyst for the whole industry.”
While some analysts doubt that DeepSeek’s training cost is as low as the company says, they agree it is lower than comparable American models.
“I see DeepSeek as a tremendous opportunity for companies like ours,” said Ulrik R-T, CEO of Denmark’s Empatik AI. “It showed that we do not need huge budgets to be able to achieve our vision.”
COST VS SAFETY
The price war may have already started.
Microsoft last week released OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model to all Copilot users for free, instead of the usual subscription fee of $20 per month.
“AI prices are going down, so future usage is probably going where there is transparency, which is usually open source, even though it’s in China,” said Scale Capital’s Joachim Schelde.
Bigger companies, ranging from Finland’s Nokia to Germany’s SAP, are more cautious about switching.
“Cost is just one factor,” said Alexandru Voica, Head of Corporate at Britain’s Synthesia, which was last valued at $2.1 billion. “Other factors are: ‘do you have all the security certifications, the frameworks, the software ecosystem that allows companies to build and integrate with your platform?'”

Title: Ayodhya Ram mandir chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das hospitalized
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:53:24 +0000
Content: Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, was hospitalized after a sudden decline in his health, sources cited by IANS said on Sunday. Reports indicated that his condition was critical upon arrival, as he had been struggling with breathing difficulties.
Due to the severity of his condition, Das was initially admitted to Shri Ram Hospital, before being transferred to the Trauma Centre and subsequently referred to PGI in Lucknow for advanced treatment.
Earlier, Arun Kumar Singh, a doctor at the Neuro Centre in Ayodhya, said, “The condition of Satyendra Das is critical. A CT scan revealed that he had suffered a brain hemorrhage, which has spread to several parts of the brain.”
Singh said that the hospital had referred him to Lucknow PGI for better medical facilities.
There is great concern among the Ram temple administration in Ayodhya and among the devotees of Acharya Satyendra Das, who have been praying for his recovery at the Ram Janmabhoomi complex.
Acharya Satyendra Das’s condition is now stable, and he has been kept under observation by doctors.
Acharya Satyendra Das was appointed as the chief priest at the start of the Ram temple construction and has been actively involved in worship activities at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple.
On October 15, 2024, the 84-year-old chief priest of the Ayodhya Ram Temple was admitted to a hospital due to neurological issues, according to officials. However, medical authorities have confirmed that his condition remains stable.
“Acharya Satyendra Das, the head priest of Ayodhya’s Shri Ram temple, has been admitted to a private room in the Neurology Ward of SGPGI under the supervision of Dr. Prakash Chandra Pandey,” said Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) Director RK Dhiman.
Acharya Satyendra Das has been a resident of Ayodhya since childhood and has been associated with the Ram Lalla temple for nearly 32 years, having started his worship there before the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.

Title: Budget math looks realistic, economic growth to pick up pace: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:34:09 +0000
Content: The Union Budget has managed to meet the goals of boosting consumption though tax cuts, increasing capex through transfers to states, and maintaining the path of fiscal consolidation which is expected to lead to a recovery in the economic growth rate with macro stability in a comfortable range, according to a Morgan Stanley report released on Monday.
The report said that both fiscal and monetary policy are pivoting to support growth, which is in line with “our view of a cyclical recovery in growth”.
“The Budget math looks realistic, with nominal GDP assumed at 10.1 per cent for F2026 and gross tax revenue growth of 10.8 per cent. We will remain watchful of income tax collection growth, which the government expects to be 14.4 per cent, given the income tax cuts and execution of capex spending to meet the targets,” the report stated.
The report pointed out that the Budget has balanced needs to support growth and continue with fiscal consolidation. As such, the Budget targets a lower fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for F2026 even as it reduced income taxes to support consumption, especially for middle income tax payers, and expanded capex growth, mainly through a boost in grants to states for capex creation.
“Indeed, as per the Finance Minister, direct tax changes should lead to a 1.0 per cent revenue loss of Rs 1 lakh crore (0.3 per cent of GDP), which should help support consumption,” the Morgan Stanley report said.
On the spending side, the mix remains tilted to capex, with effective capex (direct capex plus grants in aid of creation of capital assets) seen growing at 17.4 per cent in F2026BE vs. 5.3 per cent of F2025RE.
“We expect the Budget to support growth recovery through measures to promote consumption and increase effective capex spending, which will likely lead to a more broad-based recovery, while at the same time continued consolidation should help macro stability remain in check,” the report observed.
The simultaneous boost to consumption and capex has to be sweet for equities, especially in the context of continuing and better-than-anticipated fiscal consolidation (projected primary deficit: 0.8 per cent).
The plethora of announcements around easing of India’s tax regime, including permanent establishment rules, GIFT city clarifications, extension of exemptions to sovereign funds, and changes to tax deduction and collection at source could improve FDI and private investment sentiment, according to the report.
“A new tax code is coming this week, as per the Budget, which could reveal a more liberal tax environment. We are overweight Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Technology, and underweight other sectors,” the report added.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower as Asian markets plunge amid trade war fears
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:02:09 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened sharply lower on Monday, as Asian markets tumbled after US President Donald Trump announced trade tariffs which are set to come into effect from Tuesday.
At around 9.33 a.m., the Sensex was trading over 400 points down at 77,103.22 while the Nifty was down 154 points at 23,328.00.
At the opening bell, the Sensex shed 710 points or 0.88 per cent at 76,821.50. On the NSE, all sectors declined with Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty as the worst performing sector.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.3 per cent, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was 2.4 per cent lower, South Korea’s KOSPI tumbled 3 per cent and Australia’s ASX 200 was 1.8 per cent lower.
On Saturday (US time), Trump announced he will impose 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 per cent on goods from China starting from Tuesday. He also pledged to place new tariffs on goods from the European Union.
The US equity futures also saw a sharp sell-off in response to US president Donald Trump imposing tariffs.
“After a negative opening, Nifty can find support at 23,200 followed by 23,100 and 23,000. On the higher side, 23,500 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 23,600 and 23,700,” said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst, Choice Broking.
Rupee opened 41 paise lower at 87.02 against the US Dollar. It closed at 86.61 on Friday.
According to Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory, PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, Asia kicked off what is likely to be a volatile day in global markets after Trump followed through on his threat to hit Mexico, Canada and China with tariffs on imports into the United States.
“It will be fascinating to see how investors react to something they have known was coming and which is almost universally seen as damaging for economic growth and financial assets. They won’t be surprised, but they will still be shocked,” he mentioned
The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers on February 1, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 1,327 crore, while domestic institutions bought equities worth Rs 824 crore on the same day.
Gold and silver witnessed high volatility last week and slipped from their highs amid strength in the dollar index and the beginning of the US trade tariff war.
“Gold and silver are holding their key support levels of $2,722 and $30.20 per troy ounce respectively on a weekly closing basis in the international markets,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.

Title: Trump says Americans may feel ‘pain’ in trade war with Mexico, Canada, China
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:50:22 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump said the sweeping tariffs that he has imposed on Mexico, Canada and China may cause “short term” pain for Americans as global markets reflected concerns the levies could undermine growth and reignite inflation.
Trump said he would talk on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“I don’t expect anything dramatic,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay.”
He also said tariffs would “definitely happen” with the European Union, but did not say when.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China – the United States’ three largest trading partners – will slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
“We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,” he said.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. U.S. stock futures fell more than 2%. Shares across Asia, including Hong Kong , Tokyo and Seoul also slid around 2%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices jumped more than $1, while gasoline futures rose 3%.
North American companies braced for new duties which could upend industries from autos to consumer goods to energy.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
“Economically speaking, escalating trade tensions are a lose-lose situation for all countries involved,” the analysts wrote in a note on Sunday.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant economic growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The Trump tariffs, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Some analysts said there was some hope for negotiations, especially with Canada and China.
Goldman Sachs economists said the levies are likely to be temporary but the outlook is unclear because the White House set very general conditions for their removal.
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China has said it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks with the United States.
Its sharpest pushback was over fentanyl.
“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” China’s foreign ministry said, adding that China has taken extensive measures to combat the problem.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, raising her fist in the air in a speech outside the capital, vowed resilience. She accused the United States of failing to tackle its fentanyl problem and said it would not be solved by tariffs.
Sheinbaum said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend.
Canada said on Sunday it will take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also encouraged Canadians on Sunday to boycott their longtime ally after ordering retaliatory tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, from peanut butter, beer and wine to lumber and appliances.
Canadian officials said they were preparing measures to help business who might be hurt by the trade war.
Trump has heaped derision on Canada in particular, with calls for the country to become the 51st U.S. state. On Sunday, he said Canada “ceases to exist as a viable country” without its “massive subsidy.”
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?
Trump declared a national emergency under two laws, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, which give the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump could face legal challenges for testing the limits of U.S. laws. Some Democratic lawmakers decried what they called a blatant abuse of executive power, while others warned about rising prices.
Even some Republicans criticized Trump’s action. “It will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this?” Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes”.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed Americans were divided on tariffs, with 54% opposing new duties on imported goods and 43% in support, with Democrats more opposed and Republicans more supportive.
INVESTORS LOOK AHEAD
Investors were considering the effects of additional tariffs promised by Trump, including those related to oil and gas, as well as steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
A European Commission spokesperson said the EU “would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods.”
Europe’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, said it was counting on talks to avoid trade conflict.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada after oil refiners and Midwestern states raised concerns. At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
White House officials said Canada would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. Canada and Mexico have become conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents, they said.

Title: Grammy awards: Beyonce wins best country album, Indian-origin Chandrika Tandon takes best new age album
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 04:56:02 +0000
Content: Beyonce won the Grammy Award for best country album on Sunday for “Cowboy Carter” at a ceremony that served as a love letter to host city Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires that scarred a hub of the music business.
“Cowboy Carter” was in the running for the night’s top Grammy prize of album of the year. Beyonce has never received the album trophy despite going into Sunday’s ceremony with 32 career wins, more than any other musician.
Indian-American vocalist Chandrika Tandon took home the Grammy award for the album Triveni in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category. She outran Ricky Kej and Anoushka Shankar to win the honour.
Chandrika won the award along with her collaborators, South African flautist Wouter Kellerman and Japanese cellist Eru Matsumoto.
Along with Chandrika, names who were contending in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category included Break of Dawn by Ricky Kej, Opus by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Chapter II: How Dark It Is Before Dawn by Anoushka Shankar, and Warriors Of Light by Radhika Vekaria.
This year’s Grammy festivities were revamped to be part awards show and part fundraiser for people affected by the wildfires, which were contained on Friday after killing 29 people and displacing thousands including many musicians.
Broadcast live on CBS, the show opened with an all-star rendition “I Love LA” featuring Altadena-based band Dawes backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, St. Vincent and Brittany Howard.
“Tonight, we decided we are not just celebrating our favorite music. We are also celebrating the city that brought us so much of that music,” host Trevor Noah said.
Los Angeles natives and siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas followed Noah’s monologue with a performance of nominated song “Birds of a Feather.” “I love you LA,” Eilish said from the stage.
Sabrina Carpenter won best pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet,” minutes after a performance of hits “Please Please Please” and “Espresso” on a set inspired by the golden age of Hollywood.
“I’m still out of breath from that performance,” Carpenter said as she accepted the trophy. “This is my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.”
Doechii became the third woman in Grammys history to win best rap album for “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” As she accepted the honor, she offered words of encouragement to Black women and girls.
“Anything is possible,” Doechii said as she held her trophy. “Don’t allow anyone to project any stereotypes on you.”
Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy.
