Title: PM Modi virtually attends Maha Kumbhabhishekam of Jakarta Murugan Temple in Indonesia
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 12:23:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday virtually participated in the Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony of Shri Sanathana Dharma Aalayam, also known as the Jakarta Murugan Temple, Indonesia’s first-ever temple dedicated to Lord Murugan.
PM Modi described the temple as a beacon of spirituality, culture, and unity and also expressed his heartfelt connection to the event despite being miles away.
“It is my privilege to be part of this historic Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony at the Murugan Temple in Jakarta. My brother, President Prabowo’s presence makes it even more special for me. While I may be hundreds of kilometres away, my heart is as close to this moment,” he said.
Addressing the gathering virtually, PM Modi highlighted historical and cultural connection between India and Indonesia.
“Just a few days ago, President Prabowo Subianto carried the love of 140 crore Indians to Indonesia, and I am confident that through him, all of you can feel the warm wishes of every Indian. I congratulate everyone — crores of devotees in India, Indonesia, and across the world — on this sacred occasion,” he said.
Stressing the age-old ties between the two nations, he remarked, “India and Indonesia’s connection is not just geopolitical. We are bound by thousands of years of shared culture, history, faith, devotion, and spirituality. Our bond is linked with Lord Murugan, Lord Sri Ram, and Lord Buddha.”
“When an Indian visits Indonesia and prays at the Prambanan Temple, the experience is as spiritual as visiting Kashi or Kedarnath. Similarly, when Indians learn about the Kakawin and Serat Ramayan, they feel the same connection as when reading Valmiki’s Ramayan,” he added.
Reflecting on the significance of the Bali Yatra festival, PM Modi pointed out how Indonesia’s cultural identity remains intertwined with India.
“When people travel on Garuda Indonesia (Indonesian airlines), they experience our shared heritage. These connections remind us of our deep historical ties,” he said.
He hailed the temple’s inauguration as a monumental milestone, stating, “Today, a new golden chapter is being added to our centuries-old heritage. This temple is not just a centre of spirituality but also a testament to our shared cultural values. I have been informed that in addition to Lord Murugan, idols of various other deities have been installed here. This reflects the richness and diversity of our traditions.”
Speaking on the cultural philosophy shared by both nations, he emphasised, “Indonesia follows the tradition of ‘Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,’ which means ‘Unity in Diversity.’ In India, we uphold the same belief. It is because of this shared ethos that people of different communities live in harmony in both our countries. This sacred day reinforces the message of unity in diversity.”
PM Modi also underscored the growing people-to-people ties between the two nations.
“India and Indonesia’s connection is getting stronger due to our shared cultural initiatives. We have committed to protecting and preserving the Prambanan and Borobudur Buddhist Temples together. Such efforts need to be further encouraged, and I am confident that our bilateral ties will continue to strengthen in the future,” he said.
The Jakarta Murugan Temple’s foundation stone was laid on February 14, 2020, with a puja led by revered priests from India and Malaysia. This gathering symbolised the unity and solidarity of Indonesia’s diverse communities.
The temple stands as a remarkable confluence of Indian, Javanese and Balinese traditions while embracing the values of Pancasila.
Beyond being a spiritual sanctuary, it serves as a centre for cultural exchange and tourism, further deepening Indonesia’s ties with India.
The Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony is being conducted in Indonesia, with the support of 72 Gurukals from India.

Title: At Delhi poll rally, PM Modi promises ‘Vikas ka naya Basant’ for residents
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 11:38:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Delhi is set to witness a “Vikas ka Naya Basant” (New spring of development) after the upcoming Assembly elections, comparing it to the seasonal change brought by Basant Panchami.
Addressing a massive public gathering in Delhi’s R.K. Puram, PM Modi extended his greetings the the people on the occasion of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Calling R.K. Puram a true representation of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,” he highlighted how people from various parts of the country live together in the area, many of whom are government employees.
“With Basant Panchami, the weather starts changing. Similarly, on February 5, Delhi will experience a ‘Vikas ka Naya Basant.’ This time, the BJP government is set to be formed in Delhi. The entire city is saying, ‘Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar’!” PM Modi said, as the crowd chanted his name.
Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), PM Modi accused it of ruining Delhi over the last 11 years.
“The AAPda party has wasted precious time for Delhi. I appeal to every family to give us a chance to serve. I guarantee that I will do everything possible to resolve your problems. Whether poor or middle class, the double-engine government will work to make every family’s life happy. We need a government that serves, not one that constantly makes excuses,” he said.
Taking aim at AAP’s leadership, he added, “You have already given a strong government to the country. Now, not even by mistake should the AAP-da government, which has destroyed Delhi, return to power.”
PM Modi also mocked AAP’s election symbol, saying, “Even before the elections, the broom (Jhaadu) is falling apart. Their leaders are quitting because they see the public’s anger on the ground. AAPda is so shaken that they are making false announcements every hour.”
Amid loud sloganeering of “Jhoot Nahi Sahenge”, PM Modi described BJP’s governance as superior to that of AAP dispensation.
“On one side, you have the false promises of AAPda, and on the other, Modi’s guarantee. Modi’s guarantee means 100 per cent fulfilment. Whatever I promise, I deliver,” he asserted.
He cited the recent Union Budget as proof of his government’s commitment to the people. “The four pillars of a Viksit Bharat — Gareeb, Kisaan, Naujawan, and Naari Shakti — are at the centre of this budget. Over the years, we have provided free food, healthcare, and permanent housing to the poor.”
Speaking about India’s economic growth, PM Modi said, “India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy. This means people’s incomes are increasing. In the past, this money would have been lost in scams, but today, an honest BJP government is using it for the welfare of citizens.”
He highlighted that under the budget, manufacturing of essential goods like clothes, shoes, TVs, and mobile phones will become cheaper, boosting ‘Make in India.’
“Our middle class plays a crucial role in development, and BJP is the only party that truly respects them. This budget is being called the most middle-class-friendly budget ever,” he stated.
Elaborating on tax reforms, he recalled the burdens of past governments, “Earlier, just hearing about an upcoming budget would make the middle class anxious for five days, and after the budget, they couldn’t sleep for a whole year. But this time, the budget has filled every Indian family with happiness. Now, earnings up to Rs 12 lakh per year are tax-free, saving thousands for the middle class.”
Comparing today’s tax policies to past Congress governments, he said, “During Nehru’s time, if you earned Rs 12 lakh annually, one-fourth of your salary was taken as tax. During Indira Gandhi’s rule, you would be shocked to know that nearly Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 12 lakh went into taxes. This was their reality.”
He further announced that income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 24 lakh will now be taxed at significantly lower rates, saving Rs 1.1 lakh per year for those in that bracket.
Addressing the senior citizens, he promised additional benefits. “Millions of elderly citizens will gain from this budget. Retired government employees will see reduced taxes and increased pensions. Once BJP forms the government in Delhi, we will introduce a pension of Rs 2,500 for senior citizens and provide free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh.”
During the rally, PM Modi also had a heartwarming interaction with a young girl in the crowd who had drawn a sketch for him. Promising to write her a letter, he shared the moment with the audience, adding an emotional touch to his campaign.

Title: India beat SA to retain U19 Women’s T20 WC title
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:53:06 +0000
Content: Trisha Gongadi put out a sparkling all-round performance as a dominant India retained their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title with a nine-wicket win over South Africa in the summit clash at the Bayuemas Oval on Sunday.
A stellar bowling performance, with the spinners taking nine wickets – three of which went to Trisha – along with fielders stepping up nicely helped Niki Prasad-led India apply the squeeze on South Africa and bowl them out for 82 on a slow pitch.
In the chase, Trisha made 44 not out off 33 balls while Sanika Chalke slammed an unbeaten 26 off 22 deliveries to help India complete the chase in 11.2 overs to clinch the title yet again after winning it in 2023 in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
India’s second successive triumph in the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup yet again showed the gulf that exists between them and teams of other nations at the U19 women’s level, as they also became the first side to win the title without losing any game.
Chasing 83, India got going with Trisha edging wide of the keeper for four Nthabiseng Nini. She then thumped Fay Cowling over covers twice for fours, before G Kamalini began by clearing mid-on with ease off Kayla Reyneke for her first boundary of the final.
Trisha took a special liking to Seshnie Naidu’s leg-spin by rocking back to cut between cover and point, steering past short third region and swinging the full toss over fine leg to collect three fours, as India reached 36 for nil in just four overs.
Kamalini fell for eight in the fifth over when she stepped out to hit Kayla over the boundary ropes, but ended up hitting to long-on. After Sanika Chalke was off the mark with a magnificent drive between cover and mid-off, Trisha bisected the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on for four more.
With Sanika hammering one over Ashleigh van Wyk’s head and beating a valiant dive from long-off to get another boundary, it brought India just 25 runs away from reaching the target. The duo took their time and rotated strike well, before Sanika clipped Jemma Botha for four. \
Trisha steered Jemma past the keeper for four, and was followed by Sanika heaving Monalisa for a boundary to the square leg to get the winning runs for India.
Brief Scores: South Africa 82 all out (Mieke van Voorst 23, Fay Cowling 15; Trisha Gongadi 3-15, Parunika Sisodia 2-6) lost to India 84/1 in 11.2 overs (Trisha Gongadi 44 not out, Sanika Chalke 26 not out; Kayla Reyneke 1-14) by nine wickets

Title: 54 killed, 158 injured in paramilitary attack on market in Sudan’s Omdurman: Ministry
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 08:01:58 +0000
Content: The death toll from shelling by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a crowded market in Omdurman, north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, has risen to 54, Sudan’s Ministry of Health announced.
The ministry said in a statement that health institutions reported 54 deaths and 158 injuries in the deadly attack on Sabreen Market in the Karari locality, Xinhua news agency reported.
It condemned the attack against civilians, saying, “This constitutes a breach of international norms and laws.”
Khalid Ali Aleisir, Sudan’s minister of information and government spokesperson, also slammed the attack as it resulted in massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction of private and public property.
Earlier, a medical source at Al-Nao Hospital in Omdurman told Xinhua that “the situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word. We need blood donors and medical supplies.”
A Xinhua correspondent in Omdurman reported the shelling simultaneously targeted residential areas near the market.
The RSF has not commented on the incident yet.
The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) frequently accuses the RSF of bombing the Karari locality from its positions in Bahri, a city in Khartoum State. Karari is the only area in Omdurman that remains densely populated and fully under army control.
Military confrontations between the SAF and the RSF have intensified recently in Khartoum.
Sudan has been gripped by a devastating conflict between the two parties since mid-April 2023, which claimed at least 29,683 lives and displaced over 15 million people, either inside or outside Sudan, according to the latest estimates by international organisations.

Content: The Netherlands’ privacy watchdog AP on Friday said it will launch an investigation into Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek’s data collection practices and urged Dutch users to exercise caution with the company’s software.

Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “Best wishes on the auspicious occasions of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended his heartfelt greetings, stating, “Heartiest greetings to all the countrymen on the sacred festival of Basant Panchami.”
“I wish that Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom and discretion, brings happiness and prosperity in everyone’s life,” he added.
Union Minister and BJP National President J.P. Nadda also took to social media and posted, “Heartiest greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, the festival dedicated to the worship of Maa Saraswati, the goddess of learning, wisdom and knowledge and love for nature.”
“May Goddess Saraswati illuminate the life of all of you with the light of knowledge and provide happiness, prosperity and good health,” he added.

Title: Trump launches trade war with tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:47:45 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered sweeping tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China, demanding they stanch the flow of fentanyl – and illegal immigrants in the case of Canada and Mexico – into the United States, kicking off a trade war that could dent global growth and reignite inflation.
Mexico and Canada, the top two U.S. trading partners, immediately vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would challenge Trump’s move at the World Trade Organization and take other “countermeasures.”
In three executive orders, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, starting on Tuesday.
He vowed to keep the duties in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the U.S. ends. The White House provided no other parameters for determining what might satisfy Trump’s demands.
Responding to concerns raised by oil refiners and Midwestern states, Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada, with Mexican energy imports facing the full 25% tariff.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would respond with 25% tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect Tuesday and $125 billion 21 days later.
Trudeau warned U.S. citizens that Trump’s tariffs would raise their grocery and gasoline costs, potentially shutting down auto assembly plants and limiting supplies of goods such as nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminum. He urged his own citizens to forego travel to the U.S. and to boycott U.S. products.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a post on X, said she was instructing her economy minister to implement retaliatory tariffs but gave no details.
Canada and Mexico said they were working together to face Trump’s tariffs.
China’s Commerce Ministry did not specify its planned countermeasures. Its statement left open the door for talks between Washington and Beijing.
“China hopes that the US will view and handle its own fentanyl and other issues in an objective and rational manner,” it said, adding that Beijing wanted to “engage in frank dialogue, strengthen cooperation and manage differences.”
A White House fact sheet said the tariffs would stay in place “until the crisis alleviated,” but gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new steep tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
The tariff announcement makes good Trump’s repeated threat during the 2024 presidential campaign and since taking office, defying warnings from top economists that a new trade war with the top U.S. trade partners would erode U.S. and global growth, while raising prices for consumers and companies.
Republicans welcomed the news, while industry groups and Democrats issued stark warnings about the impact on prices.
National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said Trump’s move threatened to raise the costs of “everything from avocados to automobiles” and urged the U.S., Canada and Mexico to find a quick solution to avoid escalation.
The three countries should work together to “gain a competitive advantage and facilitate American companies’ ability to export to global markets,” Colvin said in a statement.
Provincial officials and business executives in Canada also reacted with outrage, calling for forceful tariffs on imports from the U.S.
Roughly 90 minutes after Trump’s announcement, the American national anthem was booed in the nation’s capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
U.S. tariff collections are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump’s written order. But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. Saturday would be exempt from the duties.
Trump declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to back the tariffs, which allow the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump was once again testing the limits of U.S. legislation and the tariffs could face legal challenges, while Democratic lawmakers Suzan DelBene and Don Beyer decried what they called “a blatant abuse of executive power.”
White House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs and if Canada, Mexico or China retaliated against American exports, Trump would likely increase the U.S. duties.
Nova Scotia’s Premier Tim Houston said he directed that all alcohol imported from the U.S. be removed from the province’s store shelves.
The White House officials said that Canada specifically would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.
LONG-PROMISED TARIFFS
Trump spoke extensively about the tariffs on Friday, acknowledging they could lead to disruptions and hardships for Americans. He said additional tariffs were planned against steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
The Republican president was not scheduled to speak to reporters about the tariffs after the announcement.
Trump’s tariff move was led by Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a forceful hawk on illegal immigration, and Trump’s nominee to head the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, who flew to Florida with Trump on Friday, a White House official said.
Less than two weeks into his second term, Trump is upending the norms of how the United States is governed and interacts with its neighbors and wider world.
A model gauging the economic impact of Trump’s tariff plan from EY Chief Economist Greg Daco suggests it would reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” at home.
“Steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock – a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse – while also triggering financial market volatility,” Daco wrote on Saturday.
That volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfill his threats. U.S. stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.

Title: Delhi’s air quality plummets to ‘very poor’ category
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 03:59:06 +0000
Content: The air quality in Delhi has significantly deteriorated, as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surged to 341 on Sunday at 6 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), falling into the ‘very poor’ category.
Air quality across Delhi remains concerning as several areas reporting high AQI levels with Anand Vihar reaching an alarming 418, Vivek Vihar at 407, and Wazirpur at 401, Ashok Vihar stands at 384, Jahangirpuri at 372, and Punjabi Bagh at 375, all in the ‘very poor’ category. Patparganj records 367, while Bawana and Rohini are at 338 and 367, respectively. R K Puram has an AQI of 358, and Najafgarh, though lower, still has a ‘poor’ AQI of 282.
The increase in AQI levels has been attributed to a combination of unfavourable meteorological conditions. The calm winds, low ventilation coefficients, and smoggy conditions are contributing to the slow dispersion of pollutants, trapping them over the city.
Meanwhile, the weather in Delhi has been undergoing a shift, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a yellow alert for moderate to dense fog on Sunday. Despite the fog, temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild, with a maximum of 24 degrees Celcius and a minimum of 9 degrees Celcius.
The IMD has observed that the city’s temperatures are transitioning from the cold winter range of 22-26 degrees Celcius for maximum and 10-12 degrees Celcius for minimum, indicating the onset of milder weather.
While mornings and nights are still chilly, the daytimes are showing warmer trends, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celcius.
In response to the rising pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) activated Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) earlier on January 29. These measures are aimed at curbing air pollution by imposing stricter controls on construction activities, vehicular emissions, and other pollution sources.
As Delhi continues to battle the dual challenge of poor air quality and fluctuating weather, residents are urged to take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, wearing masks, and using air purifiers to mitigate the health risks associated with the deteriorating air quality.
