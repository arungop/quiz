Title: PM Modi virtually attends Maha Kumbhabhishekam of Jakarta Murugan Temple in Indonesia
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 12:23:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday virtually participated in the Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony of Shri Sanathana Dharma Aalayam, also known as the Jakarta Murugan Temple, Indonesia’s first-ever temple dedicated to Lord Murugan.
PM Modi described the temple as a beacon of spirituality, culture, and unity and also expressed his heartfelt connection to the event despite being miles away.
“It is my privilege to be part of this historic Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony at the Murugan Temple in Jakarta. My brother, President Prabowo’s presence makes it even more special for me. While I may be hundreds of kilometres away, my heart is as close to this moment,” he said.
Addressing the gathering virtually, PM Modi highlighted historical and cultural connection between India and Indonesia.
“Just a few days ago, President Prabowo Subianto carried the love of 140 crore Indians to Indonesia, and I am confident that through him, all of you can feel the warm wishes of every Indian. I congratulate everyone — crores of devotees in India, Indonesia, and across the world — on this sacred occasion,” he said.
Stressing the age-old ties between the two nations, he remarked, “India and Indonesia’s connection is not just geopolitical. We are bound by thousands of years of shared culture, history, faith, devotion, and spirituality. Our bond is linked with Lord Murugan, Lord Sri Ram, and Lord Buddha.”
“When an Indian visits Indonesia and prays at the Prambanan Temple, the experience is as spiritual as visiting Kashi or Kedarnath. Similarly, when Indians learn about the Kakawin and Serat Ramayan, they feel the same connection as when reading Valmiki’s Ramayan,” he added.
Reflecting on the significance of the Bali Yatra festival, PM Modi pointed out how Indonesia’s cultural identity remains intertwined with India.
“When people travel on Garuda Indonesia (Indonesian airlines), they experience our shared heritage. These connections remind us of our deep historical ties,” he said.
He hailed the temple’s inauguration as a monumental milestone, stating, “Today, a new golden chapter is being added to our centuries-old heritage. This temple is not just a centre of spirituality but also a testament to our shared cultural values. I have been informed that in addition to Lord Murugan, idols of various other deities have been installed here. This reflects the richness and diversity of our traditions.”
Speaking on the cultural philosophy shared by both nations, he emphasised, “Indonesia follows the tradition of ‘Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,’ which means ‘Unity in Diversity.’ In India, we uphold the same belief. It is because of this shared ethos that people of different communities live in harmony in both our countries. This sacred day reinforces the message of unity in diversity.”
PM Modi also underscored the growing people-to-people ties between the two nations.
“India and Indonesia’s connection is getting stronger due to our shared cultural initiatives. We have committed to protecting and preserving the Prambanan and Borobudur Buddhist Temples together. Such efforts need to be further encouraged, and I am confident that our bilateral ties will continue to strengthen in the future,” he said.
The Jakarta Murugan Temple’s foundation stone was laid on February 14, 2020, with a puja led by revered priests from India and Malaysia. This gathering symbolised the unity and solidarity of Indonesia’s diverse communities.
The temple stands as a remarkable confluence of Indian, Javanese and Balinese traditions while embracing the values of Pancasila.
Beyond being a spiritual sanctuary, it serves as a centre for cultural exchange and tourism, further deepening Indonesia’s ties with India.
The Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony is being conducted in Indonesia, with the support of 72 Gurukals from India.

Title: At Delhi poll rally, PM Modi promises ‘Vikas ka naya Basant’ for residents
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 11:38:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Delhi is set to witness a “Vikas ka Naya Basant” (New spring of development) after the upcoming Assembly elections, comparing it to the seasonal change brought by Basant Panchami.
Addressing a massive public gathering in Delhi’s R.K. Puram, PM Modi extended his greetings the the people on the occasion of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Calling R.K. Puram a true representation of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,” he highlighted how people from various parts of the country live together in the area, many of whom are government employees.
“With Basant Panchami, the weather starts changing. Similarly, on February 5, Delhi will experience a ‘Vikas ka Naya Basant.’ This time, the BJP government is set to be formed in Delhi. The entire city is saying, ‘Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar’!” PM Modi said, as the crowd chanted his name.
Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), PM Modi accused it of ruining Delhi over the last 11 years.
“The AAPda party has wasted precious time for Delhi. I appeal to every family to give us a chance to serve. I guarantee that I will do everything possible to resolve your problems. Whether poor or middle class, the double-engine government will work to make every family’s life happy. We need a government that serves, not one that constantly makes excuses,” he said.
Taking aim at AAP’s leadership, he added, “You have already given a strong government to the country. Now, not even by mistake should the AAP-da government, which has destroyed Delhi, return to power.”
PM Modi also mocked AAP’s election symbol, saying, “Even before the elections, the broom (Jhaadu) is falling apart. Their leaders are quitting because they see the public’s anger on the ground. AAPda is so shaken that they are making false announcements every hour.”
Amid loud sloganeering of “Jhoot Nahi Sahenge”, PM Modi described BJP’s governance as superior to that of AAP dispensation.
“On one side, you have the false promises of AAPda, and on the other, Modi’s guarantee. Modi’s guarantee means 100 per cent fulfilment. Whatever I promise, I deliver,” he asserted.
He cited the recent Union Budget as proof of his government’s commitment to the people. “The four pillars of a Viksit Bharat — Gareeb, Kisaan, Naujawan, and Naari Shakti — are at the centre of this budget. Over the years, we have provided free food, healthcare, and permanent housing to the poor.”
Speaking about India’s economic growth, PM Modi said, “India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy. This means people’s incomes are increasing. In the past, this money would have been lost in scams, but today, an honest BJP government is using it for the welfare of citizens.”
He highlighted that under the budget, manufacturing of essential goods like clothes, shoes, TVs, and mobile phones will become cheaper, boosting ‘Make in India.’
“Our middle class plays a crucial role in development, and BJP is the only party that truly respects them. This budget is being called the most middle-class-friendly budget ever,” he stated.
Elaborating on tax reforms, he recalled the burdens of past governments, “Earlier, just hearing about an upcoming budget would make the middle class anxious for five days, and after the budget, they couldn’t sleep for a whole year. But this time, the budget has filled every Indian family with happiness. Now, earnings up to Rs 12 lakh per year are tax-free, saving thousands for the middle class.”
Comparing today’s tax policies to past Congress governments, he said, “During Nehru’s time, if you earned Rs 12 lakh annually, one-fourth of your salary was taken as tax. During Indira Gandhi’s rule, you would be shocked to know that nearly Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 12 lakh went into taxes. This was their reality.”
He further announced that income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 24 lakh will now be taxed at significantly lower rates, saving Rs 1.1 lakh per year for those in that bracket.
Addressing the senior citizens, he promised additional benefits. “Millions of elderly citizens will gain from this budget. Retired government employees will see reduced taxes and increased pensions. Once BJP forms the government in Delhi, we will introduce a pension of Rs 2,500 for senior citizens and provide free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh.”
During the rally, PM Modi also had a heartwarming interaction with a young girl in the crowd who had drawn a sketch for him. Promising to write her a letter, he shared the moment with the audience, adding an emotional touch to his campaign.

Title: India beat SA to retain U19 Women’s T20 WC title
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:53:06 +0000
Content: Trisha Gongadi put out a sparkling all-round performance as a dominant India retained their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title with a nine-wicket win over South Africa in the summit clash at the Bayuemas Oval on Sunday.
A stellar bowling performance, with the spinners taking nine wickets – three of which went to Trisha – along with fielders stepping up nicely helped Niki Prasad-led India apply the squeeze on South Africa and bowl them out for 82 on a slow pitch.
In the chase, Trisha made 44 not out off 33 balls while Sanika Chalke slammed an unbeaten 26 off 22 deliveries to help India complete the chase in 11.2 overs to clinch the title yet again after winning it in 2023 in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
India’s second successive triumph in the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup yet again showed the gulf that exists between them and teams of other nations at the U19 women’s level, as they also became the first side to win the title without losing any game.
Chasing 83, India got going with Trisha edging wide of the keeper for four Nthabiseng Nini. She then thumped Fay Cowling over covers twice for fours, before G Kamalini began by clearing mid-on with ease off Kayla Reyneke for her first boundary of the final.
Trisha took a special liking to Seshnie Naidu’s leg-spin by rocking back to cut between cover and point, steering past short third region and swinging the full toss over fine leg to collect three fours, as India reached 36 for nil in just four overs.
Kamalini fell for eight in the fifth over when she stepped out to hit Kayla over the boundary ropes, but ended up hitting to long-on. After Sanika Chalke was off the mark with a magnificent drive between cover and mid-off, Trisha bisected the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on for four more.
With Sanika hammering one over Ashleigh van Wyk’s head and beating a valiant dive from long-off to get another boundary, it brought India just 25 runs away from reaching the target. The duo took their time and rotated strike well, before Sanika clipped Jemma Botha for four. \
Trisha steered Jemma past the keeper for four, and was followed by Sanika heaving Monalisa for a boundary to the square leg to get the winning runs for India.
Brief Scores: South Africa 82 all out (Mieke van Voorst 23, Fay Cowling 15; Trisha Gongadi 3-15, Parunika Sisodia 2-6) lost to India 84/1 in 11.2 overs (Trisha Gongadi 44 not out, Sanika Chalke 26 not out; Kayla Reyneke 1-14) by nine wickets

Title: 54 killed, 158 injured in paramilitary attack on market in Sudan’s Omdurman: Ministry
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 08:01:58 +0000
Content: The death toll from shelling by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a crowded market in Omdurman, north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, has risen to 54, Sudan’s Ministry of Health announced.
The ministry said in a statement that health institutions reported 54 deaths and 158 injuries in the deadly attack on Sabreen Market in the Karari locality, Xinhua news agency reported.
It condemned the attack against civilians, saying, “This constitutes a breach of international norms and laws.”
Khalid Ali Aleisir, Sudan’s minister of information and government spokesperson, also slammed the attack as it resulted in massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction of private and public property.
Earlier, a medical source at Al-Nao Hospital in Omdurman told Xinhua that “the situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word. We need blood donors and medical supplies.”
A Xinhua correspondent in Omdurman reported the shelling simultaneously targeted residential areas near the market.
The RSF has not commented on the incident yet.
The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) frequently accuses the RSF of bombing the Karari locality from its positions in Bahri, a city in Khartoum State. Karari is the only area in Omdurman that remains densely populated and fully under army control.
Military confrontations between the SAF and the RSF have intensified recently in Khartoum.
Sudan has been gripped by a devastating conflict between the two parties since mid-April 2023, which claimed at least 29,683 lives and displaced over 15 million people, either inside or outside Sudan, according to the latest estimates by international organisations.

Content: The Netherlands’ privacy watchdog AP on Friday said it will launch an investigation into Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek’s data collection practices and urged Dutch users to exercise caution with the company’s software.
“The AP is (issuing this) warning because of the serious concerns that there are over DeepSeek’s privacy policies … and the way in which it appears to use personal information,” Chairman Aleid Wolfsen said in a statement. The agency added that European citizens’ personal data can only be stored abroad under strict conditions that DeepSeek must adhere to.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday conveyed his best wishes to the nation on Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “Best wishes on the auspicious occasions of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended his heartfelt greetings, stating, “Heartiest greetings to all the countrymen on the sacred festival of Basant Panchami.”
“I wish that Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom and discretion, brings happiness and prosperity in everyone’s life,” he added.
Union Minister and BJP National President J.P. Nadda also took to social media and posted, “Heartiest greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, the festival dedicated to the worship of Maa Saraswati, the goddess of learning, wisdom and knowledge and love for nature.”
“May Goddess Saraswati illuminate the life of all of you with the light of knowledge and provide happiness, prosperity and good health,” he added.
Extending greetings, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar posted, “Warm greetings on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Basant Panchami, also known as Vasanta Panchami and Saraswati Puja, is a festival dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, heralding the arrival of spring. It is celebrated across various Indian regions with distinct customs.

Title: Trump launches trade war with tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:47:45 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered sweeping tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China, demanding they stanch the flow of fentanyl – and illegal immigrants in the case of Canada and Mexico – into the United States, kicking off a trade war that could dent global growth and reignite inflation.
Mexico and Canada, the top two U.S. trading partners, immediately vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would challenge Trump’s move at the World Trade Organization and take other “countermeasures.”
In three executive orders, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, starting on Tuesday.
He vowed to keep the duties in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the U.S. ends. The White House provided no other parameters for determining what might satisfy Trump’s demands.
Responding to concerns raised by oil refiners and Midwestern states, Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada, with Mexican energy imports facing the full 25% tariff.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would respond with 25% tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect Tuesday and $125 billion 21 days later.
Trudeau warned U.S. citizens that Trump’s tariffs would raise their grocery and gasoline costs, potentially shutting down auto assembly plants and limiting supplies of goods such as nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminum. He urged his own citizens to forego travel to the U.S. and to boycott U.S. products.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a post on X, said she was instructing her economy minister to implement retaliatory tariffs but gave no details.
Canada and Mexico said they were working together to face Trump’s tariffs.
China’s Commerce Ministry did not specify its planned countermeasures. Its statement left open the door for talks between Washington and Beijing.
“China hopes that the US will view and handle its own fentanyl and other issues in an objective and rational manner,” it said, adding that Beijing wanted to “engage in frank dialogue, strengthen cooperation and manage differences.”
A White House fact sheet said the tariffs would stay in place “until the crisis alleviated,” but gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new steep tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
The tariff announcement makes good Trump’s repeated threat during the 2024 presidential campaign and since taking office, defying warnings from top economists that a new trade war with the top U.S. trade partners would erode U.S. and global growth, while raising prices for consumers and companies.
Republicans welcomed the news, while industry groups and Democrats issued stark warnings about the impact on prices.
National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said Trump’s move threatened to raise the costs of “everything from avocados to automobiles” and urged the U.S., Canada and Mexico to find a quick solution to avoid escalation.
The three countries should work together to “gain a competitive advantage and facilitate American companies’ ability to export to global markets,” Colvin said in a statement.
Provincial officials and business executives in Canada also reacted with outrage, calling for forceful tariffs on imports from the U.S.
Roughly 90 minutes after Trump’s announcement, the American national anthem was booed in the nation’s capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
U.S. tariff collections are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump’s written order. But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. Saturday would be exempt from the duties.
Trump declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to back the tariffs, which allow the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump was once again testing the limits of U.S. legislation and the tariffs could face legal challenges, while Democratic lawmakers Suzan DelBene and Don Beyer decried what they called “a blatant abuse of executive power.”
White House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs and if Canada, Mexico or China retaliated against American exports, Trump would likely increase the U.S. duties.
Nova Scotia’s Premier Tim Houston said he directed that all alcohol imported from the U.S. be removed from the province’s store shelves.
The White House officials said that Canada specifically would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.
LONG-PROMISED TARIFFS
Trump spoke extensively about the tariffs on Friday, acknowledging they could lead to disruptions and hardships for Americans. He said additional tariffs were planned against steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
The Republican president was not scheduled to speak to reporters about the tariffs after the announcement.
Trump’s tariff move was led by Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a forceful hawk on illegal immigration, and Trump’s nominee to head the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, who flew to Florida with Trump on Friday, a White House official said.
Less than two weeks into his second term, Trump is upending the norms of how the United States is governed and interacts with its neighbors and wider world.
A model gauging the economic impact of Trump’s tariff plan from EY Chief Economist Greg Daco suggests it would reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” at home.
“Steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock – a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse – while also triggering financial market volatility,” Daco wrote on Saturday.
That volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfill his threats. U.S. stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.

Title: Delhi’s air quality plummets to ‘very poor’ category
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 03:59:06 +0000
Content: The air quality in Delhi has significantly deteriorated, as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surged to 341 on Sunday at 6 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), falling into the ‘very poor’ category.
Air quality across Delhi remains concerning as several areas reporting high AQI levels with Anand Vihar reaching an alarming 418, Vivek Vihar at 407, and Wazirpur at 401, Ashok Vihar stands at 384, Jahangirpuri at 372, and Punjabi Bagh at 375, all in the ‘very poor’ category. Patparganj records 367, while Bawana and Rohini are at 338 and 367, respectively. R K Puram has an AQI of 358, and Najafgarh, though lower, still has a ‘poor’ AQI of 282.
The increase in AQI levels has been attributed to a combination of unfavourable meteorological conditions. The calm winds, low ventilation coefficients, and smoggy conditions are contributing to the slow dispersion of pollutants, trapping them over the city.
Meanwhile, the weather in Delhi has been undergoing a shift, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a yellow alert for moderate to dense fog on Sunday. Despite the fog, temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild, with a maximum of 24 degrees Celcius and a minimum of 9 degrees Celcius.
The IMD has observed that the city’s temperatures are transitioning from the cold winter range of 22-26 degrees Celcius for maximum and 10-12 degrees Celcius for minimum, indicating the onset of milder weather.
While mornings and nights are still chilly, the daytimes are showing warmer trends, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celcius.
In response to the rising pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) activated Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) earlier on January 29. These measures are aimed at curbing air pollution by imposing stricter controls on construction activities, vehicular emissions, and other pollution sources.
As Delhi continues to battle the dual challenge of poor air quality and fluctuating weather, residents are urged to take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, wearing masks, and using air purifiers to mitigate the health risks associated with the deteriorating air quality.

Title: EU leaders to huddle on defence against Russia and handling Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 07:25:15 +0000
Content: European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent’s defences against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.
At a royal palace-turned-conference centre in Brussels, the leaders of the EU’s 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defence policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions.
The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures.
Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defence, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance.
Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States – and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand – has also added strains to transatlantic ties.
The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects.
“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defence,” Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defence actor.”
FINDING FUNDING
The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes.
Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defence. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed.
One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defence projects, according to some diplomats.
European countries have ramped up defence spending in recent years, particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU’s borders.
But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defence – a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches.
Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defence – about 326 billion euros ($334.48 billion), according to EU estimates.
That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries.
Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defence spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less – about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.

Title: DeepSeek gives Europe’s tech firms a chance to catch up in global AI race
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:57:51 +0000
Content: Hemanth Mandapati, boss of German startup Novo AI, was an early adopter of DeepSeek chatbots when he switched to the Chinese AI model from OpenAI’s ChatGPT two weeks ago.
“If you have built your application using OpenAI, you can easily migrate to the other ones … it took us minutes to switch,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the GoWest conference for venture capitalists in Gothenburg, Sweden.
DeepSeek’s emergence is changing the landscape for AI, offering companies access to the technology at a fraction of the cost, according to interviews with more than a dozen startup executives and investors. It also has the potential to push other AI companies to improve their models and bring down prices.
“There was an offer from DeepSeek which was five times lower than their actual prices,” said Mandapati. “I am saving a lot of money and users don’t see any kind of a difference.”
Europe’s tech startups had struggled to adopt the new technology at the same rate as U.S. rivals, which have easier access to funding. But executives say DeepSeek could be a game changer.
“It marks a significant step forward in democratising AI and levelling the playing field with Big Tech,” said Seena Rejal, chief commercial officer of British firm NetMind.AI, another early adopter of DeepSeek.
Analysts at Bernstein estimate that DeepSeek’s pricing is 20 to 40 times cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI.
OpenAI charges $2.5 for 1 million input tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, while DeepSeek is currently charging $0.014 for the same number of tokens.
Concerns have been raised by regulators about whether DeepSeek is copying OpenAI data or censoring answers that could portray China in a bad light. It is currently being investigated in different European countries.
“While the future of DeepSeek as a business is difficult to predict, the structural impact seems quite pervasive,” said Sanjot Malhi, partner at venture capital firm Northzone.
WAKE-UP CALL
Nearly $100 billion was invested by venture capitalists in AI companies in 2024 in the U.S. compared with about $15.8 billion in Europe, according to data from PitchBook.
Just on Jan. 22, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI project called Stargate, a joint venture backed by OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle.
Investment in Europe has been more modest.
Only France’s Mistral features among the list of top foundational models dominated by the likes of OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and Google.
China’s DeepSeek attracted attention after writing in a paper last month that the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips. It has since overtaken ChatGPT to become the top-rated productivity application available on Apple’s App Store.
“This is a wake-up call that bigger isn’t always better,” said Fabrizio Del Maffeo, CEO of Axelera AI. “By making models more attainable to everyone, the total cost of ownership and barriers to building innovative tech are lowered which can be a catalyst for the whole industry.”
While some analysts doubt that DeepSeek’s training cost is as low as the company says, they agree it is lower than comparable American models.
“I see DeepSeek as a tremendous opportunity for companies like ours,” said Ulrik R-T, CEO of Denmark’s Empatik AI. “It showed that we do not need huge budgets to be able to achieve our vision.”
COST VS SAFETY
The price war may have already started.
Microsoft last week released OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model to all Copilot users for free, instead of the usual subscription fee of $20 per month.
“AI prices are going down, so future usage is probably going where there is transparency, which is usually open source, even though it’s in China,” said Scale Capital’s Joachim Schelde.
Bigger companies, ranging from Finland’s Nokia to Germany’s SAP, are more cautious about switching.
“Cost is just one factor,” said Alexandru Voica, Head of Corporate at Britain’s Synthesia, which was last valued at $2.1 billion. “Other factors are: ‘do you have all the security certifications, the frameworks, the software ecosystem that allows companies to build and integrate with your platform?'”

Title: Ayodhya Ram mandir chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das hospitalized
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:53:24 +0000
Content: Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, was hospitalized after a sudden decline in his health, sources cited by IANS said on Sunday. Reports indicated that his condition was critical upon arrival, as he had been struggling with breathing difficulties.
Due to the severity of his condition, Das was initially admitted to Shri Ram Hospital, before being transferred to the Trauma Centre and subsequently referred to PGI in Lucknow for advanced treatment.
Earlier, Arun Kumar Singh, a doctor at the Neuro Centre in Ayodhya, said, “The condition of Satyendra Das is critical. A CT scan revealed that he had suffered a brain hemorrhage, which has spread to several parts of the brain.”
Singh said that the hospital had referred him to Lucknow PGI for better medical facilities.
There is great concern among the Ram temple administration in Ayodhya and among the devotees of Acharya Satyendra Das, who have been praying for his recovery at the Ram Janmabhoomi complex.
Acharya Satyendra Das’s condition is now stable, and he has been kept under observation by doctors.
Acharya Satyendra Das was appointed as the chief priest at the start of the Ram temple construction and has been actively involved in worship activities at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple.
On October 15, 2024, the 84-year-old chief priest of the Ayodhya Ram Temple was admitted to a hospital due to neurological issues, according to officials. However, medical authorities have confirmed that his condition remains stable.
“Acharya Satyendra Das, the head priest of Ayodhya’s Shri Ram temple, has been admitted to a private room in the Neurology Ward of SGPGI under the supervision of Dr. Prakash Chandra Pandey,” said Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) Director RK Dhiman.
Acharya Satyendra Das has been a resident of Ayodhya since childhood and has been associated with the Ram Lalla temple for nearly 32 years, having started his worship there before the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.

Title: Budget math looks realistic, economic growth to pick up pace: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:34:09 +0000
Content: The Union Budget has managed to meet the goals of boosting consumption though tax cuts, increasing capex through transfers to states, and maintaining the path of fiscal consolidation which is expected to lead to a recovery in the economic growth rate with macro stability in a comfortable range, according to a Morgan Stanley report released on Monday.
The report said that both fiscal and monetary policy are pivoting to support growth, which is in line with “our view of a cyclical recovery in growth”.
“The Budget math looks realistic, with nominal GDP assumed at 10.1 per cent for F2026 and gross tax revenue growth of 10.8 per cent. We will remain watchful of income tax collection growth, which the government expects to be 14.4 per cent, given the income tax cuts and execution of capex spending to meet the targets,” the report stated.
The report pointed out that the Budget has balanced needs to support growth and continue with fiscal consolidation. As such, the Budget targets a lower fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for F2026 even as it reduced income taxes to support consumption, especially for middle income tax payers, and expanded capex growth, mainly through a boost in grants to states for capex creation.
“Indeed, as per the Finance Minister, direct tax changes should lead to a 1.0 per cent revenue loss of Rs 1 lakh crore (0.3 per cent of GDP), which should help support consumption,” the Morgan Stanley report said.
On the spending side, the mix remains tilted to capex, with effective capex (direct capex plus grants in aid of creation of capital assets) seen growing at 17.4 per cent in F2026BE vs. 5.3 per cent of F2025RE.
“We expect the Budget to support growth recovery through measures to promote consumption and increase effective capex spending, which will likely lead to a more broad-based recovery, while at the same time continued consolidation should help macro stability remain in check,” the report observed.
The simultaneous boost to consumption and capex has to be sweet for equities, especially in the context of continuing and better-than-anticipated fiscal consolidation (projected primary deficit: 0.8 per cent).
The plethora of announcements around easing of India’s tax regime, including permanent establishment rules, GIFT city clarifications, extension of exemptions to sovereign funds, and changes to tax deduction and collection at source could improve FDI and private investment sentiment, according to the report.
“A new tax code is coming this week, as per the Budget, which could reveal a more liberal tax environment. We are overweight Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Technology, and underweight other sectors,” the report added.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower as Asian markets plunge amid trade war fears
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:02:09 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened sharply lower on Monday, as Asian markets tumbled after US President Donald Trump announced trade tariffs which are set to come into effect from Tuesday.
At around 9.33 a.m., the Sensex was trading over 400 points down at 77,103.22 while the Nifty was down 154 points at 23,328.00.
At the opening bell, the Sensex shed 710 points or 0.88 per cent at 76,821.50. On the NSE, all sectors declined with Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty as the worst performing sector.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.3 per cent, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was 2.4 per cent lower, South Korea’s KOSPI tumbled 3 per cent and Australia’s ASX 200 was 1.8 per cent lower.
On Saturday (US time), Trump announced he will impose 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 per cent on goods from China starting from Tuesday. He also pledged to place new tariffs on goods from the European Union.
The US equity futures also saw a sharp sell-off in response to US president Donald Trump imposing tariffs.
“After a negative opening, Nifty can find support at 23,200 followed by 23,100 and 23,000. On the higher side, 23,500 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 23,600 and 23,700,” said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst, Choice Broking.
Rupee opened 41 paise lower at 87.02 against the US Dollar. It closed at 86.61 on Friday.
According to Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory, PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, Asia kicked off what is likely to be a volatile day in global markets after Trump followed through on his threat to hit Mexico, Canada and China with tariffs on imports into the United States.
“It will be fascinating to see how investors react to something they have known was coming and which is almost universally seen as damaging for economic growth and financial assets. They won’t be surprised, but they will still be shocked,” he mentioned
The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers on February 1, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 1,327 crore, while domestic institutions bought equities worth Rs 824 crore on the same day.
Gold and silver witnessed high volatility last week and slipped from their highs amid strength in the dollar index and the beginning of the US trade tariff war.
“Gold and silver are holding their key support levels of $2,722 and $30.20 per troy ounce respectively on a weekly closing basis in the international markets,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.

Title: Trump says Americans may feel ‘pain’ in trade war with Mexico, Canada, China
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:50:22 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump said the sweeping tariffs that he has imposed on Mexico, Canada and China may cause “short term” pain for Americans as global markets reflected concerns the levies could undermine growth and reignite inflation.
Trump said he would talk on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“I don’t expect anything dramatic,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay.”
He also said tariffs would “definitely happen” with the European Union, but did not say when.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China – the United States’ three largest trading partners – will slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
“We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,” he said.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. U.S. stock futures fell more than 2%. Shares across Asia, including Hong Kong , Tokyo and Seoul also slid around 2%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices jumped more than $1, while gasoline futures rose 3%.
North American companies braced for new duties which could upend industries from autos to consumer goods to energy.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
“Economically speaking, escalating trade tensions are a lose-lose situation for all countries involved,” the analysts wrote in a note on Sunday.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant economic growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The Trump tariffs, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Some analysts said there was some hope for negotiations, especially with Canada and China.
Goldman Sachs economists said the levies are likely to be temporary but the outlook is unclear because the White House set very general conditions for their removal.
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China has said it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks with the United States.
Its sharpest pushback was over fentanyl.
“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” China’s foreign ministry said, adding that China has taken extensive measures to combat the problem.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, raising her fist in the air in a speech outside the capital, vowed resilience. She accused the United States of failing to tackle its fentanyl problem and said it would not be solved by tariffs.
Sheinbaum said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend.
Canada said on Sunday it will take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also encouraged Canadians on Sunday to boycott their longtime ally after ordering retaliatory tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, from peanut butter, beer and wine to lumber and appliances.
Canadian officials said they were preparing measures to help business who might be hurt by the trade war.
Trump has heaped derision on Canada in particular, with calls for the country to become the 51st U.S. state. On Sunday, he said Canada “ceases to exist as a viable country” without its “massive subsidy.”
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?
Trump declared a national emergency under two laws, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, which give the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump could face legal challenges for testing the limits of U.S. laws. Some Democratic lawmakers decried what they called a blatant abuse of executive power, while others warned about rising prices.
Even some Republicans criticized Trump’s action. “It will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this?” Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes”.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed Americans were divided on tariffs, with 54% opposing new duties on imported goods and 43% in support, with Democrats more opposed and Republicans more supportive.
INVESTORS LOOK AHEAD
Investors were considering the effects of additional tariffs promised by Trump, including those related to oil and gas, as well as steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
A European Commission spokesperson said the EU “would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods.”
Europe’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, said it was counting on talks to avoid trade conflict.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada after oil refiners and Midwestern states raised concerns. At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
White House officials said Canada would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. Canada and Mexico have become conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents, they said.

Content: Beyonce won the Grammy Award for best country album on Sunday for “Cowboy Carter” at a ceremony that served as a love letter to host city Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires that scarred a hub of the music business.
“Cowboy Carter” was in the running for the night’s top Grammy prize of album of the year. Beyonce has never received the album trophy despite going into Sunday’s ceremony with 32 career wins, more than any other musician.
Indian-American vocalist Chandrika Tandon took home the Grammy award for the album Triveni in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category. She outran Ricky Kej and Anoushka Shankar to win the honour.
Chandrika won the award along with her collaborators, South African flautist Wouter Kellerman and Japanese cellist Eru Matsumoto.
Along with Chandrika, names who were contending in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category included Break of Dawn by Ricky Kej, Opus by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Chapter II: How Dark It Is Before Dawn by Anoushka Shankar, and Warriors Of Light by Radhika Vekaria.
This year’s Grammy festivities were revamped to be part awards show and part fundraiser for people affected by the wildfires, which were contained on Friday after killing 29 people and displacing thousands including many musicians.
Broadcast live on CBS, the show opened with an all-star rendition “I Love LA” featuring Altadena-based band Dawes backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, St. Vincent and Brittany Howard.
“Tonight, we decided we are not just celebrating our favorite music. We are also celebrating the city that brought us so much of that music,” host Trevor Noah said.
Los Angeles natives and siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas followed Noah’s monologue with a performance of nominated song “Birds of a Feather.” “I love you LA,” Eilish said from the stage.
Sabrina Carpenter won best pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet,” minutes after a performance of hits “Please Please Please” and “Espresso” on a set inspired by the golden age of Hollywood.
“I’m still out of breath from that performance,” Carpenter said as she accepted the trophy. “This is my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.”
Doechii became the third woman in Grammys history to win best rap album for “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” As she accepted the honor, she offered words of encouragement to Black women and girls.
“Anything is possible,” Doechii said as she held her trophy. “Don’t allow anyone to project any stereotypes on you.”
Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy.

Title: Positive impact of regular contacts evident in India-Russia strategic partnership: President Murmu
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:23:00 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Monday asserted that the “positive impact” of regular contacts is evident in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit significantly from ongoing interactions at various levels.
As a visiting parliamentary delegation led by Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, called on her at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu also highlighted the importance of closer interaction between women and youth parliamentarians of India and Russia.
“Welcoming the delegation to India, the President stated that exchanges of this nature among public representatives not only foster stronger cooperation but also ensure that the partnership remains contemporary and updated. She further noted that the positive impact of regular contacts is clearly visible in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit from interactions at various levels,” read a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the meeting.
The President mentioned that at the leadership level, regular interactions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin play a key role.
“The cooperation between our parliaments has been very effective,” she said, adding that mechanisms like the Inter-Parliamentary Commission have facilitated this. She emphasized the importance of closer ties between women and youth parliamentarians of both countries.
President Murmu also shared with the delegation that she had inaugurated the New Delhi World Book Fair on Saturday, where Russia was the ‘Focus Country.’ She described the fair as an excellent opportunity for Indian readers to explore Russia’s rich literary heritage and encouraged stronger engagements in cultural and artistic domains.
Earlier, the visiting delegation, which arrived in India late last night for an official visit to strengthen bilateral relations, also visited both houses of the Indian Parliament.
Volodin called on Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Parliament, where he reaffirmed that India is one of Russia’s key partners in Asia.
“We share special relations that are based on friendship, non-interference in sovereign affairs, and mutually beneficial cooperation,” Volodin said during his meeting with the Vice President.
The Chairman of the State Duma further stressed that the leaders of both countries continue to make a “great contribution” to the development of the Russian-Indian dialogue.
“We must legislatively support the decisions made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our relations are growing stronger, and we must ensure that the dynamics at the executive level are reflected in our parliamentary efforts,” Volodin emphasized.
He also noted that India remains one of Russia’s most important partners in Asia.
“Over the past five years, bilateral trade has increased fivefold and continues to grow: from January to November 2024, it grew by 15 per cent. This benefits both our citizens and our countries,” Volodin added.
The Vice President’s office reported that discussions covered various aspects of the multi-dimensional bilateral relationship between India and Russia.
“Both leaders underlined the significance of enhancing parliamentary ties, which form a solid foundation for the overall Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” Vice President Dhankhar said in a post on X.
He highlighted the high level of India-Russia relations and emphasized the significant role of parliamentarians in maintaining them.
The Vice President also recalled that Prime Minister Modi had visited Russia twice over the past seven months, reflecting the importance of the strategic partnership.
“Our relations are entering new trajectories, and the level of interaction is steadily increasing. Both our countries coordinate their positions on platforms like the UN, BRICS, G20, and SCO to address global issues,” the Russian Embassy in India quoted Vice President Dhankhar as saying.
Volodin congratulated the people of India on Republic Day and extended an invitation to members of the Rajya Sabha to visit Russia.
The Russian delegation accompanying the Duma Chairman includes Deputy Speaker Alexander Babakov, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) leader Leonid Slutsky, Novye Lyudi (New People) faction leader Alexey Nechayev, Economic Policy Committee Chairman Maxim Topilin, Agrarian Committee Chairman Vladimir Kashin, and Culture Committee Chairwoman Olga Kazakova.

Title: Europe braces for Trump trade tariffs, as levies on Canada, Mexico, China roil markets
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:57:42 +0000
Content: European leaders were bracing for U.S. tariffs on Monday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping levies on Mexico, Canada and China that will affect billions of dollars worth of trade, roiling global markets and currencies.
Trump said the tariffs against the three largest U.S. trading partners, which take effect on Tuesday, might cause Americans some short-term pain, but “long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world”.
Global stock markets and currencies tumbled on Monday on concerns that the tariffs would trigger an economically damaging trade war. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.3% in morning trading, set for its biggest one-day slide this year and futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 fell 1.4%.
Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday, Trump indicated that the 27-nation European Union would be next in the firing line, but did not say when.
“They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them,” he told reporters.
EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would be prepared to fight back if the U.S. imposes tariffs, but also called for reason and negotiation.
Arriving at the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said if the EU were attacked in its commercial interests it would have to “make itself respected and thus react”. He added that recent declarations from the United States were pushing Europe to be stronger and more united.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, the EU’s largest economy which is highly dependent on exports, also said the bloc could respond if necessary with its own tariffs against the U.S. but stressed it was better for the two to find agreement on trade.
Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Luc Frieden said: “I think tariffs are always bad. Tariffs are bad for trade. Tariffs are bad for the United States.”
Trump hinted that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared tariffs, saying: “I think that one can be worked out”.
The U.S. is the EU’s largest trade and investment partner and has consistently imported more goods than it has exported to the bloc. The U.S. goods trade deficit stood at 155.8 billion euros ($161.6 billion) in 2023, according to Eurostat data.
However, in services, the U.S. had a surplus of exports over imports with the EU of 104 billion euros.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were no winners in a trade war, saying that if one broke out between Europe and the United States, “then the one laughing on the side is China”.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Trump said he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have both announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay,” Trump told reporters.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. Shares in Tokyo ended the day down almost 3% and Australia’s benchmark – often a proxy trade for Chinese markets – dropped 1.8%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices CLc1 jumped more than 1%, while gasoline futures RBc1 rose nearly 3%.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and trigger “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
In Europe, economists at Deutsche Bank said they were currently factoring in a 0.5% hit to gross domestic product (GDP) should Trump impose 10% tariffs on the bloc.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what Canada, Mexico and China would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China called fentanyl America’s problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed resilience and said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend. Canada said it would take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico, burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Shares in Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell by about 5-6% in European trading on Monday.
Analysts at investment bank Stifel estimated that 8 billion euros of VW’s revenues would be impacted by tariffs and 16 billion euros of Stellantis.
Shares in U.S. big tech stocks were also lower ahead of the U.S. open, with Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all down between 1.5% to 2%.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products.

Title: Global semiconductor revenue jumps 18 per cent in 2024: report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:43:37 +0000
Content: The global semiconductor industry witnessed a strong rebound in 2024, with total revenue reaching $626 billion, marking an 18.1 per cent increase from the previous year, according to a report released on Monday.
This positive momentum is expected to continue, with projections indicating that semiconductor revenue will climb to $705 billion in 2025, the report from Gartner stated.
While memory dominated the market, non-memory semiconductor revenue also saw a 6.9 per cent increase in 2024, accounting for 74.8 per cent of total industry revenue.
The report added that, among the top 25 semiconductor companies, 11 posted double-digit revenue increases, while only eight experienced a decline.
Samsung Electronics reclaimed its position as the world’s top semiconductor vendor, overtaking Intel.
The South Korean tech giant benefited from a sharp recovery in memory prices, pushing its revenue to $66.5 billion in 2024.
Meanwhile, Intel slipped to the number two spot as its AI PCs and Core Ultra chipset failed to make a significant impact.
Intel’s semiconductor revenue remained almost flat, with a growth of just 0.1 per cent in 2024.
Nvidia continued its remarkable rise, securing the number three position after increasing its semiconductor revenue by 84 per cent to reach $46 billion.
The company’s strong foothold in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fueled its growth, allowing it to climb two spots in the global rankings.
The memory segment played a key role in the semiconductor industry’s expansion, with revenue soaring by 71.8 per cent in 2024.
DRAM revenue surged by 75.4 per cent, while NAND revenue also climbed by 75.7 per cent year-over-year.
A major factor behind this growth was the increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which contributed significantly to DRAM sales.
HBM accounted for 13.6 per cent of total DRAM revenue in 2024, and its share is expected to rise to 19.2 per cent in 2025.

Title: Man found guilty of hate crime over Sweden Koran burnings
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:06:16 +0000
Content: A Swedish court found an anti-Islam campaigner guilty on Monday of hate crimes for staging public burnings of the Koran, in a ruling handed down five days after another man also being prosecuted over the incidents was shot dead.
Salwan Najem, a Swedish citizen, was given a suspended sentence and fines over the Koran burnings and derogatory comments he made about Muslims in the 2023 incidents, which led to unrest and inspired anger towards Sweden in Muslim countries.
His fellow campaigner, Iraqi refugee Salwan Momika, was shot dead last week on the day he had been due to receive his verdict in a parallel case. No suspect has been charged yet in that killing; five people were detained but later released. Sweden’s prime minister has said a foreign state may have been behind it.
The 2023 Koran burnings made the balance between free speech rights and rules protecting ethnic and religious groups into a major issue for Sweden, its Nordic neighbours and other European countries.
The Stockholm district court said in a statement Najem, 50, and Momika had desecrated the Koran in various ways and made offensive statements directed towards Islam, representatives of the religion and activities in mosques.
Najem was found guilty of hate crimes for “having expressed contempt for the Muslim ethnic group because of their religious beliefs on four occasions”, it said.
Najem’s lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict.
“My client considers that his statements fall within the scope of criticism of religion, which is covered by the freedom of expression,” he said.
The court had dropped the case against Momika after he was killed.

Title: Trump’s meme coin made nearly $100 million in trading fees, as small traders lost money
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:59:31 +0000
Content: Entities behind President Donald Trump’s crypto coin have accumulated close to $100 million in trading fees in less than two weeks, according to estimates from three blockchain analysis firms, a large windfall from a venture that has seen tens of thousands of small traders lose money.
The meme coin, known as $Trump, was launched by the president on Jan. 17 and quickly surged, reaching a peak of over $14.5 billion in overall market value by Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration. It has since slumped by two-thirds.
Three crypto data firms, including Merkle Science and Chainalysis, analyzed the blockchain, a publicly available ledger that shows all transactions involving $Trump, for Reuters. They estimated that the $Trump token had generated between $86 million and $100 million in trading fees by Jan. 30.
The estimates far exceed what has been previously reported.
One of the entities behind the crypto coin is a company owned by Trump, called CIC Digital. The official website for $Trump says CIC Digital will “receive trading revenue derived from trading activities” of the meme coin. Reuters could not determine what portion of the fees so far, if any, had accrued to Trump personally, nor the ownership of the other entities behind the coin.
The creators of the meme coin receive a share of the trading fees from Meteora, a little-known crypto exchange where the $Trump coins were first sold, the blockchain analyses showed.
At least fifty of the largest investors in the coin have made profits in excess of $10 million each on the $Trump coin, according to Chainalysis. At the same time, some 200,000 crypto wallets, most with small holdings, lost money on $Trump on the exchange, it said.
Trump has pledged to put his assets in a trust managed by his children on entering the White House. His son, Eric Trump, speaking on behalf of the Trump Organization, told Reuters in response to questions about the fees that he is proud of what “we continue to accomplish in crypto. $Trump is currently the hottest digital meme on earth.”
“We are just getting started,” he added.
The White House responded to a list of questions from Reuters with a two-page fact sheet describing Trump’s executive order earlier this month on digital financial technology. It did not address questions about the trading fees.
Trump has promised to become the first “crypto president” and make America the “crypto capital of the planet” by overhauling regulations and promoting ownership of digital assets. Several key figures in his administration, cabinet and circles hold crypto or have ties to the crypto industry.
But the combination of large dollar amounts around his crypto ventures and their opaque nature has also sparked criticism from ethics experts and Trump’s political opponents in the Democratic party.
“There’s an ethical concern that in effect he has the power to regulate his own business,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University.
Reuters was unable to determine how much of Trump’s own wealth comes from this newest crypto business because precise details of his ownership are not public. Trump’s other crypto investments include two decentralized finance (DeFi) projects – a type of platform that connects buyers and sellers without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks – and a series of non-fungible tokens, a type of digital asset.
OPAQUE OWNERSHIP
Meme coins are crypto tokens that feature branding or names referencing memes or internet trends. They are usually highly volatile and have scant practical use. Trump’s coin, for example, is intended as an expression of support for the president’s call to ‘fight, fight, fight’ after he was shot at a campaign rally last year.
The exact ownership of Trump’s meme coins is hidden behind opaque limited liability companies. Fight Fight Fight, a Delaware-registered company, is the owner of the official website for the coin, gettrumpmemes.com.
William Zanker, a Trump business associate who in 2022 collaborated with him on digital assets, is listed as the primary contact for Fight Fight Fight in registration documents. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Fight Fight Fight is owned by Trump’s CIC Digital and Celebration Cards, according to the meme coin’s website. Reuters could not ascertain the identity of the people behind Celebration Cards, which also receives revenue from the trading activities of the meme coin.
The official $Trump website says up to 1 billion $Trump coins will be sold over the next 36 months. Initially, a tranche of 200 million $Trump coins was released to the market, when the coin’s creators transferred them to three crypto wallets, the blockchain analysis shows. The meme coin’s website says Fight Fight Fight and CIC Digital own the remaining 800 million coins, worth around $16 billion at the coin’s current price of about $20.
Merkle Science said the three crypto wallets were the earliest holders of the $Trump tokens and received the coins directly from their creators without purchasing them. Chainalysis said that, based on its assessment, the three wallet addresses “belong to creators of the $Trump coin.”
Blockchain analysis firms track the movement of crypto coins on the public ledger that underpins most digital assets. They connect digital wallets – which are anonymous – with known individuals or entities via proprietary research and investigations.
TRADING FEES
The wallets began trading the tokens on Meteora, a DeFi exchange, the blockchain analyses show.
Traders on Meteora pay a fee to the coin creators for providing liquidity, a function that enables buyers and sellers to trade an asset smoothly. The creators do so by putting some of their assets in so-called “liquidity pools”, which then stand ready to enable trading on the exchange.
Meteora says it allows creators to “mint a meme coin and earn fees for life.” The exchange also receives fees.
Ben Chow, the Meteora co-founder, said in a Telegram chat that he did not know anything about the team behind the Trump token. In response to a question on how Meteora was involved with the launch of the $Trump token, Chow said: “I didn’t connect with the team precisely.” He added that “the team reached out” to his co-founder, who is known only as Meow. Reuters could not reach Meow.
The fees on Meteora vary during spells of market volatility, its website says, with “surge pricing” in place, where fees rise with higher demand.
Between Jan.17 and Jan. 30, the three wallets earned fees of $86 million through these activities on Meteora, Merkle Science estimated. Chainalysis assessed that the three had earned about $94 million in trading fees over the same period.
A third blockchain analytics firm, whose founder requested that it not be identified, said by Jan. 29 it calculated the meme coin had garnered roughly $100 million in fees.

Title: Inflation eases, growth picks up, Crisil’s economic forecast for FY26
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:16:50 +0000
Content: India’s economy is poised to grow at 6.5 percent in the financial year 2025-26 (FY26), slightly surpassing the 6.4 percent growth forecast for the current fiscal year, according to a recent report by Crisil.
The report underscores that a combination of lower inflation and anticipated rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will support economic growth, assuming there are no major global shocks and the country experiences a normal monsoon.
“Lower inflation and the RBI’s rate cuts are expected to lift growth next fiscal, assuming a normal monsoon and lower crude oil prices,” the report said.
While government spending will continue to be a key growth driver, Crisil highlighted that the fiscal impulse will weaken as fiscal consolidation advances. A critical factor for sustaining growth would be the revival of private sector investments, which need to gain momentum.
Export prospects, however, face headwinds due to global trade challenges, including tariff hikes by the United States.
On the inflation front, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is projected to decline from 4.7 percent in FY25 to 4.4 percent in FY26, largely due to favorable monsoon expectations, a high base effect in food inflation, and softer global commodity prices. Nevertheless, non-food inflation may see a slight uptick due to an adverse base effect.
If inflation approaches the RBI’s target of 4 percent, it could pave the way for further rate cuts, potentially boosting economic activity.
India’s fiscal deficit, which stood at 5.6 percent of GDP in FY24, is expected to decrease to 4.8 percent in FY25 and further to 4.4 percent in FY26. This improvement will be driven by controlled revenue spending while maintaining a strong emphasis on capital expenditure.
On the external front, the current account deficit (CAD) is expected to widen from 1.0 percent of GDP in FY25 to 1.3 percent in FY26, primarily due to export challenges linked to U.S. trade policies. Despite this, a strong services trade balance, steady remittances, and lower crude oil prices are anticipated to limit the deficit’s expansion.
The Indian rupee is projected to depreciate gradually, averaging Rs 86 per dollar in FY25 and Rs 87 per dollar in FY26. Crisil warned that geopolitical uncertainties could lead to currency market volatility despite the CAD remaining under control.

Title: Illegal immigration disrupting Delhi’s economy, causing “notable increase of Muslim population”: JNU report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:12:03 +0000
Content: A report from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has highlighted the significant socio-economic and political disruptions caused by illegal immigration in Delhi, particularly from Bangladesh and Myanmar. The report, titled Illegal Immigrants to Delhi: Analysing Socio-economic and Political Consequences, outlines how the influx of undocumented settlers has reshaped the city’s demographics, strained resources, and strengthened criminal networks.
The 114-page document presents a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of illegal immigration, pointing out that these trends have led to a “notable increase of Muslim population” in Delhi-NCR. According to the report, unchecked migration has adversely impacted the local economy, created socio-political tensions, and heightened security concerns.
The JNU report underscores how the city’s infrastructure is buckling under the weight of an expanding population fueled by illegal immigration. Public services, including healthcare, education, and transportation, are facing immense pressure, while unregulated settlements have emerged as hubs for hazardous living conditions.
“Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in migrant settlements are contributing to the spread of infectious diseases,” the report warns, adding that these health crises often extend to the broader population.
Illegal settlements also pose environmental risks, with unregulated waste disposal contributing to pollution and public health hazards. Additionally, rising population density has overwhelmed Delhi’s already strained public transportation system.
The report points to political patronage as a key enabler of illegal immigration. It alleges that some political actors have facilitated voter registration for undocumented migrants, raising concerns about electoral manipulation and the erosion of democratic integrity.
“The report says that political patronage plays a crucial role in allowing a steady influx of undocumented Rohingyas and Bangladeshis,” BJP MP Sambit Patra stated while addressing the findings. He accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of being complicit in this process.
According to the findings, illegal immigration has fueled the proliferation of criminal networks. Vulnerable migrants are often exploited for activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and other illicit trades.
Efforts to deport illegal immigrants have faced numerous challenges, including bureaucratic hurdles, lack of cooperation from migrants’ home countries, and resistance from local political entities.
The porous India-Bangladesh border remains a significant obstacle in managing illegal migration. The report criticizes inadequate border control measures, which have allowed the continued influx of undocumented individuals.
Illegal immigration from neighboring countries has also affected India’s diplomatic relations with Bangladesh and Myanmar. The report emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts to address cross-border migration issues.
The influx of illegal migrants has created social tensions, as local populations often view these newcomers with suspicion and hostility. The report highlights instances of discrimination against migrants, which further complicates their integration into Delhi’s social fabric.
The presence of undocumented populations complicates disaster response and crisis management efforts. Migrants living in unofficial settlements are often excluded from official relief measures during emergencies, making it harder to deliver aid effectively.
One of the report’s key recommendations is the formulation of a comprehensive immigration policy. The lack of a clear policy framework has made it difficult to address the root causes of illegal migration and implement effective solutions.
“The absence of reliable data on migration trends hampers effective policymaking and resource allocation,” the report says, urging better data collection and analysis.
Reacting to the report, BJP’s Sambit Patra accused the AAP government of facilitating the influx of illegal immigrants. “Every aspect, including socio-political impact, has been mentioned in this report… The report also talks about how political parties are facilitating fake voter registration for the migrants,” Patra said.
Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar countered the allegations by holding Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri accountable for the settlement of Rohingyas in India. “If Rohingyas are present anywhere in India, it is Shah’s responsibility, while Puri is to blame for their settlement in Delhi,” Kakkar said.

Title: WHO proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:02:40 +0000
Content: World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump’s move to withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the agency, a document released on Monday showed.
Opening the agency’s annual executive board meeting, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency’s work and recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit and enter into dialogue with the WHO about further change.
“We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,” he said.
The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting, during which member state representatives will discuss the agency’s funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.
The executive board proposes cutting the base programmes section of the budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for polio eradication and tackling emergencies.
“With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget could not be ‘business as usual,'” the document reads. The U.S. is the WHO’s biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps after the U.S. move.
However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the challenges, the document adds.
The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base programme budget for the previous period, 2024-2025.
Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago. The process will take one year under U.S. law.

“Greenland is today a part of the kingdom of Denmark. It is part of our territory, and it’s not for sale,” she said ahead of an informal EU leaders meeting in Brussels.
Trump has said he would make the autonomous territory of Denmark a part of the United States, and has not ruled out using military or economic power to persuade Denmark to hand it over.
Fredriksen added on Monday that she agreed with the U.S. view that the Arctic region was becoming increasingly important when talking about security and defence.
“So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,” she said.

Title: Women-led Indian startups making global mark: Minister Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:33:56 +0000
Content: Women-led startups in India are making a global impact and hold the promise of realizing the vision of a “Viksit Bharat,” said Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, on Sunday.
Speaking to a delegation of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry – Ladies Organisation (FICCI-FLO), Singh highlighted women’s contributions even in traditionally challenging sectors like space exploration.
He cited India’s solar mission, “Aditya L1,” led by Nigar Shaji, who is popularly known as ISRO’s “Sunny Lady.”
“Women-led development is a key priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance agenda, with the vision that women-led startups will place India on the global map in the years to come. Our women entrepreneurs have the potential to realize that goal,” Singh said.
He added that since 2014, women’s empowerment has taken on a practical dimension through various welfare schemes, including entrepreneurship-focused initiatives like the PM Mudra Yojana and PM Vishwakarma Yojana, which have largely benefited women entrepreneurs.
The Minister noted that nearly 70 percent of the youth who availed of financial assistance under the PM Mudra Yojana were women, many of whom established businesses that not only supported their livelihoods but also created jobs for others.
Calling traditional artisans and craftsmen an “exclusive asset of India,” Singh said they had been brought into the mainstream through the launch of the PM Vishwakarma Yojana.
“The traditional artisans and craftsmen are as integral to Indian society as anything else. They have preserved centuries-old crafts and traditions but were often overlooked since independence,” he added.

Title: Philippines declares food security emergency to curb soaring rice prices
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:10:50 +0000
Content: Philippine Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel declared a food security emergency concerning rice on Sunday to stabilize the extraordinarily high prices of the staple grain.
“This emergency declaration allows us to release rice buffer stocks held by the National Food Authority (NFA) to stabilize prices and ensure that rice, a staple food for millions, remains accessible to consumers,” Laurel said in a statement.
The declaration was made based on recommendations from the National Price Coordinating Council.
Under the Rice Tariffication Law, the Agriculture Secretary is empowered to declare a food security emergency in response to extraordinary price increases.
The decision allows the Department of Agriculture to direct the NFA to release buffer stocks to government agencies and local units to help curb rising rice prices and protect consumers from further hikes.
Laurel stated that the emergency measures would remain in effect until rice prices are stabilized, Xinhua news agency reported.
In December 2023, the Philippines’ rice inflation hit a staggering 21.4 percent.
Meanwhile, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported last week that the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.6 percent in 2024, below the government’s target range of 6 to 6.5 percent.
“While the GDP growth falls short of our target, we are positioned as the third-fastest growing economy in the region,” said National Economic and Development Authority Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon.
Edillon noted that the Philippines faced significant setbacks in 2024, including extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions, and subdued global demand. The agriculture sector, in particular, suffered due to a series of six typhoons between late October and mid-November.
Looking ahead to 2025, Edillon emphasized the importance of building economic resilience through diversified growth sources and price stability.
“We will ensure a stable food supply and prevent unwarranted price increases through strategic trade policies, timely release and distribution of production and post-production support, and proactive measures against hoarding,” she added.

Title: Schools shut, more flights scheduled as quakes constantly shake Santorini
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:49:21 +0000
Content: Families boarded ferries and extra flights were laid on to help people leave Santorini on Monday as dozens of tremors shook the Greek island for a fourth day.
Tremors have been recorded between the volcanic islands of Santorini and Amorgos in the Aegean Sea since Friday, forcing authorities to close schools in Santorini and nearby Ios, Amorgos and Anafi until Friday.
Quakes, some with a magnitude above 4, rattled Santorini every few minutes on Monday as people were advised to stay out of indoor spaces and small ports. Disaster response units were deployed on the ground as a precaution.
Experts have said the seismic activity on the island, some of whose most populated areas are perched on steep cliffs, will continue for weeks.
Local officials said that permanent residents were not particularly worried as they have been used to quakes but some who were on the island, a popular holiday destination, for work were moving out.
“For three days now there have been earthquakes all the time, every five minutes, it is continuous they don’t stop at all, the entire island is traumatized,” said Tzanis Lignos, 35, who managed to find tickets for himself, his wife and his son to leave.
“No one could sleep last night, not my wife. There was a lot of noise. We went running outside, that is why we cannot stay here any longer.”
Many rushed to board the ferry on Monday including families with babies and children.
“There are constantly earthquakes, it is intense, we feel it,” said Zoi Lignou, 72.
“We have been patient for three days but today was the worst so we said we will leave, for as many days as it takes.”
Aegean Airlines said it would operate three additional flights to and from Santorini on Monday and Tuesday to facilitate the travel of residents and visitors upon a request by Greece’s Civil Protection Ministry.
“We estimate it (the activity) will continue for some days and there could be a lengthy seismic sequence,” Efthymios Lekkas, a professor of tectonic geology and disaster management, and part of a team of experts assessing the situation on the ground, told Greek television.
Greece sits on multiple fault lines and is often rattled by earthquakes.
One of the largest volcanic eruptions in history, around 1600 BC, formed Santorini in its current shape. The last eruption in the area occurred in 1950.
Experts said a mild volcanic activity also recorded near Santorini in recent days was not linked to the quakes.

Title: Cambodia completes restoration of UNESCO-Listed Angkor Park
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:27:53 +0000
Content: Cambodia has completed the restoration of a more than 1,000-year-old brick temple located on the north side of Phnom Krom Temple in the UNESCO-listed Angkor Archaeological Park, the APSARA National Authority (ANA) announced on Monday.
Ros Visoth, a Conservation Officer from the ANA’s Department of Conservation of Monuments and Preventive Archaeology, stated that the Hindu temple, built in the late ninth century, measures approximately six meters in width and over seven meters in height.
The restoration work, which began in June 2024, was completed in late December 2024.
“The ruined temple has undergone a complete restoration, returning it to its former glory thanks to the meticulous efforts of experts from the APSARA National Authority,” Visoth said.
He noted that prior to the restoration, the temple had suffered from significant deterioration, with its roof and walls badly decayed.
“During the rainy season, water seeped through the brick seams due to age, weather conditions, and plant growth that had damaged the bricks,” he said.
To restore the temple, the team focused on preserving the existing bricks by salvaging those that remained intact, cutting new bricks to fill gaps, and carefully reconstructing the walls to align with the original structure, Visoth explained.
Following the restoration, Visoth expressed confidence that the temple would become a captivating site for visitors, Xinhua news agency reported.
Perched on a hill, Phnom Krom Temple offers a variety of attractions, including stunning views of the freshwater Tonle Sap Lake, picturesque landscapes of golden rice fields, breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, and nearby villages and pagodas, according to the news release.
Located in northwest Siem Reap province, the 401-square-kilometer Angkor Archaeological Park is home to 91 ancient temples built between the ninth and 13th centuries.
The site, which is Cambodia’s most popular tourist destination, attracted 1.02 million international tourists in 2024, generating $47.8 million in revenue from ticket sales, according to the state-owned Angkor Enterprise.

Title: “India-Russia friendship a shining example of cooperation and diplomacy: Speaker Om Birla welcomes Russian parliamentary delegation
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 14:58:38 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday extended a warm welcome to the Russian parliamentary delegation led by the Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, Vyacheslav Volodin, to witness the proceedings of the Lower House.
Birla said that the robust and time-tested friendship between India and Russia stands as a model for cooperation and diplomacy worldwide. Highlighting the historic and enduring ties between the two nations, he said that their relationship, rooted in centuries-old bonds, has positioned Russia as India’s closest ally since independence.
Congratulating Russia on its fruitful chairmanship of BRICS in 2024, Birla recalled his participation in the BRICS Parliamentary Summit held in St. Petersburg. He underscored the significance of such exchanges in strengthening parliamentary processes and deepening bilateral ties.
Expressing satisfaction over the Russian delegation’s observation of proceedings in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Birla highlighted how this provided valuable insights into India’s democratic framework. He explained the functioning of India’s Parliamentary Committees, describing them as “Mini-Parliaments” where budgetary matters and critical issues are examined in depth. These committees, he said, operate in a non-partisan manner, enabling comprehensive discussions often constrained in the larger House due to time limitations.
Reflecting on India’s 75th year as a Republic, Birla spoke about the country’s journey since independence and the visionary contributions of the Constitution’s founding fathers in upholding equality and justice for all citizens. He highlighted India’s progress in strengthening constitutional values and democratic practices over the years.
Further stressing the strong cooperation between the Parliaments of India and Russia, Speaker Birla cited frequent engagements at multilateral platforms such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), BRICS Parliamentary Forum, and G-20. He reiterated his belief in the role of mutual trust and respect in strengthening India-Russia ties, which have evolved into a Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership encompassing political, strategic, and cultural cooperation.
Acknowledging vibrant people-to-people ties as the foundation of this partnership, Birla expressed confidence that the current visit would further bolster bilateral relations, fostering mutual growth and prosperity.
Vyacheslav Volodin expressed gratitude for the warm reception extended to his delegation. He added that observing parliamentary proceedings in a multi-party democracy like India was an enriching experience. Praising the enduring partnership between India and Russia, he highlighted the strong bond shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin as a driving force behind bilateral ties.
Mr. Volodin congratulated India on its 75 years as a republic and commended the country’s remarkable economic growth, acknowledging its emergence as a global power. He hoped that India-Russia friendship would continue to thrive and reach new horizons.

Title: Positive impact of regular contacts evident in India-Russia strategic partnership: President Murmu
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:23:00 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Monday asserted that the “positive impact” of regular contacts is evident in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit significantly from ongoing interactions at various levels.
As a visiting parliamentary delegation led by Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, called on her at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu also highlighted the importance of closer interaction between women and youth parliamentarians of India and Russia.
“Welcoming the delegation to India, the President stated that exchanges of this nature among public representatives not only foster stronger cooperation but also ensure that the partnership remains contemporary and updated. She further noted that the positive impact of regular contacts is clearly visible in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit from interactions at various levels,” read a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the meeting.
The President mentioned that at the leadership level, regular interactions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin play a key role.
“The cooperation between our parliaments has been very effective,” she said, adding that mechanisms like the Inter-Parliamentary Commission have facilitated this. She emphasized the importance of closer ties between women and youth parliamentarians of both countries.
President Murmu also shared with the delegation that she had inaugurated the New Delhi World Book Fair on Saturday, where Russia was the ‘Focus Country.’ She described the fair as an excellent opportunity for Indian readers to explore Russia’s rich literary heritage and encouraged stronger engagements in cultural and artistic domains.
Earlier, the visiting delegation, which arrived in India late last night for an official visit to strengthen bilateral relations, also visited both houses of the Indian Parliament.
Volodin called on Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Parliament, where he reaffirmed that India is one of Russia’s key partners in Asia.
“We share special relations that are based on friendship, non-interference in sovereign affairs, and mutually beneficial cooperation,” Volodin said during his meeting with the Vice President.
The Chairman of the State Duma further stressed that the leaders of both countries continue to make a “great contribution” to the development of the Russian-Indian dialogue.
“We must legislatively support the decisions made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our relations are growing stronger, and we must ensure that the dynamics at the executive level are reflected in our parliamentary efforts,” Volodin emphasized.
He also noted that India remains one of Russia’s most important partners in Asia.
“Over the past five years, bilateral trade has increased fivefold and continues to grow: from January to November 2024, it grew by 15 per cent. This benefits both our citizens and our countries,” Volodin added.
The Vice President’s office reported that discussions covered various aspects of the multi-dimensional bilateral relationship between India and Russia.
“Both leaders underlined the significance of enhancing parliamentary ties, which form a solid foundation for the overall Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” Vice President Dhankhar said in a post on X.
He highlighted the high level of India-Russia relations and emphasized the significant role of parliamentarians in maintaining them.
The Vice President also recalled that Prime Minister Modi had visited Russia twice over the past seven months, reflecting the importance of the strategic partnership.
“Our relations are entering new trajectories, and the level of interaction is steadily increasing. Both our countries coordinate their positions on platforms like the UN, BRICS, G20, and SCO to address global issues,” the Russian Embassy in India quoted Vice President Dhankhar as saying.

Title: Europe braces for Trump trade tariffs, as levies on Canada, Mexico, China roil markets
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:57:42 +0000
Content: European leaders were bracing for U.S. tariffs on Monday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping levies on Mexico, Canada and China that will affect billions of dollars worth of trade, roiling global markets and currencies.
Trump said the tariffs against the three largest U.S. trading partners, which take effect on Tuesday, might cause Americans some short-term pain, but “long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world”.
Global stock markets and currencies tumbled on Monday on concerns that the tariffs would trigger an economically damaging trade war. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.3% in morning trading, set for its biggest one-day slide this year and futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 fell 1.4%.
Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday, Trump indicated that the 27-nation European Union would be next in the firing line, but did not say when.
“They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them,” he told reporters.
EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would be prepared to fight back if the U.S. imposes tariffs, but also called for reason and negotiation.
Arriving at the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said if the EU were attacked in its commercial interests it would have to “make itself respected and thus react”. He added that recent declarations from the United States were pushing Europe to be stronger and more united.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, the EU’s largest economy which is highly dependent on exports, also said the bloc could respond if necessary with its own tariffs against the U.S. but stressed it was better for the two to find agreement on trade.
Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Luc Frieden said: “I think tariffs are always bad. Tariffs are bad for trade. Tariffs are bad for the United States.”
Trump hinted that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared tariffs, saying: “I think that one can be worked out”.
The U.S. is the EU’s largest trade and investment partner and has consistently imported more goods than it has exported to the bloc. The U.S. goods trade deficit stood at 155.8 billion euros ($161.6 billion) in 2023, according to Eurostat data.
However, in services, the U.S. had a surplus of exports over imports with the EU of 104 billion euros.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were no winners in a trade war, saying that if one broke out between Europe and the United States, “then the one laughing on the side is China”.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Trump said he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have both announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay,” Trump told reporters.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. Shares in Tokyo ended the day down almost 3% and Australia’s benchmark – often a proxy trade for Chinese markets – dropped 1.8%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices CLc1 jumped more than 1%, while gasoline futures RBc1 rose nearly 3%.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and trigger “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
In Europe, economists at Deutsche Bank said they were currently factoring in a 0.5% hit to gross domestic product (GDP) should Trump impose 10% tariffs on the bloc.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what Canada, Mexico and China would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China called fentanyl America’s problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed resilience and said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend. Canada said it would take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico, burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Shares in Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell by about 5-6% in European trading on Monday.
Analysts at investment bank Stifel estimated that 8 billion euros of VW’s revenues would be impacted by tariffs and 16 billion euros of Stellantis.
Shares in U.S. big tech stocks were also lower ahead of the U.S. open, with Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all down between 1.5% to 2%.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products.

Title: Global semiconductor revenue jumps 18 per cent in 2024: report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:43:37 +0000
Content: The global semiconductor industry witnessed a strong rebound in 2024, with total revenue reaching $626 billion, marking an 18.1 per cent increase from the previous year, according to a report released on Monday.
This positive momentum is expected to continue, with projections indicating that semiconductor revenue will climb to $705 billion in 2025, the report from Gartner stated.
While memory dominated the market, non-memory semiconductor revenue also saw a 6.9 per cent increase in 2024, accounting for 74.8 per cent of total industry revenue.
The report added that, among the top 25 semiconductor companies, 11 posted double-digit revenue increases, while only eight experienced a decline.
Samsung Electronics reclaimed its position as the world’s top semiconductor vendor, overtaking Intel.
The South Korean tech giant benefited from a sharp recovery in memory prices, pushing its revenue to $66.5 billion in 2024.
Meanwhile, Intel slipped to the number two spot as its AI PCs and Core Ultra chipset failed to make a significant impact.
Intel’s semiconductor revenue remained almost flat, with a growth of just 0.1 per cent in 2024.
Nvidia continued its remarkable rise, securing the number three position after increasing its semiconductor revenue by 84 per cent to reach $46 billion.
The company’s strong foothold in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fueled its growth, allowing it to climb two spots in the global rankings.
The memory segment played a key role in the semiconductor industry’s expansion, with revenue soaring by 71.8 per cent in 2024.
DRAM revenue surged by 75.4 per cent, while NAND revenue also climbed by 75.7 per cent year-over-year.
A major factor behind this growth was the increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which contributed significantly to DRAM sales.
HBM accounted for 13.6 per cent of total DRAM revenue in 2024, and its share is expected to rise to 19.2 per cent in 2025.
