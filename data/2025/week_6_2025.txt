Title: PM Modi virtually attends Maha Kumbhabhishekam of Jakarta Murugan Temple in Indonesia
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 12:23:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday virtually participated in the Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony of Shri Sanathana Dharma Aalayam, also known as the Jakarta Murugan Temple, Indonesia’s first-ever temple dedicated to Lord Murugan.
PM Modi described the temple as a beacon of spirituality, culture, and unity and also expressed his heartfelt connection to the event despite being miles away.
“It is my privilege to be part of this historic Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony at the Murugan Temple in Jakarta. My brother, President Prabowo’s presence makes it even more special for me. While I may be hundreds of kilometres away, my heart is as close to this moment,” he said.
Addressing the gathering virtually, PM Modi highlighted historical and cultural connection between India and Indonesia.
“Just a few days ago, President Prabowo Subianto carried the love of 140 crore Indians to Indonesia, and I am confident that through him, all of you can feel the warm wishes of every Indian. I congratulate everyone — crores of devotees in India, Indonesia, and across the world — on this sacred occasion,” he said.
Stressing the age-old ties between the two nations, he remarked, “India and Indonesia’s connection is not just geopolitical. We are bound by thousands of years of shared culture, history, faith, devotion, and spirituality. Our bond is linked with Lord Murugan, Lord Sri Ram, and Lord Buddha.”
“When an Indian visits Indonesia and prays at the Prambanan Temple, the experience is as spiritual as visiting Kashi or Kedarnath. Similarly, when Indians learn about the Kakawin and Serat Ramayan, they feel the same connection as when reading Valmiki’s Ramayan,” he added.
Reflecting on the significance of the Bali Yatra festival, PM Modi pointed out how Indonesia’s cultural identity remains intertwined with India.
“When people travel on Garuda Indonesia (Indonesian airlines), they experience our shared heritage. These connections remind us of our deep historical ties,” he said.
He hailed the temple’s inauguration as a monumental milestone, stating, “Today, a new golden chapter is being added to our centuries-old heritage. This temple is not just a centre of spirituality but also a testament to our shared cultural values. I have been informed that in addition to Lord Murugan, idols of various other deities have been installed here. This reflects the richness and diversity of our traditions.”
Speaking on the cultural philosophy shared by both nations, he emphasised, “Indonesia follows the tradition of ‘Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,’ which means ‘Unity in Diversity.’ In India, we uphold the same belief. It is because of this shared ethos that people of different communities live in harmony in both our countries. This sacred day reinforces the message of unity in diversity.”
PM Modi also underscored the growing people-to-people ties between the two nations.
“India and Indonesia’s connection is getting stronger due to our shared cultural initiatives. We have committed to protecting and preserving the Prambanan and Borobudur Buddhist Temples together. Such efforts need to be further encouraged, and I am confident that our bilateral ties will continue to strengthen in the future,” he said.
The Jakarta Murugan Temple’s foundation stone was laid on February 14, 2020, with a puja led by revered priests from India and Malaysia. This gathering symbolised the unity and solidarity of Indonesia’s diverse communities.
The temple stands as a remarkable confluence of Indian, Javanese and Balinese traditions while embracing the values of Pancasila.
Beyond being a spiritual sanctuary, it serves as a centre for cultural exchange and tourism, further deepening Indonesia’s ties with India.
The Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony is being conducted in Indonesia, with the support of 72 Gurukals from India.

Title: At Delhi poll rally, PM Modi promises ‘Vikas ka naya Basant’ for residents
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 11:38:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that Delhi is set to witness a “Vikas ka Naya Basant” (New spring of development) after the upcoming Assembly elections, comparing it to the seasonal change brought by Basant Panchami.
Addressing a massive public gathering in Delhi’s R.K. Puram, PM Modi extended his greetings the the people on the occasion of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Calling R.K. Puram a true representation of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,” he highlighted how people from various parts of the country live together in the area, many of whom are government employees.
“With Basant Panchami, the weather starts changing. Similarly, on February 5, Delhi will experience a ‘Vikas ka Naya Basant.’ This time, the BJP government is set to be formed in Delhi. The entire city is saying, ‘Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar’!” PM Modi said, as the crowd chanted his name.
Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), PM Modi accused it of ruining Delhi over the last 11 years.
“The AAPda party has wasted precious time for Delhi. I appeal to every family to give us a chance to serve. I guarantee that I will do everything possible to resolve your problems. Whether poor or middle class, the double-engine government will work to make every family’s life happy. We need a government that serves, not one that constantly makes excuses,” he said.
Taking aim at AAP’s leadership, he added, “You have already given a strong government to the country. Now, not even by mistake should the AAP-da government, which has destroyed Delhi, return to power.”
PM Modi also mocked AAP’s election symbol, saying, “Even before the elections, the broom (Jhaadu) is falling apart. Their leaders are quitting because they see the public’s anger on the ground. AAPda is so shaken that they are making false announcements every hour.”
Amid loud sloganeering of “Jhoot Nahi Sahenge”, PM Modi described BJP’s governance as superior to that of AAP dispensation.
“On one side, you have the false promises of AAPda, and on the other, Modi’s guarantee. Modi’s guarantee means 100 per cent fulfilment. Whatever I promise, I deliver,” he asserted.
He cited the recent Union Budget as proof of his government’s commitment to the people. “The four pillars of a Viksit Bharat — Gareeb, Kisaan, Naujawan, and Naari Shakti — are at the centre of this budget. Over the years, we have provided free food, healthcare, and permanent housing to the poor.”
Speaking about India’s economic growth, PM Modi said, “India is now the world’s fifth-largest economy. This means people’s incomes are increasing. In the past, this money would have been lost in scams, but today, an honest BJP government is using it for the welfare of citizens.”
He highlighted that under the budget, manufacturing of essential goods like clothes, shoes, TVs, and mobile phones will become cheaper, boosting ‘Make in India.’
“Our middle class plays a crucial role in development, and BJP is the only party that truly respects them. This budget is being called the most middle-class-friendly budget ever,” he stated.
Elaborating on tax reforms, he recalled the burdens of past governments, “Earlier, just hearing about an upcoming budget would make the middle class anxious for five days, and after the budget, they couldn’t sleep for a whole year. But this time, the budget has filled every Indian family with happiness. Now, earnings up to Rs 12 lakh per year are tax-free, saving thousands for the middle class.”
Comparing today’s tax policies to past Congress governments, he said, “During Nehru’s time, if you earned Rs 12 lakh annually, one-fourth of your salary was taken as tax. During Indira Gandhi’s rule, you would be shocked to know that nearly Rs 10 lakh out of Rs 12 lakh went into taxes. This was their reality.”
He further announced that income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 24 lakh will now be taxed at significantly lower rates, saving Rs 1.1 lakh per year for those in that bracket.
Addressing the senior citizens, he promised additional benefits. “Millions of elderly citizens will gain from this budget. Retired government employees will see reduced taxes and increased pensions. Once BJP forms the government in Delhi, we will introduce a pension of Rs 2,500 for senior citizens and provide free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh.”
During the rally, PM Modi also had a heartwarming interaction with a young girl in the crowd who had drawn a sketch for him. Promising to write her a letter, he shared the moment with the audience, adding an emotional touch to his campaign.

Title: India beat SA to retain U19 Women’s T20 WC title
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:53:06 +0000
Content: Trisha Gongadi put out a sparkling all-round performance as a dominant India retained their U19 Women’s T20 World Cup title with a nine-wicket win over South Africa in the summit clash at the Bayuemas Oval on Sunday.
A stellar bowling performance, with the spinners taking nine wickets – three of which went to Trisha – along with fielders stepping up nicely helped Niki Prasad-led India apply the squeeze on South Africa and bowl them out for 82 on a slow pitch.
In the chase, Trisha made 44 not out off 33 balls while Sanika Chalke slammed an unbeaten 26 off 22 deliveries to help India complete the chase in 11.2 overs to clinch the title yet again after winning it in 2023 in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
India’s second successive triumph in the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup yet again showed the gulf that exists between them and teams of other nations at the U19 women’s level, as they also became the first side to win the title without losing any game.
Chasing 83, India got going with Trisha edging wide of the keeper for four Nthabiseng Nini. She then thumped Fay Cowling over covers twice for fours, before G Kamalini began by clearing mid-on with ease off Kayla Reyneke for her first boundary of the final.
Trisha took a special liking to Seshnie Naidu’s leg-spin by rocking back to cut between cover and point, steering past short third region and swinging the full toss over fine leg to collect three fours, as India reached 36 for nil in just four overs.
Kamalini fell for eight in the fifth over when she stepped out to hit Kayla over the boundary ropes, but ended up hitting to long-on. After Sanika Chalke was off the mark with a magnificent drive between cover and mid-off, Trisha bisected the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on for four more.
With Sanika hammering one over Ashleigh van Wyk’s head and beating a valiant dive from long-off to get another boundary, it brought India just 25 runs away from reaching the target. The duo took their time and rotated strike well, before Sanika clipped Jemma Botha for four. \
Trisha steered Jemma past the keeper for four, and was followed by Sanika heaving Monalisa for a boundary to the square leg to get the winning runs for India.
Brief Scores: South Africa 82 all out (Mieke van Voorst 23, Fay Cowling 15; Trisha Gongadi 3-15, Parunika Sisodia 2-6) lost to India 84/1 in 11.2 overs (Trisha Gongadi 44 not out, Sanika Chalke 26 not out; Kayla Reyneke 1-14) by nine wickets

Title: 54 killed, 158 injured in paramilitary attack on market in Sudan’s Omdurman: Ministry
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 08:01:58 +0000
Content: The death toll from shelling by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a crowded market in Omdurman, north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, has risen to 54, Sudan’s Ministry of Health announced.
The ministry said in a statement that health institutions reported 54 deaths and 158 injuries in the deadly attack on Sabreen Market in the Karari locality, Xinhua news agency reported.
It condemned the attack against civilians, saying, “This constitutes a breach of international norms and laws.”
Khalid Ali Aleisir, Sudan’s minister of information and government spokesperson, also slammed the attack as it resulted in massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction of private and public property.
Earlier, a medical source at Al-Nao Hospital in Omdurman told Xinhua that “the situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word. We need blood donors and medical supplies.”
A Xinhua correspondent in Omdurman reported the shelling simultaneously targeted residential areas near the market.
The RSF has not commented on the incident yet.
The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) frequently accuses the RSF of bombing the Karari locality from its positions in Bahri, a city in Khartoum State. Karari is the only area in Omdurman that remains densely populated and fully under army control.
Military confrontations between the SAF and the RSF have intensified recently in Khartoum.
Sudan has been gripped by a devastating conflict between the two parties since mid-April 2023, which claimed at least 29,683 lives and displaced over 15 million people, either inside or outside Sudan, according to the latest estimates by international organisations.

Content: The Netherlands’ privacy watchdog AP on Friday said it will launch an investigation into Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek’s data collection practices and urged Dutch users to exercise caution with the company’s software.
“The AP is (issuing this) warning because of the serious concerns that there are over DeepSeek’s privacy policies … and the way in which it appears to use personal information,” Chairman Aleid Wolfsen said in a statement. The agency added that European citizens’ personal data can only be stored abroad under strict conditions that DeepSeek must adhere to.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday conveyed his best wishes to the nation on Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “Best wishes on the auspicious occasions of Basant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended his heartfelt greetings, stating, “Heartiest greetings to all the countrymen on the sacred festival of Basant Panchami.”
“I wish that Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom and discretion, brings happiness and prosperity in everyone’s life,” he added.
Union Minister and BJP National President J.P. Nadda also took to social media and posted, “Heartiest greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, the festival dedicated to the worship of Maa Saraswati, the goddess of learning, wisdom and knowledge and love for nature.”
“May Goddess Saraswati illuminate the life of all of you with the light of knowledge and provide happiness, prosperity and good health,” he added.
Extending greetings, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar posted, “Warm greetings on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami and Saraswati Puja.”
Basant Panchami, also known as Vasanta Panchami and Saraswati Puja, is a festival dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, heralding the arrival of spring. It is celebrated across various Indian regions with distinct customs.

Title: Trump launches trade war with tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:47:45 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered sweeping tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China, demanding they stanch the flow of fentanyl – and illegal immigrants in the case of Canada and Mexico – into the United States, kicking off a trade war that could dent global growth and reignite inflation.
Mexico and Canada, the top two U.S. trading partners, immediately vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would challenge Trump’s move at the World Trade Organization and take other “countermeasures.”
In three executive orders, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, starting on Tuesday.
He vowed to keep the duties in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the U.S. ends. The White House provided no other parameters for determining what might satisfy Trump’s demands.
Responding to concerns raised by oil refiners and Midwestern states, Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada, with Mexican energy imports facing the full 25% tariff.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would respond with 25% tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect Tuesday and $125 billion 21 days later.
Trudeau warned U.S. citizens that Trump’s tariffs would raise their grocery and gasoline costs, potentially shutting down auto assembly plants and limiting supplies of goods such as nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminum. He urged his own citizens to forego travel to the U.S. and to boycott U.S. products.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a post on X, said she was instructing her economy minister to implement retaliatory tariffs but gave no details.
Canada and Mexico said they were working together to face Trump’s tariffs.
China’s Commerce Ministry did not specify its planned countermeasures. Its statement left open the door for talks between Washington and Beijing.
“China hopes that the US will view and handle its own fentanyl and other issues in an objective and rational manner,” it said, adding that Beijing wanted to “engage in frank dialogue, strengthen cooperation and manage differences.”
A White House fact sheet said the tariffs would stay in place “until the crisis alleviated,” but gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new steep tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
The tariff announcement makes good Trump’s repeated threat during the 2024 presidential campaign and since taking office, defying warnings from top economists that a new trade war with the top U.S. trade partners would erode U.S. and global growth, while raising prices for consumers and companies.
Republicans welcomed the news, while industry groups and Democrats issued stark warnings about the impact on prices.
National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said Trump’s move threatened to raise the costs of “everything from avocados to automobiles” and urged the U.S., Canada and Mexico to find a quick solution to avoid escalation.
The three countries should work together to “gain a competitive advantage and facilitate American companies’ ability to export to global markets,” Colvin said in a statement.
Provincial officials and business executives in Canada also reacted with outrage, calling for forceful tariffs on imports from the U.S.
Roughly 90 minutes after Trump’s announcement, the American national anthem was booed in the nation’s capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
U.S. tariff collections are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump’s written order. But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. Saturday would be exempt from the duties.
Trump declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to back the tariffs, which allow the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump was once again testing the limits of U.S. legislation and the tariffs could face legal challenges, while Democratic lawmakers Suzan DelBene and Don Beyer decried what they called “a blatant abuse of executive power.”
White House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs and if Canada, Mexico or China retaliated against American exports, Trump would likely increase the U.S. duties.
Nova Scotia’s Premier Tim Houston said he directed that all alcohol imported from the U.S. be removed from the province’s store shelves.
The White House officials said that Canada specifically would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.
LONG-PROMISED TARIFFS
Trump spoke extensively about the tariffs on Friday, acknowledging they could lead to disruptions and hardships for Americans. He said additional tariffs were planned against steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
The Republican president was not scheduled to speak to reporters about the tariffs after the announcement.
Trump’s tariff move was led by Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a forceful hawk on illegal immigration, and Trump’s nominee to head the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, who flew to Florida with Trump on Friday, a White House official said.
Less than two weeks into his second term, Trump is upending the norms of how the United States is governed and interacts with its neighbors and wider world.
A model gauging the economic impact of Trump’s tariff plan from EY Chief Economist Greg Daco suggests it would reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” at home.
“Steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock – a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse – while also triggering financial market volatility,” Daco wrote on Saturday.
That volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfill his threats. U.S. stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.

Title: Delhi’s air quality plummets to ‘very poor’ category
Publication Date: Sun, 02 Feb 2025 03:59:06 +0000
Content: The air quality in Delhi has significantly deteriorated, as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surged to 341 on Sunday at 6 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), falling into the ‘very poor’ category.
Air quality across Delhi remains concerning as several areas reporting high AQI levels with Anand Vihar reaching an alarming 418, Vivek Vihar at 407, and Wazirpur at 401, Ashok Vihar stands at 384, Jahangirpuri at 372, and Punjabi Bagh at 375, all in the ‘very poor’ category. Patparganj records 367, while Bawana and Rohini are at 338 and 367, respectively. R K Puram has an AQI of 358, and Najafgarh, though lower, still has a ‘poor’ AQI of 282.
The increase in AQI levels has been attributed to a combination of unfavourable meteorological conditions. The calm winds, low ventilation coefficients, and smoggy conditions are contributing to the slow dispersion of pollutants, trapping them over the city.
Meanwhile, the weather in Delhi has been undergoing a shift, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a yellow alert for moderate to dense fog on Sunday. Despite the fog, temperatures are expected to remain relatively mild, with a maximum of 24 degrees Celcius and a minimum of 9 degrees Celcius.
The IMD has observed that the city’s temperatures are transitioning from the cold winter range of 22-26 degrees Celcius for maximum and 10-12 degrees Celcius for minimum, indicating the onset of milder weather.
While mornings and nights are still chilly, the daytimes are showing warmer trends, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celcius.
In response to the rising pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) activated Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) earlier on January 29. These measures are aimed at curbing air pollution by imposing stricter controls on construction activities, vehicular emissions, and other pollution sources.
As Delhi continues to battle the dual challenge of poor air quality and fluctuating weather, residents are urged to take necessary precautions, such as limiting outdoor activities, wearing masks, and using air purifiers to mitigate the health risks associated with the deteriorating air quality.

Title: EU leaders to huddle on defence against Russia and handling Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 07:25:15 +0000
Content: European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent’s defences against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.
At a royal palace-turned-conference centre in Brussels, the leaders of the EU’s 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defence policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions.
The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures.
Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defence, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance.
Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States – and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand – has also added strains to transatlantic ties.
The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects.
“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defence,” Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defence actor.”
FINDING FUNDING
The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes.
Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defence. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed.
One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defence projects, according to some diplomats.
European countries have ramped up defence spending in recent years, particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU’s borders.
But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defence – a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches.
Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defence – about 326 billion euros ($334.48 billion), according to EU estimates.
That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries.
Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defence spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less – about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.

Title: DeepSeek gives Europe’s tech firms a chance to catch up in global AI race
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:57:51 +0000
Content: Hemanth Mandapati, boss of German startup Novo AI, was an early adopter of DeepSeek chatbots when he switched to the Chinese AI model from OpenAI’s ChatGPT two weeks ago.
“If you have built your application using OpenAI, you can easily migrate to the other ones … it took us minutes to switch,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the GoWest conference for venture capitalists in Gothenburg, Sweden.
DeepSeek’s emergence is changing the landscape for AI, offering companies access to the technology at a fraction of the cost, according to interviews with more than a dozen startup executives and investors. It also has the potential to push other AI companies to improve their models and bring down prices.
“There was an offer from DeepSeek which was five times lower than their actual prices,” said Mandapati. “I am saving a lot of money and users don’t see any kind of a difference.”
Europe’s tech startups had struggled to adopt the new technology at the same rate as U.S. rivals, which have easier access to funding. But executives say DeepSeek could be a game changer.
“It marks a significant step forward in democratising AI and levelling the playing field with Big Tech,” said Seena Rejal, chief commercial officer of British firm NetMind.AI, another early adopter of DeepSeek.
Analysts at Bernstein estimate that DeepSeek’s pricing is 20 to 40 times cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI.
OpenAI charges $2.5 for 1 million input tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, while DeepSeek is currently charging $0.014 for the same number of tokens.
Concerns have been raised by regulators about whether DeepSeek is copying OpenAI data or censoring answers that could portray China in a bad light. It is currently being investigated in different European countries.
“While the future of DeepSeek as a business is difficult to predict, the structural impact seems quite pervasive,” said Sanjot Malhi, partner at venture capital firm Northzone.
WAKE-UP CALL
Nearly $100 billion was invested by venture capitalists in AI companies in 2024 in the U.S. compared with about $15.8 billion in Europe, according to data from PitchBook.
Just on Jan. 22, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI project called Stargate, a joint venture backed by OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle.
Investment in Europe has been more modest.
Only France’s Mistral features among the list of top foundational models dominated by the likes of OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic and Google.
China’s DeepSeek attracted attention after writing in a paper last month that the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips. It has since overtaken ChatGPT to become the top-rated productivity application available on Apple’s App Store.
“This is a wake-up call that bigger isn’t always better,” said Fabrizio Del Maffeo, CEO of Axelera AI. “By making models more attainable to everyone, the total cost of ownership and barriers to building innovative tech are lowered which can be a catalyst for the whole industry.”
While some analysts doubt that DeepSeek’s training cost is as low as the company says, they agree it is lower than comparable American models.
“I see DeepSeek as a tremendous opportunity for companies like ours,” said Ulrik R-T, CEO of Denmark’s Empatik AI. “It showed that we do not need huge budgets to be able to achieve our vision.”
COST VS SAFETY
The price war may have already started.
Microsoft last week released OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model to all Copilot users for free, instead of the usual subscription fee of $20 per month.
“AI prices are going down, so future usage is probably going where there is transparency, which is usually open source, even though it’s in China,” said Scale Capital’s Joachim Schelde.
Bigger companies, ranging from Finland’s Nokia to Germany’s SAP, are more cautious about switching.
“Cost is just one factor,” said Alexandru Voica, Head of Corporate at Britain’s Synthesia, which was last valued at $2.1 billion. “Other factors are: ‘do you have all the security certifications, the frameworks, the software ecosystem that allows companies to build and integrate with your platform?'”

Title: Ayodhya Ram mandir chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das hospitalized
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:53:24 +0000
Content: Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, was hospitalized after a sudden decline in his health, sources cited by IANS said on Sunday. Reports indicated that his condition was critical upon arrival, as he had been struggling with breathing difficulties.
Due to the severity of his condition, Das was initially admitted to Shri Ram Hospital, before being transferred to the Trauma Centre and subsequently referred to PGI in Lucknow for advanced treatment.
Earlier, Arun Kumar Singh, a doctor at the Neuro Centre in Ayodhya, said, “The condition of Satyendra Das is critical. A CT scan revealed that he had suffered a brain hemorrhage, which has spread to several parts of the brain.”
Singh said that the hospital had referred him to Lucknow PGI for better medical facilities.
There is great concern among the Ram temple administration in Ayodhya and among the devotees of Acharya Satyendra Das, who have been praying for his recovery at the Ram Janmabhoomi complex.
Acharya Satyendra Das’s condition is now stable, and he has been kept under observation by doctors.
Acharya Satyendra Das was appointed as the chief priest at the start of the Ram temple construction and has been actively involved in worship activities at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple.
On October 15, 2024, the 84-year-old chief priest of the Ayodhya Ram Temple was admitted to a hospital due to neurological issues, according to officials. However, medical authorities have confirmed that his condition remains stable.
“Acharya Satyendra Das, the head priest of Ayodhya’s Shri Ram temple, has been admitted to a private room in the Neurology Ward of SGPGI under the supervision of Dr. Prakash Chandra Pandey,” said Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) Director RK Dhiman.
Acharya Satyendra Das has been a resident of Ayodhya since childhood and has been associated with the Ram Lalla temple for nearly 32 years, having started his worship there before the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.

Title: Budget math looks realistic, economic growth to pick up pace: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:34:09 +0000
Content: The Union Budget has managed to meet the goals of boosting consumption though tax cuts, increasing capex through transfers to states, and maintaining the path of fiscal consolidation which is expected to lead to a recovery in the economic growth rate with macro stability in a comfortable range, according to a Morgan Stanley report released on Monday.
The report said that both fiscal and monetary policy are pivoting to support growth, which is in line with “our view of a cyclical recovery in growth”.
“The Budget math looks realistic, with nominal GDP assumed at 10.1 per cent for F2026 and gross tax revenue growth of 10.8 per cent. We will remain watchful of income tax collection growth, which the government expects to be 14.4 per cent, given the income tax cuts and execution of capex spending to meet the targets,” the report stated.
The report pointed out that the Budget has balanced needs to support growth and continue with fiscal consolidation. As such, the Budget targets a lower fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for F2026 even as it reduced income taxes to support consumption, especially for middle income tax payers, and expanded capex growth, mainly through a boost in grants to states for capex creation.
“Indeed, as per the Finance Minister, direct tax changes should lead to a 1.0 per cent revenue loss of Rs 1 lakh crore (0.3 per cent of GDP), which should help support consumption,” the Morgan Stanley report said.
On the spending side, the mix remains tilted to capex, with effective capex (direct capex plus grants in aid of creation of capital assets) seen growing at 17.4 per cent in F2026BE vs. 5.3 per cent of F2025RE.
“We expect the Budget to support growth recovery through measures to promote consumption and increase effective capex spending, which will likely lead to a more broad-based recovery, while at the same time continued consolidation should help macro stability remain in check,” the report observed.
The simultaneous boost to consumption and capex has to be sweet for equities, especially in the context of continuing and better-than-anticipated fiscal consolidation (projected primary deficit: 0.8 per cent).
The plethora of announcements around easing of India’s tax regime, including permanent establishment rules, GIFT city clarifications, extension of exemptions to sovereign funds, and changes to tax deduction and collection at source could improve FDI and private investment sentiment, according to the report.
“A new tax code is coming this week, as per the Budget, which could reveal a more liberal tax environment. We are overweight Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Technology, and underweight other sectors,” the report added.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower as Asian markets plunge amid trade war fears
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 06:02:09 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices opened sharply lower on Monday, as Asian markets tumbled after US President Donald Trump announced trade tariffs which are set to come into effect from Tuesday.
At around 9.33 a.m., the Sensex was trading over 400 points down at 77,103.22 while the Nifty was down 154 points at 23,328.00.
At the opening bell, the Sensex shed 710 points or 0.88 per cent at 76,821.50. On the NSE, all sectors declined with Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty as the worst performing sector.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.3 per cent, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was 2.4 per cent lower, South Korea’s KOSPI tumbled 3 per cent and Australia’s ASX 200 was 1.8 per cent lower.
On Saturday (US time), Trump announced he will impose 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 per cent on goods from China starting from Tuesday. He also pledged to place new tariffs on goods from the European Union.
The US equity futures also saw a sharp sell-off in response to US president Donald Trump imposing tariffs.
“After a negative opening, Nifty can find support at 23,200 followed by 23,100 and 23,000. On the higher side, 23,500 can be an immediate resistance, followed by 23,600 and 23,700,” said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst, Choice Broking.
Rupee opened 41 paise lower at 87.02 against the US Dollar. It closed at 86.61 on Friday.
According to Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory, PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, Asia kicked off what is likely to be a volatile day in global markets after Trump followed through on his threat to hit Mexico, Canada and China with tariffs on imports into the United States.
“It will be fascinating to see how investors react to something they have known was coming and which is almost universally seen as damaging for economic growth and financial assets. They won’t be surprised, but they will still be shocked,” he mentioned
The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers on February 1, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 1,327 crore, while domestic institutions bought equities worth Rs 824 crore on the same day.
Gold and silver witnessed high volatility last week and slipped from their highs amid strength in the dollar index and the beginning of the US trade tariff war.
“Gold and silver are holding their key support levels of $2,722 and $30.20 per troy ounce respectively on a weekly closing basis in the international markets,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.

Title: Trump says Americans may feel ‘pain’ in trade war with Mexico, Canada, China
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:50:22 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump said the sweeping tariffs that he has imposed on Mexico, Canada and China may cause “short term” pain for Americans as global markets reflected concerns the levies could undermine growth and reignite inflation.
Trump said he would talk on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“I don’t expect anything dramatic,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay.”
He also said tariffs would “definitely happen” with the European Union, but did not say when.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China – the United States’ three largest trading partners – will slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
“We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,” he said.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. U.S. stock futures fell more than 2%. Shares across Asia, including Hong Kong , Tokyo and Seoul also slid around 2%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices jumped more than $1, while gasoline futures rose 3%.
North American companies braced for new duties which could upend industries from autos to consumer goods to energy.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
“Economically speaking, escalating trade tensions are a lose-lose situation for all countries involved,” the analysts wrote in a note on Sunday.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant economic growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The Trump tariffs, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Some analysts said there was some hope for negotiations, especially with Canada and China.
Goldman Sachs economists said the levies are likely to be temporary but the outlook is unclear because the White House set very general conditions for their removal.
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China has said it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks with the United States.
Its sharpest pushback was over fentanyl.
“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” China’s foreign ministry said, adding that China has taken extensive measures to combat the problem.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, raising her fist in the air in a speech outside the capital, vowed resilience. She accused the United States of failing to tackle its fentanyl problem and said it would not be solved by tariffs.
Sheinbaum said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend.
Canada said on Sunday it will take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also encouraged Canadians on Sunday to boycott their longtime ally after ordering retaliatory tariffs against $155 billion of U.S. goods, from peanut butter, beer and wine to lumber and appliances.
Canadian officials said they were preparing measures to help business who might be hurt by the trade war.
Trump has heaped derision on Canada in particular, with calls for the country to become the 51st U.S. state. On Sunday, he said Canada “ceases to exist as a viable country” without its “massive subsidy.”
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?
Trump declared a national emergency under two laws, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, which give the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.
Trade lawyers said Trump could face legal challenges for testing the limits of U.S. laws. Some Democratic lawmakers decried what they called a blatant abuse of executive power, while others warned about rising prices.
Even some Republicans criticized Trump’s action. “It will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this?” Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said in an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes”.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed Americans were divided on tariffs, with 54% opposing new duties on imported goods and 43% in support, with Democrats more opposed and Republicans more supportive.
INVESTORS LOOK AHEAD
Investors were considering the effects of additional tariffs promised by Trump, including those related to oil and gas, as well as steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
A European Commission spokesperson said the EU “would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods.”
Europe’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, said it was counting on talks to avoid trade conflict.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products from Canada after oil refiners and Midwestern states raised concerns. At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
White House officials said Canada would no longer be allowed the “de minimis” U.S. duty exemption for shipments under $800. Canada and Mexico have become conduits for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents, they said.

Content: Beyonce won the Grammy Award for best country album on Sunday for “Cowboy Carter” at a ceremony that served as a love letter to host city Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires that scarred a hub of the music business.
“Cowboy Carter” was in the running for the night’s top Grammy prize of album of the year. Beyonce has never received the album trophy despite going into Sunday’s ceremony with 32 career wins, more than any other musician.
Indian-American vocalist Chandrika Tandon took home the Grammy award for the album Triveni in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category. She outran Ricky Kej and Anoushka Shankar to win the honour.
Chandrika won the award along with her collaborators, South African flautist Wouter Kellerman and Japanese cellist Eru Matsumoto.
Along with Chandrika, names who were contending in the Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album category included Break of Dawn by Ricky Kej, Opus by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Chapter II: How Dark It Is Before Dawn by Anoushka Shankar, and Warriors Of Light by Radhika Vekaria.
This year’s Grammy festivities were revamped to be part awards show and part fundraiser for people affected by the wildfires, which were contained on Friday after killing 29 people and displacing thousands including many musicians.
Broadcast live on CBS, the show opened with an all-star rendition “I Love LA” featuring Altadena-based band Dawes backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, St. Vincent and Brittany Howard.
“Tonight, we decided we are not just celebrating our favorite music. We are also celebrating the city that brought us so much of that music,” host Trevor Noah said.
Los Angeles natives and siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas followed Noah’s monologue with a performance of nominated song “Birds of a Feather.” “I love you LA,” Eilish said from the stage.
Sabrina Carpenter won best pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet,” minutes after a performance of hits “Please Please Please” and “Espresso” on a set inspired by the golden age of Hollywood.
“I’m still out of breath from that performance,” Carpenter said as she accepted the trophy. “This is my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.”
Doechii became the third woman in Grammys history to win best rap album for “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” As she accepted the honor, she offered words of encouragement to Black women and girls.
“Anything is possible,” Doechii said as she held her trophy. “Don’t allow anyone to project any stereotypes on you.”
Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy.

Title: Positive impact of regular contacts evident in India-Russia strategic partnership: President Murmu
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:23:00 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Monday asserted that the “positive impact” of regular contacts is evident in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit significantly from ongoing interactions at various levels.
As a visiting parliamentary delegation led by Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, called on her at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu also highlighted the importance of closer interaction between women and youth parliamentarians of India and Russia.
“Welcoming the delegation to India, the President stated that exchanges of this nature among public representatives not only foster stronger cooperation but also ensure that the partnership remains contemporary and updated. She further noted that the positive impact of regular contacts is clearly visible in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit from interactions at various levels,” read a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the meeting.
The President mentioned that at the leadership level, regular interactions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin play a key role.
“The cooperation between our parliaments has been very effective,” she said, adding that mechanisms like the Inter-Parliamentary Commission have facilitated this. She emphasized the importance of closer ties between women and youth parliamentarians of both countries.
President Murmu also shared with the delegation that she had inaugurated the New Delhi World Book Fair on Saturday, where Russia was the ‘Focus Country.’ She described the fair as an excellent opportunity for Indian readers to explore Russia’s rich literary heritage and encouraged stronger engagements in cultural and artistic domains.
Earlier, the visiting delegation, which arrived in India late last night for an official visit to strengthen bilateral relations, also visited both houses of the Indian Parliament.
Volodin called on Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Parliament, where he reaffirmed that India is one of Russia’s key partners in Asia.
“We share special relations that are based on friendship, non-interference in sovereign affairs, and mutually beneficial cooperation,” Volodin said during his meeting with the Vice President.
The Chairman of the State Duma further stressed that the leaders of both countries continue to make a “great contribution” to the development of the Russian-Indian dialogue.
“We must legislatively support the decisions made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our relations are growing stronger, and we must ensure that the dynamics at the executive level are reflected in our parliamentary efforts,” Volodin emphasized.
He also noted that India remains one of Russia’s most important partners in Asia.
“Over the past five years, bilateral trade has increased fivefold and continues to grow: from January to November 2024, it grew by 15 per cent. This benefits both our citizens and our countries,” Volodin added.
The Vice President’s office reported that discussions covered various aspects of the multi-dimensional bilateral relationship between India and Russia.
“Both leaders underlined the significance of enhancing parliamentary ties, which form a solid foundation for the overall Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” Vice President Dhankhar said in a post on X.
He highlighted the high level of India-Russia relations and emphasized the significant role of parliamentarians in maintaining them.
The Vice President also recalled that Prime Minister Modi had visited Russia twice over the past seven months, reflecting the importance of the strategic partnership.
“Our relations are entering new trajectories, and the level of interaction is steadily increasing. Both our countries coordinate their positions on platforms like the UN, BRICS, G20, and SCO to address global issues,” the Russian Embassy in India quoted Vice President Dhankhar as saying.
Volodin congratulated the people of India on Republic Day and extended an invitation to members of the Rajya Sabha to visit Russia.
The Russian delegation accompanying the Duma Chairman includes Deputy Speaker Alexander Babakov, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) leader Leonid Slutsky, Novye Lyudi (New People) faction leader Alexey Nechayev, Economic Policy Committee Chairman Maxim Topilin, Agrarian Committee Chairman Vladimir Kashin, and Culture Committee Chairwoman Olga Kazakova.

Title: Europe braces for Trump trade tariffs, as levies on Canada, Mexico, China roil markets
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:57:42 +0000
Content: European leaders were bracing for U.S. tariffs on Monday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping levies on Mexico, Canada and China that will affect billions of dollars worth of trade, roiling global markets and currencies.
Trump said the tariffs against the three largest U.S. trading partners, which take effect on Tuesday, might cause Americans some short-term pain, but “long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world”.
Global stock markets and currencies tumbled on Monday on concerns that the tariffs would trigger an economically damaging trade war. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.3% in morning trading, set for its biggest one-day slide this year and futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 fell 1.4%.
Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday, Trump indicated that the 27-nation European Union would be next in the firing line, but did not say when.
“They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them,” he told reporters.
EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would be prepared to fight back if the U.S. imposes tariffs, but also called for reason and negotiation.
Arriving at the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said if the EU were attacked in its commercial interests it would have to “make itself respected and thus react”. He added that recent declarations from the United States were pushing Europe to be stronger and more united.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, the EU’s largest economy which is highly dependent on exports, also said the bloc could respond if necessary with its own tariffs against the U.S. but stressed it was better for the two to find agreement on trade.
Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Luc Frieden said: “I think tariffs are always bad. Tariffs are bad for trade. Tariffs are bad for the United States.”
Trump hinted that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared tariffs, saying: “I think that one can be worked out”.
The U.S. is the EU’s largest trade and investment partner and has consistently imported more goods than it has exported to the bloc. The U.S. goods trade deficit stood at 155.8 billion euros ($161.6 billion) in 2023, according to Eurostat data.
However, in services, the U.S. had a surplus of exports over imports with the EU of 104 billion euros.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were no winners in a trade war, saying that if one broke out between Europe and the United States, “then the one laughing on the side is China”.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Trump said he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have both announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay,” Trump told reporters.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. Shares in Tokyo ended the day down almost 3% and Australia’s benchmark – often a proxy trade for Chinese markets – dropped 1.8%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices CLc1 jumped more than 1%, while gasoline futures RBc1 rose nearly 3%.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and trigger “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
In Europe, economists at Deutsche Bank said they were currently factoring in a 0.5% hit to gross domestic product (GDP) should Trump impose 10% tariffs on the bloc.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what Canada, Mexico and China would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China called fentanyl America’s problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed resilience and said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend. Canada said it would take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico, burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Shares in Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell by about 5-6% in European trading on Monday.
Analysts at investment bank Stifel estimated that 8 billion euros of VW’s revenues would be impacted by tariffs and 16 billion euros of Stellantis.
Shares in U.S. big tech stocks were also lower ahead of the U.S. open, with Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all down between 1.5% to 2%.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products.

Title: Global semiconductor revenue jumps 18 per cent in 2024: report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:43:37 +0000
Content: The global semiconductor industry witnessed a strong rebound in 2024, with total revenue reaching $626 billion, marking an 18.1 per cent increase from the previous year, according to a report released on Monday.
This positive momentum is expected to continue, with projections indicating that semiconductor revenue will climb to $705 billion in 2025, the report from Gartner stated.
While memory dominated the market, non-memory semiconductor revenue also saw a 6.9 per cent increase in 2024, accounting for 74.8 per cent of total industry revenue.
The report added that, among the top 25 semiconductor companies, 11 posted double-digit revenue increases, while only eight experienced a decline.
Samsung Electronics reclaimed its position as the world’s top semiconductor vendor, overtaking Intel.
The South Korean tech giant benefited from a sharp recovery in memory prices, pushing its revenue to $66.5 billion in 2024.
Meanwhile, Intel slipped to the number two spot as its AI PCs and Core Ultra chipset failed to make a significant impact.
Intel’s semiconductor revenue remained almost flat, with a growth of just 0.1 per cent in 2024.
Nvidia continued its remarkable rise, securing the number three position after increasing its semiconductor revenue by 84 per cent to reach $46 billion.
The company’s strong foothold in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fueled its growth, allowing it to climb two spots in the global rankings.
The memory segment played a key role in the semiconductor industry’s expansion, with revenue soaring by 71.8 per cent in 2024.
DRAM revenue surged by 75.4 per cent, while NAND revenue also climbed by 75.7 per cent year-over-year.
A major factor behind this growth was the increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which contributed significantly to DRAM sales.
HBM accounted for 13.6 per cent of total DRAM revenue in 2024, and its share is expected to rise to 19.2 per cent in 2025.

Title: Man found guilty of hate crime over Sweden Koran burnings
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:06:16 +0000
Content: A Swedish court found an anti-Islam campaigner guilty on Monday of hate crimes for staging public burnings of the Koran, in a ruling handed down five days after another man also being prosecuted over the incidents was shot dead.
Salwan Najem, a Swedish citizen, was given a suspended sentence and fines over the Koran burnings and derogatory comments he made about Muslims in the 2023 incidents, which led to unrest and inspired anger towards Sweden in Muslim countries.
His fellow campaigner, Iraqi refugee Salwan Momika, was shot dead last week on the day he had been due to receive his verdict in a parallel case. No suspect has been charged yet in that killing; five people were detained but later released. Sweden’s prime minister has said a foreign state may have been behind it.
The 2023 Koran burnings made the balance between free speech rights and rules protecting ethnic and religious groups into a major issue for Sweden, its Nordic neighbours and other European countries.
The Stockholm district court said in a statement Najem, 50, and Momika had desecrated the Koran in various ways and made offensive statements directed towards Islam, representatives of the religion and activities in mosques.
Najem was found guilty of hate crimes for “having expressed contempt for the Muslim ethnic group because of their religious beliefs on four occasions”, it said.
Najem’s lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict.
“My client considers that his statements fall within the scope of criticism of religion, which is covered by the freedom of expression,” he said.
The court had dropped the case against Momika after he was killed.

Title: Trump’s meme coin made nearly $100 million in trading fees, as small traders lost money
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:59:31 +0000
Content: Entities behind President Donald Trump’s crypto coin have accumulated close to $100 million in trading fees in less than two weeks, according to estimates from three blockchain analysis firms, a large windfall from a venture that has seen tens of thousands of small traders lose money.
The meme coin, known as $Trump, was launched by the president on Jan. 17 and quickly surged, reaching a peak of over $14.5 billion in overall market value by Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration. It has since slumped by two-thirds.
Three crypto data firms, including Merkle Science and Chainalysis, analyzed the blockchain, a publicly available ledger that shows all transactions involving $Trump, for Reuters. They estimated that the $Trump token had generated between $86 million and $100 million in trading fees by Jan. 30.
The estimates far exceed what has been previously reported.
One of the entities behind the crypto coin is a company owned by Trump, called CIC Digital. The official website for $Trump says CIC Digital will “receive trading revenue derived from trading activities” of the meme coin. Reuters could not determine what portion of the fees so far, if any, had accrued to Trump personally, nor the ownership of the other entities behind the coin.
The creators of the meme coin receive a share of the trading fees from Meteora, a little-known crypto exchange where the $Trump coins were first sold, the blockchain analyses showed.
At least fifty of the largest investors in the coin have made profits in excess of $10 million each on the $Trump coin, according to Chainalysis. At the same time, some 200,000 crypto wallets, most with small holdings, lost money on $Trump on the exchange, it said.
Trump has pledged to put his assets in a trust managed by his children on entering the White House. His son, Eric Trump, speaking on behalf of the Trump Organization, told Reuters in response to questions about the fees that he is proud of what “we continue to accomplish in crypto. $Trump is currently the hottest digital meme on earth.”
“We are just getting started,” he added.
The White House responded to a list of questions from Reuters with a two-page fact sheet describing Trump’s executive order earlier this month on digital financial technology. It did not address questions about the trading fees.
Trump has promised to become the first “crypto president” and make America the “crypto capital of the planet” by overhauling regulations and promoting ownership of digital assets. Several key figures in his administration, cabinet and circles hold crypto or have ties to the crypto industry.
But the combination of large dollar amounts around his crypto ventures and their opaque nature has also sparked criticism from ethics experts and Trump’s political opponents in the Democratic party.
“There’s an ethical concern that in effect he has the power to regulate his own business,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University.
Reuters was unable to determine how much of Trump’s own wealth comes from this newest crypto business because precise details of his ownership are not public. Trump’s other crypto investments include two decentralized finance (DeFi) projects – a type of platform that connects buyers and sellers without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks – and a series of non-fungible tokens, a type of digital asset.
OPAQUE OWNERSHIP
Meme coins are crypto tokens that feature branding or names referencing memes or internet trends. They are usually highly volatile and have scant practical use. Trump’s coin, for example, is intended as an expression of support for the president’s call to ‘fight, fight, fight’ after he was shot at a campaign rally last year.
The exact ownership of Trump’s meme coins is hidden behind opaque limited liability companies. Fight Fight Fight, a Delaware-registered company, is the owner of the official website for the coin, gettrumpmemes.com.
William Zanker, a Trump business associate who in 2022 collaborated with him on digital assets, is listed as the primary contact for Fight Fight Fight in registration documents. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Fight Fight Fight is owned by Trump’s CIC Digital and Celebration Cards, according to the meme coin’s website. Reuters could not ascertain the identity of the people behind Celebration Cards, which also receives revenue from the trading activities of the meme coin.
The official $Trump website says up to 1 billion $Trump coins will be sold over the next 36 months. Initially, a tranche of 200 million $Trump coins was released to the market, when the coin’s creators transferred them to three crypto wallets, the blockchain analysis shows. The meme coin’s website says Fight Fight Fight and CIC Digital own the remaining 800 million coins, worth around $16 billion at the coin’s current price of about $20.
Merkle Science said the three crypto wallets were the earliest holders of the $Trump tokens and received the coins directly from their creators without purchasing them. Chainalysis said that, based on its assessment, the three wallet addresses “belong to creators of the $Trump coin.”
Blockchain analysis firms track the movement of crypto coins on the public ledger that underpins most digital assets. They connect digital wallets – which are anonymous – with known individuals or entities via proprietary research and investigations.
TRADING FEES
The wallets began trading the tokens on Meteora, a DeFi exchange, the blockchain analyses show.
Traders on Meteora pay a fee to the coin creators for providing liquidity, a function that enables buyers and sellers to trade an asset smoothly. The creators do so by putting some of their assets in so-called “liquidity pools”, which then stand ready to enable trading on the exchange.
Meteora says it allows creators to “mint a meme coin and earn fees for life.” The exchange also receives fees.
Ben Chow, the Meteora co-founder, said in a Telegram chat that he did not know anything about the team behind the Trump token. In response to a question on how Meteora was involved with the launch of the $Trump token, Chow said: “I didn’t connect with the team precisely.” He added that “the team reached out” to his co-founder, who is known only as Meow. Reuters could not reach Meow.
The fees on Meteora vary during spells of market volatility, its website says, with “surge pricing” in place, where fees rise with higher demand.
Between Jan.17 and Jan. 30, the three wallets earned fees of $86 million through these activities on Meteora, Merkle Science estimated. Chainalysis assessed that the three had earned about $94 million in trading fees over the same period.
A third blockchain analytics firm, whose founder requested that it not be identified, said by Jan. 29 it calculated the meme coin had garnered roughly $100 million in fees.

Title: Inflation eases, growth picks up, Crisil’s economic forecast for FY26
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:16:50 +0000
Content: India’s economy is poised to grow at 6.5 percent in the financial year 2025-26 (FY26), slightly surpassing the 6.4 percent growth forecast for the current fiscal year, according to a recent report by Crisil.
The report underscores that a combination of lower inflation and anticipated rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will support economic growth, assuming there are no major global shocks and the country experiences a normal monsoon.
“Lower inflation and the RBI’s rate cuts are expected to lift growth next fiscal, assuming a normal monsoon and lower crude oil prices,” the report said.
While government spending will continue to be a key growth driver, Crisil highlighted that the fiscal impulse will weaken as fiscal consolidation advances. A critical factor for sustaining growth would be the revival of private sector investments, which need to gain momentum.
Export prospects, however, face headwinds due to global trade challenges, including tariff hikes by the United States.
On the inflation front, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is projected to decline from 4.7 percent in FY25 to 4.4 percent in FY26, largely due to favorable monsoon expectations, a high base effect in food inflation, and softer global commodity prices. Nevertheless, non-food inflation may see a slight uptick due to an adverse base effect.
If inflation approaches the RBI’s target of 4 percent, it could pave the way for further rate cuts, potentially boosting economic activity.
India’s fiscal deficit, which stood at 5.6 percent of GDP in FY24, is expected to decrease to 4.8 percent in FY25 and further to 4.4 percent in FY26. This improvement will be driven by controlled revenue spending while maintaining a strong emphasis on capital expenditure.
On the external front, the current account deficit (CAD) is expected to widen from 1.0 percent of GDP in FY25 to 1.3 percent in FY26, primarily due to export challenges linked to U.S. trade policies. Despite this, a strong services trade balance, steady remittances, and lower crude oil prices are anticipated to limit the deficit’s expansion.
The Indian rupee is projected to depreciate gradually, averaging Rs 86 per dollar in FY25 and Rs 87 per dollar in FY26. Crisil warned that geopolitical uncertainties could lead to currency market volatility despite the CAD remaining under control.

Title: Illegal immigration disrupting Delhi’s economy, causing “notable increase of Muslim population”: JNU report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:12:03 +0000
Content: A report from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has highlighted the significant socio-economic and political disruptions caused by illegal immigration in Delhi, particularly from Bangladesh and Myanmar. The report, titled Illegal Immigrants to Delhi: Analysing Socio-economic and Political Consequences, outlines how the influx of undocumented settlers has reshaped the city’s demographics, strained resources, and strengthened criminal networks.
The 114-page document presents a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of illegal immigration, pointing out that these trends have led to a “notable increase of Muslim population” in Delhi-NCR. According to the report, unchecked migration has adversely impacted the local economy, created socio-political tensions, and heightened security concerns.
The JNU report underscores how the city’s infrastructure is buckling under the weight of an expanding population fueled by illegal immigration. Public services, including healthcare, education, and transportation, are facing immense pressure, while unregulated settlements have emerged as hubs for hazardous living conditions.
“Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in migrant settlements are contributing to the spread of infectious diseases,” the report warns, adding that these health crises often extend to the broader population.
Illegal settlements also pose environmental risks, with unregulated waste disposal contributing to pollution and public health hazards. Additionally, rising population density has overwhelmed Delhi’s already strained public transportation system.
The report points to political patronage as a key enabler of illegal immigration. It alleges that some political actors have facilitated voter registration for undocumented migrants, raising concerns about electoral manipulation and the erosion of democratic integrity.
“The report says that political patronage plays a crucial role in allowing a steady influx of undocumented Rohingyas and Bangladeshis,” BJP MP Sambit Patra stated while addressing the findings. He accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of being complicit in this process.
According to the findings, illegal immigration has fueled the proliferation of criminal networks. Vulnerable migrants are often exploited for activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and other illicit trades.
Efforts to deport illegal immigrants have faced numerous challenges, including bureaucratic hurdles, lack of cooperation from migrants’ home countries, and resistance from local political entities.
The porous India-Bangladesh border remains a significant obstacle in managing illegal migration. The report criticizes inadequate border control measures, which have allowed the continued influx of undocumented individuals.
Illegal immigration from neighboring countries has also affected India’s diplomatic relations with Bangladesh and Myanmar. The report emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts to address cross-border migration issues.
The influx of illegal migrants has created social tensions, as local populations often view these newcomers with suspicion and hostility. The report highlights instances of discrimination against migrants, which further complicates their integration into Delhi’s social fabric.
The presence of undocumented populations complicates disaster response and crisis management efforts. Migrants living in unofficial settlements are often excluded from official relief measures during emergencies, making it harder to deliver aid effectively.
One of the report’s key recommendations is the formulation of a comprehensive immigration policy. The lack of a clear policy framework has made it difficult to address the root causes of illegal migration and implement effective solutions.
“The absence of reliable data on migration trends hampers effective policymaking and resource allocation,” the report says, urging better data collection and analysis.
Reacting to the report, BJP’s Sambit Patra accused the AAP government of facilitating the influx of illegal immigrants. “Every aspect, including socio-political impact, has been mentioned in this report… The report also talks about how political parties are facilitating fake voter registration for the migrants,” Patra said.
Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar countered the allegations by holding Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri accountable for the settlement of Rohingyas in India. “If Rohingyas are present anywhere in India, it is Shah’s responsibility, while Puri is to blame for their settlement in Delhi,” Kakkar said.

Title: WHO proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:02:40 +0000
Content: World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump’s move to withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the agency, a document released on Monday showed.
Opening the agency’s annual executive board meeting, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency’s work and recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit and enter into dialogue with the WHO about further change.
“We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,” he said.
The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting, during which member state representatives will discuss the agency’s funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.
The executive board proposes cutting the base programmes section of the budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for polio eradication and tackling emergencies.
“With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget could not be ‘business as usual,'” the document reads. The U.S. is the WHO’s biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps after the U.S. move.
However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the challenges, the document adds.
The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base programme budget for the previous period, 2024-2025.
Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago. The process will take one year under U.S. law.

“Greenland is today a part of the kingdom of Denmark. It is part of our territory, and it’s not for sale,” she said ahead of an informal EU leaders meeting in Brussels.
Trump has said he would make the autonomous territory of Denmark a part of the United States, and has not ruled out using military or economic power to persuade Denmark to hand it over.
Fredriksen added on Monday that she agreed with the U.S. view that the Arctic region was becoming increasingly important when talking about security and defence.
“So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,” she said.

Title: Women-led Indian startups making global mark: Minister Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:33:56 +0000
Content: Women-led startups in India are making a global impact and hold the promise of realizing the vision of a “Viksit Bharat,” said Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, on Sunday.
Speaking to a delegation of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry – Ladies Organisation (FICCI-FLO), Singh highlighted women’s contributions even in traditionally challenging sectors like space exploration.
He cited India’s solar mission, “Aditya L1,” led by Nigar Shaji, who is popularly known as ISRO’s “Sunny Lady.”
“Women-led development is a key priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance agenda, with the vision that women-led startups will place India on the global map in the years to come. Our women entrepreneurs have the potential to realize that goal,” Singh said.
He added that since 2014, women’s empowerment has taken on a practical dimension through various welfare schemes, including entrepreneurship-focused initiatives like the PM Mudra Yojana and PM Vishwakarma Yojana, which have largely benefited women entrepreneurs.
The Minister noted that nearly 70 percent of the youth who availed of financial assistance under the PM Mudra Yojana were women, many of whom established businesses that not only supported their livelihoods but also created jobs for others.
Calling traditional artisans and craftsmen an “exclusive asset of India,” Singh said they had been brought into the mainstream through the launch of the PM Vishwakarma Yojana.
“The traditional artisans and craftsmen are as integral to Indian society as anything else. They have preserved centuries-old crafts and traditions but were often overlooked since independence,” he added.

Title: Philippines declares food security emergency to curb soaring rice prices
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:10:50 +0000
Content: Philippine Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel declared a food security emergency concerning rice on Sunday to stabilize the extraordinarily high prices of the staple grain.
“This emergency declaration allows us to release rice buffer stocks held by the National Food Authority (NFA) to stabilize prices and ensure that rice, a staple food for millions, remains accessible to consumers,” Laurel said in a statement.
The declaration was made based on recommendations from the National Price Coordinating Council.
Under the Rice Tariffication Law, the Agriculture Secretary is empowered to declare a food security emergency in response to extraordinary price increases.
The decision allows the Department of Agriculture to direct the NFA to release buffer stocks to government agencies and local units to help curb rising rice prices and protect consumers from further hikes.
Laurel stated that the emergency measures would remain in effect until rice prices are stabilized, Xinhua news agency reported.
In December 2023, the Philippines’ rice inflation hit a staggering 21.4 percent.
Meanwhile, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported last week that the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.6 percent in 2024, below the government’s target range of 6 to 6.5 percent.
“While the GDP growth falls short of our target, we are positioned as the third-fastest growing economy in the region,” said National Economic and Development Authority Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon.
Edillon noted that the Philippines faced significant setbacks in 2024, including extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions, and subdued global demand. The agriculture sector, in particular, suffered due to a series of six typhoons between late October and mid-November.
Looking ahead to 2025, Edillon emphasized the importance of building economic resilience through diversified growth sources and price stability.
“We will ensure a stable food supply and prevent unwarranted price increases through strategic trade policies, timely release and distribution of production and post-production support, and proactive measures against hoarding,” she added.

Title: Schools shut, more flights scheduled as quakes constantly shake Santorini
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:49:21 +0000
Content: Families boarded ferries and extra flights were laid on to help people leave Santorini on Monday as dozens of tremors shook the Greek island for a fourth day.
Tremors have been recorded between the volcanic islands of Santorini and Amorgos in the Aegean Sea since Friday, forcing authorities to close schools in Santorini and nearby Ios, Amorgos and Anafi until Friday.
Quakes, some with a magnitude above 4, rattled Santorini every few minutes on Monday as people were advised to stay out of indoor spaces and small ports. Disaster response units were deployed on the ground as a precaution.
Experts have said the seismic activity on the island, some of whose most populated areas are perched on steep cliffs, will continue for weeks.
Local officials said that permanent residents were not particularly worried as they have been used to quakes but some who were on the island, a popular holiday destination, for work were moving out.
“For three days now there have been earthquakes all the time, every five minutes, it is continuous they don’t stop at all, the entire island is traumatized,” said Tzanis Lignos, 35, who managed to find tickets for himself, his wife and his son to leave.
“No one could sleep last night, not my wife. There was a lot of noise. We went running outside, that is why we cannot stay here any longer.”
Many rushed to board the ferry on Monday including families with babies and children.
“There are constantly earthquakes, it is intense, we feel it,” said Zoi Lignou, 72.
“We have been patient for three days but today was the worst so we said we will leave, for as many days as it takes.”
Aegean Airlines said it would operate three additional flights to and from Santorini on Monday and Tuesday to facilitate the travel of residents and visitors upon a request by Greece’s Civil Protection Ministry.
“We estimate it (the activity) will continue for some days and there could be a lengthy seismic sequence,” Efthymios Lekkas, a professor of tectonic geology and disaster management, and part of a team of experts assessing the situation on the ground, told Greek television.
Greece sits on multiple fault lines and is often rattled by earthquakes.
One of the largest volcanic eruptions in history, around 1600 BC, formed Santorini in its current shape. The last eruption in the area occurred in 1950.
Experts said a mild volcanic activity also recorded near Santorini in recent days was not linked to the quakes.

Title: Cambodia completes restoration of UNESCO-Listed Angkor Park
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 16:27:53 +0000
Content: Cambodia has completed the restoration of a more than 1,000-year-old brick temple located on the north side of Phnom Krom Temple in the UNESCO-listed Angkor Archaeological Park, the APSARA National Authority (ANA) announced on Monday.
Ros Visoth, a Conservation Officer from the ANA’s Department of Conservation of Monuments and Preventive Archaeology, stated that the Hindu temple, built in the late ninth century, measures approximately six meters in width and over seven meters in height.
The restoration work, which began in June 2024, was completed in late December 2024.
“The ruined temple has undergone a complete restoration, returning it to its former glory thanks to the meticulous efforts of experts from the APSARA National Authority,” Visoth said.
He noted that prior to the restoration, the temple had suffered from significant deterioration, with its roof and walls badly decayed.
“During the rainy season, water seeped through the brick seams due to age, weather conditions, and plant growth that had damaged the bricks,” he said.
To restore the temple, the team focused on preserving the existing bricks by salvaging those that remained intact, cutting new bricks to fill gaps, and carefully reconstructing the walls to align with the original structure, Visoth explained.
Following the restoration, Visoth expressed confidence that the temple would become a captivating site for visitors, Xinhua news agency reported.
Perched on a hill, Phnom Krom Temple offers a variety of attractions, including stunning views of the freshwater Tonle Sap Lake, picturesque landscapes of golden rice fields, breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, and nearby villages and pagodas, according to the news release.
Located in northwest Siem Reap province, the 401-square-kilometer Angkor Archaeological Park is home to 91 ancient temples built between the ninth and 13th centuries.
The site, which is Cambodia’s most popular tourist destination, attracted 1.02 million international tourists in 2024, generating $47.8 million in revenue from ticket sales, according to the state-owned Angkor Enterprise.

Title: “India-Russia friendship a shining example of cooperation and diplomacy: Speaker Om Birla welcomes Russian parliamentary delegation
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 14:58:38 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday extended a warm welcome to the Russian parliamentary delegation led by the Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, Vyacheslav Volodin, to witness the proceedings of the Lower House.
Birla said that the robust and time-tested friendship between India and Russia stands as a model for cooperation and diplomacy worldwide. Highlighting the historic and enduring ties between the two nations, he said that their relationship, rooted in centuries-old bonds, has positioned Russia as India’s closest ally since independence.
Congratulating Russia on its fruitful chairmanship of BRICS in 2024, Birla recalled his participation in the BRICS Parliamentary Summit held in St. Petersburg. He underscored the significance of such exchanges in strengthening parliamentary processes and deepening bilateral ties.
Expressing satisfaction over the Russian delegation’s observation of proceedings in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Birla highlighted how this provided valuable insights into India’s democratic framework. He explained the functioning of India’s Parliamentary Committees, describing them as “Mini-Parliaments” where budgetary matters and critical issues are examined in depth. These committees, he said, operate in a non-partisan manner, enabling comprehensive discussions often constrained in the larger House due to time limitations.
Reflecting on India’s 75th year as a Republic, Birla spoke about the country’s journey since independence and the visionary contributions of the Constitution’s founding fathers in upholding equality and justice for all citizens. He highlighted India’s progress in strengthening constitutional values and democratic practices over the years.
Further stressing the strong cooperation between the Parliaments of India and Russia, Speaker Birla cited frequent engagements at multilateral platforms such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), BRICS Parliamentary Forum, and G-20. He reiterated his belief in the role of mutual trust and respect in strengthening India-Russia ties, which have evolved into a Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership encompassing political, strategic, and cultural cooperation.
Acknowledging vibrant people-to-people ties as the foundation of this partnership, Birla expressed confidence that the current visit would further bolster bilateral relations, fostering mutual growth and prosperity.
Vyacheslav Volodin expressed gratitude for the warm reception extended to his delegation. He added that observing parliamentary proceedings in a multi-party democracy like India was an enriching experience. Praising the enduring partnership between India and Russia, he highlighted the strong bond shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin as a driving force behind bilateral ties.
Mr. Volodin congratulated India on its 75 years as a republic and commended the country’s remarkable economic growth, acknowledging its emergence as a global power. He hoped that India-Russia friendship would continue to thrive and reach new horizons.

Title: Positive impact of regular contacts evident in India-Russia strategic partnership: President Murmu
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:23:00 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Monday asserted that the “positive impact” of regular contacts is evident in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit significantly from ongoing interactions at various levels.
As a visiting parliamentary delegation led by Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, called on her at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu also highlighted the importance of closer interaction between women and youth parliamentarians of India and Russia.
“Welcoming the delegation to India, the President stated that exchanges of this nature among public representatives not only foster stronger cooperation but also ensure that the partnership remains contemporary and updated. She further noted that the positive impact of regular contacts is clearly visible in the broader ‘India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,’ which continues to benefit from interactions at various levels,” read a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the meeting.
The President mentioned that at the leadership level, regular interactions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin play a key role.
“The cooperation between our parliaments has been very effective,” she said, adding that mechanisms like the Inter-Parliamentary Commission have facilitated this. She emphasized the importance of closer ties between women and youth parliamentarians of both countries.
President Murmu also shared with the delegation that she had inaugurated the New Delhi World Book Fair on Saturday, where Russia was the ‘Focus Country.’ She described the fair as an excellent opportunity for Indian readers to explore Russia’s rich literary heritage and encouraged stronger engagements in cultural and artistic domains.
Earlier, the visiting delegation, which arrived in India late last night for an official visit to strengthen bilateral relations, also visited both houses of the Indian Parliament.
Volodin called on Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Parliament, where he reaffirmed that India is one of Russia’s key partners in Asia.
“We share special relations that are based on friendship, non-interference in sovereign affairs, and mutually beneficial cooperation,” Volodin said during his meeting with the Vice President.
The Chairman of the State Duma further stressed that the leaders of both countries continue to make a “great contribution” to the development of the Russian-Indian dialogue.
“We must legislatively support the decisions made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our relations are growing stronger, and we must ensure that the dynamics at the executive level are reflected in our parliamentary efforts,” Volodin emphasized.
He also noted that India remains one of Russia’s most important partners in Asia.
“Over the past five years, bilateral trade has increased fivefold and continues to grow: from January to November 2024, it grew by 15 per cent. This benefits both our citizens and our countries,” Volodin added.
The Vice President’s office reported that discussions covered various aspects of the multi-dimensional bilateral relationship between India and Russia.
“Both leaders underlined the significance of enhancing parliamentary ties, which form a solid foundation for the overall Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” Vice President Dhankhar said in a post on X.
He highlighted the high level of India-Russia relations and emphasized the significant role of parliamentarians in maintaining them.
The Vice President also recalled that Prime Minister Modi had visited Russia twice over the past seven months, reflecting the importance of the strategic partnership.
“Our relations are entering new trajectories, and the level of interaction is steadily increasing. Both our countries coordinate their positions on platforms like the UN, BRICS, G20, and SCO to address global issues,” the Russian Embassy in India quoted Vice President Dhankhar as saying.
Volodin congratulated the people of India on Republic Day and extended an invitation to members of the Rajya Sabha to visit Russia.

Title: Europe braces for Trump trade tariffs, as levies on Canada, Mexico, China roil markets
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:57:42 +0000
Content: European leaders were bracing for U.S. tariffs on Monday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping levies on Mexico, Canada and China that will affect billions of dollars worth of trade, roiling global markets and currencies.
Trump said the tariffs against the three largest U.S. trading partners, which take effect on Tuesday, might cause Americans some short-term pain, but “long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world”.
Global stock markets and currencies tumbled on Monday on concerns that the tariffs would trigger an economically damaging trade war. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.3% in morning trading, set for its biggest one-day slide this year and futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 fell 1.4%.
Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday, Trump indicated that the 27-nation European Union would be next in the firing line, but did not say when.
“They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them,” he told reporters.
EU leaders meeting at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would be prepared to fight back if the U.S. imposes tariffs, but also called for reason and negotiation.
Arriving at the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said if the EU were attacked in its commercial interests it would have to “make itself respected and thus react”. He added that recent declarations from the United States were pushing Europe to be stronger and more united.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, the EU’s largest economy which is highly dependent on exports, also said the bloc could respond if necessary with its own tariffs against the U.S. but stressed it was better for the two to find agreement on trade.
Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Luc Frieden said: “I think tariffs are always bad. Tariffs are bad for trade. Tariffs are bad for the United States.”
Trump hinted that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared tariffs, saying: “I think that one can be worked out”.
The U.S. is the EU’s largest trade and investment partner and has consistently imported more goods than it has exported to the bloc. The U.S. goods trade deficit stood at 155.8 billion euros ($161.6 billion) in 2023, according to Eurostat data.
However, in services, the U.S. had a surplus of exports over imports with the EU of 104 billion euros.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were no winners in a trade war, saying that if one broke out between Europe and the United States, “then the one laughing on the side is China”.
TUESDAY DEADLINE
The tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday.
Trump said he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have both announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, but downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
“They owe us a lot of money, and I’m sure they’re going to pay,” Trump told reporters.
Economists said the Republican president’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would slow global growth and drive prices higher for Americans.
Trump says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries.
Financial market reaction on Monday reflected concerns about the fallout from a trade war. Shares in Tokyo ended the day down almost 3% and Australia’s benchmark – often a proxy trade for Chinese markets – dropped 1.8%. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays.
The Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso all slumped against a soaring dollar. With Canada and Mexico the top sources of U.S. crude oil imports, U.S. oil prices CLc1 jumped more than 1%, while gasoline futures RBc1 rose nearly 3%.
Trump’s tariffs will cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap – an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote.
Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and trigger “stagflation” – high inflation, stagnant growth and elevated unemployment – at home.
In Europe, economists at Deutsche Bank said they were currently factoring in a 0.5% hit to gross domestic product (GDP) should Trump impose 10% tariffs on the bloc.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
A White House fact sheet gave no details on what Canada, Mexico and China would need to do to win a reprieve.
Trump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends.
China called fentanyl America’s problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed resilience and said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on the weekend. Canada said it would take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.
Automakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico, burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.
Shares in Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell by about 5-6% in European trading on Monday.
Analysts at investment bank Stifel estimated that 8 billion euros of VW’s revenues would be impacted by tariffs and 16 billion euros of Stellantis.
Shares in U.S. big tech stocks were also lower ahead of the U.S. open, with Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all down between 1.5% to 2%.
Trump imposed only a 10% duty on energy products.

Title: Global semiconductor revenue jumps 18 per cent in 2024: report
Publication Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 12:43:37 +0000
Content: The global semiconductor industry witnessed a strong rebound in 2024, with total revenue reaching $626 billion, marking an 18.1 per cent increase from the previous year, according to a report released on Monday.
This positive momentum is expected to continue, with projections indicating that semiconductor revenue will climb to $705 billion in 2025, the report from Gartner stated.
While memory dominated the market, non-memory semiconductor revenue also saw a 6.9 per cent increase in 2024, accounting for 74.8 per cent of total industry revenue.
The report added that, among the top 25 semiconductor companies, 11 posted double-digit revenue increases, while only eight experienced a decline.
Samsung Electronics reclaimed its position as the world’s top semiconductor vendor, overtaking Intel.
The South Korean tech giant benefited from a sharp recovery in memory prices, pushing its revenue to $66.5 billion in 2024.
Meanwhile, Intel slipped to the number two spot as its AI PCs and Core Ultra chipset failed to make a significant impact.
Intel’s semiconductor revenue remained almost flat, with a growth of just 0.1 per cent in 2024.
Nvidia continued its remarkable rise, securing the number three position after increasing its semiconductor revenue by 84 per cent to reach $46 billion.
The company’s strong foothold in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fueled its growth, allowing it to climb two spots in the global rankings.
The memory segment played a key role in the semiconductor industry’s expansion, with revenue soaring by 71.8 per cent in 2024.
DRAM revenue surged by 75.4 per cent, while NAND revenue also climbed by 75.7 per cent year-over-year.
A major factor behind this growth was the increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which contributed significantly to DRAM sales.
HBM accounted for 13.6 per cent of total DRAM revenue in 2024, and its share is expected to rise to 19.2 per cent in 2025.

Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 06:09:39 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to reply to the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, marking the fourth day of the Budget session of Parliament. His address follows a speech by Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, who on Monday launched a sharp attack on the NDA-led central government.
During his address in the lower house, Gandhi criticized the Modi government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, claiming it had failed to revive the manufacturing sector. He pointed out that the sector’s share in GDP had declined from 15.3 percent in 2014 to 12.6 percent, the lowest in the past 60 years. He also reiterated his call for a caste census, suggesting that applying artificial intelligence to such data could open up significant opportunities.
Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Kiren Rijiju demanded an apology from Gandhi, stating that the opposition leader failed to substantiate his claims. Rijiju said that the Speaker had asked Gandhi four times to authenticate his statements, but he left the House without providing any supporting evidence. He emphasized that the post of Leader of Opposition carries responsibility and that any unverified statements should not be taken lightly.
The session also witnessed disruptions from opposition MPs during question hour, as they demanded a discussion on the Maha Kumbh stampede. Many members staged a walkout in protest.
Meanwhile, Congress MP Angomcha Bimol Akoijam is set to present two reports in the Lok Sabha. One will focus on the government’s response to recommendations regarding the Rashtriya Yuva Sashaktikaran Karyakram under the Department of Youth Affairs. The other will review education standards, accreditation, research, and examination reforms in Deemed Private Universities and other higher education institutions under the Ministry of Education.
Lok Sabha MP Iqra Choudhary is expected to table a report on the government’s actions concerning recommendations on mental health care and its management in contemporary times under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The Budget session of Parliament began on January 31 with President Droupadi Murmu’s joint address to both Houses. The first phase of the session will continue until February 13, with a recess before the second phase resumes on March 10. The session is scheduled to conclude on April 4.

Title: National Games: Taekwondo director replaced over allegations of ‘misconduct’
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 05:14:13 +0000
Content: The Indian Olympic Association has replaced senior officials of the Taekwondo team at the National Games following serious allegations of manipulation and match-fixing.
The Games Technical Conduct Committee (GTCC) has appointed S. Dinesh Kumar as the Director of Competition for Taekwondo, replacing T. Praveen Kumar, following strong recommendations from the three-member Prevention of Manipulation of Competition (PMC) Committee, according to a press release from the Indian Olympic Association.
GTCC Chairperson Sunaina Kumari said that she and her colleagues had decided to accept the recommendations made by the three-person PMC panel. “It is important that we take on board the PMC Committee’s recommendations and protect the integrity of the 38th National Games Uttarakhand. In addition to receiving complaints against the former Director of Competition, we were also shocked to discover that he had appointed office-bearers and executive committee members of some State Associations, as well as an equipment vendor for the selection trials, as Sports Specific Volunteers,” she said.
Backing the GTCC’s decision to replace the Director of Competition and change some technical officials, Indian Olympic Association President PT Usha emphasised the importance of all stakeholders upholding the spirit of sport and ensuring all competitors have a fair chance to showcase their talent on the biggest stage in the country. “It is shocking and sad that National Games medals were allegedly decided away from the field of play even before the competitions began. At the Indian Olympic Association, we are committed to being fair to all our athletes and protecting them from individuals attempting to manipulate the competition and tarnish the image of the National Games,” Usha said, as quoted in the release.
Acting on complaints, the PMC Committee made four recommendations to prevent disputes that could affect the conduct of the National Games due to unethical practices.
The first recommendation was for the IOA to replace the Director of Competition with a suitable candidate in consultation with the Games Technical Conduct Committee. Further, it suggested to the IOA President that at least 50 per cent of the nominated Technical Officials be replaced with qualified officials holding international or national certifications.
The PMC Committee also recommended that the entire competition be recorded on video, with the footage preserved for reference if needed. Finally, the panel advised that a team of officials nominated by the GTCC be present at the venue throughout the competition to minimise the scope for manipulation and give all athletes a fair chance at winning medals.
The PMC panel had reviewed complaints that some officials appointed by the Taekwondo Federation of India had already predetermined the outcomes of matches in 10 of the 16 weight categories before the competition was set to begin. “The asking price is Rs. 3 lakh for a gold medal, Rs. 2 lakh for silver, and Rs. 1 lakh for bronze,” the IOA was informed, as stated in the release.
As many as 16 Kyorugi and 10 Poomsae Taekwondo competitions will be held at Milam Hall in the Sports Complex in Haldwani from February 4 to 8.

Title: India accelerates nuclear power expansion in Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 05:03:59 +0000
Content: The Union Budget 2025-26 lays out a major push for nuclear energy as part of India’s long-term strategy to ensure energy security and transition to cleaner power sources. With an ambitious target of achieving 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047, the government is positioning nuclear energy as a cornerstone of its energy mix. This initiative aligns with the broader objectives of Viksit Bharat, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels while ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.
Recognizing nuclear power as a critical component for achieving energy security and sustainability, the government has introduced the Nuclear Energy Mission for Viksit Bharat. This initiative aims to enhance domestic nuclear capabilities, promote private sector participation, and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and R&D Initiatives
A key highlight of the Union Budget 2025-26 is the launch of a Nuclear Energy Mission, which is focused on research and development (R&D) of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government has allocated ₹20,000 crore for this initiative, aiming to develop at least five indigenously designed and operational SMRs by 2033.
Nuclear Energy Mission for Viksit Bharat
To facilitate the implementation of the Nuclear Energy Mission, amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act will be taken up by the parliament. These amendments are expected to encourage private sector investments in nuclear power projects.
These legislative changes are expected to create a more conducive environment for investment and innovation in the nuclear sector. The mission aligns with India’s commitment to achieving 100 GW of nuclear energy capacity by 2047, a milestone deemed essential for reducing carbon emissions and meeting future energy demands. As of January 30, 2025, India’s nuclear capacity is 8180 MW.
The government plans to collaborate with the private sector to advance nuclear energy initiatives. This partnership will focus on establishing Bharat Small Reactors, conducting research and development for Bharat Small Modular Reactors, and exploring newer technologies in the nuclear energy sector.
The government is actively expanding its nuclear energy sector by developing Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs) and exploring partnerships with the private sector. BSRs are 220 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) with a proven safety and performance record. These reactors are being upgraded to reduce land requirements, making them suitable for deployment near industries such as steel, aluminium, and metals, serving as captive power plants to aid in decarbonization efforts.
The plan involves private entities providing land, cooling water, and capital, while the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) handles design, quality assurance, and operation and maintenance, all within the existing legal framework. This initiative aligns with India’s commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy generation by 2030 and meeting 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030, as pledged at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in 2021.
In addition to BSRs, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) is developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) for repurposing retiring coal-based power plants and meeting power needs in remote locations. The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) also plans to introduce new nuclear reactors, including high-temperature gas-cooled reactors for hydrogen co-generation and molten salt reactors aimed at utilizing India’s abundant thorium resources.
This strategic move signifies India’s dedication to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing its civil nuclear energy program, with private sector participation playing a crucial role within the bounds of Indian laws and regulations.
Bharat Small Modular Reactors
India is actively exploring Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a crucial part of its energy transition strategy, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions while ensuring energy security. SMRs, are advanced nuclear reactors with a power generation capacity ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe, provide a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to conventional large nuclear reactors. Given India’s growing energy demands and the need for reliable, low-carbon power, SMRs can play a transformative role in complementing renewable energy sources and stabilizing the grid. Their modular design allows for factory-based manufacturing, reducing construction timelines and costs, making them suitable for both on-grid and off-grid applications, including deployment in remote locations.
India’s expertise in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) provides a strong foundation for the development and deployment of indigenous SMR designs. By integrating SMRs into its energy mix, India can address land constraints, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and enhance its ability to meet international climate commitments under the Paris Agreement (2015) which India ratified in October 2016.
Government Initiatives for Enhancing India’s Nuclear Capacity
India is actively expanding its nuclear power capacity to meet growing energy demands and achieve environmental goals. The government has initiated steps to increase nuclear power capacity from the current 8,180 MW to 22,480 MW by 2031-32. This expansion includes the construction and commissioning of ten reactors, totaling 8,000 MW, across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh. Additionally, pre-project activities for ten more reactors have commenced, with plans for progressive completion by 2031-32. Furthermore, the government has granted in-principle approval to establish a 6 × 1,208 MW nuclear power plant in collaboration with the USA at Kovvada in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh.
A significant milestone was achieved on September 19, 2024, when the Rajasthan Atomic Power Project’s Unit-7 (RAPP-7), one of the country’s largest and third indigenous nuclear reactors, reached criticality, marking the beginning of controlled fission chain reaction. This event signifies India’s growing capability in building and operating indigenous nuclear reactors, contributing to a future powered by homegrown technology.
Safety remains a cornerstone of India’s nuclear energy policy. India’s nuclear power plants operate with stringent safety protocols and international oversight. The radiation levels at Indian nuclear facilities are consistently well below global benchmarks, underscoring the country’s commitment to secure and sustainable nuclear energy. These efforts align with India’s broader strategy to provide clean and reliable energy, contributing to long-term energy security and environmental sustainability.
Recent Developments in Nuclear Energy in India
A significant deposit has been discovered in India’s oldest uranium mine, the Jaduguda Mines, within and around the existing lease area. This discovery will extend the life of the otherwise depleting mine by more than fifty years.
First two units of the indigenous 700 MWe PHWR at Kakrapar, Gujarat (KAPS – 3 & 4) have started commercial operation in FY 2023-24.
The closed fuel cycle, being the cornerstone of India’s nuclear power program, saw a major advancement in 2024 with the country’s first Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR 500 MWe) achieving several key milestones. These included the primary sodium filling in the main vessel, purification of the filled sodium, and the commissioning of all four sodium pumps (two primary sodium pumps and two secondary sodium pumps). Core loading commenced with the insertion of the first reactor control rod on March 4, 2024.
NPCIL and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) have signed a supplementary Joint Venture agreement to develop nuclear power facilities in the country. The JV named ASHVINI will function within the existing legal framework of the Atomic Energy Act 1962 (amended in 2015) and will build, own, and operate nuclear power plants, including the upcoming 4×700 MWe PHWR Mahi-Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open higher as US delays tariff hikes on Canada, Mexico
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:36:20 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market opened on a positive note on Tuesday, breaking a two-day losing streak, after the United States announced a one-month delay in its planned tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico.
At 9:32 a.m., the BSE Sensex rose by over 443 points, or 0.58 percent, reaching 77,630.71, while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 130.25 points, or 0.56 percent, to trade at 23,491.30.
Market sentiment improved after a sharp global sell-off in equities the previous day. Analysts attributed the rebound to the decision by US President Donald Trump to temporarily freeze the tariffs and initiate negotiations, interpreting it as part of his broader trade strategy. Over the weekend, Trump had imposed 25 percent duties on Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent levy on China, citing these measures as necessary to curb migration and fentanyl trafficking into the US.
The impact was visible across sectors, with eleven out of twelve NSE indices trading higher. The Nifty Metal index led the gains, while the Nifty FMCG index was the weakest performer at market open. Shares of Infosys, ICICI Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Larsen & Toubro provided support to the Nifty 50, whereas Power Grid Corporation, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, and Asian Paints dragged the index down.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee hit a record low on Monday, weakening beyond ₹87 per US dollar for the first time. The depreciation came amid concerns over the new tariff measures and their potential impact on global trade flows.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree for the 23rd consecutive session on February 3, offloading equities worth ₹3,958 crore. On the other hand, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers, purchasing equities worth ₹2,708 crore on the same day.
Volatility in the market remained evident, with the India VIX rising by 1.83 percent to trade at 14.3525 on Monday.

Title: Manchester City the big spenders in January transfer window
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:31:53 +0000
Content: Manchester City easily topped the spending charts in the January transfer window with the signing of Spanish midfielder Nico Gonzalez on Deadline Day to complete a busy month for the ailing Premier League champions.
City have endured a testing time on the pitch and sit fifth in the Premier League table with their hopes of a record-extending fifth successive domestic championship in tatters.
But the rebuild appears to have started in earnest with more than 180 million pounds ($223.58 million) spent by Pep Guardiola’s outfit — more than the combined amount paid by the other 19 English top-flight clubs in a relatively quiet window.
City’s spending was the second-biggest outlay ever worldwide by a club in the January transfer window behind Chelsea’s 274 million pounds in 2023, according to Transfermarkt.
City paid Porto 60 million euros ($62.06 million) for 23-year-old Gonzalez — their fourth major signing in the window.
Defender Abdukodir Khusanov joined from Lens for 33 million pounds, Egypt forward Omar Marmoush arrived from Eintracht Frankfurt for 59 million pounds while defender Vitor Reis was signed from Palmeiras for 29 million pounds.
It is quite a change of direction by City who usually do not feel the need to make big signings in mid-season. The last time they made a significant signing in January was 2018 when they brought in Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte.
While fullback Kyle Walker left to join AC Milan on loan, Guardiola will be content that his squad has been bolstered for the second half of a campaign that features a looming Champions League playoff against Real Madrid for a last-16 spot.
While City splashed the cash, Premier League leaders Liverpool made no signings and second-placed Arsenal also failed to bolster their forward line despite injuries to Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka.
Aston Villa cashed in on Colombia striker Jhon Duran for whom Al-Nassr paid 64 million pounds but manager Unai Emery will be satisfied that Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford joined last week on loan.
Three-times Champions League winner Marco Asensio has also arrived at Villa Park on loan from Paris St Germain in a deal completed on Deadline Day.
SPURS SIGNINGS
Injury-plagued Tottenham Hotspur began the transfer window by signing Czech goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky from Slavia Prague for 12 million pounds and concluded it by agreeing to take winger Mathys Tel on loan from Bayern Munich.
Manchester United fans may be left wondering whether they have been weakened in the window with Anthony also going out on loan to Real Betis and no forwards coming in.
Champions League qualification hopefuls Nottingham Forest have often been frenetic in past January windows but this time spent virtually nothing. Some of their rivals in the battle to qualify for Europe did strengthen though.
Brighton & Hove Albion signed Paraguayan midfielder Diego Gomez from Inter Miami for 12 million pounds and also spent 20 million pounds on Greek defender Stefanos Tzimas, who will stay at Nuremberg for the rest of the season.
Previous big spenders Chelsea kept their powder dry while Newcastle United were also inactive in January, both wary of staying within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).
Of teams involved in the Premier League relegation battle, Wolverhampton Wanderers strengthened their defence with Emmanuel Agbadou joining from Reims and Burkina Faso international Nasser Djiga signing on Deadline Day from Red Star Belgrade.
Elsewhere in Europe it was a quiet month of trading although Paris St Germain did buy exciting Georgia winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli for 70 million euros ($72.25 million)and handed him the number seven shirt vacated by Kylian Mbappe.

Title: Arsenal reignite WSL title hopes with win over Man City, Chelsea stay top
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:27:24 +0000
Content: A 78th-minute goal from Arsenal striker Stina Blackstenius gave her side a thrilling 4-3 victory away to Manchester City after a ding-dong battle on Sunday that revived the Gunners’ slim title hopes, but Chelsea remain top after a 1-0 win over Aston Villa.
Chelsea, who beat Arsenal a week ago in a serious blow to the Gunners’ league ambitions, are seven points clear of second-placed Manchester United, who kept up the pressure thanks to a 1-0 over Tottenham Hotspur in Sunday’s late kickoff.
Arsenal’s win moved them past Manchester City and into third spot on27 points, three behind Manchester United,while City are two points further back in fourthfollowing a rip-roaring encounter in the first game of the day.
Mariona Caldentey got the Gunners off to a flying start with a goal after 42 seconds, and seven minutes later the visitors were two up when defender Lotte Wubben-Moy headed home a free kick.
Mary Fowler grabbed the first of her two goals for City in the 20th minute, heading home from close range at the back post and five minutes after the break Vivianne Miedema levelled amid a frenetic start to the second half.
A minute later Frida Maanum put Arsenal back in front, but the visitors’ joy was short-lived as Steph Catley was adjudged to have brought down Aoba Fujino and despite the contact appearing to happen outside the box, the referee awarded a penalty that Fowler fired home to make it 3-3.
City brought on striker Khadija Shaw as they chased a winner, but it was Sweden international Blackstenius who grabbed the glory, making up for a number of misses by slamming home Beth Mead’s pass to secure a well-deserved win for Arsenal.
With nine league games to go, Arsenal goal-scorer Caldentey said her side were pleased to bounce back after losing to Chelsea.
“We needed a win today after what happened last week, we want to be on the top and to try and win every game,” she told Sky Sports.
In Birmingham, Chelsea faced one of the sterner tests of their season so far against a dogged Aston Villa, and despite fielding a side full of firepower, the Londoners needed an 82nd-minute own goal from Villa’s Sarah Mayling to wrap up the three points.
At the other end of the 12-team table, bottom side Crystal Palace grabbed a much needed point in a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion, while 11th-placed Leicester City suffered a 4-1 defeat away to Everton.
On the other side of Merseyside, Liverpool’s Leanne Kiernan got the only goal of the game as the Reds beat West Ham United 1-0.

Title: Trump makes Musk, the world’s richest man, a ‘special government employee’
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:16:34 +0000
Content: Elon Musk, who has moved swiftly to shrink the size of the U.S. government at President Donald Trump’s behest, is now considered a “special government employee,” the White House said on Monday.
The designation allows Musk, the world’s richest man, to work for the federal government but potentially avoid disclosure rules about conflicts of interest and finances that apply to regular government employees.
Musk still runs electric car company Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX while chairing Trump’s cost-cutting effort called the Department of Government Efficiency. As CEO of SpaceX, Musk oversees the company’s contracts with the Pentagon and intelligence community that are worth billions of dollars.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk is classified as a “special government employee.” A second senior White House official said Musk is not receiving a government paycheck and is following the law.
Special government employees are appointed to their positions for no more than 130 days, but Trump has not said how long Musk’s position will last.
Musk, who has promised “mass head-count reductions” across the federal bureaucracy, has drawn wide scrutiny in recent days as his team has been given access to or has taken control of numerous government systems. Musk’s moves have struck fear into the government workforce and caused chaos inside some agencies.
Reuters reported on Friday that aides to Musk charged with running the U.S. government human resources agency have locked career civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees, according to two agency officials.
Musk also has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for closure, calling the humanitarian agency a left-wing organization unaccountable to the White House.
Democratic lawmakers have decried what they characterize as an unelected billionaire amassing too much power over the federal government.
Trump, who officials say has entrusted Musk with overseeing the revamp of USAID, on Monday defended Musk but said there are limits to what his adviser can do.
“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval, and we’ll give him the approval, where appropriate; where not appropriate, we won’t. But he reports in,” Trump said to reporters.
“It’s something that he feels very strongly about, and I’m impressed, because he’s running, obviously, a big company,” Trump added. “If there’s a conflict, then we won’t let him get near it. But he does have a good, natural instinct. He’s got a team of very talented people.”
QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY
Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has embarked on a massive government makeover, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists.
A separate U.S. official said Trump is not closely monitoring Musk’s moves but is being kept up to date. “He’s read in,” the official said of Trump’s awareness of Musk’s activities.
Kathleen Clark, a government ethics professor at the Washington University School of Law, said most special government employees are not required to publicly file financial disclosures.
Musk’s new designation could be a way to avoid disclosing publicly his finances and his many conflicts, she said.
“If they do not make public his financial disclosure, it may make it impossible for the public and nongovernmental organizations and journalists to hold him and the government accountable and make sure he does not participate in matters where he has conflicts,” she said.
Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November’s presidential election.
On X, the social media platform Musk also owns, he shared a post from right-wing commentator Rogan O’Handley that said Musk had prominently campaigned with Trump and voters had knowingly voted for his cost-cutting agenda.

Title: World Cancer Day: Ayushman Bharat Yojana proving game changer in treating cancer patients
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 03:44:02 +0000
Content: World Cancer Day is celebrated every year on February 4 to raise awareness about cancer, and the Ayushman Bharat scheme, launched by the Narendra Modi-led Central government in 2018, is emerging as a transformative initiative in the fight against this disease.
The primary goal of celebrating World Cancer Day is to raise awareness about cancer and encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment at the earliest as a large number of people in the country and across the world and to reduce deaths that occur due to cancer.
Islam Ali, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Bhadohi, told the news agency: “My wife Afsari Begum has been undergoing treatment for cancer under the Ayushman Bharat scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Tata Hospital in Mumbai for the last six to seven months. My wife is undergoing chemotherapy and her health expenses are being paid with the help of an Ayushman Card.”
“With the help of Ayushman card, there is a lot of help getting health treatment. Till now my wife has undergone five chemotherapy treatments. All those health expenses have been incurred with the help of the Ayushman card,” he added.
The life of Anil Kumar Sharma, a resident of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, came to a standstill when he was diagnosed with throat cancer 18 months ago. All thanks to the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, now he is feeling about 50 per cent relief from his disease.
Anil Kumar Sharma said, “Initially my morale was down when I came to know about the disease, but under the Ayushman Yojana I was able to get timely treatment. Getting free treatment and essential medicines under the scheme has also relieved me of the financial burden that the disease brings. This scheme has given me a new hope.”
Alka Sharma, sister of Anil Kumar Sharma, told, “We had earlier gone to private hospitals, where the cost of treatment was very high and there was no special relief. Despite spending about Rs 3 lakh, we did not get any relief or concession.
“After this we got the card of the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Yojana made and then we got immediate financial relief. There was no difficulty in getting the Ayushman card made, and this card was activated soon. This card became an important part of the treatment and we started my brother’s chemotherapy from here. Now his fourth chemo has been done and he is feeling better.”
Radha Agarwal, a resident of Ahmedabad, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2024. Initially, this disease was detected at a private hospital, but after this she started getting treatment in a government hospital under the PM Ayushman Yojana, where she is getting better facilities.
Mahesh Chaurasia, a resident of Maharashtra’s Bhiwandi, told IANS: “My wife Poonam Chaurasia has been treated at the Tata Hospital in Mumbai for the last year with the help of Ayushman Card, from which our family is getting health benefits. My wife is suffering from breast cancer. I work in a private firm and am the only sole breadwinner in the family. My wife’s Ayushman card has already been made. Doctors say that my family will benefit from the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.”
Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is a national public health insurance scheme of the Indian government that was launched on September 23, 2018, that aims to provide free access to health insurance coverage for low-income earners in the country. The bottom 50 per cent of the country qualifies for this scheme. It was later expanded to include all senior citizens above 70 years, regardless of their economic status.
73-year-old Makhbooba Bano, a resident of Ahmedabad, has been getting treatment for stomach cancer under the PM Ayushman Yojana for the last five months.
Makhbooba Bano said that when she came to know about cancer, her family started treatment immediately and with the Ayushman card she is getting the benefit of high-quality treatment in a government hospital.
Siraj Mohammad Hanif Barfwala, a resident of Ahmedabad, successfully fought his battle with blood cancer with the help of the Ayushman card and now he is completely healthy.
Siraj Mohammad said that his condition became very serious when he was diagnosed with blood cancer, but after starting treatment under the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Yojana, he got relief from the cost of treatment and now he is recovering.
The Ayushman Bharat Yojana, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 23, 2018, has emerged as a beacon of hope for countless families across India, enabling them to access free treatment for serious illnesses in both private and government hospitals. By reducing the financial burden of healthcare, the scheme ensures that even the poorest citizens can receive life-saving medical care. (IANS)

Title: Ayushman Bharat Scheme: A lifeline for cancer patients and healthcare transformation in India
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 13:27:47 +0000
Content: Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 23, 2018, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) has emerged as a revolutionary initiative in India’s healthcare landscape. Designed to offer health insurance coverage to over 500 million people, the scheme aims to ensure equitable access to quality healthcare for the country’s economically vulnerable populations.
As India observes World Cancer Day, an occasion dedicated to raising awareness and combating the deadly disease, the transformative impact of PM-JAY is being lauded across the nation. The scheme has not only eased the financial burden of cancer treatment but also enabled thousands of families to access life-saving medical care.
Success stories of beneficiaries in Gujarat
Jyoti Amit Kumar Shah from Ahmedabad is one of the many beneficiaries who received free treatment under PM-JAY. Sharing his experience, he said, “Initially, I went to a private hospital for treatment. It was expensive, and the surgery did not work out. Later, I benefited from the PM-JAY scheme and am now receiving free treatment here.”
Vivek Singh, another beneficiary, highlighted how the scheme rescued him from crippling medical expenses. “Previously, I conducted tests in private hospitals but didn’t get any results. So, I came here, got the benefits of the PM-JAY scheme, and I am better now. I spent lakhs in private hospitals.”
Kiritbhai Poojabhai Gajjar, who has been receiving treatment at a government hospital for the past six years, praised the scheme for its comprehensive support. “I cannot afford a private hospital. I can’t get better treatment than this in India. We were so tense when this disease was diagnosed, but with the Ayushman card, I got free treatment,” he said.
Widespread impact across Madhya Pradesh
In Bhopal, cancer patients receiving care at the Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital under Ayushman Bharat are expressing deep gratitude for the scheme. Raghuvar Yadav from Sehore recounted how it helped his son-in-law Dharmendra Yadav. “The entire treatment is being done free of cost under Ayushman Bharat. I thank PM Modi for this; there is no one else like him,” he said.
Cancer patient Bubly echoed similar sentiments, stating, “We are poor, and I was diagnosed with cancer. Without this scheme, we would not have been able to afford treatment. Since PM Modi came to power, everything has changed.”
At Shivpuri Medical College, cancer patients have found renewed hope. Dr. Dheerendra Sachan, an oncologist at the college, highlighted the importance of timely treatment and the ongoing efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure. “We provide surgery and chemotherapy services. Patients in the fourth stage have been receiving treatment here for the past 5 to 6 years, which is a positive sign,” he noted.
‘Game changer’: Gurugram doctors hail Ayushman Bharat
Doctors at hospitals across the country, including Gurugram, have hailed Ayushman Bharat as a game changer in cancer care. Dr. Dheeraj Gautam explained, “Before, many patients couldn’t afford the investigations needed for early detection, which delayed treatment. Now, Ayushman Bharat makes these crucial tests affordable. Early detection significantly reduces treatment costs and improves survival rates.”
Dr. Nitin Sood, a haematologist, highlighted findings from a recent study published in *The Lancet*, which demonstrated that patients eligible for PM-JAY are more likely to recover due to early diagnosis and treatment. “By eliminating the financial barrier, we’re ensuring more people get diagnosed and treated sooner, which is crucial for better outcomes,” he said.
Aligned with India’s National Health Policy 2017, Ayushman Bharat aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by delivering comprehensive healthcare services. The initiative consists of two major components: Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) for preventive and primary care, and PM-JAY, which provides financial coverage for secondary and tertiary treatments, including cancer care.

Title: Investor Jim Rogers hails PM Modi as ‘one of the most competent leaders,’ predicts strong India-US ties
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 12:38:35 +0000
Content: Global investor Jim Rogers lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, calling him one of the most competent leaders capable of working effectively with the new US administration under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with IANS, Rogers discussed PM Modi’s upcoming visit to the United States, where he is expected to engage in wide-ranging talks with Trump on February 13.
“PM Modi is going to meet Trump. In my view, he will be true to himself, to his own intellect, and will not be swept away by the dazzle of foreign politicians,” said Rogers, who is based in Singapore.
“In my opinion, Mr. Modi is smarter than Mr. Trump,” he added.
PM Modi’s visit to the US is expected to follow his participation in the AI Summit in Paris on February 10-11. Last month, Trump indicated that PM Modi would likely visit the White House in February after the two leaders spoke over the phone on January 27, their second conversation since Trump’s re-election in November 2024.
Rogers expressed confidence in India’s trajectory under PM Modi’s leadership, saying that the country is on course to become the world’s third-largest economy despite global uncertainties.
He also voiced optimism about strengthening ties between India and the US.
“PM Modi can open up the Indian economy; he is smart enough to do that. It would be beneficial for both India and America,” he said.

Title: From Congress to BJP: Tracing the transformation of Delhi’s Lok Sabha elections
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 12:27:37 +0000
Content: Data on Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, sourced from the Election Commission of India, offer some interesting insights into the politics of the city, from the number of voters and voting patterns to its vast geographical expanse. 
India held its first Lok Sabha elections in 1951. At that time, Delhi, the nation’s capital, had four Lok Sabha seats. The city had 744,668 registered electors and a turnout of 57.92%. The Indian National Congress (INC) won three seats with 49.43% of the votes, while the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party secured one seat with 7.28%. Although the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) did not win any seats, it achieved an impressive vote share of 25.92%.
In 1957, five Lok Sabha seats were contested, and the Congress won all of them, with 54% of the votes compared to the BJS’s 20%. In the 1962 elections, the Congress repeated its performance with a 51% vote share from an electorate of 1,345,360. The BJS, despite failing to win a seat, remained a significant force with 33% of the votes, and the overall electoral turnout climbed to 68.75%.
The 1967 elections recorded a slightly higher turnout of 69.49%. The registered voter base had expanded to 1,684,714, and seven Lok Sabha seats were contested. The BJS won six seats with 47% of the votes, while the Congress managed only one seat with 39%. In 1971 the Congress reclaimed all seven seats with 64% of the votes. Delhi’s electorate increased to 2,016,390 and the overall turnout reached 65.19%.
The post-Emergency 1977 elections saw the highest turnout in Delhi Lok Sabha elections so far, when 71.31% of voters cast their ballots. The Bharatiya Lok Dal (BLD), as part of the broader Janata alliance, won all seven seats with 68.15% of the votes, leaving the Congress with no representation. By then, the registered voter base had expanded to 2,547,064.
A shift was observed in 1980 when the Congress (I) won six of the seven seats with over 50% of the vote, while the Janata Party secured one seat with 38% of the votes. In 1984, the Lok Sabha elections were held after the assassination of then Prime Minister of the country, Indira Gandhi. The Congress swept Delhi by winning all seven seats with 68.72% of the votes. That year, there were 3,496,781 registered voters and the final electoral turnout Delhi was 64.48%.
By 1989 the BJP had begun to make significant inroads in Delhi’s Lok Sabha elections. That year, the BJP won four seats, the Congress two, and the Janata Dal one. Delhi had 5,702,828 registered voters and a cumulative turnout of 54.3%. In 1991, despite a lower turnout of 48.52% from a registered base exceeding six million, the BJP won five seats while the Congress secured two, a trend that largely continued into the late 1990s.
In 1996, with the electorate expanding to over eight million, the overall turnout was 50.62%. The BJP won five out of the seven seats with nearly half of the total votes. In 1998, the BJP improved further by winning six seats with 51% of the votes, while the Congress secured around 37% and two seats in 1996 and then one seat with 43% in 1998. The following year, in 1999, the BJP swept all seven seats with 51.75% of the votes, even though the Congress polled over 40%, its efforts not enough to win any seats. The overall turnout that year was 43.54%.
The 2004 Lok Sabha elections marked a positive turn for the Congress, which won six seats with roughly 55% of the votes. The BJP secured one seat with 41%, and the overall turnout was 47.09%. In 2009, the Congress won all seven seats with 57% of the votes. That year, the registered voter base in Delhi expanded to over one crore, reaching 11,096,854.
In 2014, reflecting the BJP’s national dominance, the party’s influence was evident in Delhi as well. The BJP went on to win all seven Lok Sabha seats in both the 2019 and 2024 elections. Voter turnout, which had previously varied between 43% and around 50%, rose to 65.1% in 2014 from a registered base of 12,711,164. Delhi’s electoral contest, once a two-party race, evolved into a three-party contest with the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The BJP secured 47% of the votes, while the AAP replaced the Congress with a 33% share, leaving the Congress in third place with nearly 15%.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Delhi’s voter base further expanded to 14,327,649 with an overall turnout of 60.6%. The BJP, while winning all seven seats, increased its vote share to 56.85%. The Congress emerged as the second-largest party with 23% of the votes this time, while the AAP received 18%. In the 2024 elections, the BJP again maintained a vote share of 55% while winning all the seats, while the AAP emerged as the runner-up, replacing the Congress in vote share again. The voter base in the national capital city expanded beyond 1.5 crore, with 1,52,14,638 registered voters with final vote share in Delhi at 58.78%.

These figures highlight the ups and downs of Delhi’s parliamentary politics over the decades. Voter turnout has fluctuated significantly, from a peak of 71.31% in 1977 to a low of 43.54% in 1999. The Congress dominated in the early decades and performed well in the mid-2000s, whereas the BJP (and its predecessor, the BJS) has consistently been a significant force in Delhi’s electoral landscape. Since 1991, the BJP’s vote share has always exceeded 40%, even surpassing 50% on four occasions.

While the Congress, which once ruled the national capital, has experienced a steady decline and now faces a battle for survival, the BJP’s performance has remained remarkably consistent, ultimately paving the way for its rise. The emergence of AAP in Delhi’s politics has further eroded Congress’s vote share, while the BJP has strengthened its position in what is now the most populous city in India. According to the latest United Nations World Urbanisation Prospects report, Delhi is the world’s second most populous city, with 33.8 million residents, trailing only Tokyo, Japan, which has a population of 37 million.

Title: The India Growth Story
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 12:13:18 +0000
Content: It’s a great time to be in Asia, especially India. We are the world’s largest and fastest growing democracy with a significant population in the lower to middle class that’s educated, aspirational and hungry for consumption. At $3.72 trillion, India is the fifth largest economy in the world and the third largest by purchasing power parity on a per capita basis. From an once agriculture driven economy, India has moved towards becoming mainly services-oriented at 53% with agriculture being reduced to 18% and industry at approximately 28%. Manufacturing falls under industry contributing about 17% of India’s GDP with 27.3 million workers and the government aims to make manufacturing $1 trillion by 2025 or about 25% of GDP. The Indian government has set a $5 trillion by 2025 while India has grown at roughly 7.2% annually. Considering the size of the population and the demographics, India’s propelling to an economic powerhouse cannot be on the basis of services alone. The solution and opportunity lie in manufacturing.
The Government of India launched the Make in India program in 2014 for promoting India as manufacturing hub and rolled out various incentives such as concessional loans, tax rebates as well Production Link Incentives scheme (PLI). This was followed up with the launch of Atma Nirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) in 2020 after disruptions to the supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic in 14 sectors via PLI with an outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore (over US$26 billion) to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports. The purpose of the PLI Schemes is to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector to make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.
The sectors are: (i) Mobile Manufacturing and Specified Electronic Components, (ii) Critical Key Starting Materials/Drug Intermediaries & Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, (iii) Manufacturing of Medical Devices (iv) Automobiles and Auto Components, (v) Pharmaceuticals Drugs, (vi) Specialty Steel, (vii) Telecom & Networking Products, (viii) Electronic/Technology Products, (ix) White Goods (ACs and LEDs), (x) Food Products, (xi) Textile Products: MMF segment and technical textiles, (xii) High efficiency solar PV modules, (xiii) Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery, and (xiv) Drones and Drone Components.
PLI schemes have attracted over Rs 95,000 crore in investments with over 746 applications approved till November 2023. The anchor units that will be built in every sector are likely to set a new supplier/vendor base in the entire value chain. Most of these ancillary units are expected to be built in the MSME sector and will have a cascading effect on India’s MSME ecosystem. We can also impact gamechangers in BFSI via Fintech as banking becomes hyper-personalised.
The results are already visible. India is now the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world in smartphone manufacturing after China with over 2 billion phones shipped between 2014-22 with an annual CAGR of 23%. Companies like Foxconn have shifted many assembly lines of top end iPhones to India and aim to take India’s share in Apple’s production to 25% in the near future with exports of smartphones to US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, UAE etc. India is also regarded as the “pharmacy of the world” and is the third largest global producer by volume accounting to over 20% of the global supply of generic medicines. India is also the third-largest automotive market in the world expecting to double its size by the end of 2024. EMS and Renewable energy are sunrise sectors that expected to be gamechangers. Hence, we can see that opportunities exist in mature as well as sunrise sectors.
Industrial Revolutions present a gamechanger for the world. They typically bring out the best of innovation and the countries at its forefront get to enjoy leadership status for the foreseeable future till the next revolution comes along. The First Industrial Revolution witnessed the birth of the steam engine, reducing reliance on animal and human labour and ushered in a new era of manufacturing and precision engineering. The Second Industrial Revolution created the assembly line and mass manufacturing process driven by oil and electric energy. The Third Industrial Revolution in the mid-20th century brought computers and the initial stages of robotics and factory automation. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is about IoT, AI, Big Data, Robotics and Automation powered by the integration of intelligent digital technologies into industrial and manufacturing processes heralding an era of Smart Manufacturing. The Fourth Industrial Revolution with new technologies and systems is providing a relatively level playing field to Emerging Markets as they slowly take their place in the new world away from the colonial hangover.
However Indian economy has been facing huge headwinds off late in last few quarters due to slowing growth, sticky inflation, falling consumption, tighter liquidity in market due to high interest rates. As the going gets tough the tough gets going. The Budget 2025 presented by Hon’ble Finance Minister Shri Nirmala Sitaraman took the bull by the horns unleashing the India growth story. The finance minister ticked all the right boxes from giving impetus on Infrastructure, Defence, Renewable energy with its capex rising in the Budget Estimates of FY26-27. On the other hand, by raising the taxable income exemption limit from 7 lakh to 12 lakh it gave more in hand of the middle class to save, spend and thus spur consumption. The Government and the RBI have given much needed boost to the Indian economy by injecting more liquidity in markets, so that lending by banks, NBFCs could rise while giving more purchasing power to tax paying middle class.
In the Budget 2025, Government has provided more tax certainties to Electronic Manufacturing Sector, Make in India exemptions to LCD/LED Tvs, Looms, Textiles, Lithium-Ion batteries for Mobile Phones and EVs. Promotion of MRO for Ship Building, exempting 36 lifesaving drugs including rare diseases like cancer etc. The Government has also provided an outlay of 1.5 lakh crores, 50-year interest free loans to states for capital expenditure, new UDAN 2.0 scheme for connecting 120 new destinations and carry 4 crore passengers in next 10 years and allow private participation in the Nuclear Power sector by amendments to civil nuclear liability law. So these measures taken by Government are indeed revolutionary promoting defence indigenisation specially ship building, promoting private participation in nuclear power sector while boosting the consumption based economy by giving tax breaks to middle class.
However, one must be mindful over here that nation’s economy is not limited to budgetary announcement but goes even beyond it. The launch of manufacturing sector PLI schemes has yielded good results as noted above. In addition to this the Government is in midst of bringing PLI schemes for Telecom sector as well where stress will be given on telecom hardware indigenisation & import substation. The heralding of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and new breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence are equally going to affect the Indian IT sector. It is heartening to see the Government of India & the Private sector collaborate on Artificial Intelligence mission and Semi-Conductor chips programs, hosting of the Deep Seek AI on Indian servers and collaboration with NVIDIA on GPUs to transform India’s AI landscape. Thus, all these measures taken by RBI, by the Government of India in Budget and private sector augur well for the Indian economy to catapult it to the next stage of becoming the 3rd largest Economy in the world by 2030. It will be thus fit to say that it is not only India’s decade but India’s century.

Title: Government introduces ‘Haj Suvidha App’ and strengthens healthcare support for Indian pilgrims
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 11:41:52 +0000
Content: The Government of India has taken significant steps to improve the Haj pilgrimage experience by introducing the ‘Haj Suvidha App’ and providing comprehensive healthcare services to Indian pilgrims, with a special focus on the elderly, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Minorities on Monday.
The ‘Haj Suvidha App’ was launched to make the pilgrimage smoother by leveraging information technology. Pilgrims can access important information such as training materials, accommodation details, flight schedules, baggage tracking, an emergency helpline (SOS), grievance redressal, and feedback. The app also offers language translation services and other essential information to enhance the pilgrim’s experience. For government officials overseeing Haj operations, the app provides real-time monitoring and emergency response tools, ensuring better coordination and accountability.
During Haj-2024, more than 78,000 out of the 1,75,025 Indian pilgrims registered on the app. The app handled over 8,500 grievances and more than 2,100 emergency SOS calls. The use of QR codes for baggage identification significantly reduced the number of missing baggage cases.
In 2024, a record 4,558 female pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage without a Mehram (male companion), the highest number since the Ladies without Mehram category was introduced in 2018.
In addition to improving the logistical experience, the Government of India provided comprehensive healthcare support for pilgrims, especially for the elderly, through temporary healthcare facilities established in Saudi Arabia. The Indian Haj Mission ensured access to free medical consultations, medications, and treatment. Four medical centers in Makkah, one in Madinah, and 17 dispensaries operated 24/7 to meet the healthcare needs of pilgrims. Daily health monitoring was conducted, and medical teams visited pilgrims’ accommodations regularly.
A fleet of 24 ambulances was stationed in Makkah, Madinah, and other key locations to ensure quick responses during emergencies. Indian translators were deployed at Saudi hospitals to help pilgrims communicate effectively and receive appropriate care. Special arrangements were also made to ensure that elderly pilgrims admitted to hospitals could participate in essential rituals.
To combat extreme weather conditions, a hydration program was implemented, providing Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) to elderly pilgrims. Awareness campaigns advised pilgrims on staying hydrated, avoiding sun exposure, and other measures to prevent heat-related issues.

Title: US-China trade war expected to boost India’s exports, say government sources
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 11:33:10 +0000
Content: The ongoing trade war between the United States and China is anticipated to benefit India’s export sector, according to government sources cited by ANI. Despite potential challenges, officials remain optimistic about increased trade opportunities with the US.
Sources noted that while India may not be entirely spared from the impact of higher tariffs, the overall sentiment among Indian exporters is positive. “Some Indian products might face trade actions from the US, but our exports to America are expected to rise significantly,” a government source revealed.
The development follows recent moves by US President Donald Trump, who imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods starting Tuesday. In retaliation, China levied a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil imports from the US. The trade conflict stems from US concerns over illegal immigration and drug smuggling, including fentanyl.
Trump had initially announced tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. However, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were deferred by a month as negotiations continued.
Despite the brewing tensions, officials are confident about India’s strategic advantage. “We have engaged with Indian exporters, and the mood is upbeat. There is a significant rise in export orders and value projections,” one source explained.
India had previously benefitted during Trump’s first term amid trade tensions between the US and China. “Back then, our exports to the US were around $57 billion. They rose to $73 billion during the trade war period,” the source added, highlighting the historical precedent for gains in similar scenarios.
China, meanwhile, has condemned the new tariffs, with its Commerce and Finance ministries criticizing the US for “seriously violating” international trade rules. China vowed to challenge the decision at the World Trade Organization and implement unspecified countermeasures.

Title: Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban vow to stay united despite “enemy” bids to cause rifts
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 11:28:08 +0000
Content: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers will stay united despite enemies’ efforts to create divisions among the movement’s leaders and the people, a spokesman said, ruling out the prospect of conflict or war stemming from differences of opinion.
Some analysts and diplomats have voiced concern that divisions in the Taliban, which fought a 20-year war against foreign forces and took over Afghanistan in 2021, might spill over into instability as they seek to restore control.
“Enemies” dreamed of sowing division in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman based in the southern city of Kandahar, said on X, referring to the Taliban by the term it uses for its government.
“To them, I say, listen carefully: you will never achieve your dream of creating divisions among the leaders of the IEA and taking their place,” he said in an audio address on Monday.
“Consider it a mere illusion, the IEA remains a united front, and this system is the result of unity. Without unity, nothing would exist.”
The remarks come after a Taliban leader spoke out last month against policies denying formal education to girls, while this week Taliban guards fired shots that killed one of them outside the main United Nations compound in Kabul, the capital.
Despite occasional differences in opinion, there was no conflict among Taliban leaders, Mujahid added.
“These discussions sometimes become public, but this should never be mistaken for division,” he said.
“At the end of the day, they unite under one decision, it does not mean they rise against each other, harm one another, or engage in conflict and war.”
Diplomatic and Taliban sources have previously told Reuters of years of disagreement among the Islamist administration’s leaders over decisions by its supreme spiritual leader to close high schools and universities to female students.
The Taliban say they are discussing a plan and conditions for female students to return to school, but have not set a timeframe.
Curbs on education for girls and women was not in line with Islamic Sharia law, acting deputy foreign minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, who previously led a team of negotiators at the Taliban’s political office in Doha, said in a speech in January.

Title: 25 crore people lifted out of poverty in last 10 years; 5 crore houses built for poor: PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:57:21 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted in Parliament on Tuesday that his government has succeeded in lifting 25 crore people out of poverty in the last 10 years, provided tap water to 16 crore homes, and built 5 crore houses for poor families, as it has been working “tirelessly” to implement schemes for the economic development of the country.
Replying to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address in the Lok Sabha, PM Modi said: “In the past 10 years, people gave us the opportunity to serve them, and 25 crore countrymen defeated poverty and came out of it, which has been stated again and again by various studies.”
“Even after 75 years of Independence, 75 per cent of households comprising nearly 16 crore homes did not have tap water connections. In just five years, our government has provided tap water to 12 crore families in their homes.”
He pointed out that the poor have been given 5 crore houses, and the government has provided more than 12 crore toilets to improve the quality of life of the people, especially women who had to suffer the most because of the lack of these facilities.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the ‘farmers first’ initiatives undertaken by his government, which include a total of Rs 12 lakh crore being spent over the last years to provide them fertilizers at affordable prices.
Besides, the government has deposited over Rs 3.5 lakh crore directly into the bank accounts of farmers under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, and raised the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to record highs, with procurement now three times higher than it was a decade ago, he observed.
The Prime Minister also mentioned the sharp increase in medical college seats that had taken place during his tenure. He stated that in 2014, before the BJP came to power, there were only 387 medical colleges in the country.
This number has now doubled to 780 medical colleges, which has also resulted in a much higher number of seats for youths, the Prime Minister pointed out.
In 2014, there were only 3,800 MBBS seats for ST students. Today, this number has increased to nearly 9,000, he added.
“For OBC students, MBBS seats were less than 14,000 before 2014. Today, this number has risen to around 32,000, which means that 32,000 OBC students will become doctors,” PM Modi remarked.
“In the last ten years, a new university has been established every week, a new ITI every day, and a new college every two days. Imagine the growth in opportunities for SC, ST, and OBC youth,” the Prime Minister said.
PM Modi said that his government had also focused on youth aspirations, creating more opportunities and opening multiple sectors for them. As a result, India’s youth are now showcasing their potential on a global stage, he added.
Mentioning the benefits extended to the middle class, PM Modi said that while in 2013-14, the income tax exemption limit was only Rs 2.5 lakh, this has now been increased to Rs 12 lakh.
This has provided complete tax relief to those earning an income of up to Rs 12.75 lakh as they do not have to pay any tax, he added.
PM Modi also highlighted the setting up of Jan Aushadhi Kendras, which provide medicines at an 80 per cent discount, enabling families purchasing medicines from these centres to collectively save nearly Rs 30,000 crore on medical expenses.
“This is just our third term, and we are committed to building a modern, capable, and Viksit Bharat (developed India). For all of us, the country must always come first. Let us come together and make the dream of a Viksit Bharat our own — a dream shared by 140 crore Indians,” the Prime Minister said.

Title: Indian researchers’ new drug delivery system to revolutionise arthritis treatment
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:30:31 +0000
Content: Researchers from the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST) Mohali, an autonomous institution of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), have developed an innovative “self-actuating” drug delivery system that could revolutionise the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) affects millions of people worldwide, causing chronic inflammation, debilitating pain, and irreversible joint damage.
While traditional treatments often rely on systemic drug administration, which carries the risk of side effects and also requires frequent dosing, the novel treatment targets inflammation directly within the joints so that therapeutic agents are released only when needed, the researchers said.
The new system responds directly to the biochemical signals in the inflamed synovial environment. It uses specially designed microspheres loaded with methotrexate — a commonly used anti-rheumatic drug.
“These microspheres are engineered to sense inflammation in joints and release the drug only when needed, minimising side effects and improving therapeutic outcomes,” said the team led by Dr. Rahul Kumar Verma fromthe Institute.
The formulation consists of polymer-lipid hybrid micro-composites, where the lipid component (soya lecithin) ensures high drug encapsulation efficiency, and the polymer component (gelatin) provides responsiveness to Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).
In animal studies, it significantly reduced joint swelling, inflammation, and cartilage damage while promoting joint repair, the team said.
“The system leverages the unique biochemical signals present in the inflamed synovial microenvironment to release therapeutic agents precisely when needed. When exposed to these enzymes, the gelatin substrate is cleaved, triggering the release of the encapsulated drug in a controlled, pulsatile manner,” said the researchers in the paper published in the journal Biomaterial Advances.
The findings could offer a safer, more effective alternative to current RA treatments by eliminating the need for frequent drug injections and reducing systemic toxicity.
The system enhances drug effectiveness by improving bioavailability and retention in the affected joints, leading to longer-lasting relief with fewer doses. This means less pain, improved joint function, and slower progression of joint damage for patients.
Beyond arthritis, the technology holds promise for managing other inflammatory diseases, such as synovitis and inflammatory bowel disease. It could also pave the way for smart biomaterials in regenerative medicine and personalized treatments, said the researchers.

The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, which commenced on Paush Purnima (January 13), is recognized as the world’s largest spiritual and cultural gathering, drawing millions of devotees from around the globe. The grand event will continue until Mahashivratri on February 26.
In his consistent effort to promote India’s cultural and spiritual heritage, Prime Minister Modi has spearheaded several initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure and facilities at major pilgrimage sites. During a previous visit to Prayagraj on December 13, 2024, he inaugurated 167 development projects worth Rs 5,500 crore to bolster connectivity and public amenities.
Meanwhile, King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk of Bhutan also visited the Maha Kumbh 2025 on Tuesday, participating in spiritual activities alongside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The King explored the ‘Digital Mahakumbh Experience Centre’ and visited significant sites such as the Lete Hanuman Mandir and the sacred Akshayvat tree.
In a post on X, CM Yogi Adityanath highlighted the visit, saying, “His Majesty the King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk Ji observed the divine, grand, and digital form of Mahakumbh during his visit to Prayagraj.”
To ensure a safe and smooth experience for devotees, an elaborate security arrangement has been implemented across the fairgrounds, involving personnel from civil police, PAC, STF, ATS, NSG, and paramilitary forces. Key locations, including pontoon bridges, Akhara routes, and bathing ghats, have been fortified to manage the flow of pilgrims.
According to officials, more than 375 million devotees have already taken a holy dip at the Sangam during this year’s Maha Kumbh, as the sea of pilgrims continues to flock to the sacred site.

Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday refuted comments made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament regarding the statement of the Chief of the Army Staff on the situation along the India-China border.
In a tweet, Singh clarified that the Army Chief’s observations pertained to a “temporary disturbance” in traditional patrolling patterns by both India and China along the disputed border. He emphasized that these patrols have now returned to their traditional practices following recent disengagement efforts, a fact previously presented in Parliament.
The minister said that the words attributed to the Army Chief during the parliamentary debate were never uttered by him. He stressed the need for accuracy and responsible discourse when discussing sensitive issues related to national security.
Singh further highlighted the historical context of territorial disputes, reminding that approximately 38,000 square kilometers of Indian territory in Aksai Chin has remained under Chinese control since the 1962 war. Additionally, he added that Pakistan ceded 5,180 square kilometers of Indian land to China in 1963.

Title: India has over 300 mobile manufacturing units, exports surpass Rs 1.29 lakh cr: Ashwini Vaishnaw
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:26:01 +0000
Content: India has risen to become the world’s second-largest mobile manufacturer, growing from just 2 units in 2014 to over 300 operational units nationwide today, Union Minister for Railways and Electronics and IT, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said on Tuesday.
About 99.2 per cent of mobile phones sold in India are now made locally, as the manufacturing value has soared to Rs 4.22 lakh crore, with exports crossing Rs 1.29 lakh crore in 2024.
In 2014-15, only 26 per cent of the mobile phones sold in the country were made in India, with the rest being imported.
More than 325 to 330 million mobile phones are manufactured annually in India, and there are about a billion mobile phones in use across the country, the minister stated.
“Indian mobile phones have virtually saturated the domestic market, and there’s a substantial uptick in the exports of mobile phones. The exports, which were almost non-existent in 2014, have now surpassed Rs 1.29 lakh crore,” Vaishnaw said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ vision is helping India become a global manufacturing hub, he noted.
The sector’s expansion has also been a major employment driver, creating approximately 12 lakh direct and indirect jobs over the decade. These employment opportunities have uplifted the economic status of numerous families and contributed to the socio-economic fabric of the country, according to the minister.
The ‘Make in India’ initiative has been pivotal in achieving these milestones, enabling the domestic production of critical components and sub-assemblies such as chargers, battery packs, mechanics of all types, USB cables, and more complex components like Lithium Ion cells, speaker and microphone systems, display assemblies, and camera modules.
“Looking forward, the focus will intensify on advancing deeper into the value chain, particularly in the production of components and semiconductors. This shift is part of a broader strategy to enhance self-reliance and establish India as a leading player in the global electronics market,” Vaishnaw reiterated.
The establishment of a semiconductor manufacturing base has been an important part of the ‘Make in India’ effort, which India has been striving to achieve for over six decades.
With the launch of the India Semiconductor Mission and five major approved projects—including Micron, two projects by Tata Electronics, one by CG Power, and another by Keynes—a real semiconductor manufacturing base is now being established in India.
“From toys to mobile phones, defence equipment to EV motors, production is shifting back to India,” Ashwini Vaishnaw said.

Title: Kejriwal busy with power & money, does not think of country: Anna Hazare
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:18:02 +0000
Content: In an interview with IANS, anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare spoke at length on various issues, including the present state of AAP, headed by Arvind Kejriwal. He said that in politics, Kejriwal has become preoccupied with power and money. Until he starts thinking about society and the country, no matter how much money he earns, it will be of no use.
IANS: What is your view on AAP founder Arvind Kejriwal, who is facing a tough poll battle?
Anna Hazare: In politics, Kejriwal has become preoccupied with power and money. Until he starts thinking about society and the country, no matter how much money he earns, there is no use. Earlier, Kejriwal was with me. But when the thought of power and money came to his mind, and the idea of liquor shops took root in his heart, I chose not to go with him. When the party had to be launched, I was called, I went but told him that until everyone was in power, I would not join him.
IANS: Who will win the Delhi Assembly elections?
Anna Hazare: People will teach a lesson to those who do bad deeds. Kejriwal’s victory or defeat will be known after the election results. The result will tell what is right and wrong.
IANS: How do you view Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia going to jail?
Anna Hazare: Those who do bad deeds will have to go to jail. Our country runs according to the law. Our country has many religions, but the reason for them running in one line is ‘spirituality.’ There are different parties, but the highest is the Constitution; the country runs according to it and the law.
IANS: Why did Kumar Vishwas and Prashant Bhushan leave Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP?
Anna Hazare: Everyone has the right to speak in a democracy, but if someone says something wrong, society teaches him a lesson. If you go on the wrong path, the public will teach you a lesson. I have left the people who thought of liquor. I talk to Prashant Bhushan and Kumar Vishwas, but I don’t talk to those who are after money and power.
IANS: Are you satisfied with the functioning of Lokpal and Lok Ayukta as you had staged a sit-in fast earlier?
Anna Hazare: I protested for the creation of Lokpal at the Centre, the bill was passed in Parliament, and now the second Lokpal has been appointed. Recently, the Lokpal law was passed and appointments were made, but things did not go as per our wishes. Lokpal and Lokayukt were appointed, but the rights that people should get are lacking. Till now, people have not gotten all their rights; however, they are getting some now. But there is much more that needs to be done. The central acts regarding the Right to Information and Lokpal are good.
IANS: Your views on ‘one country, one election’?
Anna Hazare: If I get to know the motive behind one country, one election, I will say something.
IANS: Your views on spirituality and the ongoing Maha Kumbh?
Anna Hazare: Life will not change without spirituality. Spirituality does not mean chanting a rosary but doing good for the distressed and the country. Regarding Kumbh, you see the world through the lens of your perspective; it’s essential to understand the viewpoint of others as well.

Title: ‘We didn’t give false hopes to the poor but brought real change’: PM Modi’s dig at Congress
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:32:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday boasted about his government’s achievements in lifting more than 25 crore people out of poverty and criticized the previous Congress governments for misleading the public with false promises.
While addressing the Lok Sabha during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address, PM Modi stated that the grand old party only boasted of poverty eradication for decades but did nothing to bring about real change.
“Big change happens and is ensured when people with a grassroots understanding work with strong resolve. Only then does real change occur,” the Prime Minister said.
Mocking the grand old party’s Garibi Hatao campaign, PM Modi added, “We didn’t give them false hopes but brought real change.”
“Real change demands courage, determination, and a will to bring it. It is sad that many people lack it today,” he said.
PM Modi also listed the government’s concerns and initiatives for the poor and shared details of how people are benefiting from various welfare schemes.
The Prime Minister mentioned that about 4 crore people have received pucca houses, emphasizing that only those who live in kuccha houses can understand the pain and hardship.
“We built more than 12 crore toilets. Women had to wait for hours for nature’s call. The construction of toilets has relieved them of their daily struggle. Our government has ensured direct tap water connections to about 12 crore households under the Nal se Jal scheme,” he said.
In an indirect jibe at Aam Aadmi Party convenor and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Prime Minister remarked that while some leaders focus on jacuzzis and stylish showers, his government remains focused on strengthening tap water connections.
“The President in her address laid down the roadmap for the next 25 years, evoking fresh optimism about the ‘Viksit Bharat’ goal and inspiring the new generation to contribute towards it,” he said.

Title: Used money to build India, not ‘Sheeshmahal’: PM Modi jabs Kejriwal’s Delhi model
Publication Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:03:10 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that his government has consistently strived to uplift the living standards of people as well as enhance their financial power, unlike the previous governments which focused on filling their own coffers and letting corruption thrive under their watch.
Replying to the Motion of Thanks on President’s address, PM Modi cited many public-driven projects and schemes to harness the country’s resources and said that his government used the money to build the nation, not ‘Sheeshmahal’, a luxurious palace allegedly built by former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal using taxpayers’ money.
“Earlier, the newspapers were filled with news of scams and corruption. In the past 10 years, we have saved crores of rupees which have been used for the public. We have not used that money to build a ‘Sheeshmahal’; instead, we used it to build the nation,” said the Prime Minister, amid vigorous desk thumping by the treasury bench members.
The Prime Minister also took a swipe at a former Congress Prime Minister, mocking his self-styled image as ‘Mr Clean’.
“A former PM used to say that when Rs 1 was sent from Delhi, only 15 paise reached the bottom. Everyone can understand who was getting the 15 paise,” he said while stating that it happened at a time when there was only one party from the panchayat level to the central level. The PM was referring to ex-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.
PM Modi asserted that his government tried to find solutions and not merely keep situations lingering for decades.
“Our model is ‘Bhachat bhi Vikas bhi’, ‘Janata ka paisa janata ke liye’,” he asserted.
PM Modi listed several schemes like JAM Trinity while talking about ethanol as an alternative to fuel and explained they have proven to be big money-minting projects.
“Under the Jan Aushadi Kendra, 80 per cent discount is available on medicines. Beneficiaries are saving about Rs 30,000 crore in medicines,” PM Modi pointed out.
“Because of our intensified focus on LED bulbs and energy saving, the prices of LED bulbs have come down from Rs 400 to Rs 40. Countrymen have saved a whopping Rs 20,000 from this,” the Prime Minister said.
PM Modi also quoted a UNICEF survey and said that the world body found that those families being part of the sanitation drive have saved Rs 70,000 per family in a year.

Simultaneously, the Milkipur assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh saw a 65.25% turnout in by-polls, while Tamil Nadu’s Erode (East) recorded 64.02% voter participation by 5 PM.
Polling for all 70 Delhi Assembly seats and by-elections for two constituencies in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh commenced at 7 AM under heavy security arrangements.
However, the voting day was not without controversy. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of “openly distributing money” in the Jangpura constituency’s Sarai Kale Khan area.
The Delhi Police swiftly refuted these claims. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the police said: “Allegations of voter bribery at Sarai Kale Khan were promptly investigated. Police, along with the Executive Magistrate/Flying Squad Team (FST), ensured thorough verification. No evidence was found to substantiate the claims. Effective police presence is maintained for peace and order.”
The votes will be counted on February 8, with both political camps preparing for a crucial verdict.

Content: Iran is ready to give the United States a chance to resolve disputes between the arch foes, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump restored his “maximum pressure” campaign on the country.
The official said Tehran disagreed with “any displacement of Gazans, but Iran-U.S. talks are a separate matter”, referring to Trump’s remarks that the U.S. would take over war-ravaged Gaza and create a “Riviera of the Middle East” after resettling Palestinians elsewhere.
“Iran does not agree with any displacement of Palestinians and has communicated this through various channels. However, this issue and the path of Iran’s nuclear agreement are two separate matters and should be pursued separately,” the official said.
The official said Tehran wanted the United States to “rein in Israel if Washington is seeking a deal” with the Islamic Republic.
Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said that U.S. concerns about Iran developing nuclear weapons were not a complicated issue and could be resolved given Tehran’s opposition to weapons of mass destruction.
Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Tehran has long said its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and it has no intention to build nuclear weapons.

Title: Cargo handled at India’s major ports surges to 819 million tonnes
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2025 11:22:52 +0000
Content: The cargo handled at India’s major ports has increased from 581.34 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 819.23 million tonnes in FY 2023-24, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5 per cent, which is comparable to global standards, the Parliament was informed on Wednesday.
During 2023-24, the cargo handled comprised 33.80 per cent liquid bulk, 44.04 per cent dry bulk, and 22.16 per cent container cargo, Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.
Infrastructure development and capacity augmentations of major ports are continuous processes involving the construction of new berths and terminals, mechanisation of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging to deepen drafts for attracting larger vessels, and the development of road and rail connectivity, he added.
Further, Vadhavan Port in Maharashtra has been approved for development as a mega container port to cater to the requirement of handling new-generation mega-size container ships.
Based on consultations with major ports, state maritime boards, and the Ministries of Railway and Road Transport and Highways, 107 road and rail connectivity infrastructure gaps for major and non-major ports have been identified and included in the Comprehensive Port Connectivity Plan (CPCP) prepared by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in September 2022. These projects aim to enhance connectivity between ports and domestic production and consumption centres, the minister said.
In response to another question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister tabled data showing the total cargo handled at both major ports run by the Central government and non-major ports managed by private companies and state governments over the last four years. There has been a steady increase in the total cargo handled at all ports in the country, from 1,247.72 million tonnes in 2020-21 to 1,540.23 million tonnes in 2023-24. While 819.23 million tonnes of this cargo was handled by the major ports, 721 million tonnes were shipped through other ports.
The minister further noted that the government has taken various steps to streamline logistics for export-oriented industries, such as the construction of new berths, terminals, and parking plazas; the mechanisation and modernisation of existing berths and terminals; the streamlining of processes through digitalisation; and the expansion of hinterland connectivity through rail and road.

In response, the DEO clarified on social media that a Flying Squad Team (FST) was immediately dispatched to investigate. The inquiry found that voters had cast their ballots independently without any external influence.
The election results will be announced on February 8 when the counting of votes takes place.

Title: Sensex Slips as Investors Eye RBI Policy, Delhi Polls
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:40:09 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Wednesday after a volatile trading session, as investors remained cautious amid global uncertainties. Market participants are now closely watching the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on February 7, where a potential rate cut—the first in five years—could be announced. Additionally, the outcome of the Delhi Assembly elections, scheduled for February 8, is being closely monitored.
The BSE Sensex declined by 312.53 points, or 0.40 per cent, to settle at 78,271.28, having fluctuated between an intra-day high of 78,735.41 and a low of 78,226.26. Meanwhile, the NSE Nifty ended 42.95 points lower at 23,696.30, after touching a high of 23,807.30 and a low of 23,680.45 during the day.
Despite the losses in benchmark indices, select stocks provided support to the market. Adani Ports, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank were among the top gainers, registering gains between 0.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent. However, selling pressure weighed on Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan Company, ITC, HUL, and L&T, with Asian Paints leading the decline with a 4 per cent drop.
Broader market indices performed better, with the Nifty MidCap index rising by 1.13 per cent, while the Nifty SmallCap index recorded a stronger gain of 1.99 per cent. Sectoral indices painted a mixed picture, as Nifty FMCG, Realty, Auto, and Consumer Durable indices declined by up to 1.85 per cent, while PSU Bank, Metal, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), and Media stocks witnessed buying interest, rising over 1 per cent each.
Aditya Gaggar of Progressive Shares noted that the markets opened strong but faced resistance near the 23,800 level, causing a reversal. Without sustained momentum, the index oscillated between positive and negative territory before settling at 23,696.30, down by 42.95 points. The Media and Energy sectors performed well, while Realty and FMCG stocks saw declines of over 1.5 per cent.
As investors await key developments, market sentiment hinges on the RBI’s potential 25-basis-point repo rate cut, which is expected to align with the budget’s objectives of stimulating economic activity while maintaining fiscal prudence.

Title: 1st ODI: England brace for more spin test, India focus on Rohit, Virat’s form
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:37:26 +0000
Content: Spin has been the England cricket team’s nemesis in the T20I series against India and it will continue to be their Achille’s heel in the three-match ODI series, which starts with the first match at the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) Stadium here on Thursday. They are also expected to be subjected to more spin inquisition in the Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan.
Spinners played a big role in India’s 4-1 triumph in the T20I series with leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy tormenting the visitors by claiming 14 wickets in five matches, including a fifer in the third game in Rajkot, incidentally the only match in the series that England won.
They were hammered by Abhishek Sharma, who blazed to 135 off 54 balls — the highest score by an Indian in T20Is, in the final match at the Wankhede in Mumbai and then troubled by the spin again as they were bundled out for 97 in just within 11 overs.
England’s think tank is aware of their spin troubles and also the fact that all-format coach Brendon McCullum implored his batters to take on aggressively the spinners and go after the turning ball in T20 cricket after the series defeat to India. He will continue to advocate the same tactics to his batters in 50-over cricket considering that they will also face spin attack in the Champions Trophy.
England skipper Jos Buttler said they will continue to bat aggressively as they have been doing in all formats in recent times.
“We want to play in the same way. We want to find ways to put pressure on the opposition with the bat. They’ve got to take wickets.
“I think it’s crucial to see how, if you let guys bat for a period of time, they can go on to it,” said Jos Buttler in the pre-match press conference here on Wednesday.
Buttler said their bumbling 1-4 defeat to India in the T20Is was not because of issues with their style of play but rather due to poor execution of plans.
“It’s always about execution really. I think that’s the, you know, whatever plan you come up with, try and execute it well. We believe that the best way for us is to win games of cricket and get the best out of the players in our dressing room. So we’ll, we’ll double down on that,” said Buttler.
Considering their discomfiture against the slow-turning ball, India have reinforced their 50-over side by calling in Chakravarthy as a late inclusion. If one goes by how things are presently moving, the leg-spinner is likely to make his ODI debut on Thursday.
England are bracing themselves for another spin test on what the curator promises to be a pitch that will produce a 200-plus score but will also assist spinners in the second half of the match.
The Indian fans will be hoping to see skipper Rohit Sharma and seasoned batter Virat Kohli firing all cylinders considering the upcoming Champions Trophy.
Rohit had done well in ODIs at the 2023 World Cup at home and was India’s top scorer in the T20 World Cup last year while Kohli was exceptional in the T20 World Cup final, scoring 76 off 59 balls as India went on to win by seven runs.
Rohit had a good series against Sri Lanka after the T20 World Cup but Kohli went off the boil after that and has struggled ever since. Rohit has not done well in the Test series against New Zealand and Australia and also the lone domestic red-ball match he played after India’s BGT debacle Down Under.
The duo will be hoping to return to form ahead of the Champions Trophy and the subsequent 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League.
India are also going into the three ODI series without Jasprit Bumrah, who has been rested after the Australia red-ball series in which he bowled exceptionally well. However, the Indian thinktank will be closely monitoring Mohammed Shami, the hero of India’s surge to the final in the 2024 ODI World Cup. Shami picked a three-fer in the Wankhede T20I against England but some experts feel he still has to prove that he is back to his best following the injury and surgery that kept him out for nearly a year.
Arshdeep will be India’s pace spearhead in the series while the spin attack will be led by Ravindran Jadeja and it has to be seen who will partner him and Chakravarthy.
Overall, India and England have played 107 ODIs with India winning 58 and England 44 — two matches were tied and three ended in no results. In India, the two sides have clashed in 52 matches with India winning 34 and England 17 — 1 match was tied.
India have been quite successful at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha, winning four of the six matches they have played there. However, they have played only three ODIs in 2024, losing two matches while one ended in a tie.
While the overall record favours the hosts, the pitch at the stadium has been under scrutiny twice, being termed poor by the ICC on a couple of occasions. With England playing here after a few years, it promises to be a cracker of an encounter if the pitch holds to the promise made by the curator.
Squads:
India: Rohit Sharma (C), Ꮪhubman Gill (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy.
England: Harry Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Jos Buttler, Jamie Smith, Philip Salt, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood.

Title: ECI’s ‘Chandrayaan Se Chunao Tak’ initiative boosts voter enthusiasm in West Delhi
Publication Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:21:34 +0000
Content: As the Delhi Assembly polls unfold, a captivating and futuristic initiative by the Election Commission of India (ECI) has been turning heads and generating excitement in West Delhi. At a special polling booth in Vikaspuri, voters are greeted with a remarkable theme: “India’s Flight from Chandrayaan to Election.”
The booth is unlike any other, featuring models of the Chandrayaan and Gaganyaan, as well as interactive displays of planets through a bioscope and telescope.
In a bid to connect the nation’s ambitious space missions with the democratic process, astronauts —dressed in full gear — escort voters into the booth, adding an element of fun and innovation to the voting experience.
Particularly heartwarming is the special attention given to elderly voters, who are greeted with roses and a warm welcome as they step forward to cast their ballots.
The idea behind this initiative is to increase voter awareness and enthusiasm, while also celebrating India’s remarkable achievements in space exploration.
It has certainly captured the imagination of those visiting the booth. The set-up, featuring a mix of space-themed models and technology-driven displays, not only engages voters but also creates a sense of national pride and excitement.
Voters, young and old, are visibly delighted by the experience, with many expressing their appreciation for the innovative approach.
Speaking to IANS, SDM Patel Nagar, Nitin Shakya, who is spearheading the initiative and ensuring that everything runs smoothly at the polling booths, shared his optimism about the potential impact of this unique approach on voter turnout.
“We’ve worked with the theme ‘Chandrayaan se Chunao tak’ to connect space exploration with the electoral process.
“The students and college volunteers have been instrumental in bringing this vision to life. The use of technology and AI has added a futuristic touch, and the positive response from the voters is overwhelming. This excitement is definitely driving up the voting percentage,” he said.
As of 1 p.m. on polling day, Delhi saw a turnout of 33.31 per cent, with a noticeable increase in voters as the afternoon warmed up after a cool morning.
The ECI’s initiative, combined with the collaborative efforts of the West Delhi administration, is already proving to be a success, attracting a steady stream of voters, all enthusiastic about this engaging and memorable voting experience.
With the perfect blend of space exploration and civic engagement, the ‘Chandrayaan Se Chunao Tak’ initiative is not only boosting the spirit of democracy but also ensuring that more citizens come out to participate in shaping the future of Delhi.
