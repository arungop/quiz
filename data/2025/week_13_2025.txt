Title: India’s forex reserves rise by USD 305 million to USD 654.3 billion
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 07:50:29 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by USD 305 million, reaching USD 654.271 billion in the week ending March 14.
This rise follows the previous week’s surge, which marked the highest weekly gains in over three years. Prior to these recent increases, forex reserves had experienced a steady decline for about four months, slipping to an 11-month low. The trend has since seen fluctuations, with alternate weeks of gains and declines.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. Since then, they have fallen by nearly 7 percent from that peak. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s interventions, primarily to curb a sharp depreciation of the Rupee, are considered a key reason for the decline. Currently, the Indian Rupee hovers at or near its record low against the US dollar.
According to the latest RBI data, India’s foreign currency assets (FCA)—the largest component of forex reserves—stand at USD 557.186 billion. Gold reserves are valued at USD 74.391 billion.
Estimates suggest that the country’s forex reserves are adequate to cover approximately 10 to 11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added about USD 58 billion to its forex reserves, in contrast to a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion recorded in 2022. In 2024, the reserves saw a modest increase of slightly over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a country’s central bank or monetary authority, mainly in reserve currencies such as the US dollar, with smaller holdings in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI frequently intervenes in the forex market, managing liquidity by buying dollars when the Rupee strengthens and selling them when it weakens. These measures are aimed at stabilizing the currency and preventing steep depreciation. (ANI)

Title: Unseasonal rain cause huge crop loss in Telangana
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:56:38 +0000
Content: Unseasonal rain along with strong winds have caused widespread damage to crops in Telangana and the affected farmers are looking to the government for compensation.
Hailstorms hit north Telangana districts during the last two days, damaging standing crops of paddy, maize and mango.
A few days ago, crops in some districts were withering due to a lack of irrigation water and declining groundwater. But now, the unseasonal rain has destroyed whatever crops the farmers had grown.
Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds reaching 40 to 50 kmph caused huge losses to farmers as the standing crops were submerged. Hailstorms in some districts added to farmers’ woes.
Mango farmers have suffered massive losses from gusty winds that have uprooted trees in several districts. Farmers said the hailstorms hit the mango crop which was almost ready for harvest
Paddy kept at market yards for sale in some places also soaked in the unseasonal rain.
The gusty winds also damaged electric poles and transformers, disrupting electricity supply.
Hundreds of bags of paddy and maize kept at the market yard in Sangareddy soaked in rain, causing huge losses to farmers. The district received heavy rain accompanied by lightning and gusty winds.
In the Kamareddy district, maize crops were inundated due to unseasonal rain. A farmer said in just 30 minutes of hailstorm he lost everything.
The affected farmers have appealed to the government to come to their rescue by compensating for the losses.
Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari reviewed the situation after a hailstorm hit north Telangana. She directed the district administrations to be on alert and accessible to people in view of the forecast of more rain.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rain or thundershowers at isolated places over the next two days.
It has issued an orange alert for north Telangana districts.
According to Met Office, thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (40-50 kmph) and hailstorms are very likely to occur at isolated places in Kumuram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Mulugu, Mahabubabad, Warangal, Hanamkonda, Jangaon districts.

Title: India’s aviation sector reflects stable outlook amid rising air traffic
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:23:37 +0000
Content: India’s aviation sector continues to show a stable outlook, supported by a steady rise in air passenger traffic. Official data reveals that domestic air passenger traffic recorded a robust double-digit growth of 11.04 per cent in February this year compared to the same month last year.
According to an ICRA report, domestic air traffic for the first 11 months of the current financial year stood at approximately 1,551 lakh passengers. This marks a 7.7 per cent increase over the same period last year and a 12.9 per cent rise compared to the pre-Covid level of 1,338 lakh passengers recorded in the same period of FY20.
International passenger traffic has also seen significant growth. In the first 10 months of the financial year (April-January), Indian carriers transported around 280.9 lakh international passengers, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 14.8 per cent. This figure is 41.3 per cent higher than the pre-Covid level of approximately 198.8 lakh passengers.
The ICRA report notes that the Indian aviation industry’s outlook remains stable, supported by expectations of moderate growth in domestic air passenger traffic and a relatively stable cost environment in FY25 and FY26.
Data released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) shows that India’s scheduled domestic airlines ferried around 1.40 crore passengers in February 2025, up from 1.26 crore in the same month of the previous year.
DGCA’s monthly passenger traffic report highlights IndiGo as the country’s leading airline, commanding a 63.7 per cent market share. The low-cost carrier transported 89.40 lakh passengers in February 2025.
IndiGo was followed by the Air India Group, including Air India Express, which carried 38.30 lakh passengers, giving the Tata Group airline a 27.3 per cent market share.
Among newer entrants, Akasa Air carried 6.59 lakh passengers, securing a 4.7 per cent share of the market. SpiceJet, led by Ajay Singh, flew 4.54 lakh passengers, translating to a 3.2 per cent market share.
Smaller carriers also made their mark. Alliance Air transported 0.86 lakh passengers, accounting for 0.6 per cent of the market, while Star Air flew 0.60 lakh passengers, capturing a 0.4 per cent share.
ICRA has maintained a ‘stable’ outlook for the aviation industry, citing improved pricing power and moderate traffic growth projections. Domestic air traffic is projected to grow at 7-10 per cent in FY2025 and FY2026, while international passenger traffic for Indian carriers is anticipated to expand by 15-20 per cent.
Adding to the momentum, IndiGo Airlines has emerged as the world’s second fastest-growing airline in terms of seat capacity, which increased by 10.1 per cent year-on-year to over 134.9 million seats in 2024. It is ranked just behind Qatar Airways, which recorded a 10.4 per cent increase, according to data from the Official Airline Guide (OAG).
IndiGo has also been recognised as the fastest-growing airline globally in terms of flight frequency growth, clocking a 9.7 per cent year-on-year increase in 2024. The airline recorded 7,49,156 flights during the year, OAG data shows.
Additionally, IndiGo holds one of the world’s largest aircraft orders, with over 900 aircraft on order. It was the largest recipient of new aircraft in 2024, receiving 58 Airbus planes. However, the report also notes that a sizeable portion of its fleet, approximately 80 aircraft, remains inactive due to MRO-related supply chain challenges.

Title: Scientists link type 2 diabetes with some obesity-related cancers
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:52:09 +0000
Content: A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to an increased risk of developing certain obesity-related cancers, according to recent research.
While earlier studies have identified associations between type 2 diabetes and a heightened risk of several obesity-related cancers, questions have remained about whether these links are truly causal. Factors such as obesity—a common risk factor for both conditions—as well as potential biases like immortal time bias (stemming from the combination of pre-existing and new cases of T2D) and time detection bias (where two common conditions are diagnosed concurrently) have clouded the findings.
In this latest study, set to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) in Malaga, Spain, researchers aimed to overcome these methodological limitations. They conducted a matched cohort control study using data from the UK Biobank, comparing individuals newly diagnosed with T2D (defined by the date of first reported non-insulin-dependent diabetes) to unexposed individuals matched based on body mass index (BMI), age, and sex.
The study involved 23,750 participants with newly diagnosed T2D and 71,123 matched controls. Over a median follow-up period of five years, 2,431 new primary cancers were reported among T2D participants, compared to 5,184 cases among the control group.
The analysis revealed that new-onset T2D was associated with a 48 per cent increased risk of obesity-related cancers in men and a 24 per cent increased risk in women—an effect independent of BMI. However, the study found no association between T2D and certain site-specific cancers, such as endometrial cancer and post-menopausal breast cancer in women.
Positive associations were observed for specific cancers. New-onset T2D increased the risk of bowel cancer by 27 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. The risk of pancreatic cancer rose by 74 per cent in men and nearly doubled in women. For liver cancer, new-onset T2D was linked to a near quadrupling of risk in men and a nearly five-fold increase in women.
“At this stage, we are unsure whether these differences in men and women are due to a sex-dependent biological pathway—such as hormone levels, insulin sensitivity, or body fat composition—or if they are simply the result of variations in the number of cancers found in men and women within the UK Biobank by chance,” the study authors noted.

Title: Miami Open: Tiafoe, Berrettini make winning starts; Rublev bows out
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:30:44 +0000
Content: Playing in his 100th ATP Masters 1000 match, Frances Tiafoe earned his 50th win at the prestigious level with a 7-5, 7-6(5) win against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
The 27-year-old earned his first Top 40 win since beating Daniil Medvedev at Laver Cup last September by improving to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head-to-Head series with Davidovich Fokina, avenging a defeat to the Spaniard last month in Acapulco, ATP reports.
Wins like that are big for me,” said Tiafoe, who saved all four break points he faced after dropping serve in the opening game. “Any win right now is big for me, but especially the way I played. I was super aggressive, so I’m really happy with it.”
Tiafoe will next meet 17th seed Arthur Fils, who led lucky loser Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 2-3 before the Canadian retired with an ankle injury.
Andrey Rublev, on the other hand, became the latest upset victim with Belgium’s Zizou Bergs knocking him out 7-5, 6-4. The 25-year-old Bergs earned his first Top 20 win by beating the No. 9 in the ATP Rankings to advance to his first ATP Masters 1000 third round.
Bergs will seek to score another upset against Matteo Berrettini in the third round, after the Italian opened his Miami campaign with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against Hugo Gaston.
In a rematch of the 2024 Kitzbuhel final, the 29th-seeded Berrettini beat lucky loser Gaston with a dominant serving performance.
Meanwhile, the 18-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca became the youngest player to reach round three at ATP Masters 1000 since Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in 2021.
Fonseca delivered a five-star display to defeat 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 and reach the third round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time in his fledgling career.
Due to a last-minute schedule change, Fonseca and Humbert’s second-round clash was relocated from Grandstand to Stadium.
Fonseca has enjoyed a rapid rise at the start of the 2025 season. He claimed his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and is now up to a new career-high No. 58 in the ATP Live Rankings.

Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:48:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid homage to revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, and Sukhdev Thapar on their death anniversary, observed as Shaheed Diwas or Martyrs’ Day.
The three freedom fighters were executed by the British on March 23, 1931, for their unwavering fight against colonial rule.
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Today, our nation remembers the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev. Their fearless pursuit of freedom and justice continues to inspire us all.”
In a video message, he highlighted their immense contribution to India’s independence struggle, recalling an incident from Bhagat Singh’s childhood.
“Taking oath on this soil, our heroes fought for freedom. In this soil, a hundred years ago, a small child was sowing wood. When his father asked what he was sowing, he replied that he was sowing guns. The father asked what he would do with them, and the child said he would use them to free his country. That brave child was none other than Shaheed Bhagat Singh,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi further stated that even after so many years, the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev remains deeply ingrained in the hearts of every Indian child.
Quoting a Hindu shloka, he said, “‘Neither weapons can cut him, nor fire can burn him.’ Such are the people who sacrifice their lives for the nation. On Shaheed Diwas, I pay tribute on behalf of the grateful nation to all the brave men and women who sacrificed everything for the country.”
March 23, though a solemn day in Indian history, serves as a reminder of the courage and sacrifice of India’s freedom fighters. It stands as a tribute to all those who laid down their lives in the pursuit of independence, inspiring generations to cherish and uphold the hard-won freedom of the nation.

Title: Centre disburses ₹14,020 crore incentive under PLI scheme; industry welcomes move
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:45:42 +0000
Content: The industry has welcomed the central government’s commitment to bolstering India’s manufacturing sector following the disbursement of ₹14,020 crore under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The scheme, spread across multiple sectors, has resulted in cumulative sales of ₹14 lakh crore so far.
According to data compiled by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, incentives worth ₹14,020 crore have been disbursed under the PLI schemes in 10 sectors, including large-scale electronics manufacturing, IT hardware, bulk drugs, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, telecom products, food processing, white goods, automobiles, and drones.
The PLI schemes, designed in line with India’s vision of achieving self-reliance (‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’), cover 14 key sectors and have attracted investments worth ₹1.6 lakh crore.
Commenting on the development, Ashok Chandak, President of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), said, “This initiative is a major step toward job creation, expansion of India’s manufacturing ecosystem, and boosting exports, particularly in electronics and semiconductors. Going forward, we expect accelerated growth in the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector, fostering innovation, strengthening supply chains, and positioning India as a global hub for high-value electronics production.”
He further noted that the current momentum, supported by initiatives such as the upcoming Semicon India Programme V2.0 and the PLI scheme for electronic components, would help achieve a targeted $500 billion electronics market and meet the projected $103 billion semiconductor demand with significant value addition.
The PLI schemes have incentivized domestic manufacturing, leading to increased production, job creation, and higher exports. They have also drawn significant investments from both domestic and foreign companies.
To date, 764 applications have been approved under the PLI schemes for the 14 sectors, with 176 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) among the beneficiaries. These include sectors such as bulk drugs, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, telecom, white goods, food processing, textiles, and drones, according to an official statement.
As of November 2024, actual investments of around ₹1.61 lakh crore ($18.72 billion) have been reported. This has generated production worth approximately ₹14 lakh crore ($162.84 billion) against the target of ₹15.52 lakh crore up to FY 2024-25. The scheme has also created employment for over 11.5 lakh individuals, both directly and indirectly.
The PLI schemes have helped transform India’s export basket, shifting from traditional commodities to high value-added products such as electronics, telecommunications goods, and processed food products. Exports under the scheme have exceeded ₹5.31 lakh crore ($61.76 billion), with significant contributions from sectors like large-scale electronics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and telecom and networking products.
Individual cases under the PLI scheme have been approved transparently over time. Projects typically require 2 to 3 years for implementation, depending on the manufacturing sector, and incentive claims are generally submitted after the first year of production. As a result, many projects are still at the implementation stage and will be filing claims in the coming period.

Title: Djokovic says reclaiming top ranking, not his goal anymore
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:43:33 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic said chasing the world number one ranking is not his main objective anymore and the 24-times Grand Slam champion will happily take major tournament victories over the top spot in the twilight of his glittering career.
Djokovic has spent more than 400 weeks at number one and now sits fifth in the rankings, but the 37-year-old showed he cannot be written off and earned a record 411th ATP Masters 1000 match win on Sunday.
A 6-1 7-6(1) third-round victory over Argentine lucky Camilo Ugo Carabelli at the Miami Open also put Djokovic a step closer to his 100th singles title and the Serbian said the top ranking did not matter as much.
“If it comes as a consequence of great results and titles that I win in a season, then that’s amazing. But that’s not my objective,” Djokovic told reporters.
“My objective is to be able to play my best tennis at the Grand Slams and the tournaments where I participate. My schedule is revised, so obviously I’m not chasing ranking points.
“It’s different nowadays, maybe, from what it was a few years back (or) for most of my career, to be honest. I’m happy to win a Grand Slam and a big tournament rather than getting to number one. Right now that’s more important for me.”
Jimmy Connors with 109 and Roger Federer with 103 are the only men with more titles than Djokovic but he said climbing to the top of the list could be difficult.
“It would definitely be amazing to get to that record,” Djokovic added. “Connors is someone that I truly admire and respect. He’s always very supportive of me in public, I’m thankful for that. It would be amazing.
“But again, it’s probably more difficult to achieve that nowadays for me than maybe it was some years ago. I’ll go step by step. I’ll see. I don’t know how long I’m going to compete for. But I’m still enjoying myself when I play well.”

Title: India observes World Tuberculosis Day with renewed commitment to eradication by 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:37:03 +0000
Content: India marked World Tuberculosis (TB) Day on March 24, reaffirming its commitment to eliminating the deadly disease by 2025. The day aims to raise awareness about the global health threat posed by TB, which primarily affects the lungs and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or spits.
In her message on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day, the President of India, Droupadi Murmu commended the National TB Elimination Programme and its efforts to raise awareness through public participation. She emphasized the theme for this year, “Yes, We Can End TB: Commit, Invest, Deliver,” calling for a united global effort to eradicate the disease. “Our united efforts to end TB and awareness campaigns have led to a significant reduction in TB cases in the country over the past decade. I urge all stakeholders to work collectively to make India TB-free,” she said.
Union Health Minister JP Nadda also highlighted the progress made by India in combating TB, stating that the government has made remarkable strides toward eliminating the world’s deadliest infectious disease. “Our government has made notable progress through the National TB Elimination Programme, and we are committed to achieving our goal of eliminating TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global target,” Nadda said in a statement.
India has witnessed a 17.7% decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2023, surpassing the global average reduction of 8.3%, according to the WHO Global TB Report 2024. Additionally, TB-related deaths in the country have dropped by 21.4% during the same period.
To intensify efforts, the government launched the India 100 Days TB Elimination Campaign in December, focusing on high-burden districts. The campaign has detected over five lakh TB patients across 347 high-priority districts in 33 states and union territories. To further support TB patients, the government has increased the financial assistance under the Nikshya Poshan Yojana from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 per month to ensure adequate nutrition during treatment.
India continues to lead the fight against TB, which remains a significant health challenge, accounting for 26% of global TB cases and 29% of global TB-related deaths. As the nation works toward a TB-free future, Nadda extended his gratitude to healthcare workers for their dedication and urged all citizens to join efforts in creating a “#TBMuktBharat” for better health outcomes.
“Together, we can eliminate TB and improve health for all,” Nadda concluded.

Title: Nanotechnology breakthrough may boost treatment for aggressive breast cancer: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:26:18 +0000
Content: Researchers in Australia are developing next-generation nanoparticles to enhance current treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of the disease.
The researchers are designing innovative iron-based nanoparticles, or “nano-adjuvants,” which are small enough to fit thousands on a single strand of hair, to strengthen the body’s immune response against TNBC, according to the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) on Monday, Xinhua news agency reported.
Unlike other breast cancers, TNBC lacks the proteins targeted by some conventional treatments, making effective therapy a significant challenge, according to Prof. Yu Chengzhong from the AIBN.
“Despite the promise of immunotherapy, its effectiveness against triple-negative breast cancer is extremely limited, leaving too many women without options — and that’s what our research is trying to change,” Yu said.
The nanoparticles are designed to enhance the activity of T-cells, the white blood cells used by the immune system to fight disease, within the tumor microenvironment, improving the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells, according to Yu.
Supported by a 3 million Australian dollar ($1.89 million) National Health and Medical Research Council grant, the five-year research project aims to bridge a critical treatment gap and could pave the way for clinical applications, not only for TNBC but also for other hard-to-treat cancers like ovarian cancer.
With over two decades of experience in nanotechnology and nanomedicine, Yu hopes this breakthrough will transform cancer treatment by making immunotherapy more effective for patients with aggressive solid tumors.
“This research will push the boundaries of science to find innovative treatments that change the way we fight this cancer, offering hope for women facing devastating outcomes,” said AIBN Director Alan Rowan.

Title: Who is Han Duck-soo, South Korea’s PM who returns as acting president?
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:11:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated on Monday as South Korea’s acting president, is a technocrat whose experience and reputation as a safe pair of hands transcended party lines and helped him serve in senior posts under five presidents.
Known as a seasoned economic, trade and foreign affairs specialist, Han, 75, was serving the second stint as the head of cabinet, when he became acting president on December 14 after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached by parliament for leading a short-lived martial law.
Two weeks later, Han himself was impeached after being accused of aiding Yoon in the martial law declaration and his powers suspended. He denied this but accepted some responsibility for the ensuing crisis by failing to dissuade Yoon from making the surprise move.
On Monday, the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment, restoring his powers to serve as leader while the country awaits the same court’s ruling on Yoon’s impeachment.
In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han has been a rare example of an official who has sought to stay out of the political fray.
“It is my life’s honour that I have been able to serve the people with all my might,” Han said after parliament voted to impeach him.
Earlier, when he stepped into the acting presidency, he faced the challenge of keeping government functioning through its gravest political crisis in four decades, while also tackling threats from nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea, and a slowing economy at home.
It is the same daunting responsibility he returns to but with external pressure on the export-reliant economy much more intense under the threat of higher tariffs for its products to the United States under the second Donald Trump presidency.
Han has served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.
His roles have ranged from prime minister, finance minister and trade minister to presidential secretary for policy co-ordination, besides being ambassador to the United States and the OECD and heading up think-tanks and organisations.
With a Harvard doctorate in economics, Han’s expertise in the economy, trade and diplomacy as well as a reputation for rationality, a moderate demeanour and hard work had made him a regular go-to man in South Korean politics.
Han has been prime minister since Yoon’s term began in 2022, his second time in the role after a stint under former president Roh Moo-hyun in 2007-2008.
“He has served in key posts in state affairs solely through recognition of his skills and expertise, unrelated to political factions,” Yoon said when appointing Han in 2022, echoing descriptions used when previous administrations tapped him.
Han has experience working with South Korea’s key ally the United States, having been deeply involved in the process of signing the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement.
Fluent in English, he was appointed South Korea’s ambassador to the United States in 2009, working in Washington at a time when former U.S. President Joe Biden was vice president, and contributed to Congress approving the free trade deal in 2011.
“He is a civil servant through and through, who didn’t take on a political colour despite working under (five presidents),” said a former high-ranking government official speaking on condition of anonymity.
Han’s acting presidency had been expected to last for months. Now the role is likely to be brief, until the Constitutional Court delivers its ruling on whether to remove Yoon or restore his powers. The ruling is expected within days.
If Yoon is removed, a presidential election must be held in 60 days. South Korea’s constitution does not say how much the acting president is empowered to do in the role.

Title: India secures FIBA Asia Cup 2025 spot with thrilling win over Bahrain
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 04:48:02 +0000
Content: The Indian men’s basketball team clinched a hard-fought 81-77 victory over Bahrain at Khalifa Sports City on Saturday, securing their place in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025.
In a tense contest against world No. 66 Bahrain, India, ranked 81st in the FIBA men’s basketball rankings, displayed remarkable resilience to overcome a late deficit and seal the win in the final qualifying round.
India finished at the top of Group H after winning both their matches in the final phase of the FIBA Asia Cup 2025 Qualifiers. They had earlier registered a dominant 97-77 win over Iraq on Friday.
India Qualifies for 11th Consecutive FIBA Asia Cup
This round of the qualifiers featured six third-placed teams from the previous stage, competing for the last four spots in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025, which will be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from August 5 to 17.
The teams were divided into two groups, with the top two from each group earning qualification. India’s back-to-back wins secured them the Group H title, while Iraq and Bahrain will battle for the second qualification spot on Sunday.
Harsh Dagar Shines as India Edges Bahrain in a Nail-Biter
Against Bahrain, Harsh Dagar emerged as the standout performer, leading India with a game-high 28 points. He was in sublime form from beyond the arc, shooting an impressive 6-of-8 while also contributing three rebounds, three assists, and two steals.
Kanwar Sandhu added 15 points, while Pranav Prince and Muin Bek Hafeez chipped in with 11 points and eight rebounds each. The duo also combined for eight assists.
India started strong, with Dagar setting the tone early from long range. They controlled the game for most of the contest and entered the fourth quarter with a 62-53 lead. However, hosts Bahrain staged a spirited comeback, led by Subah Azzam, to take a 77-75 advantage with under two minutes remaining.
Krishnan Delivers in the Clutch
With the game on the line, Arvind Krishnan stepped up in the clutch, curling off a screen to drain a crucial three-pointer from the left wing, putting India back in front at 78-77 with 1:39 remaining.
Although Krishnan momentarily lost possession with a turnover, he quickly made amends by snatching a vital steal from Wayne Chism. Moments later, Hafeez split a pair of free throws to extend India’s lead to two points.
Bahrain had one final opportunity, but Prince forced a crucial turnover, intercepting Mosti Rashed’s inbound pass intended for Mohammed Ameer. With just 11 seconds left on the clock, India regained possession, leaving the hosts with little room for a comeback.
Bahrain resorted to fouling in a desperate attempt to prolong the game, but Krishnan calmly sank both free throws to seal India’s 11th consecutive FIBA Asia Cup qualification, a streak that dates back to 2001.
Road to the FIBA World Cup 2027
India’s victory over Bahrain not only secured their place in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025 but also earned them a spot in the FIBA World Cup 2027 Qualifiers, marking another major milestone for Indian basketball.
