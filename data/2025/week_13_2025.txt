Title: India’s forex reserves rise by USD 305 million to USD 654.3 billion
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 07:50:29 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by USD 305 million, reaching USD 654.271 billion in the week ending March 14.
This rise follows the previous week’s surge, which marked the highest weekly gains in over three years. Prior to these recent increases, forex reserves had experienced a steady decline for about four months, slipping to an 11-month low. The trend has since seen fluctuations, with alternate weeks of gains and declines.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. Since then, they have fallen by nearly 7 percent from that peak. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s interventions, primarily to curb a sharp depreciation of the Rupee, are considered a key reason for the decline. Currently, the Indian Rupee hovers at or near its record low against the US dollar.
According to the latest RBI data, India’s foreign currency assets (FCA)—the largest component of forex reserves—stand at USD 557.186 billion. Gold reserves are valued at USD 74.391 billion.
Estimates suggest that the country’s forex reserves are adequate to cover approximately 10 to 11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added about USD 58 billion to its forex reserves, in contrast to a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion recorded in 2022. In 2024, the reserves saw a modest increase of slightly over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a country’s central bank or monetary authority, mainly in reserve currencies such as the US dollar, with smaller holdings in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI frequently intervenes in the forex market, managing liquidity by buying dollars when the Rupee strengthens and selling them when it weakens. These measures are aimed at stabilizing the currency and preventing steep depreciation. (ANI)

Title: Unseasonal rain cause huge crop loss in Telangana
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:56:38 +0000
Content: Unseasonal rain along with strong winds have caused widespread damage to crops in Telangana and the affected farmers are looking to the government for compensation.
Hailstorms hit north Telangana districts during the last two days, damaging standing crops of paddy, maize and mango.
A few days ago, crops in some districts were withering due to a lack of irrigation water and declining groundwater. But now, the unseasonal rain has destroyed whatever crops the farmers had grown.
Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds reaching 40 to 50 kmph caused huge losses to farmers as the standing crops were submerged. Hailstorms in some districts added to farmers’ woes.
Mango farmers have suffered massive losses from gusty winds that have uprooted trees in several districts. Farmers said the hailstorms hit the mango crop which was almost ready for harvest
Paddy kept at market yards for sale in some places also soaked in the unseasonal rain.
The gusty winds also damaged electric poles and transformers, disrupting electricity supply.
Hundreds of bags of paddy and maize kept at the market yard in Sangareddy soaked in rain, causing huge losses to farmers. The district received heavy rain accompanied by lightning and gusty winds.
In the Kamareddy district, maize crops were inundated due to unseasonal rain. A farmer said in just 30 minutes of hailstorm he lost everything.
The affected farmers have appealed to the government to come to their rescue by compensating for the losses.
Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari reviewed the situation after a hailstorm hit north Telangana. She directed the district administrations to be on alert and accessible to people in view of the forecast of more rain.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rain or thundershowers at isolated places over the next two days.
It has issued an orange alert for north Telangana districts.
According to Met Office, thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (40-50 kmph) and hailstorms are very likely to occur at isolated places in Kumuram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Mulugu, Mahabubabad, Warangal, Hanamkonda, Jangaon districts.

Title: India’s aviation sector reflects stable outlook amid rising air traffic
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:23:37 +0000
Content: India’s aviation sector continues to show a stable outlook, supported by a steady rise in air passenger traffic. Official data reveals that domestic air passenger traffic recorded a robust double-digit growth of 11.04 per cent in February this year compared to the same month last year.
According to an ICRA report, domestic air traffic for the first 11 months of the current financial year stood at approximately 1,551 lakh passengers. This marks a 7.7 per cent increase over the same period last year and a 12.9 per cent rise compared to the pre-Covid level of 1,338 lakh passengers recorded in the same period of FY20.
International passenger traffic has also seen significant growth. In the first 10 months of the financial year (April-January), Indian carriers transported around 280.9 lakh international passengers, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 14.8 per cent. This figure is 41.3 per cent higher than the pre-Covid level of approximately 198.8 lakh passengers.
The ICRA report notes that the Indian aviation industry’s outlook remains stable, supported by expectations of moderate growth in domestic air passenger traffic and a relatively stable cost environment in FY25 and FY26.
Data released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) shows that India’s scheduled domestic airlines ferried around 1.40 crore passengers in February 2025, up from 1.26 crore in the same month of the previous year.
DGCA’s monthly passenger traffic report highlights IndiGo as the country’s leading airline, commanding a 63.7 per cent market share. The low-cost carrier transported 89.40 lakh passengers in February 2025.
IndiGo was followed by the Air India Group, including Air India Express, which carried 38.30 lakh passengers, giving the Tata Group airline a 27.3 per cent market share.
Among newer entrants, Akasa Air carried 6.59 lakh passengers, securing a 4.7 per cent share of the market. SpiceJet, led by Ajay Singh, flew 4.54 lakh passengers, translating to a 3.2 per cent market share.
Smaller carriers also made their mark. Alliance Air transported 0.86 lakh passengers, accounting for 0.6 per cent of the market, while Star Air flew 0.60 lakh passengers, capturing a 0.4 per cent share.
ICRA has maintained a ‘stable’ outlook for the aviation industry, citing improved pricing power and moderate traffic growth projections. Domestic air traffic is projected to grow at 7-10 per cent in FY2025 and FY2026, while international passenger traffic for Indian carriers is anticipated to expand by 15-20 per cent.
Adding to the momentum, IndiGo Airlines has emerged as the world’s second fastest-growing airline in terms of seat capacity, which increased by 10.1 per cent year-on-year to over 134.9 million seats in 2024. It is ranked just behind Qatar Airways, which recorded a 10.4 per cent increase, according to data from the Official Airline Guide (OAG).
IndiGo has also been recognised as the fastest-growing airline globally in terms of flight frequency growth, clocking a 9.7 per cent year-on-year increase in 2024. The airline recorded 7,49,156 flights during the year, OAG data shows.
Additionally, IndiGo holds one of the world’s largest aircraft orders, with over 900 aircraft on order. It was the largest recipient of new aircraft in 2024, receiving 58 Airbus planes. However, the report also notes that a sizeable portion of its fleet, approximately 80 aircraft, remains inactive due to MRO-related supply chain challenges.

Title: Scientists link type 2 diabetes with some obesity-related cancers
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:52:09 +0000
Content: A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to an increased risk of developing certain obesity-related cancers, according to recent research.
While earlier studies have identified associations between type 2 diabetes and a heightened risk of several obesity-related cancers, questions have remained about whether these links are truly causal. Factors such as obesity—a common risk factor for both conditions—as well as potential biases like immortal time bias (stemming from the combination of pre-existing and new cases of T2D) and time detection bias (where two common conditions are diagnosed concurrently) have clouded the findings.
In this latest study, set to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) in Malaga, Spain, researchers aimed to overcome these methodological limitations. They conducted a matched cohort control study using data from the UK Biobank, comparing individuals newly diagnosed with T2D (defined by the date of first reported non-insulin-dependent diabetes) to unexposed individuals matched based on body mass index (BMI), age, and sex.
The study involved 23,750 participants with newly diagnosed T2D and 71,123 matched controls. Over a median follow-up period of five years, 2,431 new primary cancers were reported among T2D participants, compared to 5,184 cases among the control group.
The analysis revealed that new-onset T2D was associated with a 48 per cent increased risk of obesity-related cancers in men and a 24 per cent increased risk in women—an effect independent of BMI. However, the study found no association between T2D and certain site-specific cancers, such as endometrial cancer and post-menopausal breast cancer in women.
Positive associations were observed for specific cancers. New-onset T2D increased the risk of bowel cancer by 27 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. The risk of pancreatic cancer rose by 74 per cent in men and nearly doubled in women. For liver cancer, new-onset T2D was linked to a near quadrupling of risk in men and a nearly five-fold increase in women.
“At this stage, we are unsure whether these differences in men and women are due to a sex-dependent biological pathway—such as hormone levels, insulin sensitivity, or body fat composition—or if they are simply the result of variations in the number of cancers found in men and women within the UK Biobank by chance,” the study authors noted.

Title: Miami Open: Tiafoe, Berrettini make winning starts; Rublev bows out
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:30:44 +0000
Content: Playing in his 100th ATP Masters 1000 match, Frances Tiafoe earned his 50th win at the prestigious level with a 7-5, 7-6(5) win against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
The 27-year-old earned his first Top 40 win since beating Daniil Medvedev at Laver Cup last September by improving to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head-to-Head series with Davidovich Fokina, avenging a defeat to the Spaniard last month in Acapulco, ATP reports.
Wins like that are big for me,” said Tiafoe, who saved all four break points he faced after dropping serve in the opening game. “Any win right now is big for me, but especially the way I played. I was super aggressive, so I’m really happy with it.”
Tiafoe will next meet 17th seed Arthur Fils, who led lucky loser Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 2-3 before the Canadian retired with an ankle injury.
Andrey Rublev, on the other hand, became the latest upset victim with Belgium’s Zizou Bergs knocking him out 7-5, 6-4. The 25-year-old Bergs earned his first Top 20 win by beating the No. 9 in the ATP Rankings to advance to his first ATP Masters 1000 third round.
Bergs will seek to score another upset against Matteo Berrettini in the third round, after the Italian opened his Miami campaign with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against Hugo Gaston.
In a rematch of the 2024 Kitzbuhel final, the 29th-seeded Berrettini beat lucky loser Gaston with a dominant serving performance.
Meanwhile, the 18-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca became the youngest player to reach round three at ATP Masters 1000 since Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in 2021.
Fonseca delivered a five-star display to defeat 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 and reach the third round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time in his fledgling career.
Due to a last-minute schedule change, Fonseca and Humbert’s second-round clash was relocated from Grandstand to Stadium.
Fonseca has enjoyed a rapid rise at the start of the 2025 season. He claimed his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and is now up to a new career-high No. 58 in the ATP Live Rankings.

Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:48:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid homage to revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, and Sukhdev Thapar on their death anniversary, observed as Shaheed Diwas or Martyrs’ Day.
The three freedom fighters were executed by the British on March 23, 1931, for their unwavering fight against colonial rule.
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Today, our nation remembers the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev. Their fearless pursuit of freedom and justice continues to inspire us all.”
In a video message, he highlighted their immense contribution to India’s independence struggle, recalling an incident from Bhagat Singh’s childhood.
“Taking oath on this soil, our heroes fought for freedom. In this soil, a hundred years ago, a small child was sowing wood. When his father asked what he was sowing, he replied that he was sowing guns. The father asked what he would do with them, and the child said he would use them to free his country. That brave child was none other than Shaheed Bhagat Singh,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi further stated that even after so many years, the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev remains deeply ingrained in the hearts of every Indian child.
Quoting a Hindu shloka, he said, “‘Neither weapons can cut him, nor fire can burn him.’ Such are the people who sacrifice their lives for the nation. On Shaheed Diwas, I pay tribute on behalf of the grateful nation to all the brave men and women who sacrificed everything for the country.”
March 23, though a solemn day in Indian history, serves as a reminder of the courage and sacrifice of India’s freedom fighters. It stands as a tribute to all those who laid down their lives in the pursuit of independence, inspiring generations to cherish and uphold the hard-won freedom of the nation.

Title: Centre disburses ₹14,020 crore incentive under PLI scheme; industry welcomes move
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:45:42 +0000
Content: The industry has welcomed the central government’s commitment to bolstering India’s manufacturing sector following the disbursement of ₹14,020 crore under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The scheme, spread across multiple sectors, has resulted in cumulative sales of ₹14 lakh crore so far.
According to data compiled by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, incentives worth ₹14,020 crore have been disbursed under the PLI schemes in 10 sectors, including large-scale electronics manufacturing, IT hardware, bulk drugs, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, telecom products, food processing, white goods, automobiles, and drones.
The PLI schemes, designed in line with India’s vision of achieving self-reliance (‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’), cover 14 key sectors and have attracted investments worth ₹1.6 lakh crore.
Commenting on the development, Ashok Chandak, President of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), said, “This initiative is a major step toward job creation, expansion of India’s manufacturing ecosystem, and boosting exports, particularly in electronics and semiconductors. Going forward, we expect accelerated growth in the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector, fostering innovation, strengthening supply chains, and positioning India as a global hub for high-value electronics production.”
He further noted that the current momentum, supported by initiatives such as the upcoming Semicon India Programme V2.0 and the PLI scheme for electronic components, would help achieve a targeted $500 billion electronics market and meet the projected $103 billion semiconductor demand with significant value addition.
The PLI schemes have incentivized domestic manufacturing, leading to increased production, job creation, and higher exports. They have also drawn significant investments from both domestic and foreign companies.
To date, 764 applications have been approved under the PLI schemes for the 14 sectors, with 176 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) among the beneficiaries. These include sectors such as bulk drugs, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, telecom, white goods, food processing, textiles, and drones, according to an official statement.
As of November 2024, actual investments of around ₹1.61 lakh crore ($18.72 billion) have been reported. This has generated production worth approximately ₹14 lakh crore ($162.84 billion) against the target of ₹15.52 lakh crore up to FY 2024-25. The scheme has also created employment for over 11.5 lakh individuals, both directly and indirectly.
The PLI schemes have helped transform India’s export basket, shifting from traditional commodities to high value-added products such as electronics, telecommunications goods, and processed food products. Exports under the scheme have exceeded ₹5.31 lakh crore ($61.76 billion), with significant contributions from sectors like large-scale electronics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and telecom and networking products.
Individual cases under the PLI scheme have been approved transparently over time. Projects typically require 2 to 3 years for implementation, depending on the manufacturing sector, and incentive claims are generally submitted after the first year of production. As a result, many projects are still at the implementation stage and will be filing claims in the coming period.

Title: Djokovic says reclaiming top ranking, not his goal anymore
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:43:33 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic said chasing the world number one ranking is not his main objective anymore and the 24-times Grand Slam champion will happily take major tournament victories over the top spot in the twilight of his glittering career.
Djokovic has spent more than 400 weeks at number one and now sits fifth in the rankings, but the 37-year-old showed he cannot be written off and earned a record 411th ATP Masters 1000 match win on Sunday.
A 6-1 7-6(1) third-round victory over Argentine lucky Camilo Ugo Carabelli at the Miami Open also put Djokovic a step closer to his 100th singles title and the Serbian said the top ranking did not matter as much.
“If it comes as a consequence of great results and titles that I win in a season, then that’s amazing. But that’s not my objective,” Djokovic told reporters.
“My objective is to be able to play my best tennis at the Grand Slams and the tournaments where I participate. My schedule is revised, so obviously I’m not chasing ranking points.
“It’s different nowadays, maybe, from what it was a few years back (or) for most of my career, to be honest. I’m happy to win a Grand Slam and a big tournament rather than getting to number one. Right now that’s more important for me.”
Jimmy Connors with 109 and Roger Federer with 103 are the only men with more titles than Djokovic but he said climbing to the top of the list could be difficult.
“It would definitely be amazing to get to that record,” Djokovic added. “Connors is someone that I truly admire and respect. He’s always very supportive of me in public, I’m thankful for that. It would be amazing.
“But again, it’s probably more difficult to achieve that nowadays for me than maybe it was some years ago. I’ll go step by step. I’ll see. I don’t know how long I’m going to compete for. But I’m still enjoying myself when I play well.”

Title: India observes World Tuberculosis Day with renewed commitment to eradication by 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:37:03 +0000
Content: India marked World Tuberculosis (TB) Day on March 24, reaffirming its commitment to eliminating the deadly disease by 2025. The day aims to raise awareness about the global health threat posed by TB, which primarily affects the lungs and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or spits.
In her message on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day, the President of India, Droupadi Murmu commended the National TB Elimination Programme and its efforts to raise awareness through public participation. She emphasized the theme for this year, “Yes, We Can End TB: Commit, Invest, Deliver,” calling for a united global effort to eradicate the disease. “Our united efforts to end TB and awareness campaigns have led to a significant reduction in TB cases in the country over the past decade. I urge all stakeholders to work collectively to make India TB-free,” she said.
Union Health Minister JP Nadda also highlighted the progress made by India in combating TB, stating that the government has made remarkable strides toward eliminating the world’s deadliest infectious disease. “Our government has made notable progress through the National TB Elimination Programme, and we are committed to achieving our goal of eliminating TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global target,” Nadda said in a statement.
India has witnessed a 17.7% decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2023, surpassing the global average reduction of 8.3%, according to the WHO Global TB Report 2024. Additionally, TB-related deaths in the country have dropped by 21.4% during the same period.
To intensify efforts, the government launched the India 100 Days TB Elimination Campaign in December, focusing on high-burden districts. The campaign has detected over five lakh TB patients across 347 high-priority districts in 33 states and union territories. To further support TB patients, the government has increased the financial assistance under the Nikshya Poshan Yojana from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 per month to ensure adequate nutrition during treatment.
India continues to lead the fight against TB, which remains a significant health challenge, accounting for 26% of global TB cases and 29% of global TB-related deaths. As the nation works toward a TB-free future, Nadda extended his gratitude to healthcare workers for their dedication and urged all citizens to join efforts in creating a “#TBMuktBharat” for better health outcomes.
“Together, we can eliminate TB and improve health for all,” Nadda concluded.

Title: Nanotechnology breakthrough may boost treatment for aggressive breast cancer: Study
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:26:18 +0000
Content: Researchers in Australia are developing next-generation nanoparticles to enhance current treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of the disease.
The researchers are designing innovative iron-based nanoparticles, or “nano-adjuvants,” which are small enough to fit thousands on a single strand of hair, to strengthen the body’s immune response against TNBC, according to the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) on Monday, Xinhua news agency reported.
Unlike other breast cancers, TNBC lacks the proteins targeted by some conventional treatments, making effective therapy a significant challenge, according to Prof. Yu Chengzhong from the AIBN.
“Despite the promise of immunotherapy, its effectiveness against triple-negative breast cancer is extremely limited, leaving too many women without options — and that’s what our research is trying to change,” Yu said.
The nanoparticles are designed to enhance the activity of T-cells, the white blood cells used by the immune system to fight disease, within the tumor microenvironment, improving the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells, according to Yu.
Supported by a 3 million Australian dollar ($1.89 million) National Health and Medical Research Council grant, the five-year research project aims to bridge a critical treatment gap and could pave the way for clinical applications, not only for TNBC but also for other hard-to-treat cancers like ovarian cancer.
With over two decades of experience in nanotechnology and nanomedicine, Yu hopes this breakthrough will transform cancer treatment by making immunotherapy more effective for patients with aggressive solid tumors.
“This research will push the boundaries of science to find innovative treatments that change the way we fight this cancer, offering hope for women facing devastating outcomes,” said AIBN Director Alan Rowan.

Title: Who is Han Duck-soo, South Korea’s PM who returns as acting president?
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:11:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated on Monday as South Korea’s acting president, is a technocrat whose experience and reputation as a safe pair of hands transcended party lines and helped him serve in senior posts under five presidents.
Known as a seasoned economic, trade and foreign affairs specialist, Han, 75, was serving the second stint as the head of cabinet, when he became acting president on December 14 after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached by parliament for leading a short-lived martial law.
Two weeks later, Han himself was impeached after being accused of aiding Yoon in the martial law declaration and his powers suspended. He denied this but accepted some responsibility for the ensuing crisis by failing to dissuade Yoon from making the surprise move.
On Monday, the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment, restoring his powers to serve as leader while the country awaits the same court’s ruling on Yoon’s impeachment.
In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han has been a rare example of an official who has sought to stay out of the political fray.
“It is my life’s honour that I have been able to serve the people with all my might,” Han said after parliament voted to impeach him.
Earlier, when he stepped into the acting presidency, he faced the challenge of keeping government functioning through its gravest political crisis in four decades, while also tackling threats from nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea, and a slowing economy at home.
It is the same daunting responsibility he returns to but with external pressure on the export-reliant economy much more intense under the threat of higher tariffs for its products to the United States under the second Donald Trump presidency.
Han has served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.
His roles have ranged from prime minister, finance minister and trade minister to presidential secretary for policy co-ordination, besides being ambassador to the United States and the OECD and heading up think-tanks and organisations.
With a Harvard doctorate in economics, Han’s expertise in the economy, trade and diplomacy as well as a reputation for rationality, a moderate demeanour and hard work had made him a regular go-to man in South Korean politics.
Han has been prime minister since Yoon’s term began in 2022, his second time in the role after a stint under former president Roh Moo-hyun in 2007-2008.
“He has served in key posts in state affairs solely through recognition of his skills and expertise, unrelated to political factions,” Yoon said when appointing Han in 2022, echoing descriptions used when previous administrations tapped him.
Han has experience working with South Korea’s key ally the United States, having been deeply involved in the process of signing the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement.
Fluent in English, he was appointed South Korea’s ambassador to the United States in 2009, working in Washington at a time when former U.S. President Joe Biden was vice president, and contributed to Congress approving the free trade deal in 2011.
“He is a civil servant through and through, who didn’t take on a political colour despite working under (five presidents),” said a former high-ranking government official speaking on condition of anonymity.
Han’s acting presidency had been expected to last for months. Now the role is likely to be brief, until the Constitutional Court delivers its ruling on whether to remove Yoon or restore his powers. The ruling is expected within days.
If Yoon is removed, a presidential election must be held in 60 days. South Korea’s constitution does not say how much the acting president is empowered to do in the role.

Title: India secures FIBA Asia Cup 2025 spot with thrilling win over Bahrain
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 04:48:02 +0000
Content: The Indian men’s basketball team clinched a hard-fought 81-77 victory over Bahrain at Khalifa Sports City on Saturday, securing their place in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025.
In a tense contest against world No. 66 Bahrain, India, ranked 81st in the FIBA men’s basketball rankings, displayed remarkable resilience to overcome a late deficit and seal the win in the final qualifying round.
India finished at the top of Group H after winning both their matches in the final phase of the FIBA Asia Cup 2025 Qualifiers. They had earlier registered a dominant 97-77 win over Iraq on Friday.
India Qualifies for 11th Consecutive FIBA Asia Cup
This round of the qualifiers featured six third-placed teams from the previous stage, competing for the last four spots in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025, which will be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from August 5 to 17.
The teams were divided into two groups, with the top two from each group earning qualification. India’s back-to-back wins secured them the Group H title, while Iraq and Bahrain will battle for the second qualification spot on Sunday.
Harsh Dagar Shines as India Edges Bahrain in a Nail-Biter
Against Bahrain, Harsh Dagar emerged as the standout performer, leading India with a game-high 28 points. He was in sublime form from beyond the arc, shooting an impressive 6-of-8 while also contributing three rebounds, three assists, and two steals.
Kanwar Sandhu added 15 points, while Pranav Prince and Muin Bek Hafeez chipped in with 11 points and eight rebounds each. The duo also combined for eight assists.
India started strong, with Dagar setting the tone early from long range. They controlled the game for most of the contest and entered the fourth quarter with a 62-53 lead. However, hosts Bahrain staged a spirited comeback, led by Subah Azzam, to take a 77-75 advantage with under two minutes remaining.
Krishnan Delivers in the Clutch
With the game on the line, Arvind Krishnan stepped up in the clutch, curling off a screen to drain a crucial three-pointer from the left wing, putting India back in front at 78-77 with 1:39 remaining.
Although Krishnan momentarily lost possession with a turnover, he quickly made amends by snatching a vital steal from Wayne Chism. Moments later, Hafeez split a pair of free throws to extend India’s lead to two points.
Bahrain had one final opportunity, but Prince forced a crucial turnover, intercepting Mosti Rashed’s inbound pass intended for Mohammed Ameer. With just 11 seconds left on the clock, India regained possession, leaving the hosts with little room for a comeback.
Bahrain resorted to fouling in a desperate attempt to prolong the game, but Krishnan calmly sank both free throws to seal India’s 11th consecutive FIBA Asia Cup qualification, a streak that dates back to 2001.
Road to the FIBA World Cup 2027
India’s victory over Bahrain not only secured their place in the FIBA Asia Cup 2025 but also earned them a spot in the FIBA World Cup 2027 Qualifiers, marking another major milestone for Indian basketball.

Title: HM Amit Shah, DoNER Minister Scindia greet Assam Rifles on their Raising Day
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:28:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah, DoNER Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, and the Governors and Chief Ministers of several northeastern states have extended their heartfelt greetings to the Assam Rifles personnel and their families on the occasion of their 190th Raising Day on Monday.
Headquartered in Shillong, the Assam Rifles, which came into existence in 1835, is currently guarding the 1,643-km unfenced border with Myanmar along the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Manipur (398 km), Nagaland (215 km), and Mizoram (510 km).
Besides guarding the India-Myanmar border, a huge contingent of the paramilitary force is deployed in the northeastern states, Jammu and Kashmir, and a few other states across the country.
The Union Home Minister said in a post on his X handle: “Greetings to our brave sentinels of the Northeast, the Assam Rifles personnel, and their families on their Raising Day. The force has knocked off the challenges to the security of the northeast with their valour and won hearts through their humanitarian assistance to the people. Salute to the warriors of the Assam Rifles who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.”
Greeting the Assam Rifles, Union Minister of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Jyotiraditya Scindia in a post on X said: “Honouring the unwavering courage & dedication of the Assam Rifles on their Raising Day. They have stood as the guardians of the Northeast for decades, ensuring security with unmatched valour while also fostering deep bonds with the people through their relentless service. My heartfelt tribute to the brave warriors for their sacrifice in service to the nation.”
Governors of the northeastern states and the Chief Ministers of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, along with Arunachal Pradesh Home Minister Mama Natung and Union Minister for Parliamentary and Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju, greeted the Assam Rifles personnel and their families on the occasion of their 190th Raising Day on Monday.
The Assam Rifles is one of the oldest and most decorated paramilitary forces in India. Often nicknamed the “Sentinels of the Northeast” or “Friends of the Hill People,” the force plays a crucial role in maintaining security in India’s northeastern states, guarding the Indo-Myanmar border, and conducting counter-insurgency operations. It is directly administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs while operational control rests with the Indian Army.

Title: Renewable growth surges as global fuel demand rises
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:55 +0000
Content: Global energy demand grew at an above-average pace in 2024 as electricity consumption increased worldwide — with the increased supply of renewables and natural gas covering the majority of additional energy needs, a new IEA report said on Monday.
The latest edition of the IEA’s Global Energy Review is the first global assessment of 2024 trends across the energy sector.
Based on the most recent data, it covers energy demand, supply, the uptake of new energy technologies, and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
The report finds that global energy demand rose by 2.2 per cent last year — lower than GDP growth of 3.2 per cent but considerably faster than the average annual demand increase of 1.3 per cent between 2013 and 2023. Emerging and developing economies accounted for over 80 per cent of the increase in global energy demand in 2024. This occurred despite slower growth in China, where energy consumption increased by less than three per cent—half the rate of 2023 and well below the country’s recent annual average.
After several years of decline, advanced economies returned to growth, with their energy demand rising by nearly one per cent overall.
The acceleration in global energy demand growth in 2024 was led by the power sector, with global electricity consumption surging by nearly 1,100 terawatt-hours or 4.3 per cent. This was nearly double the annual average over the past decade. The sharp increase in the world’s electricity use last year was driven by record global temperatures, which boosted demand for cooling in many countries, as well as by rising consumption from industry, the electrification of transport, and the growth of data centres and artificial intelligence.
The expanding supply of low-emissions sources covered most of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024. The amount of new renewable power capacity installed worldwide rose to around 700 gigawatts, setting a new annual record for the 22nd consecutive year.
Nuclear power capacity additions reached their fifth-highest level in the past three decades. As a result, 80 per cent of the increase in global electricity generation in 2024 was provided by renewable sources and nuclear, which together contributed 40 per cent of total generation for the first time. The supply of natural gas-fired generation also increased steadily to cover rising electricity demand.
“There are many uncertainties in the world today and different narratives about energy — but this new data-driven IEA report puts some clear facts on the table about what is happening globally,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.
“What is certain is that electricity use is growing rapidly, pulling overall energy demand along with it to such an extent that it is enough to reverse years of declining energy consumption in advanced economies. The result was that the demand for all major fuels and energy technologies increased in 2024, with renewables covering the largest share of the growth, followed by natural gas. And the strong expansion of solar, wind, nuclear power and EVs is increasingly loosening the links between economic growth and emissions,” he said.
As a result of higher power consumption, natural gas saw the strongest increase in demand among fossil fuels in 2024. Gas demand rose by 115 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 2.7 per cent, compared with an average of around 75 bcm annually over the past decade.
Meanwhile, oil demand grew more slowly, rising by 0.8 per cent in 2024. Oil’s share of total energy demand fell below 30 per cent for the first time ever, 50 years after it peaked at 46 per cent.
Electric car sales increased by more than 25 per cent last year, with EVs making up one in five cars sold worldwide. This contributed considerably to the decline in oil demand for road transport, which offset a significant proportion of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals.
Global coal demand rose by one per cent in 2024, half the rate of increase seen the previous year.
According to the report, intense heatwaves in China and India — which pushed up cooling needs — contributed more than 90 per cent of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally, highlighting the major impacts extreme weather can have on energy demand patterns.
The continued rapid adoption of clean energy technologies limited the annual rise in energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are increasingly decoupling from economic growth, according to the report.
Record temperatures contributed significantly to the annual 0.8 per cent rise in global CO2 emissions to 37.8 billion tonnes. But the deployment of solar PV, wind, nuclear, electric cars, and heat pumps since 2019 now prevents 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, the equivalent of seven per cent of global emissions.

Content: Russia and the United States will discuss resuming a deal to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea, the Kremlin said on Monday, noting that what Moscow saw as key parts of an earlier agreement on the subject were never implemented.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the “Black Sea Initiative”, more commonly known as the grain deal, was on the agenda at talks in Saudi Arabia between Russian and U.S. officials on Monday.
He said that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed discussing the Black Sea deal and that Putin had agreed to discuss it.
“This is primarily about the safety of navigation,” Peskov said, when asked what the Black Sea deal amounted to.
“But if you remember the initiative in its previous form, there was quite a large part of the obligations to our country that were not fulfilled last time. Therefore, this will also be on the agenda today.”
Turkey and the United Nations helped mediate the so-called Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal struck in July 2022 that allowed the safe export of nearly 33 million metric tons of Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea despite the war.
Russia withdrew from the agreement in 2023, complaining that its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious obstacles, though Russia is not currently facing serious problems getting its grain to market by the Black Sea.
To convince Russia to agree to the Black Sea deal, a three-year memorandum of understanding was struck in July 2022 under which U.N. officials agreed to help Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets.
While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments.
Russia wanted a resumption of its ammonia exports and the reconnection of its state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank to the SWIFT international payments system.
When asked about Trump’s remarks indicating progress on a possible settlement for Ukraine, Peskov said that Russia and the United States had a common understanding on the need to move towards a settlement to end the war in Ukraine but that there were still many different aspects that need to be worked out.
“There is indeed a common understanding here,” Peskov said.
“In general, of course, there are still a lot of different aspects related to the settlement to be worked out.”

Title: Angola to end east Congo conflict mediation role, presidency says
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:27:18 +0000
Content: Angola will step down from its position as a mediator between parties involved in an escalating Rwanda-backed rebel offensive in eastern Congo, the presidency said on Monday, with another African state set to lead efforts to get peace talks back on track.
The ethnic Tutsi-led M23 escalated their long-standing rebellion this year, seizing east Congo’s two biggest cities since January and encroaching into territory rich in minerals such as gold and tantalum.
As the current rotating African Union (AU) Chairperson, Angola’s President Joao Lourenco had been trying to mediate a lasting ceasefire and lower tensions between Congo and neighbouring Rwanda, which has been accused of backing M23. Rwanda denies this.
Congo and M23 were scheduled to hold direct talks for the first time in Angola’s capital Luanda last week after Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi, who had long refused dialogue with the rebels, agreed to send a delegation.
M23 pulled out at the last minute, following European Union sanctions against M23 and Rwandan officials.
“Angola considers the need to free itself from the responsibility of the mediator of this conflict” to “devote itself more” to the AU’s overall priorities, the presidency said in a statement that mentioned the “aborted” meeting in Luanda.
Another head of state will be appointed to the task in coming days, the statement said.
There have been several attempts to resolve the conflict, rooted in the fallout from Rwanda’s 1994 genocide and competition for mineral riches, including several ceasefires that were violated, international condemnations, sanctions and regional summits.
The regional blocs of southern and eastern Africa will hold a second joint summit on Monday to address the crisis. Kenya’s President William Ruto and his Zimbabwean counterpart Emmerson Mnangagwa will co-chair the virtual event.
M23 last week dismissed a joint call for an immediate ceasefire by Congo and Rwanda and reiterated demands for direct talks with Kinshasa, saying it was the only way to resolve the conflict.
The rebel group said over the weekend that it would withdraw forces from the seized town of Walikale in support of peace efforts.
In response, Congo’s army said it would observe the announced withdrawal and refrain from any offensives against enemy forces to encourage de-escalation.
A civil society source and a resident in Walikale said on Monday that M23 were still in the town.

Title: Stock markets extend rally to sixth day; Sensex over 1,000 points
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:30:56 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets continued their winning streak for the sixth consecutive session on Monday, with both Sensex and Nifty registering strong gains.
Investor sentiment remained upbeat as key indices surged over 1 per cent each during intra-day trade. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 1,078.87 points, or 1.40 per cent, to settle at 77,984.38. It touched an intra-day high of 78,107.23.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty ended 307.95 points higher, or 1.32 per cent, at 23,658.35, after hitting an intra-day peak of 23,708.75.
The market rally was broad-based, with 24 out of 30 Sensex stocks closing in the green. NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Tech Mahindra, and Power Grid Corporation were among the top gainers, rising up to 4.63 per cent.
Meanwhile, Nestle India, Bharti Airtel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Zomato, IndusInd Bank, and Titan saw marginal losses, falling up to 2.73 per cent.
The broader market also saw positive traction, as the Nifty Midcap100 and Smallcap100 indices gained over 1 per cent each.
Banking stocks led the rally, with PSU banks outperforming. The Nifty PSU Bank index surged 3.18 per cent, while Bank Nifty and the Nifty Private Bank index also advanced over 2 per cent.
Sectors such as capital goods, oil & gas, power, realty, and telecom posted gains between 1-2 per cent. Except for the Nifty Media index, all sectoral indices on the NSE closed in positive territory.
“With every sector closing positively and banking stocks leading the charge, the market’s bullish momentum remains intact,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity.
He added, “Investors are now awaiting further cues to assess if this rally has more steam left.”
On Friday, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) recorded a net inflow of ₹7,470 crore, bolstering market confidence. FIIs also increased their long positions in index futures, with the long-short ratio improving to 31.8 per cent, signaling a gradual shift towards optimism — a key factor supporting today’s rally.
The Indian rupee also showed strength, appreciating by 34 paise to close at 85.63 per US dollar, compared to Friday’s close of 85.97.
According to Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura Securities, the rupee’s gains are backed by favourable domestic factors and supportive RBI policies.

Title: Delhi Assembly goes paperless with Budget App, iPads for MLAs
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:13:43 +0000
Content: The Delhi Assembly took a step towards digital efficiency on Monday, providing iPads to legislators and making Budget 2025-26 documents accessible through the Delhi Budget application.
“I wish to inform all members that all documents related to the Budget will be made available on the Delhi Budget App. For this, all members will be provided new iPads, which can be collected during the lunch break,” Speaker Vijendra Gupta said.
The announcement was met with applause from the members, who welcomed the initiative.
Speaker Gupta further said that MLAs could access the Budget documents by clicking on the Budget App, which is also available for download on the Play Store for smartphones.
Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta also tabled a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on the financial performance of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) for 2024. Copies of the report were distributed to members for discussion in the House.
The CAG report highlighted the mounting financial losses of the DTC, which has been offering free rides to women for the past decade while struggling to phase out ageing and polluting vehicles in favor of electric buses.
According to the report, the DTC’s losses surged by ₹35,000 crore, rising from ₹25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly ₹60,750 crore in 2021-22.
The audit also pointed to the corporation’s failure to curb financial losses, achieve profitability, and modernize its fare collection and security infrastructure.
Key findings of the Performance Audit Report on the functioning of Delhi Transport Corporation included the absence of a Business Plan or Perspective Plan, delays in bus procurement despite an ageing fleet, low fleet utilization and productivity, inefficient route planning, a non-functional Automatic Fare Collection System, and non-recovery of dues.
Regarding fleet depletion, the report noted that between 2015 and 2023, the DTC’s fleet reduced from 4,344 buses in 2015-16 to 3,937 buses in 2022-23.
The corporation procured only 300 electric buses in 2021-22 and 2022-23, despite available funding from the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. There were delays in adding electric buses to the fleet, and a penalty amounting to ₹29.86 crore for delayed delivery was not imposed on the operators.
It further highlighted that the number of low-floor overage buses increased significantly over the years. The proportion of overage buses rose from 0.13 percent, or five buses, in 2015-16 to 17.44 percent, or 656 buses, in 2021-22. This number further increased to 44.96 percent, or 1,770 buses, by March 31, 2023. The report warned that this figure will continue to rise unless the corporation takes urgent steps to procure new buses.
The CAG’s critical observations come at a time when Delhi Transport Minister Pankaj Singh has announced the phased introduction of 2,000 electric buses in the city, starting April 1.
Criticizing the previous AAP government’s mismanagement, Singh vowed to make the DTC profitable and reverse the public transporter’s current losses of ₹235 crore.

Title: Cashless India: ₹1,500 crore incentive scheme for low-value BHIM-UPI transactions
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:07:12 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet has approved a ₹1,500 crore incentive scheme for the financial year 2024-25 to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions and encourage digital payments among small merchants. The initiative aims to strengthen India’s digital payment ecosystem by ensuring zero Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on UPI transactions and providing a 0.15% incentive for transactions up to ₹2,000 made to small merchants. 
With a focus on expanding UPI infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas, the scheme incorporates tools such as UPI 123PAY, Lite, and LiteX. According to the ACI Worldwide Report 2024, India accounted for 49% of all global real-time transactions in 2023, reinforcing its position as a global leader in digital payment innovation. 
Chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union Cabinet approved the Incentive Scheme for Promotion of Low-Value BHIM-UPI Transactions (Person to Merchant – P2M) for the financial year 2024-25. This initiative aligns with the government’s vision of boosting digital transactions, encouraging small merchants to adopt UPI, and promoting financial inclusion. 
Digital payments have become a crucial component of the government’s financial inclusion strategy, offering citizens a range of secure and accessible payment options. The cost of digital payment services, typically recovered through the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), is a fee paid by businesses to payment processing companies for debit or credit card transactions. 
The Reserve Bank of India has set an MDR of up to 0.90% on all debit card networks, while the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has capped MDR at 0.30% for UPI P2M transactions. Since January 2020, to incentivize digital payments, MDR has been set at zero for RuPay Debit Card and BHIM-UPI transactions through amendments to the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, and the Income-tax Act, 1961. 
To support payment ecosystem participants in delivering seamless services, the government has implemented the Incentive Scheme for the Promotion of RuPay Debit Cards and Low-Value BHIM-UPI Transactions (P2M), with the approved incentive amount being distributed among acquiring banks, issuer banks, payment service provider banks, and app providers. 
The scheme will be implemented with an estimated outlay of ₹1,500 crore from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. It will exclusively cover UPI transactions up to ₹2,000, specifically targeting small merchants to encourage digital payment adoption at the grassroots level. 
Over recent years, UPI transactions have grown significantly, with the total transaction value increasing from ₹21.3 lakh crore in FY 2019-20 to ₹213.8 lakh crore as of January 2025. Person to Merchant (P2M) transactions have also expanded, reaching ₹59.3 lakh crore, indicating a steady rise in digital payment adoption. 
The scheme seeks to promote the BHIM-UPI platform by aiming for ₹20,000 crore in transaction volume during FY 2024-25. It also aims to strengthen the payment infrastructure by ensuring high uptime, reducing technical failures, and extending UPI services to remote areas, including tier 3 to tier 6 cities. The expansion will be facilitated through UPI 123PAY for feature phones and UPI Lite and LiteX for offline payments. 
Under the approved framework, incentives will be structured based on the merchant category and transaction value. Small merchants processing UPI transactions up to ₹2,000 will continue to enjoy zero MDR while receiving a 0.15% incentive on the transaction amount. Transactions above ₹2,000 will remain exempt from MDR but will not be eligible for incentives. Large merchants will also have zero MDR but will not qualify for incentives, regardless of transaction value. 
The reimbursement mechanism ensures that 80% of the admitted claim amount by acquiring banks will be disbursed unconditionally each quarter. The remaining 20% will be disbursed based on performance benchmarks, with 10% contingent on an acquiring bank maintaining a technical decline rate of less than 0.75% and the other 10% tied to system uptime exceeding 99.5%. 
For merchants, the scheme offers multiple advantages, including convenience, speed, and access to digital credit. With no extra charges for digital transactions, small businesses are encouraged to accept UPI payments, fostering a less-cash economy with formalized and accountable transactions. Ensuring high uptime and low failure rates guarantees reliable, round-the-clock digital payment services.

Title: Indian Navy to participate in multilateral maritime exercise with African nations
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:41:54 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy is set to participate in a large-scale multilateral maritime engagement exercise with African nations, titled ‘Africa-India Key Maritime Engagement’ (AIKEYME). Meaning ‘Unity’ in Sanskrit, AIKEYME aims to enhance interoperability between the navies and maritime agencies of participating countries.
According to the Indian Navy, the maiden edition of this exercise is being co-hosted by the Indian Navy and the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF). The event will be conducted in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, and is scheduled to be inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in mid-April 2025.
The exercise will span six days and will feature participation from eight nations, including Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa, in addition to the co-hosts, India and Tanzania.
The Harbour Phase of the exercise will include Tabletop and Command Post exercises focused on piracy and information sharing, along with training sessions on seamanship and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) operations.
The Sea Phase will feature seamanship evolutions, search and rescue (SAR) drills, VBSS exercises, small arms firing, and helicopter operations, officials added.
The Indian Navy emphasized the importance of maritime security for both India and Africa, reaffirming their commitment to combating security threats such as piracy, illegal trafficking, and unregulated and unreported fishing through enhanced information sharing and surveillance mechanisms.
Over the past decade, the Indian Navy has deepened partnerships with maritime agencies across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to bolster regional maritime security. This is in line with the Government of India’s (GoI) vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).
The Indian Navy has been actively collaborating with IOR navies through joint exercises, coordinated patrols, information sharing, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) efforts, capacity-building initiatives, and diplomatic engagements.
As SAGAR enters its second decade, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently announced the Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security Across the Region (MAHASAGAR) initiative during his visit to Mauritius in March 2025. In line with this, the Indian Navy is launching two new initiatives: ‘IOS Sagar’ and ‘AIKEYME’, aimed at consolidating India’s role as the ‘Preferred Security Partner’ and First Responder in the Indian Ocean Region.
The Indian Ocean Ship (IOS) Sagar initiative is another step toward enhanced cooperation with IOR nations. As part of this initiative, the Indian Naval Ship (INS Sunayna) will be deployed to the southwestern Indian Ocean Region with a combined crew of Indian and nine Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs), namely Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and South Africa.
The ship will be deployed for over a month in April 2025, making port calls at Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania), Nacala (Mozambique), Port Louis (Mauritius), Port Victoria (Seychelles), and Malé (Maldives). Additionally, joint surveillance of the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Tanzania, Mozambique, Mauritius, and Seychelles will be conducted, officials stated.
The Navy further informed on Monday that personnel from FFCs would undergo a two-week training capsule at various naval professional schools in Kochi, including at-sea training sessions.
During this period, FFC personnel will be actively involved in whole-ship activities, watch-keeping duties, and operational exercises related to their respective trades. Additionally, participants of IOS Sagar are expected to witness the Harbour Phase activities of AIKEYME at Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.

Title: Trump to impose 25% tariff on countries that buy oil, gas from Venezuela
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:47:40 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela will pay a 25% tariff on any trades made with the United States.
This “secondary tariff” will take effect on April 2, Trump said in a Truth Social post. Trump said he is imposing the move because, he said, Venezuela has sent “tens of thousands” of people to the United States who have a “very violent nature.”
Earlier this month, Trump issued a 30-day wind down of a license that the U.S. had granted to Chevron since 2022 to operate in sanctioned Venezuela and export its oil, after he accused President Nicolas Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns.
China, which already has been the subject of U.S. tariffs, is the largest buyer of Venezuela’s oil, the OPEC member’s main export. In February, China received directly and indirectly some 503,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan crude and fuel, which represented 55% of total exports.
Spain, Italy, Cuba and India are other consumers of Venezuelan oil. U.S. imports of the oil are set to end in early April unless Trump extends the wind down.
There was no immediate response from Maduro’s government to a request for comment.
Trump earlier this month invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify the deportation of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua without final removal orders from immigration judges.

Title: SC Collegium recommends transfer of Justice Varma to Allahabad HC
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:42:04 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court Collegium has recommended the transfer of Justice Yashwant Varma, a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court, back to his parent court, the Allahabad High Court. The decision, taken in meetings held on March 20 and March 24, was officially announced on Monday.
In its resolution, the Collegium said, “In its meetings held on 20th and 24th March 2025, it has recommended the repatriation of Justice Yashwant Varma, Judge, High Court of Delhi, to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad.” However, this recommendation has not been without controversy, as the Allahabad High Court Bar Association has raised objections against the decision.
Justice Varma has found himself at the center of a growing controversy after reports emerged about the alleged recovery of a large stash of cash from his official residence in Delhi. According to media reports, the incident came to light when a fire broke out at his home on March 14. Firefighters responding to the emergency reportedly discovered the hidden cash while attempting to douse the flames. Justice Varma was not present at his residence when the fire occurred.
Amid growing speculation and public scrutiny, Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna constituted a three-member inquiry committee to look into the allegations. The committee comprises Justice Sheel Nagu, Chief Justice of the Punjab & Haryana High Court; Justice G.S. Sandhawalia, Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court; and Justice Anu Sivaraman, Judge of the Karnataka High Court.
Meanwhile, Delhi High Court Chief Justice Devendra Upadhyaya has been directed not to assign any judicial work to Justice Varma until further notice.
In response to the allegations, Justice Varma has strongly denied any involvement, claiming that this was a deliberate attempt to frame him and malign his reputation. He stated that neither he nor any member of his family had ever placed cash in the storeroom where it was allegedly found.
He also clarified that the room in question was an outhouse, separate from the main residence where he and his family live, further casting doubt on the allegations.
Even as the controversy continues to unfold, the Supreme Court has sought to distance the decision to transfer Justice Varma from the allegations against him. On Friday, the apex court dismissed any connection between the transfer and the alleged recovery of cash, maintaining that the repatriation decision was unrelated to the ongoing controversy.

In the forward auctions, a total of 12 coal mines were successfully auctioned, the statement added.
Since the inception of commercial coal mining in 2020, the Ministry of Coal has successfully auctioned a total of 125 coal mines, with a combined production capacity of 273.06 million tonnes per year. Once operational, these mines will play a crucial role in enhancing domestic coal production and strengthening India’s energy security. Collectively, these mines are expected to generate annual revenue of ₹38,767 crore, attract capital investment of ₹40,960 crore, and create employment opportunities for approximately 4,69,170 people.
Production from commercial coal mines has shown over 78% growth, rising from 12.55 million tonnes in FY 2023-24 to 22.35 million tonnes in FY 2024-25, the statement added.

Title: Dubai exhibition showcases India’s rich folk art traditions
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:12:06 +0000
Content: The Dubai International Art Centre is currently hosting Rang-De-Gulal, an exhibition celebrating India’s diverse folk art traditions. Organized by the Indian Folk Art Corridor, the event features 24 Indian artists, providing a global platform for traditional art forms deeply rooted in the country’s cultural heritage.
The exhibition presents a variety of regional styles, each with its own distinct storytelling and visual elements. Among them is Theyyam art from Kerala, a dynamic ritualistic tradition known for its elaborate face painting, striking costumes, and bold use of red, orange, and gold—symbolizing energy and transformation. Kerala’s mural paintings, which often depict intricate scenes of Hindu deities, are also prominently displayed. A unique piece within this genre captures both Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, two classical dance forms of Kerala, blending them into a single composition in the traditional mural style.
From Rajasthan, Phad art, a storytelling scroll painting tradition, visually narrates epic tales. One particular work illustrates the Hanuman Chalisa with Aarti, bringing to life key episodes of Lord Hanuman’s divine feats through intricate details and vibrant colors. Also from Rajasthan, Kishangarh art pays homage to Holi, depicting Radha and Krishna in a lively celebration of colors.
Gujarat’s Lippan art, a traditional mud-relief craft known for its use of mirror inlays, is represented through a stunning depiction of the Tree of Life. The artwork symbolizes nature’s interconnectedness with spirituality and cultural heritage, highlighting the eternal cycle of life, growth, and renewal. Meanwhile, Madhubani (Mithila) art from Bihar, recognized for its geometric patterns and mythological themes, adds to the exhibition’s diversity, as does Bengal’s Kalighat painting.
The exhibition also includes Buddha paintings, where the spiritual leader is portrayed in a tranquil meditative posture, radiating inner peace and enlightenment. Complementing the visual experience, Gond art from Central India features intricate depictions of nature and folklore, while Dot Mandala artworks use colorful dots to create symmetrical, meditative designs.
The exhibition underscores the strengthening cultural ties between India and the UAE, highlighting Dubai’s role as a thriving hub for artistic exchange. By offering Indian folk artists an international stage, the event fosters cross-cultural appreciation and economic opportunities, reinforcing the shared artistic heritage between the two nations. The Indian Folk Art Corridor, founded by Indian artist and curator Smt. Vidisha Pandey, leads this initiative, aiming to promote India’s traditional arts globally and ensure their preservation for future generations.

Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:28:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah, DoNER Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, and the Governors and Chief Ministers of several northeastern states have extended their heartfelt greetings to the Assam Rifles personnel and their families on the occasion of their 190th Raising Day on Monday.
Headquartered in Shillong, the Assam Rifles, which came into existence in 1835, is currently guarding the 1,643-km unfenced border with Myanmar along the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Manipur (398 km), Nagaland (215 km), and Mizoram (510 km).
Besides guarding the India-Myanmar border, a huge contingent of the paramilitary force is deployed in the northeastern states, Jammu and Kashmir, and a few other states across the country.
The Union Home Minister said in a post on his X handle: “Greetings to our brave sentinels of the Northeast, the Assam Rifles personnel, and their families on their Raising Day. The force has knocked off the challenges to the security of the northeast with their valour and won hearts through their humanitarian assistance to the people. Salute to the warriors of the Assam Rifles who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.”
Greeting the Assam Rifles, Union Minister of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Jyotiraditya Scindia in a post on X said: “Honouring the unwavering courage & dedication of the Assam Rifles on their Raising Day. They have stood as the guardians of the Northeast for decades, ensuring security with unmatched valour while also fostering deep bonds with the people through their relentless service. My heartfelt tribute to the brave warriors for their sacrifice in service to the nation.”
Governors of the northeastern states and the Chief Ministers of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, along with Arunachal Pradesh Home Minister Mama Natung and Union Minister for Parliamentary and Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju, greeted the Assam Rifles personnel and their families on the occasion of their 190th Raising Day on Monday.
The Assam Rifles is one of the oldest and most decorated paramilitary forces in India. Often nicknamed the “Sentinels of the Northeast” or “Friends of the Hill People,” the force plays a crucial role in maintaining security in India’s northeastern states, guarding the Indo-Myanmar border, and conducting counter-insurgency operations. It is directly administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs while operational control rests with the Indian Army.

Title: Govt increases salaries, allowances, and pensions of MPs
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:14:19 +0000
Content: The Centre has increased the salaries, allowances, and pensions of Members of Parliament (MPs), effective April 1, 2023, according to a gazette notification issued by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on Monday.
The salary of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members has been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.24 lakh per month, while the daily allowance has risen from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500, according to the notification.
The pension paid to former MPs has also been increased to Rs 31,000 per month from Rs 25,000, as per the notification.
The additional pension for each year of service beyond five years has been increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500, as per the notification.
The revision of MPs’ salaries, allowances, and pensions was announced during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament. The previous revision of salaries and allowances for sitting and former MPs was announced in April 2018.
The 2018 revision set an MP’s base pay at Rs 1,00,000 per month to align with inflation and the rising cost of living.
According to the 2018 revision, MPs receive an allowance of Rs 70,000 as a constituency allowance to cover the costs of maintaining their offices and engaging with voters in their respective districts. Apart from this, they receive Rs 60,000 per month as an office allowance and Rs 2,000 as a daily allowance during Parliamentary sessions. These allowances will also be increased now.
In addition, MPs receive an annual allowance for phone and internet usage. They enjoy 34 free domestic flights per year for themselves and their families, as well as first-class train travel at any time for professional and personal use. They can also claim a mileage allowance for road travel. MPs are further entitled to 50,000 free units of electricity and 4,000 kilolitres of water annually.
The government also provides for their housing and accommodation. During their five-year term, MPs are provided with rent-free housing in New Delhi. They may be allocated hostel rooms, apartments, or bungalows based on seniority. Individuals who choose not to utilize official accommodations are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance.

Title: Renewable growth surges as global fuel demand rises
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:55 +0000
Content: Global energy demand grew at an above-average pace in 2024 as electricity consumption increased worldwide — with the increased supply of renewables and natural gas covering the majority of additional energy needs, a new IEA report said on Monday.
The latest edition of the IEA’s Global Energy Review is the first global assessment of 2024 trends across the energy sector.
Based on the most recent data, it covers energy demand, supply, the uptake of new energy technologies, and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
The report finds that global energy demand rose by 2.2 per cent last year — lower than GDP growth of 3.2 per cent but considerably faster than the average annual demand increase of 1.3 per cent between 2013 and 2023. Emerging and developing economies accounted for over 80 per cent of the increase in global energy demand in 2024. This occurred despite slower growth in China, where energy consumption increased by less than three per cent—half the rate of 2023 and well below the country’s recent annual average.
After several years of decline, advanced economies returned to growth, with their energy demand rising by nearly one per cent overall.
The acceleration in global energy demand growth in 2024 was led by the power sector, with global electricity consumption surging by nearly 1,100 terawatt-hours or 4.3 per cent. This was nearly double the annual average over the past decade. The sharp increase in the world’s electricity use last year was driven by record global temperatures, which boosted demand for cooling in many countries, as well as by rising consumption from industry, the electrification of transport, and the growth of data centres and artificial intelligence.
The expanding supply of low-emissions sources covered most of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024. The amount of new renewable power capacity installed worldwide rose to around 700 gigawatts, setting a new annual record for the 22nd consecutive year.
Nuclear power capacity additions reached their fifth-highest level in the past three decades. As a result, 80 per cent of the increase in global electricity generation in 2024 was provided by renewable sources and nuclear, which together contributed 40 per cent of total generation for the first time. The supply of natural gas-fired generation also increased steadily to cover rising electricity demand.
“There are many uncertainties in the world today and different narratives about energy — but this new data-driven IEA report puts some clear facts on the table about what is happening globally,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.
“What is certain is that electricity use is growing rapidly, pulling overall energy demand along with it to such an extent that it is enough to reverse years of declining energy consumption in advanced economies. The result was that the demand for all major fuels and energy technologies increased in 2024, with renewables covering the largest share of the growth, followed by natural gas. And the strong expansion of solar, wind, nuclear power and EVs is increasingly loosening the links between economic growth and emissions,” he said.
As a result of higher power consumption, natural gas saw the strongest increase in demand among fossil fuels in 2024. Gas demand rose by 115 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 2.7 per cent, compared with an average of around 75 bcm annually over the past decade.
Meanwhile, oil demand grew more slowly, rising by 0.8 per cent in 2024. Oil’s share of total energy demand fell below 30 per cent for the first time ever, 50 years after it peaked at 46 per cent.
Electric car sales increased by more than 25 per cent last year, with EVs making up one in five cars sold worldwide. This contributed considerably to the decline in oil demand for road transport, which offset a significant proportion of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals.
Global coal demand rose by one per cent in 2024, half the rate of increase seen the previous year.
According to the report, intense heatwaves in China and India — which pushed up cooling needs — contributed more than 90 per cent of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally, highlighting the major impacts extreme weather can have on energy demand patterns.
The continued rapid adoption of clean energy technologies limited the annual rise in energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are increasingly decoupling from economic growth, according to the report.
Record temperatures contributed significantly to the annual 0.8 per cent rise in global CO2 emissions to 37.8 billion tonnes. But the deployment of solar PV, wind, nuclear, electric cars, and heat pumps since 2019 now prevents 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, the equivalent of seven per cent of global emissions.

Title: PM VIKAS scheme targets skill development, financial inclusion for minority communities
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:41:53 +0000
Content: The Pradhan Mantri Virasat Ka Samvardhan (PM VIKAS) scheme, launched by the Ministry of Minority Affairs, is aimed at promoting skill development, education, and economic empowerment among six notified minority communities.
This Central Sector scheme integrates five previous initiatives—‘Seekho Aur Kamao,’ ‘Nai Manzil,’ ‘Nai Roshni,’ ‘USTTAD,’ and ‘Hamari Dharohar’—to provide comprehensive support.
The scheme focuses on both traditional and non-traditional sectors, enhancing employability through skilling and training programs. It places special emphasis on promoting women’s leadership and entrepreneurship, encouraging economic self-reliance within minority communities.
Educational support is offered through collaboration with the National Institute of Open Schooling. Infrastructure development initiatives are undertaken under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram.
Additionally, the scheme facilitates access to credit through the National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation to promote financial inclusion.
To strengthen support for artisans engaged in traditional crafts, the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH) has been designated as a knowledge partner. The EPCH assists by providing marketing linkages, developing training modules, enhancing branding and visual merchandising, organizing awareness campaigns during exhibitions, and encouraging artisans to form producer group companies.
A key component of the PM VIKAS scheme is job placement. Implementation partners are required to ensure employment for at least 75 percent of the candidates trained under skill development programs aligned with the National Skills Qualifications Framework.

Title: Kremlin says key parts of original Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine were never fulfilled
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:32:22 +0000
Content: Russia and the United States will discuss resuming a deal to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea, the Kremlin said on Monday, noting that what Moscow saw as key parts of an earlier agreement on the subject were never implemented.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the “Black Sea Initiative”, more commonly known as the grain deal, was on the agenda at talks in Saudi Arabia between Russian and U.S. officials on Monday.
He said that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed discussing the Black Sea deal and that Putin had agreed to discuss it.
“This is primarily about the safety of navigation,” Peskov said, when asked what the Black Sea deal amounted to.
“But if you remember the initiative in its previous form, there was quite a large part of the obligations to our country that were not fulfilled last time. Therefore, this will also be on the agenda today.”
Turkey and the United Nations helped mediate the so-called Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal struck in July 2022 that allowed the safe export of nearly 33 million metric tons of Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea despite the war.
Russia withdrew from the agreement in 2023, complaining that its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious obstacles, though Russia is not currently facing serious problems getting its grain to market by the Black Sea.
To convince Russia to agree to the Black Sea deal, a three-year memorandum of understanding was struck in July 2022 under which U.N. officials agreed to help Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets.
While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments.
Russia wanted a resumption of its ammonia exports and the reconnection of its state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank to the SWIFT international payments system.
When asked about Trump’s remarks indicating progress on a possible settlement for Ukraine, Peskov said that Russia and the United States had a common understanding on the need to move towards a settlement to end the war in Ukraine but that there were still many different aspects that need to be worked out.
“There is indeed a common understanding here,” Peskov said.
“In general, of course, there are still a lot of different aspects related to the settlement to be worked out.”

Title: Gabba to be demolished post 2032 Olympics, Brisbane to get new stadium
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 07:22:13 +0000
Content: Brisbane’s iconic Gabba stadium is set to be demolished after the 2032 Olympic Games, with a new 60,000-capacity venue planned for the Victoria Park area. This state-of-the-art facility, part of the city’s Olympic infrastructure, will become the new home for cricket in Queensland.
Queensland Premier David Crisafulli unveiled the plans on Tuesday, bringing clarity to cricket’s future in Brisbane, which had been uncertain following the state’s successful bid to host the 2032 Olympics. The Gabba’s demolition and the new stadium construction mark a significant shift for Queensland’s sporting landscape.
Cricket Australia welcomed the announcement, saying, “This decision gives us certainty about venues and scheduling, ensuring Brisbane can continue hosting premier international and domestic cricket. Together with Queensland Cricket, the AFL, and Brisbane Lions, we advocated for the Victoria Park stadium, which will benefit both cricket fans and the wider Queensland community.”
The new venue offers long-term benefits for the sport, according to Cricket Australia, following years of speculation and changing proposals. The Gabba has been a central venue for Australian cricket since it hosted its first Test match in 1931, but the new stadium will be key in ensuring Brisbane remains a hub for top-tier cricket events.
Premier Crisafulli spoke about the legacy the new stadium will leave, commenting, “The Gabba is at the end of its life. Instead of temporary solutions, this new stadium secures the future of AFL and cricket in Queensland.”
Plans for a comprehensive AUD 2.7 billion overhaul of the Gabba under the previous government were abandoned due to escalating costs, with a scaled-back AUD 600 million upgrade also scrapped. The decision to move forward with a new stadium provides a more sustainable and long-term solution for sports in the region.
The Gabba’s final years could coincide with cricket’s return to the Olympics in 2028, after a century-long absence. Should cricket be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, the Gabba might host its last major international matches before being decommissioned.
Cricket Queensland CEO Terry Svenson reflected on the Gabba’s history, noting, “The Gabba has provided fans and players with countless memories over the years, but it’s time to look to the future. This new stadium will allow Queensland to attract the world’s best cricket events, from the Ashes Series to the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.”
The development of Brisbane’s new stadium comes as other major venues across Australia, such as Hobart’s new stadium set for completion by 2029, are also progressing. These developments are positioning Australia to host major international sporting events, with the 2032 Olympics acting as a catalyst for infrastructure growth across the country.

Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Tuesday presented the first budget of the newly elected BJP government, terming it a historic milestone.
Unveiling the Rs 1 lakh crore Budget for 2025-26, CM Gupta said it was the largest budget in the capital’s history.
“This is a historic day, as this is not just any budget. The people of Delhi and the country are keenly watching how the government, elected with a record mandate, will present its first Budget,” she said while addressing the Assembly.
She emphasized that the Budget was not merely an account of government expenditures but a roadmap to transform Delhi’s future. “This Budget aims to usher in a turnaround for the city and align it with the vision of Viksit Delhi. It seeks to make the capital a confluence of its glorious past and a bright future,” she added.
CM Gupta stated that the Budget was guided by the principles of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, and Sabka Prayas.
Taking a dig at the previous AAP-led government, she said, “It is unfortunate that in the last 10 years, Delhi regressed in every aspect of development,” citing issues such as deteriorating roads, a failing drainage system, and rising pollution.
“The previous government acted like a termite, weakening Delhi’s economy,” she remarked, highlighting that institutions like the Delhi Jal Board and the DTC had suffered significant financial losses.

Title: PLI scheme for specialty steel gets investment commitments worth Rs 17,000 crore
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:44:46 +0000
Content: The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme 1.1 for specialty steel has witnessed investment commitments worth Rs 17,000 crore in the second round, according to the government.
The expansion of the scheme is expected to further enhance India’s global competitiveness in specialty steel production.
The Ministry of Steel has signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) under the PLI Scheme 1.1 for specialty steel and according to Union Steel Minister HD Kumaraswamy, the scheme is a significant step toward achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ vision.
“The PLI scheme is a major step towards realising the Prime Minister’s vision of self-reliance. India is the second-largest producer and consumer of steel, yet we still import certain high-grade varieties. This scheme aims to bridge that gap by promoting domestic production,” the minister said.
Launched in July 2021, the PLI scheme for specialty steel covers five broad categories and 19 sub-categories.
The initiative ensures that only companies registered in India and engaged in end-to-end steel production are eligible for incentives.
The scheme has generated strong industry participation, prompting the government to introduce Round 2, allowing more companies to benefit.
To encourage investment and boost output, the government is offering incentives ranging from 3-4 per cent based on investment and production targets.
In the first round, 44 applications were submitted by 23 companies, with incentives already disbursed for one project.
“The second round has seen even greater enthusiasm, with 25 companies submitting 42 applications, committing investments worth Rs 17,000 crore,” said the minister.
Lauding the efforts of officials in the Ministry of Steel and the MECON team for fast-tracking the implementation of PLI 1.1, Kumaraswamy said, “The dedication and efficiency shown by the ministry officials and the MECON team have been instrumental in accelerating this scheme. Their efforts are crucial in ensuring the success of this initiative.”
The minister also made a strong appeal to domestic steelmakers, urging them to focus on specialty steel production.
“Domestically, we are not manufacturing specialty steel, but I personally request our steelmakers to invest in specialty steel plants. If you succeed in producing specialty steel domestically, it will boost capacity and production in the country. I urge all stakeholders to take up this challenge and contribute to our self-reliance,” he stated.

Title: White House mistakenly shares Yemen war plans with a journalist at The Atlantic
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:44:38 +0000
Content: Top Trump administration officials mistakenly disclosed war plans in a messaging group that included a journalist shortly before the U.S. attacked Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis, the White House said on Monday, following a first-hand account by The Atlantic.
Democratic lawmakers swiftly blasted the misstep, saying it was a breach of U.S. national security and a violation of law that must be investigated by Congress.
The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the “Houthi PC small group.” In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a “tiger team” to coordinate U.S. action against the Houthis.
National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemen’s Houthis on March 15 over the group’s attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he warned Iran, the Houthis’ main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group.
Hours before those attacks started, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, “including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” Goldberg said. His report omitted the details but Goldberg termed it a “shockingly reckless” use of a Signal chat.
Accounts that appeared to represent Vice President JD Vance, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and senior National Security Council officials were assembled in the chat group, Goldberg wrote.
Joe Kent, Trump’s nominee for National Counterterrorism Center director, was apparently on the Signal chain despite not yet being Senate-confirmed.
Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic,” Trump said. A White House official said later that an investigation was under way and Trump had been briefed on it.
The NSC’s Hughes said in a statement: “At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”
“The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security.”
Hegseth denied sharing war plans in the group chat.
“Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that,” he told reporters while on an official trip to Hawaii on Monday.
Goldberg responded to Hegseth’s denial in an interview on CNN late on Monday by saying, “No, that’s a lie. He was texting war plans.”
‘EUROPEAN FREE-LOADING’
According to screenshots of the chat reported by The Atlantic, officials in the group debated whether the U.S. should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether U.S. allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved U.S. help.
“@PeteHegseth if you think we should do it let’s go,” a person identified as Vance wrote. “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” the person wrote, adding: “Let’s just make sure our messaging is tight here.”
A person identified as Hegseth replied: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”
The Atlantic reported that the person identified as Vance also raised concerns about the timing of the strikes, and said there was a strong argument in favor of delaying them by a month.
“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,” the account wrote, before saying he was willing to support the group’s consensus.
Yemen, Houthi-ally Iran and the European Union’s diplomatic service did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
Under U.S. law, it can be a crime to mishandle, misuse or abuse classified information, though it is unclear whether those provisions might have been breached in this case. Messages that The Atlantic report said were set by Waltz to disappear from the Signal app after a period of time also raise questions about possible violations of federal record-keeping laws.
As part of a Trump administration effort to chase down leaks by officials to journalists unrelated to the Signal group, Gabbard posted on X on March 14 that any “unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.”
On Tuesday, Gabbard is due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on worldwide threats to the United States.
Created by the entrepreneur Moxie Marlinspike, Signal has gone from an exotic messaging app used by privacy-conscious dissidents to the unofficial whisper network of Washington officialdom. Signal does not use U.S. government encryption and is not hosted on government servers.
Democratic lawmakers called the use of the Signal group illegal and demanded an investigation.
“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, adding that he would ask Majority Leader John Thune to investigate.
“We’re just finding out about it. But obviously, we’ve got to run it to ground and figure out what went on there. We’ll have a plan,” said Thune, a Republican from South Dakota.
There was no immediate suggestion from the White House that the breach would lead to any staffing changes.
“President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including national security adviser Mike Waltz,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Reuters.
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X the use of Signal to discuss highly sensitive national security issues was “blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief.”
“Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime – even if accidentally – that would normally involve a jail sentence,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on X.

Content: Ghana’s Thomas Partey scored twice and Mohammed Kudus grabbed another as their side eased to a 3-0 win over Madagascar in a World Cup qualifier played in neutral Morocco on Monday to take a sizeable step towards a place at the tournament next year.
Ghana did not qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations finals in a surprise failure that stunned the continent, but they are well on course for a place at the 48-team World Cup which will be held in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
They have 15 points from six games in Group I, five ahead of second-placed Madagascar and six more than Mali in third with four rounds to play.
The top team in each of the nine groups earns a place at the global event, while the four best runners-up enter an arduous inter-continental playoff campaign for one further berth.
Partey netted two headers before Kudus provided a neat finish from a pass by Jordan Ayew, who set up all three goals.
Mali were held to a 0-0 draw by Central African Republic in a blow to their chances in Group I.
Ivory Coast striker Sebastien Haller scored with a header from Simon Adingra’s cross as his side edged Gambia 1-0 in Abidjan to return to the top of Group F.
They are a point ahead of second-placed Gabon and have yet to concede a goal six games into their campaign.
Tunisia substitute Seifeddine Jaziri netted a header after 87 minutes and Elias Achouri added an injury-time penalty to end the stubborn resistance of 10-man Malawi in a 2-0 win in Rades.
Tunisia head Group H with 16 points from six games after Malawi’s Lloyd Aaron received a second yellow card after 64 minutes.
Second-placed Namibia are four points off the pace after being held to a 1-1 draw by Equatorial Guinea in neutral South Africa. Peter Shalulile gave the Namibians the lead after 51 minutes but Saul Coco equalised three minutes later.
Liberia beat minnows Sao Tome e Principe 2-1 in the other game in the pool.
Lassina Traore scored twice as Burkina Faso won 2-1 at Guinea-Bissau to keep the heat on Group A leaders Egypt. The Burkinabe are within two points of the Egyptians but have played a game more. The latter host Sierra Leone on Tuesday.
Abubeker Nasir scored a hat-trick as Ethiopia trounced Djibouti 6-1 in the other match in Group A.

Title: US, Russia wrap up talks on proposed Black Sea ceasefire
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:30:54 +0000
Content: U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up day-long talks on Monday focused on a narrow proposal for a ceasefire at sea between Kyiv and Moscow, part of a diplomatic effort that Washington hopes will help pave the way for broader peace negotiations.
Even as the meeting was under way in Saudi Arabia, where a Ukrainian delegation was present on the sidelines, a Russian missile strike damaged a school and a hospital in Ukraine, wounding at least 88 people.
The talks, which focused among other issues on trying to reach a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, were portrayed by Washington as a step in President Donald Trump’s effort to end the three-year-old war.
A White House source said progress was being made in the Riyadh talks and that a “positive announcement” was expected “in the near future.”
Russia’s RIA news agency said the Russian delegation, when asked about their mood after the end of the talks, replied: “It’s good.”
A Russian source told Reuters that the talks had concluded late on Monday and a draft joint statement had been sent to Moscow and Washington for approval, with the parties aiming to release it on Tuesday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that no documents would be signed, the TASS agency reported.
Earlier on Monday, Trump listed other issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of demarcation, talking about power, power plant ownership.”
Last week, Russia rejected a proposal by Trump for a full 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, and it has so far agreed only to a moratorium on attacking energy infrastructure.
As Monday’s talks were being held in Riyadh, Russian missiles struck the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. Several high-rise residential blocks were damaged along with a school and hospital, regional governor Volodymyr Artiukh said in a video filmed in front of a blaze producing a column of smoke.
The schoolchildren were in a shelter at the time, averting worse casualties, he added.
“Moscow speaks of peace while carrying out brutal strikes on densely populated residential areas in major Ukrainian cities,” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said.
“Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians.”
The talks in Saudi Arabia follow phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Ukrainian officials met the Americans in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.
Trump, who has scaled back U.S. diplomatic backing for Ukraine and shifted publicly to a stance far less critical of Russia than that of his predecessor Joe Biden, says he aims to bring a quick end to the war.
The White House says the initial aim of the Saudi talks is to secure a maritime truce in the Black Sea, allowing the free flow of shipping.
But maritime battles have been a comparatively limited facet of the war since 2023, after Ukrainian attacks drove Moscow to move its navy far from contested waters, making it possible for Ukraine to reopen ports and resume exports.
“This is primarily about the safety of navigation,” Kremlin spokesman Peskov said. He said a previous U.N.-backed agreement on Black Sea shipping had failed to deliver some of Moscow’s demands.
A source briefed on planning for the Saudi talks said the U.S. side was led by Andrew Peek, a senior director at the White House National Security Council, and Michael Anton, a senior State Department official.
Russia was represented by Grigory Karasin, a former diplomat who is now chair of the Russian upper house’s Foreign Affairs Committee.
Karasin was cited by Interfax news agency as saying during a break in the talks on Monday that they were progressing “creatively” and that the two sides had discussed issues regarded as “irritants” in bilateral ties.
Trump had expressed broad satisfaction over the way talks have been going and has been complimentary about Putin’s engagement.
But major European powers doubt whether Putin is ready to make real concessions or will stick to what they see as his maximalist demands, which do not appear to have changed since he sent troops into Ukraine in 2022.
Putin says he is ready to discuss peace but that Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of four Ukrainian regions that Russia has unilaterally annexed.
White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian delegations were assembled in the same facility in Riyadh.
Beyond a Black Sea ceasefire, Waltz said the teams would discuss the “line of control” between the two armies, which he described as “verification measures, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are”.

Title: Khelo India Para Games 2025: Powerlifters Seema Rani, Jhandu Kumar break national records; Mona Agarwal shoots gold
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:22:32 +0000
Content: The fifth day of the Khelo India Para Games 2025 witnessed two more national records in powerlifting. Punjab’s Seema Rani registered a record lift of 97 kg in the women’s elite 61 kg category, while Jhandu Kumar of Bihar lifted 206 kg in the men’s elite 72 kg category.
Paralympians dominated the events at the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range. Paris 2024 bronze medallist Mona Agarwal clinched gold in the Mixed 50m Prone SH1 event with a score of 243.3. She had already secured two silver medals in the women’s 10m air rifle standing SH1 and the mixed 10m air rifle prone SH2 categories, according to a release.
On the penultimate day of para shooting, Rajasthan’s Nihal Singh, who has also qualified for the Paris Paralympics, showcased his dominance in the mixed 25m pistol SH1 event, successfully defending his gold medal from the first edition of the Khelo India Para Games held in December 2023.
At the time of writing, 160 medals had been awarded, with Haryana leading the medal standings with 29 golds. Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan followed closely with 24 and 22 gold medals, respectively.
Powerlifters have been in exceptional form since Sunday. After two national records were set by Punjab’s Jaspreet Kaur (45 kg class) and Haryana’s Manish Sharma (54 kg class), Jalandhar’s Seema Rani, who has had polio since the age of three, lived up to expectations by winning her second consecutive gold medal in the Khelo India Para Games. The 39-year-old Seema began her para powerlifting journey five years ago and has since represented India in several international tournaments, including the World Championships.
Seema told SAI Media, “It feels great to set a new national record and win gold medals in back-to-back Khelo India Para Games. I thank SAI for making world-class arrangements for athletes because, without them, it is difficult to focus and compete well.”
Hailing from Bihar, Jhandu Kumar started his powerlifting journey in 2014. The 28-year-old para-lifter has yet to make his debut for India but hopes to do so soon. “Khelo India Para Games is a great platform for para-athletes. I had won silver earlier in 2023. It feels great to have converted that silver into gold now,” he said.

Title: Pakistan must vacate occupied Kashmir, stop supporting terrorism: India at UN
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:03:28 +0000
Content: India has called on Pakistan to vacate the illegally occupied territory in Jammu and Kashmir and to stop justifying state-sponsored terrorism.
Responding to Pakistan’s repeated attempts to raise the Kashmir issue in the Security Council, India’s Permanent Representative P. Harish said on Monday, “Such repeated references neither validate their illegal claims nor justify their state-sponsored cross-border terrorism.”
“Pakistan continues to illegally occupy the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which it must vacate,” he asserted, adding, “That would be in keeping with Security Council Resolution 47, adopted on April 21, 1948, which requires Pakistan to withdraw its forces and infiltrators from Kashmir.”
Harish further said, “Jammu and Kashmir was, is, and will always be an integral part of India.” He advised Pakistan to refrain from using international forums to push its divisive agenda.
Earlier, during a debate on new challenges facing peacekeeping, Syed Tariq Fatemi, Pakistan’s junior foreign affairs minister, urged the Council to enforce its resolution on a plebiscite for Kashmir.
However, the same resolution clearly stipulated that Pakistan must first withdraw all non-resident tribesmen and Pakistani nationals who had entered Jammu and Kashmir for the purpose of fighting. It also required Pakistan to halt support for militants and prevent any further incursions.
A plebiscite could not be held at the time the resolution was passed because Pakistan refused to fulfill its precondition of withdrawal from Kashmir. India maintains that a plebiscite is now irrelevant, as the people of Kashmir have demonstrated their allegiance to India through participation in democratic elections and by electing their own leaders.
Fatemi also mentioned the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), which was established in 1949 to monitor the ceasefire along the Line of Control. However, India considers UNMOGIP an outdated institution, made irrelevant by the 1972 Shimla Agreement, which declared the Kashmir issue a bilateral matter between the two countries, leaving no room for third-party intervention. India has since expelled UNMOGIP from its government-provided offices in New Delhi.

Title: Ambitious climate action could boost global 2040 GDP by 0.2%, says OECD study
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:41 +0000
Content: Accelerated climate action could boost global GDP by 0.2% by 2040 compared with current policies, a study showed on Tuesday, as delegates from 40 countries meet in Berlin to shape the agenda for the COP30 summit in Brazil later this year.
An analysis by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme said that well-designed climate policies not only cut emissions but could enhance efficiency, productivity and innovation -potentially raising output by an amount equivalent to the size of Sweden’s economy.
Investing in clean energy and efficiency drives productivity and innovation, offsetting the economic impact of policy-driven price and consumption changes, the study found. Reinvesting carbon revenues could further boost GDP and build public backing for climate action, it said.
As countries prepare to submit updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by September – the national plans each country makes towards global climate goals – the study said NDCs provided policy certainty, giving markets the confidence to mobilise resources toward sustainable growth.
Unclear climate policies could delay private investment and cut GDP by 0.75% as early as 2030, the study warned.
The study comes as ministers from around 40 countries gather in Berlin for the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which will focus on preparations for the UN climate conference in Belem, Brazil in November.
The Petersberg conference will be the first major ministerial climate meeting since the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.
“Anyone who dismisses climate action in these turbulent times as being expensive, onerous or superfluous cannot count,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.
Baerbock said the Petersberg conference would focus on implementing the global goals set at the 2023 Dubai climate summit, including the summit’s deal to transition away from fossil fuels, and an agreement to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Title: NHRC takes suo motu cognisance of assault on SC student in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:17:27 +0000
Content: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken suo motu cognisance of a media report regarding the brutal assault on a Class XI Scheduled Caste student by some upper-caste boys in Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu. The incident, which has raised concerns about human rights violations, occurred while the victim was travelling by bus to appear for an exam.
According to the report, the perpetrators dragged the student out of the bus and attacked him with a sickle, severing his fingers on his left hand. The victim’s father, who attempted to intervene, was also assaulted. The NHRC, in an official statement released on Tuesday, has called for urgent action.
The Commission issued notices to the Director General of Police and the District Collector of Thoothukudi, demanding a detailed report on the incident within four weeks. It expressed concern over the gravity of the situation and highlighted the serious human rights implications if the details of the report are verified.
The media report, dated March 12, further stated that the perpetrators managed to flee the scene after the attack. The injured boy was rushed to the hospital, where he was later admitted to Tirunelveli Government Hospital. After a seven-hour surgery, a team of doctors successfully reattached the boy’s severed fingers. The Commission awaits the response from the state authorities and has stressed the need for a thorough investigation.

Title: Unifying policies of Modi govt have tossed separatism out of J&K: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:01:12 +0000
Content: After two constituents of the Hurriyat Conference announced their decision to sever ties, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday that separatism has become history in Kashmir while urging more groups to come forward.
Taking to social media, HM Shah said on his X handle, “Separatism has become history in Kashmir. The unifying policies of the Modi government have tossed separatism out of J&K. Two organizations associated with the Hurriyat have announced that they are severing all ties with separatism. I welcome this step towards strengthening Bharat’s unity and urge all such groups to come forward and shed separatism once and for all. It is a big victory for PM Shri @narendramodi Ji’s vision of building a developed, peaceful, and unified Bharat.”
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, however, refused to comment on the Union Home Minister’s statement, saying, “I have not seen the tweet. I will comment when I see it.”
It is worth mentioning that, in a major setback to the Hurriyat Conference, two of its major associate organizations—Jammu Kashmir People’s Movement and Democratic Political Movement (DPM)—announced the severing of all ties with the separatist umbrella organization on Monday.
The move follows the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) banning the Mirwaiz Umer Farooq-led Awami Action Committee (AAC) for five years under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Centre had also issued an order under the UAPA to ban J&K Ittehadul Muslimeen (JKIM), headed by Maulvi Masroor Abbas Ansari, for five years.
After Article 370 was revoked on August 5, 2019, the Hurriyat Conference became defunct.
Advocate Mohammad Shafi Reshi, leader of DPM, announced his complete dissociation from the hard-line Geelani faction of the Hurriyat Conference.
It is worth noting that Advocate Shafi also served as the political secretary of hardline separatist leader, the late Syed Ali Shah Geelani.
The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) was established on July 31, 1993, as a political alliance of 26 political, social, and religious organizations.
The APHC was established as a united separatist political front. Mehmood Ahmed Saghar was the first convener of the APHC in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
The APHC split into two main factions on September 7, 2003: the Mirwaiz faction and the Geelani faction.
Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is the founder and chairman of the Mirwaiz faction, while Masarat Alam Bhat is the interim chairman of the Geelani faction, having succeeded Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the faction’s founder, after his death.

Title: Israeli strikes kill 23 in Gaza, military expands evacuation orders
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:56:03 +0000
Content: Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 23 Palestinians on Tuesday, local health officials said, as the Israeli military expanded evacuation orders to tens of thousands of residents across the enclave.
The Israeli military resumed its campaign against Hamas in Gaza a week ago, shattering a two-month ceasefire. Since then, nearly 700 people, mostly women and children, have been killed, Palestinian health officials say.
Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has already been displaced by the fighting multiple times during nearly 18 months of war and is facing worsening shortages of food and water after Israel suspended aid deliveries earlier this month.
On Tuesday, the Israeli army told residents in all northern border towns to evacuate, saying Palestinian rockets had been fired at Israel from the area.
The affected towns include Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Shejaia in Gaza City. Orders were also issued for areas in Khan Younis and Rafah in the south.
“For your safety, you must move immediately south to known shelters,” the military said in its orders to residents in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza’s historic refugee camps.
Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the renewed offensive aimed to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining 59 hostages it is holding in Gaza. About 24 of them are believed to be still alive.
Hamas, which accuses Israel of abandoning the January 19 ceasefire deal, said it was cooperating with a new effort, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, to restore calm and conclude the three-phase ceasefire agreement.
According to some Hamas sources, there has been no breakthrough.
The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Title: Japan raises concern over longest Chinese intrusion near Senkaku islands
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:33:29 +0000
Content: Japan has voiced serious concerns over a prolonged incursion by Chinese Coast Guard ships near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, marking one of the longest intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters. The Chinese ships, which claim the islands for Beijing, left on Monday night after remaining in the area for 92 hours and 8 minutes.
Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya highlighted the growing escalation of Chinese vessel activity around the Senkaku Islands, stating that the situation is “clearly escalating.” His comments came as Chinese Coast Guard ships had been operating in Japanese waters since early Friday, according to Kyodo News.
Iwaya expressed Japan’s concerns during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tokyo on Saturday. While Iwaya described the talks as “conciliatory and friendly,” he called the timing of the Chinese intrusion during the diplomatic exchange “truly regrettable.”
Opposition lawmakers in Japan criticized the incursion, with one leader describing it as “extremely inappropriate” given the timing of the high-level talks. Iwaya responded by affirming that Japan will handle the situation “in a resolute and calm manner.”
The dispute over the Senkaku Islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Diaoyutai in Taiwan, has persisted for decades. Administered by Japan, the uninhabited islets hold strategic importance due to their proximity to shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds, and potential oil reserves. The islands are also seen as a focal point in the broader geopolitical rivalry between China and the US, with Japan being a key US ally.
Japan maintains that no agreement exists with China to “shelve” the issue of the Senkaku Islands, and asserts that China’s actions, such as sending ships into the waters since 2008, have contradicted any notion of compromise on the matter.

Title: Stock market closes in green amid volatile trade, Sensex ends above 78,000
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:31:52 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market remained in positive territory for the seventh consecutive session on Tuesday, though it gave up most of its early gains during a volatile trading session.
The Sensex, which touched an intra-day high of 78,741.69, eventually closed at 78,017.19, rising 32.81 points or 0.04 per cent.
Similarly, the Nifty ended nearly flat at 23,668.65, gaining only 10.30 points or 0.04 per cent. During the session, the index traded within a range of 23,869.60 to 23,627.55.
Despite marginal gains in the indices, market sentiment remained weak, with most stocks experiencing selling pressure.
Out of all traded shares, 1,019 stocks advanced, while 2,868 declined, and 107 remained unchanged.
Sector-wise, the IT sector was the only gainer, while other indices—including auto, capital goods, consumer durables, metal, oil and gas, power, PSU banks, realty, and telecom—declined between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent.
Among the top gainers on the Nifty were UltraTech Cement, Trent, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, and Grasim Industries.
On the other hand, IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy’s Labs, and Coal India were among the major losers.
The broader market also faced selling pressure, with the BSE Midcap index falling by 1 per cent and the BSE Smallcap index dropping 1.6 per cent.
Among sectoral indices, only the Nifty IT index closed in the green, while all others saw declines, with the biggest sectoral losses extending up to 2.16 per cent.
Market experts believe that cautious investor sentiment and profit booking led to the choppy session, while global market trends and upcoming economic data will continue to influence market movements in the coming days.
According to Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory at PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, the market’s winning streak extended to a seventh straight session, with the Nifty closing above 23,600 and the Sensex surging over 1,000 points.
“Focus now shifts to the upcoming US GDP growth report for the fourth quarter, scheduled for release on March 27, along with any fresh updates on trade tariffs,” he said.

Title: New Income Tax Bill to be introduced in monsoon session: FM Sitharaman
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:28:55 +0000
Content: The new Income Tax Bill will be taken up for discussion in the Monsoon session of Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The Income-tax Bill, 2025, which will replace the six-decade old Income Tax Act, 1961, will make direct tax laws simple to understand, remove ambiguities, and reduce tax disputes.
The simplification exercise was guided by three core principles which include textual and structural simplification for improved clarity and coherence, ensuring continuity and certainty with no major tax policy changes and no modifications of tax rates to preserve predictability for taxpayers, the Finance Ministry said.
The Bill, based on global best practices, aims to enhance the ease of doing business by providing a tax framework that is simple and clear. It has led to a substantial reduction in the Act’s volume, making it more streamlined and navigable. The total number of words in the new Income Tax Bill has been reduced to 259,676 from a massive 512,535 words in the existing Income Tax Act. This close to 50 per cent cut has resulted in a reduction of 252,859 words, according to an official statement.
Accordingly, the number of chapters in the new Income Tax Bill has come down to 23 from 47 in the existing Income Tax Act. Similarly, the number of sections has been cut to 536 from 819 earlier which has resulted in removing as many as 283 sections, the statement explained.
This massive reduction has taken place with the simplification of language, making the law more accessible while the consolidation of amendments has reduced fragmentation.
A three-pronged approach was adopted with a focus on eliminating intricate language to enhance readability, removing redundant and repetitive provisions for better navigation and reorganizing sections logically to facilitate ease of reference, according to the statement.
There has also been a structural rationalisation through tables and formulae for improved readability. Besides, the preservation of existing taxation principles has ensured continuity while enhancing usability, the statement said.
Consultations were held with industry experts and tax professionals and simplification models from Australia and the UK were studied for best practices.
The government also ensured widespread stakeholder engagement, consulting taxpayers, businesses, industry associations, and professional bodies. Out of 20,976 online suggestions received, relevant suggestions were examined and incorporated, where feasible.

Title: AB PM-JAY enables Rs. 87 crore in cashless mental health treatments with 77,634 hospital admissions
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:12:52 +0000
Content: Under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri – Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), the National Health Benefit Package has expanded to cover 1,961 procedures across 27 medical specialties, including 22 for mental disorders. As of March 21, 2025, 77,634 hospital admissions worth Rs. 87 crore have been authorized, providing beneficiaries with cashless treatment for conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disabilities.
The Government continues to improve mental healthcare access and affordability through key initiatives like AB PM-JAY and the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP).
The Government is implementing the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), a component of NMHP, in 767 districts. The programme provides outpatient services, counselling, continuing care for severe mental disorders, and a 10-bed in-patient facility at the district level. Mental health services have been extended to over 1.75 lakh Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres, now upgraded to Ayushman Arogya Mandirs.
In tertiary care, 25 Centres of Excellence have been sanctioned to increase postgraduate intake in mental health specialities and provide advanced treatment facilities. Additionally, 19 medical institutions have received support to strengthen 47 PG departments in mental health.
The country has 47 government-run mental hospitals, including three Central Mental Health Institutions: NIMHANS, Bengaluru, LGB Regional Institute of Mental Health, Assam, and the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. These institutions also offer online training to healthcare professionals through Digital Academies, with 42,488 professionals trained since 2018.
The “National Tele Mental Health Programme” launched in October 2022 has expanded tele mental health services across 36 States/UTs, with 53 Tele MANAS Cells handling over 19.67 lakh calls on the helpline. To enhance support, the Government launched the Tele MANAS Mobile Application on World Mental Health Day in October 2024, offering assistance for issues ranging from mental well-being to disorders.
Furthermore, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued a Master Circular on Health Insurance Business in May 2024, mandating insurers to offer products that cover mental health conditions in compliance with the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.

Title: Aerial transport of human corneas via drones may revolutionize eye care: ICMR
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:08:53 +0000
Content: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has successfully tested the use of drones for transporting human corneas in a pilot study, paving the way for a revolutionary shift in eye care accessibility across India, particularly in rural regions, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced on Tuesday.
The study assessed the feasibility of using drones to transport sensitive ophthalmic biomaterials, such as human corneas and amniotic membrane grafts, from peripheral collection centers to tertiary hospitals for transplantation procedures. The study was conducted in Sonipat and Jhajjar, Haryana.
“The drone successfully transported corneal tissue from Dr. Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital (Sonipat center) to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), AIIMS Jhajjar, and subsequently to AIIMS New Delhi,” the Ministry stated.
“The distance between the two cities was covered in approximately 40 minutes via drone, compared to the usual 2–2.5 hours by road. The drone maintained optimal conditions to preserve specimen integrity, and upon arrival, the cornea was evaluated, leading to a successful transplant surgery,” it added.
The pilot project was conducted under ICMR’s i-DRONE initiative, originally conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver vaccines to remote regions. The initiative was launched in collaboration with AIIMS New Delhi and Dr. Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital, with support from the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
“This cornea transport study marks another step forward in enhancing patient access, ensuring timely transplants, and reducing pressure on overburdened tertiary hospitals,” said Dr. Rajiv Bahl, Secretary of the Department of Health Research (DHR) and Director General of ICMR.
“This initiative aligns perfectly with the Prime Minister’s vision of a self-reliant India powered by innovation. Drone-based healthcare logistics represent the future, and India is taking the lead by applying this technology in areas where it matters most—saving lives and restoring sight,” he added.
In the past, the i-DRONE initiative has successfully demonstrated the use of drones to deliver essential medical supplies in various states, including North East India (COVID-19 and UIP vaccines, medications, and surgical supplies), Himachal Pradesh (medications and samples in high-altitude, sub-zero temperatures), Karnataka (intraoperative oncosurgical samples), Telangana (tuberculosis sputum samples), and the National Capital Region (blood bags and their components).
“This collaboration between the health and aviation sectors is an inspiring example of technology-driven social impact. Drones offer a scalable solution for timely medical delivery in geographically challenging areas. As India strengthens its drone ecosystem, such studies are critical to building a resilient and responsive healthcare infrastructure,” said Piyush Srivastava, Additional Secretary and Senior Economic Advisor at the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
Through this study, researchers aim to document operational workflows, identify technical challenges, and generate evidence to support the integration of drone logistics into routine medical practice, particularly for time-sensitive and temperature-sensitive biological materials like human corneas.
The findings will help shape future protocols, policies, and best practices for aerial transport in healthcare.
“Corneal blindness affects millions in India, and the timely availability of donor tissue is often a limiting factor. This drone-based transport model could be a transformative step toward ensuring equitable access to vision-restoring surgeries, especially in underserved areas,” said Prof. (Dr.) M. Srinivas, Director of AIIMS New Delhi.
