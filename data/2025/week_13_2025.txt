Title: India’s forex reserves rise by USD 305 million to USD 654.3 billion
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 07:50:29 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by USD 305 million, reaching USD 654.271 billion in the week ending March 14.
This rise follows the previous week’s surge, which marked the highest weekly gains in over three years. Prior to these recent increases, forex reserves had experienced a steady decline for about four months, slipping to an 11-month low. The trend has since seen fluctuations, with alternate weeks of gains and declines.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of USD 704.89 billion in September. Since then, they have fallen by nearly 7 percent from that peak. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s interventions, primarily to curb a sharp depreciation of the Rupee, are considered a key reason for the decline. Currently, the Indian Rupee hovers at or near its record low against the US dollar.
According to the latest RBI data, India’s foreign currency assets (FCA)—the largest component of forex reserves—stand at USD 557.186 billion. Gold reserves are valued at USD 74.391 billion.
Estimates suggest that the country’s forex reserves are adequate to cover approximately 10 to 11 months of projected imports.
In 2023, India added about USD 58 billion to its forex reserves, in contrast to a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion recorded in 2022. In 2024, the reserves saw a modest increase of slightly over USD 20 billion.
Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets held by a country’s central bank or monetary authority, mainly in reserve currencies such as the US dollar, with smaller holdings in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.
The RBI frequently intervenes in the forex market, managing liquidity by buying dollars when the Rupee strengthens and selling them when it weakens. These measures are aimed at stabilizing the currency and preventing steep depreciation. (ANI)

Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:56:38 +0000
Content: Unseasonal rain along with strong winds have caused widespread damage to crops in Telangana and the affected farmers are looking to the government for compensation.
Hailstorms hit north Telangana districts during the last two days, damaging standing crops of paddy, maize and mango.
A few days ago, crops in some districts were withering due to a lack of irrigation water and declining groundwater. But now, the unseasonal rain has destroyed whatever crops the farmers had grown.
Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds reaching 40 to 50 kmph caused huge losses to farmers as the standing crops were submerged. Hailstorms in some districts added to farmers’ woes.
Mango farmers have suffered massive losses from gusty winds that have uprooted trees in several districts. Farmers said the hailstorms hit the mango crop which was almost ready for harvest
Paddy kept at market yards for sale in some places also soaked in the unseasonal rain.
The gusty winds also damaged electric poles and transformers, disrupting electricity supply.
Hundreds of bags of paddy and maize kept at the market yard in Sangareddy soaked in rain, causing huge losses to farmers. The district received heavy rain accompanied by lightning and gusty winds.
In the Kamareddy district, maize crops were inundated due to unseasonal rain. A farmer said in just 30 minutes of hailstorm he lost everything.
The affected farmers have appealed to the government to come to their rescue by compensating for the losses.
Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari reviewed the situation after a hailstorm hit north Telangana. She directed the district administrations to be on alert and accessible to people in view of the forecast of more rain.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rain or thundershowers at isolated places over the next two days.
It has issued an orange alert for north Telangana districts.
According to Met Office, thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (40-50 kmph) and hailstorms are very likely to occur at isolated places in Kumuram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Mulugu, Mahabubabad, Warangal, Hanamkonda, Jangaon districts.

Title: India’s aviation sector reflects stable outlook amid rising air traffic
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:23:37 +0000
Content: India’s aviation sector continues to show a stable outlook, supported by a steady rise in air passenger traffic. Official data reveals that domestic air passenger traffic recorded a robust double-digit growth of 11.04 per cent in February this year compared to the same month last year.
According to an ICRA report, domestic air traffic for the first 11 months of the current financial year stood at approximately 1,551 lakh passengers. This marks a 7.7 per cent increase over the same period last year and a 12.9 per cent rise compared to the pre-Covid level of 1,338 lakh passengers recorded in the same period of FY20.
International passenger traffic has also seen significant growth. In the first 10 months of the financial year (April-January), Indian carriers transported around 280.9 lakh international passengers, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 14.8 per cent. This figure is 41.3 per cent higher than the pre-Covid level of approximately 198.8 lakh passengers.
The ICRA report notes that the Indian aviation industry’s outlook remains stable, supported by expectations of moderate growth in domestic air passenger traffic and a relatively stable cost environment in FY25 and FY26.
Data released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) shows that India’s scheduled domestic airlines ferried around 1.40 crore passengers in February 2025, up from 1.26 crore in the same month of the previous year.
DGCA’s monthly passenger traffic report highlights IndiGo as the country’s leading airline, commanding a 63.7 per cent market share. The low-cost carrier transported 89.40 lakh passengers in February 2025.
IndiGo was followed by the Air India Group, including Air India Express, which carried 38.30 lakh passengers, giving the Tata Group airline a 27.3 per cent market share.
Among newer entrants, Akasa Air carried 6.59 lakh passengers, securing a 4.7 per cent share of the market. SpiceJet, led by Ajay Singh, flew 4.54 lakh passengers, translating to a 3.2 per cent market share.
Smaller carriers also made their mark. Alliance Air transported 0.86 lakh passengers, accounting for 0.6 per cent of the market, while Star Air flew 0.60 lakh passengers, capturing a 0.4 per cent share.
ICRA has maintained a ‘stable’ outlook for the aviation industry, citing improved pricing power and moderate traffic growth projections. Domestic air traffic is projected to grow at 7-10 per cent in FY2025 and FY2026, while international passenger traffic for Indian carriers is anticipated to expand by 15-20 per cent.
Adding to the momentum, IndiGo Airlines has emerged as the world’s second fastest-growing airline in terms of seat capacity, which increased by 10.1 per cent year-on-year to over 134.9 million seats in 2024. It is ranked just behind Qatar Airways, which recorded a 10.4 per cent increase, according to data from the Official Airline Guide (OAG).
IndiGo has also been recognised as the fastest-growing airline globally in terms of flight frequency growth, clocking a 9.7 per cent year-on-year increase in 2024. The airline recorded 7,49,156 flights during the year, OAG data shows.
Additionally, IndiGo holds one of the world’s largest aircraft orders, with over 900 aircraft on order. It was the largest recipient of new aircraft in 2024, receiving 58 Airbus planes. However, the report also notes that a sizeable portion of its fleet, approximately 80 aircraft, remains inactive due to MRO-related supply chain challenges.

Title: Scientists link type 2 diabetes with some obesity-related cancers
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:52:09 +0000
Content: A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to an increased risk of developing certain obesity-related cancers, according to recent research.
While earlier studies have identified associations between type 2 diabetes and a heightened risk of several obesity-related cancers, questions have remained about whether these links are truly causal. Factors such as obesity—a common risk factor for both conditions—as well as potential biases like immortal time bias (stemming from the combination of pre-existing and new cases of T2D) and time detection bias (where two common conditions are diagnosed concurrently) have clouded the findings.
In this latest study, set to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) in Malaga, Spain, researchers aimed to overcome these methodological limitations. They conducted a matched cohort control study using data from the UK Biobank, comparing individuals newly diagnosed with T2D (defined by the date of first reported non-insulin-dependent diabetes) to unexposed individuals matched based on body mass index (BMI), age, and sex.
The study involved 23,750 participants with newly diagnosed T2D and 71,123 matched controls. Over a median follow-up period of five years, 2,431 new primary cancers were reported among T2D participants, compared to 5,184 cases among the control group.
The analysis revealed that new-onset T2D was associated with a 48 per cent increased risk of obesity-related cancers in men and a 24 per cent increased risk in women—an effect independent of BMI. However, the study found no association between T2D and certain site-specific cancers, such as endometrial cancer and post-menopausal breast cancer in women.
Positive associations were observed for specific cancers. New-onset T2D increased the risk of bowel cancer by 27 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. The risk of pancreatic cancer rose by 74 per cent in men and nearly doubled in women. For liver cancer, new-onset T2D was linked to a near quadrupling of risk in men and a nearly five-fold increase in women.
“At this stage, we are unsure whether these differences in men and women are due to a sex-dependent biological pathway—such as hormone levels, insulin sensitivity, or body fat composition—or if they are simply the result of variations in the number of cancers found in men and women within the UK Biobank by chance,” the study authors noted.

Title: Miami Open: Tiafoe, Berrettini make winning starts; Rublev bows out
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:30:44 +0000
Content: Playing in his 100th ATP Masters 1000 match, Frances Tiafoe earned his 50th win at the prestigious level with a 7-5, 7-6(5) win against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
The 27-year-old earned his first Top 40 win since beating Daniil Medvedev at Laver Cup last September by improving to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head-to-Head series with Davidovich Fokina, avenging a defeat to the Spaniard last month in Acapulco, ATP reports.
Wins like that are big for me,” said Tiafoe, who saved all four break points he faced after dropping serve in the opening game. “Any win right now is big for me, but especially the way I played. I was super aggressive, so I’m really happy with it.”
Tiafoe will next meet 17th seed Arthur Fils, who led lucky loser Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 2-3 before the Canadian retired with an ankle injury.
Andrey Rublev, on the other hand, became the latest upset victim with Belgium’s Zizou Bergs knocking him out 7-5, 6-4. The 25-year-old Bergs earned his first Top 20 win by beating the No. 9 in the ATP Rankings to advance to his first ATP Masters 1000 third round.
Bergs will seek to score another upset against Matteo Berrettini in the third round, after the Italian opened his Miami campaign with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win against Hugo Gaston.
In a rematch of the 2024 Kitzbuhel final, the 29th-seeded Berrettini beat lucky loser Gaston with a dominant serving performance.
Meanwhile, the 18-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca became the youngest player to reach round three at ATP Masters 1000 since Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in 2021.
Fonseca delivered a five-star display to defeat 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 and reach the third round at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time in his fledgling career.
Due to a last-minute schedule change, Fonseca and Humbert’s second-round clash was relocated from Grandstand to Stadium.
Fonseca has enjoyed a rapid rise at the start of the 2025 season. He claimed his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires in February and is now up to a new career-high No. 58 in the ATP Live Rankings.

Title: ‘Supreme sacrifice inspires generations’: PM Modi remembers Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Mar 2025 04:48:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid homage to revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, and Sukhdev Thapar on their death anniversary, observed as Shaheed Diwas or Martyrs’ Day.
The three freedom fighters were executed by the British on March 23, 1931, for their unwavering fight against colonial rule.
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Today, our nation remembers the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev. Their fearless pursuit of freedom and justice continues to inspire us all.”
In a video message, he highlighted their immense contribution to India’s independence struggle, recalling an incident from Bhagat Singh’s childhood.
“Taking oath on this soil, our heroes fought for freedom. In this soil, a hundred years ago, a small child was sowing wood. When his father asked what he was sowing, he replied that he was sowing guns. The father asked what he would do with them, and the child said he would use them to free his country. That brave child was none other than Shaheed Bhagat Singh,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi further stated that even after so many years, the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev remains deeply ingrained in the hearts of every Indian child.
Quoting a Hindu shloka, he said, “‘Neither weapons can cut him, nor fire can burn him.’ Such are the people who sacrifice their lives for the nation. On Shaheed Diwas, I pay tribute on behalf of the grateful nation to all the brave men and women who sacrificed everything for the country.”
March 23, though a solemn day in Indian history, serves as a reminder of the courage and sacrifice of India’s freedom fighters. It stands as a tribute to all those who laid down their lives in the pursuit of independence, inspiring generations to cherish and uphold the hard-won freedom of the nation.
