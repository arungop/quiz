Title: Israel’s Gaza aid blockade contested in World Court hearings
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 07:04:09 +0000
Content: Israel will face accusations of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into the Gaza Strip when dozens of nations present arguments at the International Court of Justice during a week of hearings starting in The Hague on Monday.
Since March 2, Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, and food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out.
In December, the U.N.’s top court was tasked to form an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations.
Israel has said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Palestinian militant group Hamas releases all remaining hostages.
Germany, France and Britain last week called on Israel to adhere to international law by allowing the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel reiterated that no aid would be allowed to enter Gaza, in order to pressure Hamas.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid that was allowed into Gaza. Hamas has denied the allegations and has blamed Israel for shortages.
The resolution adopted in December by 137 of the 193 nations in the U.N.’s General Assembly called on Israel to comply with its obligations towards the Palestinian population, as it expressed “grave concern” about the dire humanitarian situation.
Israel, the United States and 10 other countries voted against the resolution, while 22 countries abstained.
Representatives for the Palestinian territories will be among the first to address the court in The Hague on Monday.
Israel is not among the roughly 40 nations that will speak during the five days of hearings scheduled through Friday. The United States will state its opinion on Wednesday.
Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.
The U.N. views Gaza and the West Bank as Israeli-occupied territory. International humanitarian law requires an occupying power to facilitate relief programs for people in need and ensure food, medical care, hygiene and public-health standards.
After the hearings, the World Court will likely take several months to form its opinion.

Title: CBDT launches aggressive drive to curb black money, targets Rs. 2.4 lakh crore in undisclosed income
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 06:50:35 +0000
Content: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has instructed field formations of the Income Tax Department to intensify efforts against black money and tax evasion through a comprehensive, time-bound strategy aimed at bringing unreported and under-reported businesses into the tax net.
According to a media report, the CBDT estimates a potential recovery of undisclosed income amounting to a staggering Rs. 2.4 lakh crore during the current financial year.
Each jurisdiction of the Income Tax Department has been tasked with conducting at least one major search and seizure operation by July 31, followed by a minimum of two additional operations between August 2025 and March 2026, NDTV Profit reported.
The CBDT has further directed that 60% of the overall target be achieved through intrusive measures such as searches and raids, while the remaining 40% should come from non-intrusive methods involving data analytics and financial intelligence.
As part of its strategy, the Investigation Wing has been instructed to prepare focused, data-backed reports on sectors vulnerable to tax evasion and lacking sufficient disclosure. Targeted sectors may include manufacturing, services, mining, liquor trade, international trade, hawala networks, healthcare, scrap dealing, and other ancillary or unregulated industries.
Highlighting the limited visibility into informal transactions, the CBDT emphasized the urgent need to study sectors with high volumes of unreported activity and develop strategies to promote formalisation and improve compliance.
This aggressive push is part of a broader plan to widen the tax base by bringing businesses that have so far evaded scrutiny due to insufficient data into the formal economy, thereby boosting revenue collections.
Meanwhile, India’s direct tax collections for the fiscal year 2024–25 have surpassed expectations. According to the Finance Ministry’s latest figures, provisional net direct tax collections have reached Rs. 11,82,875 crore, marking a 17% increase over the previous year. The tax buoyancy factor — which measures the growth rate of direct taxes relative to GDP growth — stood at 1.57, up from 1.54 in 2023–24, reflecting the strong fiscal health of the country.

In a post on X, Dhami said, “Hail Baba Kedar…! Shri Kedarnath Dham is being decorated with flowers before the doors open. Devotees will be able to have darshan of Baba from May 2.”
The registration for Char Dham Yatra 2025 also began on Monday, with special counters set up for specially-abled individuals, senior citizens, and foreign nationals. Moreover, 20 free registration counters have been established, according to District Tourism Officer Shushil Nautiyal.

Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:58:41 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Jitendra Singh, visited Udhampur on Sunday to review the security arrangements in the region. The high-level meeting took place against the backdrop of heightened security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 22 lives.
Addressing concerns, Singh assured that all necessary measures would be taken to ensure peace and safety in the region. “We will address all concerns and constraints to ensure peace and safety. Miscreants will be dealt with firmly,” he said.
During his visit, Singh also met Lt Gen Pratik Sharma, who will assume charge as the General Officer Commanding (GoC) Northern Command, Udhampur, from May 1. He lauded the Indian Army for maintaining high public morale through its strategic deployment at sensitive locations.
The Minister also commended the district administration for its ongoing efforts in maintaining law and order and supporting developmental initiatives in the region.
The review meeting involved detailed discussions on potential hotspots, vulnerabilities, and strategies to address them. Singh emphasized the importance of coordination among all security agencies to ensure effective and seamless operations.
Media access was restricted during the high-level security meeting. However, speaking to reporters afterward, Dr. Singh explained that certain operational details could not be disclosed publicly. “Some inputs are exclusively available with concerned security agencies and are acted upon discreetly. The positive outcomes of their actions eventually become visible to the public,” he said.
Reiterating the government’s commitment, Singh added that the security forces had formulated a comprehensive plan to maintain public confidence and ensure that citizens do not feel insecure.

Title: Trump urges Russia to stop Ukraine attacks; Rubio says US might walk away from peace efforts
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:36:07 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump urged Russia on Sunday to stop its attacks in Ukraine while his top diplomat said the United States might walk away from peace efforts if it does not see progress.
Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, Trump said he was disappointed that Russia has continued to attack Ukraine, and said his one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Vatican on Saturday had gone well.
“I see him as calmer. I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal,” Trump said of Zelenskiy.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said the Trump administration might abandon its attempts to broker a deal if Russia and Ukraine do not make headway.
“It needs to happen soon,” Rubio told the NBC program “Meet the Press.'” “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”
Trump and Zelenskiy, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met in a Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since an angry encounter in the White House Oval Office in February and comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to the conflict.
Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin after that meeting, saying on social media that there is “no reason” for Russia to shoot missiles into civilian areas.
In a pre-taped interview that aired on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would continue to target sites used by Ukraine’s military.
When asked about a Russian strike on Kyiv last week that killed civilians, Lavrov said that “the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian” and that Russia targets only “sites which are used by the military.”
Zelenskiy wrote on the messaging app Telegram that his top military commander reported that Russia had already conducted nearly 70 attacks on Sunday.
“The situation at the front and the real activity of the Russian army prove that there is currently insufficient pressure on Russia from the world to end this war,” Zelenskiy said.
DIFFERING PROPOSALS
Ukrainian and European officials pushed back last week against some U.S. proposals on how to end the war, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions.
American proposals called for U.S. recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as de facto recognition of Russia’s hold on other parts of Ukraine.
In contrast, the European and Ukrainian proposal defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that Ukraine should not agree to the American proposal, saying it went too far in ceding swathes of territory in return for a ceasefire.
Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. president has “expressed his frustration” at both Putin and Zelenskiy but remains determined to help negotiate an agreement.
Waltz also said the United States and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals.
Chuck Schumer, the top U.S. Senate Democrat, said on Sunday that he is concerned Trump will “cave in to Putin.”
“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

Title: India bans 16 Pak YouTube channels for misleading content on Indian Army, security agencies
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:25:33 +0000
Content: The Indian government on Monday banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative and communally sensitive content, along with false and misleading narratives aimed at targeting India, its Army, and security agencies. This decision comes after the tragic Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.
The move was made on the recommendations of the Ministry of Home Affairs, following the attack that led to the loss of innocent lives. The banned channels include prominent names like Dawn News, Irshad Bhatti, SAMAA TV, ARY NEWS, BOL NEWS, Raftar, The Pakistan Reference, Geo News, Samaa Sports, GNN, Uzair Cricket, Umar Cheema Exclusive, Asma Shirazi, Muneeb Farooq, SUNO News HD, and Razi Naama.
These channels were found to be disseminating false and unverified information related to India’s national security, foreign relations, and public order. Collectively, they had a massive reach, with a cumulative viewership exceeding 63.08 million. The content spread by these channels aimed to create panic, fuel communal tensions, and disrupt public order within India, according to an official statement.
The banned channels were particularly active in spreading fake news about topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India’s foreign relations in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.
Following the attack, India launched a strong diplomatic response by summoning Pakistan’s top diplomat in New Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, and issuing a Persona Non Grata notice to all Pakistani military attaches.
This action is part of a broader series of retaliatory measures taken by India, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the assault as a “cowardly attack on innocent civilians.”
The attack, carried out by the Pakistan-based terror group The Resistance Front, has escalated tensions between the two nations. In response, India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), led by Prime Minister Modi, announced several harsh measures, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, the cancellation of the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) for Pakistani nationals, the expulsion of Pakistani military attaches from New Delhi, and the reduction of diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.

Title: North Korea confirms troop deployment to assist Russia in Ukraine conflict
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:10:44 +0000
Content: North Korea confirmed for the first time on Monday that it had sent troops to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean military referred to their involvement as a “sacred mission” designed to strengthen the ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.
According to the state-run KCNA news agency, North Korean soldiers helped Russian forces “completely liberate” the Kursk border region, following an order from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
This admission comes just days after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the North Korean troops for their role in the liberation of the Kursk region during a video conference with President Vladimir Putin on April 26. Putin claimed that Russia had regained control of Kursk, a region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, although Ukraine has denied Russia’s claims.
North Korea’s acknowledgment of its troops’ involvement follows reports from the US, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine about sightings of North Korean soldiers on the frontlines, nearly a year ago. The North Korean government explained that Kim Jong Un saw the participation of its armed forces as a mission to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two nations, promote their prosperity, and protect North Korea’s honor.
In June 2024, Kim Jong Un and Putin signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, committing both nations to military support in the event of war. KCNA also reported that Kim had praised the soldiers who participated in the operation as heroes, and announced plans to erect a monument in Pyongyang to honor those who took part, with flowers to be placed on the graves of those who were killed.
Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned North Korea and other “third countries” for supporting Russia’s war against Ukraine, urging an end to the conflict and Moscow’s support for Pyongyang.

Title: India shared 300 million vaccines globally during COVID-19: Piyush Goyal
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:51:18 +0000
Content: India provided nearly 300 million vaccine doses to less developed and vulnerable countries through the Vaccine Maitri initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic — many of them free of cost — ensuring that no nation was left behind during the global health crisis, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said on Sunday.
Speaking at the World Health Summit (WHS) Regional Meeting Asia 2025 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, Goyal emphasized that, unlike several countries that imposed export controls, India prioritized equitable vaccine access for all. He highlighted that this approach reflected the ancient Indian ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — “the world is one family.”
Goyal expressed gratitude that the first WHS Regional Meeting in Asia focused on “Scaling Access to Ensure Health Equity.” He stressed that access to quality healthcare is vital for sustainable development and shared India’s journey toward achieving greater healthcare access for all citizens.
Recalling his personal interactions with global leaders during the pandemic, Goyal said India had ensured the supply of critical medicines at fair prices, standing firm against the global trend of profit-driven healthcare during crises.
On the issue of health equity, the Minister criticized the extension of pharmaceutical patents through minor incremental innovations, warning that such practices could deprive millions of affordable access to life-saving medicines. He invited WHS delegates to witness first-hand India’s efforts to deliver quality healthcare even in its remotest regions.
Highlighting India’s achievements, Goyal noted that over 620 million people are now eligible for free healthcare under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, the world’s largest government-funded health insurance program. He reiterated that India’s healthcare commitment was motivated not by profit, but by compassion.
Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Goyal said, “For us, healthcare is not just curing a sick patient. Healthcare is preventive healthcare, it is wellness, it is mental healthcare, and it means bridging society under the umbrella of a better lifestyle and a better future.”
He also elaborated on India’s holistic approach to human welfare, mentioning initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission for sanitation, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana providing millions of homes, the Jal Jeevan Mission expanding rural tap water access, the Ujjwala Yojana providing clean cooking fuel, and the free distribution of food grains to 800 million citizens during and beyond the pandemic.

Title: Indian Stock Market Opens Higher, Sensex Rises by 400 Points in Early Trade
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:09:19 +0000
Content: The Indian equity benchmark indices opened higher on Monday, supported by mixed global cues. Buying activity was observed in the PSU bank and financial services sectors during early trade.
At around 9:30 AM, the Sensex was up by 400.7 points or 0.51%, reaching 79,613.28, while the Nifty gained 88.65 points or 0.37%, standing at 24,128.00.
The Nifty Bank index rose by 347.85 points or 0.64%, reaching 55,011.90. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up by 230.80 points or 0.43%, trading at 53,801.00. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index saw a slight decline of 28.55 points or 0.17%, reaching 16,518.65.
While the situation at the India-Pakistan border remains a concern for market participants, foreign portfolio investor (FPI) inflows are continuing to lend strong support to Indian equities. Although selling pressure from high net-worth individuals (HNIs) last week kept the markets under some stress, overall sentiment appears to be improving with the start of the new week.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, said, “FPI flows are continuing to support Indian markets along with steady domestic institutional investor (DII) flows. With no major Offer for Sale (OFS) or Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) absorbing liquidity, markets are benefiting from these inflows. However, last week we witnessed declines in both the leading and broader indices, despite positive numbers from both FPIs and DIIs. This suggests that there were outflows from proprietary desks and HNI segments due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Indian subcontinent.”
On the earnings front, several major companies are scheduled to announce their fourth-quarter and full-year results today. These include UltraTech Cement, Indian Railway Finance Corporation, Adani Green Energy Limited, TVS Motor Company, IDBI Bank, Adani Total Gas, Oberoi Realty, Hexaware Technologies, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and UCO Bank. Investors will closely monitor these results for cues on future market direction.
“Investors turned cautious, causing the Nifty to fall below 24,200, as escalating India-Pakistan tensions following the Pahalgam terror attack unsettled sentiment. The Nifty is currently hovering near a support level; a breakdown below 23,800 would signal a continuation of the downtrend. However, with the index currently trading above 24,000, further upward movement remains possible. Technically, as prices remain above all key moving averages, an uptrend is indicated,” said Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose by 0.44 per cent, Taiwan’s Weighted Index gained 0.62 per cent, and South Korea’s KOSPI stayed marginally positive. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped by 0.13 per cent at the time of this report. (ANI)

Title: IPL 2025: RCB seal sixth straight away win to top points table
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 03:55:53 +0000
Content: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continued their impressive run in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, securing their sixth straight away win and seventh overall with a 6-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals (DC). The win propelled RCB to the top of the points table, while the Capitals are now placed fourth.
Chasing a target of 163, RCB endured a shaky start, losing three wickets for just 26 runs. Debutant Jacob Bethell managed 12 runs before falling, while Devdutt Padikkal was dismissed for a duck. Captain Rajat Patidar’s run-out for 6 left the side in trouble at 26/3.
However, a crucial 119-run partnership between Virat Kohli and Krunal Pandya steadied the innings. Kohli played a composed knock of 51 off 47 balls, hitting four boundaries, while Pandya was the star of the night, remaining unbeaten on 73 from 47 deliveries, with five fours and four sixes.
The pair ensured RCB reached 100 in 13.3 overs and kept the required run rate in check.
After Kohli’s dismissal at the hands of Dushmantha Chameera in the 17.5th over, Tim David joined Pandya and played a cameo, scoring 19 runs off just five balls to seal the victory. RCB reached the target in 18.3 overs.
Earlier in the match, DC captain Axar Patel was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with impressive figures of 2/19 from his four overs. Despite his efforts, Delhi couldn’t stop RCB’s momentum.
RCB, now sitting at the top of the standings, will look to maintain their winning form as the tournament heads toward the playoffs.
In the first innings, a brilliant bowling performance from RCB’s Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood restricted Delhi Capitals to 162/8 in their 20 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday.
RCB skipper Rajat Patidar won the toss and elected to bowl first in the away fixture of the ongoing 18th edition of the cash-rich league.
Batters Faf du Plessis and Abhishek Porel opened the innings with a 33-run stand off 22 balls before Porel (28 runs off 11 balls) was dismissed by right-arm seamer Josh Hazlewood in the fourth over.
Following Porel’s departure, right-handed batter Karun Nair (4) came to the crease but was dismissed in the fifth over by left-arm seamer Yash Dayal when the team score was 44.
The Capitals reached the 50-run mark in the sixth over as Du Plessis struck a boundary off the penultimate ball bowled by Hazlewood.
At the score of 72, the Delhi franchise lost their third wicket as Du Plessis (22 off 26 balls) was dismissed by skipper Hardik Pandya in the 10th over.
KL Rahul (41 off 39 balls), Tristan Stubbs (34 off 18 balls), and Axar Patel (15 off 13 balls) contributed crucial runs before being dismissed.
Right-handed batter Ashutosh Sharma came in as an impact substitute but was unable to make a mark, scoring just five runs.
At the end, young uncapped all-rounder Vipraj Nigam played a cameo of 12 runs from just six balls at a strike rate of 200, helping Delhi Capitals post 162/8.
For the Bengaluru franchise, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with 3/33 in 4 overs. Josh Hazlewood claimed 2/36 in his 4-over spell, while Yash Dayal (1/42 in 4 overs) and Krunal Pandya (1/28 in 4 overs) chipped in with a wicket each.
Brief Score:
Delhi Capitals 162/8 in 20 overs (KL Rahul 41, Tristan Stubbs 34; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 3/33)* 
vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru 165/4 in 18.3 overs (Krunal Pandya 73*, Virat Kohli 51; Axar Patel 2/19)
