Title: Israel’s Gaza aid blockade contested in World Court hearings
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 07:04:09 +0000
Content: Israel will face accusations of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into the Gaza Strip when dozens of nations present arguments at the International Court of Justice during a week of hearings starting in The Hague on Monday.
Since March 2, Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, and food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out.
In December, the U.N.’s top court was tasked to form an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations.
Israel has said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Palestinian militant group Hamas releases all remaining hostages.
Germany, France and Britain last week called on Israel to adhere to international law by allowing the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel reiterated that no aid would be allowed to enter Gaza, in order to pressure Hamas.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid that was allowed into Gaza. Hamas has denied the allegations and has blamed Israel for shortages.
The resolution adopted in December by 137 of the 193 nations in the U.N.’s General Assembly called on Israel to comply with its obligations towards the Palestinian population, as it expressed “grave concern” about the dire humanitarian situation.
Israel, the United States and 10 other countries voted against the resolution, while 22 countries abstained.
Representatives for the Palestinian territories will be among the first to address the court in The Hague on Monday.
Israel is not among the roughly 40 nations that will speak during the five days of hearings scheduled through Friday. The United States will state its opinion on Wednesday.
Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.
The U.N. views Gaza and the West Bank as Israeli-occupied territory. International humanitarian law requires an occupying power to facilitate relief programs for people in need and ensure food, medical care, hygiene and public-health standards.
After the hearings, the World Court will likely take several months to form its opinion.

Title: CBDT launches aggressive drive to curb black money, targets Rs. 2.4 lakh crore in undisclosed income
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 06:50:35 +0000
Content: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has instructed field formations of the Income Tax Department to intensify efforts against black money and tax evasion through a comprehensive, time-bound strategy aimed at bringing unreported and under-reported businesses into the tax net.
According to a media report, the CBDT estimates a potential recovery of undisclosed income amounting to a staggering Rs. 2.4 lakh crore during the current financial year.
Each jurisdiction of the Income Tax Department has been tasked with conducting at least one major search and seizure operation by July 31, followed by a minimum of two additional operations between August 2025 and March 2026, NDTV Profit reported.
The CBDT has further directed that 60% of the overall target be achieved through intrusive measures such as searches and raids, while the remaining 40% should come from non-intrusive methods involving data analytics and financial intelligence.
As part of its strategy, the Investigation Wing has been instructed to prepare focused, data-backed reports on sectors vulnerable to tax evasion and lacking sufficient disclosure. Targeted sectors may include manufacturing, services, mining, liquor trade, international trade, hawala networks, healthcare, scrap dealing, and other ancillary or unregulated industries.
Highlighting the limited visibility into informal transactions, the CBDT emphasized the urgent need to study sectors with high volumes of unreported activity and develop strategies to promote formalisation and improve compliance.
This aggressive push is part of a broader plan to widen the tax base by bringing businesses that have so far evaded scrutiny due to insufficient data into the formal economy, thereby boosting revenue collections.
Meanwhile, India’s direct tax collections for the fiscal year 2024–25 have surpassed expectations. According to the Finance Ministry’s latest figures, provisional net direct tax collections have reached Rs. 11,82,875 crore, marking a 17% increase over the previous year. The tax buoyancy factor — which measures the growth rate of direct taxes relative to GDP growth — stood at 1.57, up from 1.54 in 2023–24, reflecting the strong fiscal health of the country.

Content: Uttrakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami held a virtual meeting on Monday with district magistrates from across the state to review the arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra 2025, which is scheduled to begin on April 30. 
In a post on X, Dhami said, “Hail Baba Kedar…! Shri Kedarnath Dham is being decorated with flowers before the doors open. Devotees will be able to have darshan of Baba from May 2.”
The registration for Char Dham Yatra 2025 also began on Monday, with special counters set up for specially-abled individuals, senior citizens, and foreign nationals. Moreover, 20 free registration counters have been established, according to District Tourism Officer Shushil Nautiyal.

Title: Union Minister Jitendra Singh reviews security arrangements during visit to Udhampur
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:58:41 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Jitendra Singh, visited Udhampur on Sunday to review the security arrangements in the region. The high-level meeting took place against the backdrop of heightened security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 22 lives.
Addressing concerns, Singh assured that all necessary measures would be taken to ensure peace and safety in the region. “We will address all concerns and constraints to ensure peace and safety. Miscreants will be dealt with firmly,” he said.
During his visit, Singh also met Lt Gen Pratik Sharma, who will assume charge as the General Officer Commanding (GoC) Northern Command, Udhampur, from May 1. He lauded the Indian Army for maintaining high public morale through its strategic deployment at sensitive locations.
The Minister also commended the district administration for its ongoing efforts in maintaining law and order and supporting developmental initiatives in the region.
The review meeting involved detailed discussions on potential hotspots, vulnerabilities, and strategies to address them. Singh emphasized the importance of coordination among all security agencies to ensure effective and seamless operations.
Media access was restricted during the high-level security meeting. However, speaking to reporters afterward, Dr. Singh explained that certain operational details could not be disclosed publicly. “Some inputs are exclusively available with concerned security agencies and are acted upon discreetly. The positive outcomes of their actions eventually become visible to the public,” he said.
Reiterating the government’s commitment, Singh added that the security forces had formulated a comprehensive plan to maintain public confidence and ensure that citizens do not feel insecure.
Senior officials present at the meeting included DIG Udhampur-Reasi Range Sarah Rizvi, DC Udhampur Saloni Rai, SSP Amod Nagpure, ADDC Rajinder Singh, ADC Prem Singh, ACR Umesh Shan, SDM Chenani Ranjit Kotwal, SDM Ramnagar Rajinder Singh Rana, SDM Dudu Manmeet Kumar, SDM Basant Garh Waheed Ul Rehman, and others.

Title: Trump urges Russia to stop Ukraine attacks; Rubio says US might walk away from peace efforts
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:36:07 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump urged Russia on Sunday to stop its attacks in Ukraine while his top diplomat said the United States might walk away from peace efforts if it does not see progress.
Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, Trump said he was disappointed that Russia has continued to attack Ukraine, and said his one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Vatican on Saturday had gone well.
“I see him as calmer. I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal,” Trump said of Zelenskiy.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said the Trump administration might abandon its attempts to broker a deal if Russia and Ukraine do not make headway.
“It needs to happen soon,” Rubio told the NBC program “Meet the Press.'” “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”
Trump and Zelenskiy, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met in a Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since an angry encounter in the White House Oval Office in February and comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to the conflict.
Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin after that meeting, saying on social media that there is “no reason” for Russia to shoot missiles into civilian areas.
In a pre-taped interview that aired on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would continue to target sites used by Ukraine’s military.
When asked about a Russian strike on Kyiv last week that killed civilians, Lavrov said that “the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian” and that Russia targets only “sites which are used by the military.”
Zelenskiy wrote on the messaging app Telegram that his top military commander reported that Russia had already conducted nearly 70 attacks on Sunday.
“The situation at the front and the real activity of the Russian army prove that there is currently insufficient pressure on Russia from the world to end this war,” Zelenskiy said.
DIFFERING PROPOSALS
Ukrainian and European officials pushed back last week against some U.S. proposals on how to end the war, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions.
American proposals called for U.S. recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as de facto recognition of Russia’s hold on other parts of Ukraine.
In contrast, the European and Ukrainian proposal defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that Ukraine should not agree to the American proposal, saying it went too far in ceding swathes of territory in return for a ceasefire.
Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. president has “expressed his frustration” at both Putin and Zelenskiy but remains determined to help negotiate an agreement.
Waltz also said the United States and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals.
Chuck Schumer, the top U.S. Senate Democrat, said on Sunday that he is concerned Trump will “cave in to Putin.”
“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

Title: India bans 16 Pak YouTube channels for misleading content on Indian Army, security agencies
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:25:33 +0000
Content: The Indian government on Monday banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative and communally sensitive content, along with false and misleading narratives aimed at targeting India, its Army, and security agencies. This decision comes after the tragic Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.
The move was made on the recommendations of the Ministry of Home Affairs, following the attack that led to the loss of innocent lives. The banned channels include prominent names like Dawn News, Irshad Bhatti, SAMAA TV, ARY NEWS, BOL NEWS, Raftar, The Pakistan Reference, Geo News, Samaa Sports, GNN, Uzair Cricket, Umar Cheema Exclusive, Asma Shirazi, Muneeb Farooq, SUNO News HD, and Razi Naama.
These channels were found to be disseminating false and unverified information related to India’s national security, foreign relations, and public order. Collectively, they had a massive reach, with a cumulative viewership exceeding 63.08 million. The content spread by these channels aimed to create panic, fuel communal tensions, and disrupt public order within India, according to an official statement.
The banned channels were particularly active in spreading fake news about topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India’s foreign relations in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.
Following the attack, India launched a strong diplomatic response by summoning Pakistan’s top diplomat in New Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, and issuing a Persona Non Grata notice to all Pakistani military attaches.
This action is part of a broader series of retaliatory measures taken by India, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the assault as a “cowardly attack on innocent civilians.”
The attack, carried out by the Pakistan-based terror group The Resistance Front, has escalated tensions between the two nations. In response, India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), led by Prime Minister Modi, announced several harsh measures, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, the cancellation of the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) for Pakistani nationals, the expulsion of Pakistani military attaches from New Delhi, and the reduction of diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.

Title: North Korea confirms troop deployment to assist Russia in Ukraine conflict
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:10:44 +0000
Content: North Korea confirmed for the first time on Monday that it had sent troops to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean military referred to their involvement as a “sacred mission” designed to strengthen the ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.
According to the state-run KCNA news agency, North Korean soldiers helped Russian forces “completely liberate” the Kursk border region, following an order from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
This admission comes just days after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the North Korean troops for their role in the liberation of the Kursk region during a video conference with President Vladimir Putin on April 26. Putin claimed that Russia had regained control of Kursk, a region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, although Ukraine has denied Russia’s claims.
North Korea’s acknowledgment of its troops’ involvement follows reports from the US, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine about sightings of North Korean soldiers on the frontlines, nearly a year ago. The North Korean government explained that Kim Jong Un saw the participation of its armed forces as a mission to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two nations, promote their prosperity, and protect North Korea’s honor.
In June 2024, Kim Jong Un and Putin signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, committing both nations to military support in the event of war. KCNA also reported that Kim had praised the soldiers who participated in the operation as heroes, and announced plans to erect a monument in Pyongyang to honor those who took part, with flowers to be placed on the graves of those who were killed.
Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned North Korea and other “third countries” for supporting Russia’s war against Ukraine, urging an end to the conflict and Moscow’s support for Pyongyang.

Title: India shared 300 million vaccines globally during COVID-19: Piyush Goyal
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:51:18 +0000
Content: India provided nearly 300 million vaccine doses to less developed and vulnerable countries through the Vaccine Maitri initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic — many of them free of cost — ensuring that no nation was left behind during the global health crisis, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said on Sunday.
Speaking at the World Health Summit (WHS) Regional Meeting Asia 2025 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, Goyal emphasized that, unlike several countries that imposed export controls, India prioritized equitable vaccine access for all. He highlighted that this approach reflected the ancient Indian ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — “the world is one family.”
Goyal expressed gratitude that the first WHS Regional Meeting in Asia focused on “Scaling Access to Ensure Health Equity.” He stressed that access to quality healthcare is vital for sustainable development and shared India’s journey toward achieving greater healthcare access for all citizens.
Recalling his personal interactions with global leaders during the pandemic, Goyal said India had ensured the supply of critical medicines at fair prices, standing firm against the global trend of profit-driven healthcare during crises.
On the issue of health equity, the Minister criticized the extension of pharmaceutical patents through minor incremental innovations, warning that such practices could deprive millions of affordable access to life-saving medicines. He invited WHS delegates to witness first-hand India’s efforts to deliver quality healthcare even in its remotest regions.
Highlighting India’s achievements, Goyal noted that over 620 million people are now eligible for free healthcare under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, the world’s largest government-funded health insurance program. He reiterated that India’s healthcare commitment was motivated not by profit, but by compassion.
Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Goyal said, “For us, healthcare is not just curing a sick patient. Healthcare is preventive healthcare, it is wellness, it is mental healthcare, and it means bridging society under the umbrella of a better lifestyle and a better future.”
He also elaborated on India’s holistic approach to human welfare, mentioning initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission for sanitation, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana providing millions of homes, the Jal Jeevan Mission expanding rural tap water access, the Ujjwala Yojana providing clean cooking fuel, and the free distribution of food grains to 800 million citizens during and beyond the pandemic.

Title: Indian Stock Market Opens Higher, Sensex Rises by 400 Points in Early Trade
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:09:19 +0000
Content: The Indian equity benchmark indices opened higher on Monday, supported by mixed global cues. Buying activity was observed in the PSU bank and financial services sectors during early trade.
At around 9:30 AM, the Sensex was up by 400.7 points or 0.51%, reaching 79,613.28, while the Nifty gained 88.65 points or 0.37%, standing at 24,128.00.
The Nifty Bank index rose by 347.85 points or 0.64%, reaching 55,011.90. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up by 230.80 points or 0.43%, trading at 53,801.00. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index saw a slight decline of 28.55 points or 0.17%, reaching 16,518.65.
While the situation at the India-Pakistan border remains a concern for market participants, foreign portfolio investor (FPI) inflows are continuing to lend strong support to Indian equities. Although selling pressure from high net-worth individuals (HNIs) last week kept the markets under some stress, overall sentiment appears to be improving with the start of the new week.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, said, “FPI flows are continuing to support Indian markets along with steady domestic institutional investor (DII) flows. With no major Offer for Sale (OFS) or Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) absorbing liquidity, markets are benefiting from these inflows. However, last week we witnessed declines in both the leading and broader indices, despite positive numbers from both FPIs and DIIs. This suggests that there were outflows from proprietary desks and HNI segments due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Indian subcontinent.”
On the earnings front, several major companies are scheduled to announce their fourth-quarter and full-year results today. These include UltraTech Cement, Indian Railway Finance Corporation, Adani Green Energy Limited, TVS Motor Company, IDBI Bank, Adani Total Gas, Oberoi Realty, Hexaware Technologies, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and UCO Bank. Investors will closely monitor these results for cues on future market direction.
“Investors turned cautious, causing the Nifty to fall below 24,200, as escalating India-Pakistan tensions following the Pahalgam terror attack unsettled sentiment. The Nifty is currently hovering near a support level; a breakdown below 23,800 would signal a continuation of the downtrend. However, with the index currently trading above 24,000, further upward movement remains possible. Technically, as prices remain above all key moving averages, an uptrend is indicated,” said Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose by 0.44 per cent, Taiwan’s Weighted Index gained 0.62 per cent, and South Korea’s KOSPI stayed marginally positive. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped by 0.13 per cent at the time of this report. (ANI)

Title: IPL 2025: RCB seal sixth straight away win to top points table
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 03:55:53 +0000
Content: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continued their impressive run in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, securing their sixth straight away win and seventh overall with a 6-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals (DC). The win propelled RCB to the top of the points table, while the Capitals are now placed fourth.
Chasing a target of 163, RCB endured a shaky start, losing three wickets for just 26 runs. Debutant Jacob Bethell managed 12 runs before falling, while Devdutt Padikkal was dismissed for a duck. Captain Rajat Patidar’s run-out for 6 left the side in trouble at 26/3.
However, a crucial 119-run partnership between Virat Kohli and Krunal Pandya steadied the innings. Kohli played a composed knock of 51 off 47 balls, hitting four boundaries, while Pandya was the star of the night, remaining unbeaten on 73 from 47 deliveries, with five fours and four sixes.
The pair ensured RCB reached 100 in 13.3 overs and kept the required run rate in check.
After Kohli’s dismissal at the hands of Dushmantha Chameera in the 17.5th over, Tim David joined Pandya and played a cameo, scoring 19 runs off just five balls to seal the victory. RCB reached the target in 18.3 overs.
Earlier in the match, DC captain Axar Patel was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with impressive figures of 2/19 from his four overs. Despite his efforts, Delhi couldn’t stop RCB’s momentum.
RCB, now sitting at the top of the standings, will look to maintain their winning form as the tournament heads toward the playoffs.
In the first innings, a brilliant bowling performance from RCB’s Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood restricted Delhi Capitals to 162/8 in their 20 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday.
RCB skipper Rajat Patidar won the toss and elected to bowl first in the away fixture of the ongoing 18th edition of the cash-rich league.
Batters Faf du Plessis and Abhishek Porel opened the innings with a 33-run stand off 22 balls before Porel (28 runs off 11 balls) was dismissed by right-arm seamer Josh Hazlewood in the fourth over.
Following Porel’s departure, right-handed batter Karun Nair (4) came to the crease but was dismissed in the fifth over by left-arm seamer Yash Dayal when the team score was 44.
The Capitals reached the 50-run mark in the sixth over as Du Plessis struck a boundary off the penultimate ball bowled by Hazlewood.
At the score of 72, the Delhi franchise lost their third wicket as Du Plessis (22 off 26 balls) was dismissed by skipper Hardik Pandya in the 10th over.
KL Rahul (41 off 39 balls), Tristan Stubbs (34 off 18 balls), and Axar Patel (15 off 13 balls) contributed crucial runs before being dismissed.
Right-handed batter Ashutosh Sharma came in as an impact substitute but was unable to make a mark, scoring just five runs.
At the end, young uncapped all-rounder Vipraj Nigam played a cameo of 12 runs from just six balls at a strike rate of 200, helping Delhi Capitals post 162/8.
For the Bengaluru franchise, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with 3/33 in 4 overs. Josh Hazlewood claimed 2/36 in his 4-over spell, while Yash Dayal (1/42 in 4 overs) and Krunal Pandya (1/28 in 4 overs) chipped in with a wicket each.
Brief Score:
Delhi Capitals 162/8 in 20 overs (KL Rahul 41, Tristan Stubbs 34; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 3/33)* 
vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru 165/4 in 18.3 overs (Krunal Pandya 73*, Virat Kohli 51; Axar Patel 2/19)

Title: India’s index of industrial production grows by 3% in March 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:59:37 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on Monday released the Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for March 2025, reporting a year-on-year growth of 3%. This comes slightly higher than the revised figure of 2.9% for February 2025. The IIP, calculated with base year 2011–12=100, stood at 164.8 in March 2025 compared to 160.0 in March 2024.
Among the three major sectors, electricity production showed the most robust growth at 6.3%, followed by manufacturing at 3.0% and mining at 0.4%. The sectoral indices for March 2025 were 156.8 for mining, 160.9 for manufacturing, and 217.1 for electricity.
The manufacturing sector saw positive contributions from 13 of the 23 industry groups at the 2-digit NIC level. Leading the growth were “Manufacture of electrical equipment” with a remarkable 15.7% rise, “Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers” at 10.3%, and “Manufacture of basic metals” which increased by 6.9%. Within these categories, specific products like electric heaters, small transformers, and auto components played a significant role in driving growth.
Under the use-based classification, Infrastructure/Construction Goods led the momentum with an 8.8% increase, followed by Primary Goods at 3.1%, and Consumer Durables at 6.6%. However, Consumer Non-Durables experienced a contraction, declining by 4.7% compared to March 2024. The indices for these use-based categories stood at 168.2 for Primary Goods, 134.8 for Capital Goods, 173.1 for Intermediate Goods, 212.3 for Infrastructure/Construction Goods, 138.5 for Consumer Durables, and 147.9 for Consumer Non-Durables.
The cumulative average IIP for the financial year April 2024 to March 2025 registered a growth of 4.0%, with sectoral contributions of 2.9% in mining, 3.9% in manufacturing, and 5.1% in electricity. This marks a slight slowdown from the 5.9% growth recorded in the previous financial year.
Within the detailed industry-wise data, notable growth was seen in “Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products” (21.5%), and “Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.” (8.0%). Some sectors like “Manufacture of pharmaceuticals” and “Manufacture of food products” posted negative growth rates of -4.6% and -8.0% respectively, reflecting industry-specific challenges.
This month’s IIP Quick Estimate is based on a weighted response rate of 88%, while the finalized figures for December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025 reflect updated data with response rates of 95%, 94%, and 94%, respectively.

Title: Canadians vote in election dominated by concerns about Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:16:52 +0000
Content: Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Carney briefly paused his campaign, and both he and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre mentioned the tragedy in their final campaign events.
It was unclear if the mass casualty event would have any impact on the election. Duane Bratt, professor of political science at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said he did not expect it to deter voters.
Carney’s Liberals held a four-point lead over Poilievre’s Conservatives in separate polls by Ipsos and Angus Reid, suggesting little movement in the final days. Ipsos on Sunday pegged the Liberals at 42% support and the Conservatives at 38%.
Angus Reid’s Saturday poll placed the Liberals at 44% support, over the Conservatives’ 40% support.
Those results would likely produce a fourth consecutive Liberal mandate, but Carney might only win a minority of seats in the 343-seat House of Commons, leaving him reliant on smaller parties to govern.
Trump re-emerged as a campaign factor last week, declaring that he might raise a 25% tariff on Canadian-made cars because the U.S. does not want them. He said earlier he might use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.
“This is probably the most consequential election in my lifetime,” said Kelly Saunders, a political science professor at Brandon University. “Everything has been so overshadowed by the threats coming out of the United States.”
Carney has emphasized his experience handling economic issues makes him the best leader to deal with Trump, while Poilievre has tapped into concerns about the cost of living, crime and a housing crisis.
“I’m probably going to go Carney on this one just because right now, I feel like we need stability,” said Andy Hill, 37, a Vancouver-based mortgage broker and co-founder of mortgage marketplace EveryRate. “Being in the English banking system and being in the Canadian banking system, he really understands the economy.”
Bob Lowe, a 66-year-old cattle rancher who lives south of Calgary, said he has already cast his ballot for the Conservatives. He said his top concern is Canada’s flagging economic growth.
The economy had seen a fledgling recovery until the U.S. imposed tariffs.
Carney has sought to distance himself from former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was deeply unpopular when he said in January he would resign after nearly a decade in power. The Conservatives led polls by some 20 points around that time.
CONSERVATIVES FOCUS ON ECONOMY
Lowe said the Conservatives have focused on the economy all along, and that he believes the Liberals have been stoking Canadians’ anxieties about Trump to win another term.
“Poilievre has managed to keep the focus on the economy and a strong Canada, and Carney’s campaign is based on fear. That’s it in a nutshell,” Lowe said.
Saunders, however, predicts the Liberals will win a majority of seats, and says it would take a “magical scenario” for the Conservatives to pull off a victory. Tensions with the U.S. have caused supporters of two smaller parties, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals.
A party needs to win 172 electoral districts, called ridings or seats, to form a majority government that does not rely on smaller parties’ support to stay in power.
Much of the Conservative support is in rural areas where there are fewer seats.
Carney, who covered more than 20 cities in his last week of campaigning, has appeared tired but tried to maintain his exuberance at rallies, attended by 1,000 to 2,000 people, according to party figures.
Poilievre’s rallies have been bigger.
Standing on Sunday in front of the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor’s Canadian auto hub with Detroit across the border, Carney pointed to the bridge as a symbol of peace and cooperation between the two countries for almost a century.
“That has changed, and it wasn’t us who did the changing … President Trump, the guy over there,” Carney said. “He’s launched a trade war that has literally ruptured the global economy, and in the process, he’s betrayed us.”
Carney’s rallies have attracted mostly older Canadians and featured placards saying “Jamais Le 51” (“Never 51”) – a reference to Trump’s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state – and “Un Canada Fort” (“A Strong Canada”).
Mentions of Trump have been loudly booed.
Poilievre has attracted more young voters than usual for the Conservatives.
“Time is running out, only one more day to bring home change so that Canadians can afford food and homes and live on safe streets,” Poilievre said at a rally in Oakville, Ontario on Sunday.
Election results will trickle in, starting in eastern provinces, after polls close at staggered times on Monday evening. Ballots are counted by hand.

Title: Nawaz advises PM Shehbaz Sharif against aggressive stance on India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:43:25 +0000
Content: Three-time Prime Minister of Pakistan and founder of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Nawaz Sharif, has urged his younger brother and current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to avoid adopting an aggressive posture towards India. He emphasized the need to utilize all diplomatic avenues to restore peace between the two countries.
The two leaders met in Lahore on Sunday evening, where Shehbaz Sharif briefed Nawaz Sharif on the measures taken by his government following the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, particularly in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after the Pahalgam attack.
According to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz detailed how Pakistan had reciprocated New Delhi’s actions, including the closure of its airspace to India, and informed his brother about the country’s preparedness to respond to any Indian aggression.
“India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty has dangerously increased the risk of conflict in the region,” a source quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
In response, Nawaz Sharif advised restraint and stressed the importance of pursuing diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has proposed the formation of an international commission—comprising representatives from the United States, Russia, China, and Britain—to investigate the Pahalgam attack. He asserted that Pakistan is ready to present evidence implicating India in the Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan and alleged links with anti-Pakistan groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Even though we know it was a false flag operation, we are willing to cooperate with any international inquiry to expose the truth. However, if India proceeds with any misadventure, it will see Pakistan’s preparedness,” said Khawaja Asif.

Title: ‘Make in India’ booster: HMD Global to launch direct-to-mobile phones in India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:17:23 +0000
Content: In a major step towards advancing India’s technological landscape, HMD Global, in collaboration with FreeStream Technologies (incubated at IIT Kanpur), Tejas Networks, and other partners, has unveiled plans to address the growing demand for Direct-to-Mobile (D2M) phones in the country. The announcement will be officially made at the ‘World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025,’ set to take place from May 1-4 in Mumbai.
D2M technology represents a breakthrough in next-generation broadcasting by enabling the delivery of OTT and live TV, video, audio, and text messages directly to mobile phones without relying on Wi-Fi or internet services.
This innovation aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ and further strengthens the ‘Make in India’ initiative.
As part of this effort, affordable feature phones, smartphones, and tablets powered by Tejas Networks will be manufactured. These devices are being developed using the innovative SL-3000 chipset from Saankhya Labs, which serves as the cornerstone for enabling the D2M platform.
Over the years, this technology has undergone extensive testing in live networks by Prasar Bharati in partnership with IIT Kanpur and Tejas Networks.
Ravi Kunwar, VP and CEO of HMD India and APAC, said, “This pioneering platform will allow consumers to access a vast range of multimedia content directly on their devices.”
Sumeet Nindrajog, Director of FreeStream Technologies, highlighted the transformative nature of the D2M technology, adding, “This technology is set to revolutionize how content and data are consumed by users.”
He further stated that the collaboration with HMD will help lay the foundation for a robust device ecosystem, which will play a key role in the nationwide rollout of D2M services.
Parag Naik, co-founder of the former Saankhya Labs and Executive Vice President of Tejas Networks, elaborated on the potential of D2M: “The technology would allow the delivery of targeted ads, educational content, emergency alerts, and more, aligning with the government’s vision for a digitally empowered India,” Naik mentioned.
Chris Ripley, President and CEO of Sinclair, Inc., also shared his enthusiasm for the project, stating, “We’re proud to be at the forefront of global deployment and look forward to collaborating with partners like HMD in making India a hub for next-generation broadcast technology.”

Title: Saudi’s Jeddah old town regains glory as the Grand Prix lures tourists
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:54:07 +0000
Content: When Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea port of Jeddah hosted Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and U.S. singer Jennifer Lopez during its Grand Prix this month, visitors found they were also drawn to a less obvious attraction – the historic old town.
Jeddah is known for being the kingdom’s modern commercial hub, and the exodus of its merchant class meant its old town had fallen into neglect.
The kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy and make itself less dependent on oil, however, has included revitalising culture to lure tourism revenue.
Visitors who came for the F1 event found they loved the slower pace of the restored old Jeddah.
Known in Arabic as al-Balad, the Town, has the feel of previous centuries with its Arabic-styled wooden architecture in brown and blue colours that reflect the city’s location between the sand of the Arabian desert and the sea.
“It’s my first time in Saudi Arabia and the old city is very beautiful with earthly tones… and has a very particular architecture,” said Rossella from Milan.
Al-Balad was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2014. Since then, the government has accelerated plans to restore about 650 buildings and revive the district’s local businesses.
Fadil Zahir, 57, was born in the old town and works as a barista there.
“Tourists and visitors are coming to al-Balad in great numbers,” he said.
UNESCO cited historic Jeddah as “the only surviving urban ensemble of the Red Sea,” where coral stone tower houses adorned with Roshan wooden balconies stand alongside mosques as old as the advent of Islam, when the third Caliph Uthman bin Affan declared the city to be Mecca’s official port.
” I am 62 now, I now see what I could see 40 years back. You talk about changes, I say it’s actually going back to the original,” said Ahmed Alkhanbashi, a general manager at Alkhanbashi Business Development Bureau.

Title: JNUSU elections: ABVP shatters decade-long drought with joint secretary post
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:41:23 +0000
Content: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has secured one of the top posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), marking a comeback after a decade, according to results of the students’ union elections declared on Monday.

ABVP’s Vaibhav Meena won the post of Joint Secretary with 1,518 votes. Nitish Kumar of the All India Students’ Association (AISA) was elected President, securing 1,702 votes, while Manisha and Munteha Fatima, both from the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), clinched the Vice-President and General Secretary posts, respectively. Manisha garnered 1,150 votes, while Munteha Fatima won with 1,520 votes, further strengthening DSF’s presence in the central panel.
Although the ABVP fell short of winning the President, Vice-President, and General Secretary posts, the narrow margins of defeat underscored a palpable shift in campus dynamics.

Describing the outcome as an “unprecedented performance,” Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s IT cell, said in a post on X: “Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) conquered: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) candidate Vaibhav Meena has been elected as Joint Secretary. And it doesn’t stop there. ABVP has delivered an unprecedented performance in the JNUSU elections, winning 23 out of 42 councillor seats across 16 schools and special centres — the highest number of seats won by any student organization.”
Nitish Kumar of the All India Students’ Association (AISA) emerged as President, garnering 1,702 votes, while Manisha and Munteha Fatima, both from the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), claimed the posts of Vice-President and General Secretary, respectively. Manisha secured 1,150 votes, while Munteha Fatima’s victory further solidified DSF’s presence in the central panel, with 1,520 votes.
Shikha Swaraj, Nittu Goutham, Kunal Rai, and Vaibhav Meena represented the ABVP in the key positions of President, Vice-President, General Secretary, and Joint Secretary, respectively, as part of their ambitious campaign to challenge the status quo and alter campus politics.
The contest was marked by intense competition among strategic alliances: the All India Students’ Association (AISA) allied with the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), while the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) joined forces with the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students’ Association (BAPSA), the All India Students’ Federation (AISF), and the Progressive Students’ Association.
The ABVP contested the election independently.
This year’s turnout of 68.3 per cent, though slightly lower than the record-breaking 73 per cent participation in the 2024 elections, still reflected strong voter engagement.

Title: Indian stock market rebounds sharply; Sensex surges 1,006 points
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:37:28 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market staged a strong rebound on Monday, ending the day with robust gains despite ongoing geo-political tensions. The rally was largely fueled by a sharp uptick in select banking stocks and renewed optimism over a potential India-US trade deal.
The Sensex opened with a positive gap of about 120 points at 79,344 and continued its upward trajectory throughout the session. It touched a fresh yearly high of 80,322 before settling at 80,218, up by 1,006 points, or 1.27 per cent.
The Nifty 50 also posted solid gains, moving between 24,054 and 24,355 during the day, and closed at 24,329, up by 289 points, or 1.2 per cent.
“On the higher end, 24,360 remains a resistance level. The Nifty might consolidate around the current range unless it decisively breaches this mark,” said Rupak De of LKP Securities. He added that a break above 24,360 could potentially push the index towards 24,550, aligning with the 61.80 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous decline from 26,277 to 21,743.
Banking heavyweights like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI were among the major contributors to the rally, together adding nearly 340 points to the Sensex — accounting for about 75 per cent of the day’s total gains.
Among individual gainers, stocks such as Sun Pharma, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Steel, SBI, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, and Larsen & Toubro advanced by 2–3 per cent.
However, a few counters faced losses. HCL Technologies, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, and Eternal declined, with HCL Technologies falling nearly 2 per cent.
In the broader markets, the BSE MidCap index climbed 1.4 per cent, while the SmallCap index edged higher by 0.4 per cent.
Sector-wise, most indices ended in the green, led by the BSE Oil and Gas index, which rose nearly 3 per cent. Banking, capital goods, auto, metal, and healthcare sectors also posted gains of over 1.5 per cent each.
Meanwhile, the rupee strengthened to 84.98 against the US dollar, appreciating by 0.25, supported by strong inflows into the capital markets, where key indices gained over 1.20 per cent, and the banking index rose by 1.41 per cent.

Title: Trump’s first 100 days: America First president is overturning the world order
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:30:56 +0000
Content: He has launched an unprecedented global tariff war and slashed U.S. foreign aid. He has disparaged NATO allies and embraced Russia’s narrative about its invasion of Ukraine. And he has spoken about annexing Greenland, retaking the Panama Canal and making Canada the 51st state.
In the chaotic first 100 days since President Donald Trump returned to office, he has waged an often unpredictable campaign that has upended parts of the rules-based world order that Washington helped build from the ashes of World War II.
“Trump is much more radical now than he was eight years ago,” said Elliott Abrams, a conservative who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush before being appointed U.S. special envoy on Iran and Venezuela in Trump’s first term. “I have been surprised.”
Trump’s second-term “America First” agenda has alienated friends and emboldened adversaries while raising questions about how far he is prepared to go. His actions, coupled with that uncertainty, have so unnerved some governments that they are responding in ways that could be difficult to undo, even if a more traditional U.S. president is elected in 2028.
All this comes amid what the Republican president’s critics see as signs of democratic backsliding at home that have raised concerns abroad. These include verbal attacks on judges, a pressure campaign against universities and the transfer of migrants to a notorious El Salvador prison as part of a broader deportation drive.
“What we’re seeing is a huge disruption in world affairs,” said Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. “No one is certain at this point what to make of what’s happening or what will come next.”
This assessment of Trump’s shakeup of the global system comes from Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials, foreign diplomats and independent analysts in Washington and capitals around the world.
he told me that he needs more weapons but he’s been saying that for three years you know he needs more weapons and we’re going I want to see what happens with respect to Russia, because Russia had been surprised.
Many say that while some of the damage already done could be long-lasting, the situation may not be beyond repair if Trump softens his approach. He has already backtracked on some issues, including the timing and severity of his tariffs.
But they see little chance of a dramatic shift by Trump and instead expect many countries to make lasting changes in their relationships with the U.S. to safeguard against his erratic policy-making.
The fallout has already begun.
Some European allies, for instance, are looking to boost their own defense industries to reduce reliance on U.S. weapons. Debate has intensified in South Korea about developing its own nuclear arsenal. And speculation has grown that deteriorating relations could prompt U.S. partners to move closer to China, at least economically.
The White House rejects the notion that Trump has hurt U.S. credibility, citing instead the need to clean up after what it calls former President Joe Biden’s “feckless leadership” on the world stage.
“President Trump is taking swift action to address challenges by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table to end their war, stemming the flow of fentanyl and protecting American workers by holding China accountable, getting Iran to the negotiating table by reimposing Maximum Pressure,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement.
He said Trump was also “making the Houthis pay for their terrorism … and securing our southern border that was open to invasion for four years.”
More than half of Americans, including one in five Republicans, think Trump is “too closely aligned” with Russia, and the American public has little appetite for the expansionist agenda he has laid out, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on April 21.
HIGH STAKES
At stake, say experts, is the future of a global system that has taken shape over the past eight decades largely under U.S. primacy. It has come to be based on free trade, rule of law and respect for territorial integrity.
But under Trump, who has been scornful of multilateral organizations and often views global affairs through the transactional lens of a former real estate developer, that world order is being shaken up.
Accusing trading partners of “ripping off” the U.S. for decades, Trump has set in motion a sweeping tariffs policy that has roiled financial markets, weakened the dollar and triggered warnings of a slowdown in worldwide economic output and increased risk of recession.
Trump has called the tariffs necessary “medicine” but his objectives remain unclear even as his administration works to negotiate separate deals with dozens of countries.
At the same time, he has all but reversed U.S. policy on Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine and engaged in an Oval Office shouting match with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in late February. He has warmed to Moscow and stirred fears that he will force NATO-backed Kyiv to accept the loss of territory while he prioritizes improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The administration’s belittling of Europe and NATO, long the central pillar of transatlantic security but accused by Trump and his aides of freeloading off the U.S., has caused deep unease.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, after winning February’s election, expressed concern about European relations with the United States, saying it would be difficult if those who put “America First” actually made their motto “America Alone”.
“This really is five minutes to midnight for Europe,” Merz said.
In a further blow to Washington’s global image, Trump has employed expansionist rhetoric long avoided by modern-day presidents, which some analysts say could be used by China as justification if it decides to invade self-governed Taiwan.
With his blustery style, he has insisted that the U.S. will “get” Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish island. He has angered Canada by saying it has little reason to exist and should become part of the U.S. He has threatened to seize the Panama Canal, which was handed over to Panama in 1999. And he has proposed that Washington take over war-ravaged Gaza and transform the Palestinian enclave into a Riviera-style resort.
Some analysts say Trump may be seeking to resurrect a Cold War-style global structure in which big powers carve up geographic spheres of influence.
Even so, he has offered no details on how the U.S. could acquire more territory, and some experts suggest he may be assuming extreme and even over-the-top positions as bargaining ploys.
But some countries are taking him seriously.
“When you demand to take over a part of the Kingdom of Denmark’s territory, when we are met by pressure and by threats from our closest ally, what are we to believe in about the country that we have admired for so many years?” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a news conference in Greenland in early April. “This is about the world order that we have built together across the Atlantic over generations.”
COPING WITH TRUMP 2.0
Other governments are also beginning to recalibrate.
The European Union — which Trump has claimed, without evidence, was formed to “screw” the U.S. — has prepared a range of retaliatory tariffs if negotiations fail.
Some countries such as Germany and France are looking at spending more on their militaries, something Trump has demanded but which could also mean investing more in their own defense industries and buying fewer arms from the U.S.
With its historic friendship with the U.S. now strained, Canada is seeking to strengthen economic and security links to Europe. This comes against the backdrop of Canada’s national elections on Monday dominated by voter resentment of Trump’s actions, which have triggered a nationalist wave and fueled perceptions that the U.S. is no longer a reliable partner.
South Korea, too, has been rattled by Trump’s policies, including his threats to withdraw U.S. troops. But Seoul has vowed to try to work with Trump and preserve the alliance it regards as critical against the threat of nuclear-armed North Korea.
U.S. ally Japan is also on edge. It was taken by surprise by the magnitude of Trump’s tariffs and “is now scrambling to respond,” said a senior Japanese government official close to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
A key question is whether some governments will quietly hedge their bets by forging closer trade ties to China, Trump’s number one tariff target.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing in early April, and China said recently it exchanged views with the EU on bolstering economic cooperation.
Beijing has cast itself as a solution for nations that feel bullied by Trump’s trade approach, despite its own record of sometimes predatory practices internationally, and is also trying to fill the vacuum left by his cuts in humanitarian aid.
Aaron David Miller, a former veteran U.S. diplomat in Republican and Democratic administrations, said it’s not too late for Trump to shift course on foreign policy, especially if he begins to feel pressure from fellow Republicans uneasy over economic risks as they seek to retain control of Congress in next year’s mid-term elections.
If Trump holds firm, the next president could try to re-establish Washington’s role as guarantor of the world order, but the obstacles could be steep.
“What’s happening is not yet beyond the point of no return,” said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “But how much damage is being done now to our relations with friends and how much adversaries will be probably incalculable.

Title: India signs ₹63,000 crore Rafale Marine aircraft deal with France
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:28:07 +0000
Content: India and France on Monday signed a ₹63,000 crore defence agreement for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine combat aircraft.
 
The agreement was signed at the Defence Ministry headquarters at South Block in New Delhi, the Indian Navy said. The Cabinet Committee on Security had approved the deal earlier this month.
 
Representing France was its Ambassador to India, while Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh led the Indian delegation. The Defence Ministers of both countries also attended the signing ceremony remotely. The French Defence Minister was initially scheduled to attend in person but had to cancel his visit due to personal reasons.
 
The Indian Navy urgently requires new carrier-borne fighter jets to replace its aging MiG-29K fleet, which has faced operational challenges due to maintenance issues. The newly acquired Rafale Marine aircraft are expected to be deployed aboard INS Vikrant, India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier currently in service.
 
The government-to-government contract includes the purchase of 22 single-seater and four twin-seater Rafale M jets, specially configured to meet Indian requirements and integrate with Indian aircraft carriers.
 
This procurement serves as an interim solution until India develops its own carrier-borne fighter aircraft. The contract also includes a comprehensive package covering maintenance support, logistics, training, and the manufacturing of indigenous components.
 
The Rafale M jets will operate alongside the existing MiG-29K fleet on INS Vikrant, enhancing the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities.
 
The Indian Air Force already operates 36 Rafale aircraft acquired through a separate deal signed in 2016, with squadrons based in Ambala and Hasimara.
 
With the new acquisition, India’s Rafale fleet will grow to 62 aircraft, significantly strengthening its inventory of 4.5-generation fighter jets. (ANI)

Title: Canada’s Liberal Party takes early lead in national election
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 02:15:46 +0000
Content: Canada’s ruling Liberal Party took an early lead in national elections on Tuesday, winning 19 of the first 25 seats announced, with counting underway for the remaining 313 seats.
The Liberals were ahead in six more constituencies, while the opposition Conservative Party had won six seats and was leading in another six in voting for the 338-seat House of Commons.
The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, had not won or led in any seat. Singh has been accused by critics of sympathising with the Khalistan movement, a charge he denies.
Polls before Monday’s vote showed the Liberals with a narrow lead of just under 3 percentage points over the Conservatives, according to the government-funded Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, projections suggested the Liberals could secure a strong lead in seat count.
Mark Carney, who succeeded Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader, would remain prime minister if the party wins a majority.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had gained support amid dissatisfaction with Trudeau’s government, with some polls forecasting a landslide Conservative win.
However, a tariff dispute initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump, who also threatened to annex Canada, appeared to shift voter sentiment. Poilievre’s ideological closeness to Trump prompted some Canadians to rally behind the Liberals, who campaigned on a nationalist platform.
The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.
While polling stations closed in eastern and central Canada, voting continued in western provinces due to the country’s multiple time zones.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to participate in the YUGM Conclave on April 29 at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. The event, scheduled to begin at 11 AM, will see the Prime Minister address a gathering of stakeholders from government, academia, industry, and the innovation sector.
The YUGM Conclave—short for “confluence” in Sanskrit—is a landmark initiative designed to propel India’s innovation ecosystem forward. It marks a strategic collaboration involving a joint investment of approximately ₹1,400 crore from the Wadhwani Foundation and key government institutions. The conclave aims to be a pivotal moment in realizing the Prime Minister’s vision of a self-reliant, innovation-driven India.
Several high-impact projects will be launched during the event. These include the establishment of “Superhubs” at IIT Kanpur and IIT Bombay, focusing on artificial intelligence and biosciences respectively. In addition, Wadhwani Innovation Network (WIN) Centers will be set up at premier research institutions to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial application. A significant collaboration with the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) will also be announced to fund late-stage innovation and research translation.
The conclave will feature a series of high-level roundtables and panel discussions bringing together top government officials, industry leaders, and academic experts. The agenda will focus on enabling rapid commercialization of research, fostering academia-industry-government partnerships, and scaling up private investment in innovation.
One of the highlights of the event will be a Deep Tech Startup Showcase, which will spotlight groundbreaking innovations from across India. The conclave is expected to serve as a launchpad for new partnerships and cross-sector collaborations.
With its forward-looking agenda, the YUGM Conclave is positioned to support national missions such as ANRF, AICTE Innovation, and the broader vision of Viksit Bharat@2047 by strengthening India’s capacity in frontier technologies and democratizing access to innovation.

Title: Putin announces May 8-10 ceasefire, Ukraine wants truce now
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 15:24:29 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday declared a three-day ceasefire in May in the war with Ukraine to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies in World War Two.
The Kremlin said the 72-hour ceasefire would run on May 8, May 9 – when Putin will host international leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping for lavish celebrations to commemorate victory over Nazi Germany – and May 10.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, in response, said: “If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately. Why wait until May 8th?”
A ceasefire should be “real, not just for a parade,” he posted on X.
The White House said President Donald Trump wanted a permanent ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
Against a background of increasing U.S. impatience, Putin’s move appeared aimed at signalling that Russia is still interested in peace – something that Ukraine and its European allies dispute.
“All military actions are suspended for this period. Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example,” the Kremlin said in a statement on the May 8-10 ceasefire.
“In the event of violations by the Ukrainian side, Russia’s armed forces will give an adequate and effective response.”
It was the second unilateral truce announcement that Putin has made in quick succession, following a 30-hour Easter ceasefire that each side accused the other of violating countless times.
It came after Trump criticised Putin for a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv last week and voiced concern at the weekend that Putin was “just tapping me along”. Washington has repeatedly threatened to abandon its peace efforts unless there is real progress.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who met Trump on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome on Saturday, has said Kyiv would be ready to hold talks with Moscow once a ceasefire deal has stopped the fighting.
Ukraine’s Sybiha said Kyiv had been “constantly proposing” a ceasefire for at least 30 days. Russia has said it wants a full settlement, not a pause.
‘TALKS WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS’
The Kremlin statement said: “The Russian side once again declares its readiness for peace talks without preconditions, aimed at eliminating the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, and constructive interaction with international partners.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier that the signal for direct talks should come from Ukraine, as it currently had a “legal ban” on negotiating with Putin.
He was referring to a 2022 decree in which Zelenskiy ruled out such negotiations, after Russia had claimed four Ukrainian regions as its own in an action condemned as illegal by most countries at the United Nations.
Ukraine accuses Russia of playing for time in order to try to seize more of its territory, and has urged greater international pressure to get Moscow to stop fighting.
Russia accuses Ukraine of being unwilling to make any concessions and of seeking a ceasefire only on its own terms.
Trump on Sunday urged Russia to stop its attacks in Ukraine and suggested Zelenskiy was ready to give up Crimea, which Russia seized from it in 2014.
Zelenskiy said earlier this month that doing so would violate Ukraine’s constitution. Kyiv has not commented on Trump’s comments on Sunday regarding Crimea.

Title: Nepal plans to restrict Everest permits to experienced climbers
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:43:44 +0000
Content: Nepal will issue Everest permits only to climbers with experience of scaling at least one of the Himalayan nation’s 7,000-metre (22,965 ft) peaks, according to the draft of a new law aimed at reducing overcrowding and improving safety.
Nepal, which is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking and tourism for foreign exchange, has faced criticism for permitting too many climbers, including inexperienced ones, to try to ascend the 8,849-metre (29,032 ft) peak.
This often results in long queues of climbers in the ‘death Zone’, an area below the summit with insufficient natural oxygen for survival.
Overcrowding has been blamed for the high number of deaths on the mountain. At least 12 climbers died, and another five went missing on Everest’s slopes in 2023 when Nepal issued 478 permits. Eight climbers died last year.
Under the proposed law, an Everest permit would be issued only after a climber provides evidence of having climbed at least one 7,000-metre mountain in Nepal.
“The sardar, or the head of local staff, and the mountain guide accompanying climbers must also be Nepali citizens.
The draft law has been registered at the National Assembly, the upper house of parliament, where the ruling alliance holds a majority required to pass the bill.
International expedition operators have urged Nepal to allow any 7,000-metre peak, not just those in the Himalayan nation, for the Everest permit.
That wouldn’t make any sense. And I would also add mountains that are close to 7,000 metres to that list and that are widely used as preparation, like Ama Dablam, Aconcagua, Denali and others,” said Lukas Furtenbach of Austria-based expedition organiser, Furtenbach Adventures.
Furtenbach, currently leading an expedition on Everest, said mountain guides from other countries must also be allowed to work on Everest, as there are not enough qualified Nepali mountain guides.
“It is important that mountain guides have a qualification like IFMGA (International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations), no matter what nationality they are. We do also welcome Nepali IFMGA guides to work in the Alps in Europe,” he told media.
Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering also said a 6,500-metre peak anywhere in the world would be a better idea.
“It’s too difficult to find a reasonable 7,000-metre plus peak in Nepal,” Madison said.
There are over 400 mountain peaks in Nepal which are open to expeditions – of them, 74 are higher than 7,000 metres, according to tourism department data.
However, not many of those peaks are popular among climbers, hiking officials said.
“Only a few of the 7,000 metre mountains attract climbers,” said Tashi Lhakpa Sherpa of the 14 Peaks Expedition, a major expedition organising company in Nepal. Tashi has climbed Everest eight times.

Title: DeepSeek available to download again in South Korea after suspension
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:35:20 +0000
Content: Chinese artificial intelligence service DeepSeek became available again on South Korean app markets on Monday for the first time in about two months, when downloads were suspended after authorities cited breaches in data protection rules.
South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission said on Thursday that DeepSeek transferred user data and prompts without permission when the service first launched in South Korea in January.
Downloading the app was suspended in February after the questions over personal data protection surfaced, but the service was available for download again on South Korea’s app market including via Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store.
“We process your personal information in compliance with the Personal Information Protection Act of Korea,” DeepSeek said in a revised privacy policy note applied to the app.
DeepSeek said users had the option to refuse to allow the transfer of personal information to a number of companies in China and the United States.
DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
South Korea’s data protection agency said DeepSeek had voluntarily decided to make the app available for download, which it is free to do after at least partially reflecting its recommendations.

Title: India’s index of industrial production grows by 3% in March 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:59:37 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on Monday released the Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for March 2025, reporting a year-on-year growth of 3%. This comes slightly higher than the revised figure of 2.9% for February 2025. The IIP, calculated with base year 2011–12=100, stood at 164.8 in March 2025 compared to 160.0 in March 2024.
Among the three major sectors, electricity production showed the most robust growth at 6.3%, followed by manufacturing at 3.0% and mining at 0.4%. The sectoral indices for March 2025 were 156.8 for mining, 160.9 for manufacturing, and 217.1 for electricity.
The manufacturing sector saw positive contributions from 13 of the 23 industry groups at the 2-digit NIC level. Leading the growth were “Manufacture of electrical equipment” with a remarkable 15.7% rise, “Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers” at 10.3%, and “Manufacture of basic metals” which increased by 6.9%. Within these categories, specific products like electric heaters, small transformers, and auto components played a significant role in driving growth.
Under the use-based classification, Infrastructure/Construction Goods led the momentum with an 8.8% increase, followed by Primary Goods at 3.1%, and Consumer Durables at 6.6%. However, Consumer Non-Durables experienced a contraction, declining by 4.7% compared to March 2024. The indices for these use-based categories stood at 168.2 for Primary Goods, 134.8 for Capital Goods, 173.1 for Intermediate Goods, 212.3 for Infrastructure/Construction Goods, 138.5 for Consumer Durables, and 147.9 for Consumer Non-Durables.
The cumulative average IIP for the financial year April 2024 to March 2025 registered a growth of 4.0%, with sectoral contributions of 2.9% in mining, 3.9% in manufacturing, and 5.1% in electricity. This marks a slight slowdown from the 5.9% growth recorded in the previous financial year.
Within the detailed industry-wise data, notable growth was seen in “Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products” (21.5%), and “Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.” (8.0%). Some sectors like “Manufacture of pharmaceuticals” and “Manufacture of food products” posted negative growth rates of -4.6% and -8.0% respectively, reflecting industry-specific challenges.
This month’s IIP Quick Estimate is based on a weighted response rate of 88%, while the finalized figures for December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025 reflect updated data with response rates of 95%, 94%, and 94%, respectively.

Title: Canadians vote in election dominated by concerns about Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:16:52 +0000
Content: Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Carney briefly paused his campaign, and both he and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre mentioned the tragedy in their final campaign events.
It was unclear if the mass casualty event would have any impact on the election. Duane Bratt, professor of political science at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said he did not expect it to deter voters.
Carney’s Liberals held a four-point lead over Poilievre’s Conservatives in separate polls by Ipsos and Angus Reid, suggesting little movement in the final days. Ipsos on Sunday pegged the Liberals at 42% support and the Conservatives at 38%.
Angus Reid’s Saturday poll placed the Liberals at 44% support, over the Conservatives’ 40% support.
Those results would likely produce a fourth consecutive Liberal mandate, but Carney might only win a minority of seats in the 343-seat House of Commons, leaving him reliant on smaller parties to govern.
Trump re-emerged as a campaign factor last week, declaring that he might raise a 25% tariff on Canadian-made cars because the U.S. does not want them. He said earlier he might use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.
“This is probably the most consequential election in my lifetime,” said Kelly Saunders, a political science professor at Brandon University. “Everything has been so overshadowed by the threats coming out of the United States.”
Carney has emphasized his experience handling economic issues makes him the best leader to deal with Trump, while Poilievre has tapped into concerns about the cost of living, crime and a housing crisis.
“I’m probably going to go Carney on this one just because right now, I feel like we need stability,” said Andy Hill, 37, a Vancouver-based mortgage broker and co-founder of mortgage marketplace EveryRate. “Being in the English banking system and being in the Canadian banking system, he really understands the economy.”
Bob Lowe, a 66-year-old cattle rancher who lives south of Calgary, said he has already cast his ballot for the Conservatives. He said his top concern is Canada’s flagging economic growth.
The economy had seen a fledgling recovery until the U.S. imposed tariffs.
Carney has sought to distance himself from former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was deeply unpopular when he said in January he would resign after nearly a decade in power. The Conservatives led polls by some 20 points around that time.
CONSERVATIVES FOCUS ON ECONOMY
Lowe said the Conservatives have focused on the economy all along, and that he believes the Liberals have been stoking Canadians’ anxieties about Trump to win another term.
“Poilievre has managed to keep the focus on the economy and a strong Canada, and Carney’s campaign is based on fear. That’s it in a nutshell,” Lowe said.
Saunders, however, predicts the Liberals will win a majority of seats, and says it would take a “magical scenario” for the Conservatives to pull off a victory. Tensions with the U.S. have caused supporters of two smaller parties, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals.
A party needs to win 172 electoral districts, called ridings or seats, to form a majority government that does not rely on smaller parties’ support to stay in power.
Much of the Conservative support is in rural areas where there are fewer seats.
Carney, who covered more than 20 cities in his last week of campaigning, has appeared tired but tried to maintain his exuberance at rallies, attended by 1,000 to 2,000 people, according to party figures.
Poilievre’s rallies have been bigger.
Standing on Sunday in front of the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor’s Canadian auto hub with Detroit across the border, Carney pointed to the bridge as a symbol of peace and cooperation between the two countries for almost a century.
“That has changed, and it wasn’t us who did the changing … President Trump, the guy over there,” Carney said. “He’s launched a trade war that has literally ruptured the global economy, and in the process, he’s betrayed us.”
Carney’s rallies have attracted mostly older Canadians and featured placards saying “Jamais Le 51” (“Never 51”) – a reference to Trump’s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state – and “Un Canada Fort” (“A Strong Canada”).
Mentions of Trump have been loudly booed.
Poilievre has attracted more young voters than usual for the Conservatives.
“Time is running out, only one more day to bring home change so that Canadians can afford food and homes and live on safe streets,” Poilievre said at a rally in Oakville, Ontario on Sunday.
Election results will trickle in, starting in eastern provinces, after polls close at staggered times on Monday evening. Ballots are counted by hand.

Title: Nawaz advises PM Shehbaz Sharif against aggressive stance on India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:43:25 +0000
Content: Three-time Prime Minister of Pakistan and founder of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Nawaz Sharif, has urged his younger brother and current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to avoid adopting an aggressive posture towards India. He emphasized the need to utilize all diplomatic avenues to restore peace between the two countries.
The two leaders met in Lahore on Sunday evening, where Shehbaz Sharif briefed Nawaz Sharif on the measures taken by his government following the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, particularly in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after the Pahalgam attack.
According to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz detailed how Pakistan had reciprocated New Delhi’s actions, including the closure of its airspace to India, and informed his brother about the country’s preparedness to respond to any Indian aggression.
“India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty has dangerously increased the risk of conflict in the region,” a source quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
In response, Nawaz Sharif advised restraint and stressed the importance of pursuing diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has proposed the formation of an international commission—comprising representatives from the United States, Russia, China, and Britain—to investigate the Pahalgam attack. He asserted that Pakistan is ready to present evidence implicating India in the Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan and alleged links with anti-Pakistan groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Even though we know it was a false flag operation, we are willing to cooperate with any international inquiry to expose the truth. However, if India proceeds with any misadventure, it will see Pakistan’s preparedness,” said Khawaja Asif.

Title: ‘Make in India’ booster: HMD Global to launch direct-to-mobile phones in India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:17:23 +0000
Content: In a major step towards advancing India’s technological landscape, HMD Global, in collaboration with FreeStream Technologies (incubated at IIT Kanpur), Tejas Networks, and other partners, has unveiled plans to address the growing demand for Direct-to-Mobile (D2M) phones in the country. The announcement will be officially made at the ‘World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025,’ set to take place from May 1-4 in Mumbai.
D2M technology represents a breakthrough in next-generation broadcasting by enabling the delivery of OTT and live TV, video, audio, and text messages directly to mobile phones without relying on Wi-Fi or internet services.
This innovation aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ and further strengthens the ‘Make in India’ initiative.
As part of this effort, affordable feature phones, smartphones, and tablets powered by Tejas Networks will be manufactured. These devices are being developed using the innovative SL-3000 chipset from Saankhya Labs, which serves as the cornerstone for enabling the D2M platform.
Over the years, this technology has undergone extensive testing in live networks by Prasar Bharati in partnership with IIT Kanpur and Tejas Networks.
Ravi Kunwar, VP and CEO of HMD India and APAC, said, “This pioneering platform will allow consumers to access a vast range of multimedia content directly on their devices.”
Sumeet Nindrajog, Director of FreeStream Technologies, highlighted the transformative nature of the D2M technology, adding, “This technology is set to revolutionize how content and data are consumed by users.”
He further stated that the collaboration with HMD will help lay the foundation for a robust device ecosystem, which will play a key role in the nationwide rollout of D2M services.
Parag Naik, co-founder of the former Saankhya Labs and Executive Vice President of Tejas Networks, elaborated on the potential of D2M: “The technology would allow the delivery of targeted ads, educational content, emergency alerts, and more, aligning with the government’s vision for a digitally empowered India,” Naik mentioned.
Chris Ripley, President and CEO of Sinclair, Inc., also shared his enthusiasm for the project, stating, “We’re proud to be at the forefront of global deployment and look forward to collaborating with partners like HMD in making India a hub for next-generation broadcast technology.”

Title: Canada’s Liberals win minority government; Carney says old relationship with US ‘is over’
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 07:23:22 +0000
Content: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals retained power in the country’s election on Monday, but fell short of the majority government he had wanted to help him negotiate tariffs with U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Liberals were leading or elected in 167 electoral districts, known as seats, followed by the Conservatives with 145, with votes still being counted.
 
The Liberals had needed to win 172 of the House of Commons’ 343 seats for a majority that would allow them to govern without support from a smaller party.
 
“Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increasing integration, is over,” Carney said in a victory speech in Ottawa. “The system of open global trade anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over.”
 
“These are tragedies, but it’s also our new reality.”
 
Carney said the coming months would be challenging and require sacrifices.
 
Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a polling firm, told Reuters the Liberal win hinged on three factors.
 
“It was the ‘anybody-but-Conservative’ factor, it was the Trump tariff factor, and then it was the Trudeau departure … which enabled a lot of left-of-center voters and traditional Liberal voters to come back to the party,” Kurl said, referring to the resignation of unpopular former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
 
Carney had promised a tough approach with Washington over its import tariffs and said Canada would need to spend billions to reduce its reliance on the U.S. But the right-of-center Conservatives, who called for change after more than nine years of Liberal rule, showed unexpected strength.
 
Minority governments in Canada rarely last longer than 2-1/2 years.
 
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat to Carney’s Liberals and said his party would hold the government to account.
 
“America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” Carney said. “These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ever happen.”
 
WAVE OF PATRIOTISM
 
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
 
Trump re-emerged as a campaign factor last week, declaring that he might raise a 25% tariff on Canadian-made cars because the U.S. does not want them. He said earlier he might use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st state.
 
Carney has emphasized that his experience handling economic issues makes him the best leader to deal with Trump, while Poilievre tapped into concerns about the cost of living, crime and a housing crisis.
 
Trump, in a social media post on Monday, reiterated his call for Canada to become the 51st state.
 
“Good luck to the Great people of Canada,” he said. “Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America. No more artificially drawn line from many years ago.”
 
Tensions with the U.S. have caused supporters of two smaller parties, the left-leaning New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh conceded defeat in his own district and said he planned to quit as party leader.
 
The Conservatives appeared on track to make gains in the seat-rich Toronto area to prevent a Liberal majority government, but Poilievre was trailing in his own Ottawa-area district, with votes still being counted.
“We didn’t quite get over the finish line yet,” Poilievre told his supporters in Ottawa. “We know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time.”
 
The Liberals are the last party to win four consecutive elections in Canada, accomplishing the feat in 2004.
Poilievre focused his campaign on domestic issues and the need to fix a country that he said the Liberals had “broken.”

Title: Death toll in Iran’s Bandar Abbas port blast rises to 70
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 06:31:47 +0000
Content: The death toll from a major explosion in Iran’s most important container port of Bandar Abbas rose to at least 70, with over 1,200 injured, state media said on Monday, as firefighters battled a blaze that Iranian officials said was now under control 48 hours after the start of the fire.
 
Saturday’s blast took place in the Shahid Rajaee section of the port, Iran’s biggest container hub. Efforts to put out the ensuing blaze have continued since with sporadic fires breaking out due to wind and flammable goods in the containers, some releasing toxic emissions in the area, according to state media.
 
“After putting the huge fire under control, rescue operations are underway” Iran’s state media said, citing the governor of Hormozgan Province, in which Bandar Abbas is situated. “Removing containers could take up to two weeks”, it added.
 
Iran’s ISNA news agency cited its interior minister Eskandar Momeni as saying national operations to confront the fire in Shahid Rajaee had ended and the management of firefighting had been handed over to local authorities.
 
“Shortcomings in regards to not respecting security protocols have been identified and some of the individuals at fault have been summoned”, Momeni said, according to state media.
 
An initial report by the investigative committee charged with the incident found shortcomings in adherence to principles of civil defence and security.
 
Around 22 people are missing and 22 bodies have not been identified yet, state TV cited the governor of Hormozgan as saying.
 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday ordered an investigation to “uncover any negligence or intent” behind the incident, an indication that authorities are not ruling out sabotage.
 
The incident occurred as Iran began a third round of nuclear talks with the United States in Oman, but there was no indication of a link between the two events.
 
Iran’s Infrastructure Communications Company said on Monday that a large cyber attack against the country’s infrastructure had been repelled a day after the blast, without providing more detail.
 
Poor storage of chemicals in containers is suspected of having caused the explosion. A spokesperson for the crisis management organisation said on Saturday that earlier warnings had highlighted potential safety risks at the port.
 
Iran’s defence ministry dismissed on Sunday international media reports suggesting the blast may be linked to the mishandling of solid fuel used for missiles.

Title: Jammu and Kashmir govt tightens security, shuts 48 tourist spots
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 06:19:04 +0000
Content: The Jammu and Kashmir government announced on Tuesday that 48 tourist destinations across the Valley have been closed to visitors in an effort to tighten security after last week’s attack on tourists.
In the April 22 attack, terrorists opened fire on tourists in Baisaran near Pahalgam, killing 26 people, including a local resident and a Nepali national, in what reports indicate was a targeted assault on Hindu men.
Kashmir has a total of 87 tourist destinations, of which 48 have now been closed. According to an official, the remaining 39 destinations have been provided with enhanced security.
Following the attack, there has been a significant drop in tourist arrivals. The number of passengers arriving at Srinagar airport has notably declined.
The killing of tourists in Pahalgam has triggered nationwide outrage, with people across the country strongly condemning the barbaric attack.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed that the terrorists, their backers, and handlers will be hunted down and face punishment “beyond their imagination.”
In response to the attack, security forces have demolished 10 houses belonging to active terrorists, including those of Adil Hussain Thoker and Asif Sheikh — both believed to be responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack.
On Monday, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly passed a unanimous resolution condemning the attack. The resolution described it as heinous, barbaric, inhumane, and cowardly, highlighting that such acts of terror directly undermine the ethos of Kashmiriyat, the values of the Constitution, and the spirit of unity, peace, and harmony. The Assembly expressed solidarity with the victims and extended condolences to their families.

Title: Pak exposed as rogue state fuelling global terrorism: India at UN
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:45:52 +0000
Content: India has strongly condemned Pakistan at the United Nations, accusing it of fuelling global terrorism in the wake of the recent Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives, including 25 tourists and one local resident.
Speaking at the launch of the Victims of Terrorism Association Network (VoTAN) in New York, India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Yojna Patel, drew global attention to a Pakistani minister’s public admission of supporting terrorism. She referred to Pakistan Defence Minister Khwaja Asif’s recent television interview, where he acknowledged that Pakistan had backed terrorist activities for decades.
“The whole world has heard Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khwaja Asif admitting and confessing Pakistan’s history of supporting, training, and funding terrorist organisations. This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as a rogue state fuelling global terrorism and destabilising the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye,” Ambassador Patel said.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, has been described as the deadliest assault on civilians since the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. Ambassador Patel underlined that India has long suffered from cross-border terrorism and understands the deep and lasting impact such attacks have on victims, their families, and societies.
Khwaja Asif, responding to questions in the interview shortly after the Pahalgam incident, said, “We have been doing this dirty work for the US for the past three decades, including the West and the UK,” acknowledging Pakistan’s role in supporting terrorism under the guise of foreign alliances.
Ambassador Patel also criticized Pakistan for misusing international platforms to spread propaganda and make baseless allegations against India. She expressed India’s appreciation for the global solidarity received after the Pahalgam attack, calling it a strong reflection of the international community’s zero tolerance for terrorism.
“This is a testimony to the international community’s zero tolerance for terrorism. We reiterate that terrorism in all its forms must be condemned unequivocally,” she said.
Highlighting the significance of the newly launched VoTAN initiative, Ambassador Patel said it would create a structured and safe platform for victims to be heard and supported. She added, “India believes that initiatives like VoTAN are essential to strengthening the global response to terrorism, ensuring that victims remain at the centre of our collective efforts.”

Title: First batch of Hong Kong democrats freed after 4 years’ jail for subversion
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:33:14 +0000
Content: The first batch of individuals jailed in the landmark Hong Kong national security trial of “47 democrats” accused of conspiracy to commit subversion was freed on Tuesday after being behind bars for more than four years.
Four former pro-democracy lawmakers, including Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Gary Fan were driven away from three separate prisons across Hong Kong around dawn. Security was tight with patrols of police officers, and access to some roads to the prisons restricted for hours beforehand.
A Reuters witness outside the maximum security Stanley Prison, where Kwok and Tam were held, was told by a police officer they had left.
Vehicles were also seen leaving the more remote Shek Pik Prison on Lantau Island and a women’s correctional institution at Lo Wu close to the border with China.
Police blocked access to two roads leading to the entrance of Shek Kip Prison, so media could only stand on a bridge next to a reservoir overlooking the ocean-facing facility.
Fan, speaking to the press when he arrived at his home early on Tuesday, said: “I will go back home and reunite with family. Thank you HongKongers”.
Philip Bowring, Mo’s husband, said she was calm on her return home and needed time to rest, local media reported.
Since large and sustained pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong for most of 2019, China has cracked down on the democratic opposition as well as liberal civil society and media outlets under sweeping national security laws.
The 47 pro-democracy campaigners were arrested and charged in early 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion under a Beijing-imposed national law which carried sentences of up to life in prison.
Forty-five of these were convicted following a marathon trial, with sentences of up to 10 years. Only two were acquitted.
All four had been denied bail since being charged and were remanded in custody for nearly two years before the trial kicked off in early 2023. All four had pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to four years and two months imprisonment.
Mo, Kwok and Tam were former members of the Civic Party, once one of Hong Kong’s leading pro-democracy parties, which was disbanded in early 2024 amid the national security crackdown.
Mo resigned from the Civic Party in 2016 and founded the localist group HK First with Fan of the Neo Democrats.
The democrats were found guilty of organising an unofficial “primary election” in 2020 to select candidates for a legislative election. Prosecutors accused the activists of plotting to paralyse the government by engaging in potentially disruptive acts had they been elected.
Western governments including the U.S. called the trial politically motivated and had demanded the democrats be freed.
Hong Kong and Beijing, however, say all are equal under the national security laws and the democrats received a fair trial.

Title: National Archives of India acquires private papers of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:31:04 +0000
Content: The National Archives of India (NAI) has significantly enriched its repository of historical records with the acquisition of the private papers of former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The collection, donated by members of Dr. Kalam’s family, offers a rare and intimate glimpse into the life and legacy of one of India’s most revered statesmen and scientists.
According to the Ministry of Culture, the collection includes original correspondences, Dr. Kalam’s passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, detailed tour reports, several original photographs, and transcripts of lectures delivered at various universities and organizations.
The formal handover took place in the presence of Dr. Kalam’s niece, Dr. APJM Nazema Maraikayar, and grandnephews A.P.J.M.J. Sheik Saleem and A.P.J.M.J. Sheik Dawood. Also in attendance was his nephew A.P.J.M. Jainulabudeen. The agreement was signed by Arun Singhal (IAS), Director-General of the National Archives of India, and Dr. Maraikayar, further cementing the collection’s place in the national record.
The National Archives of India, operating under the Public Records Act of 1993, is the official custodian of the non-current records of the Government of India. In addition to government files, it maintains a rich and diverse collection of private papers of eminent Indians from various walks of life, serving as a vital resource for researchers, historians, and the general public.
Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (1931–2015), popularly known as the “Missile Man of India,” served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. A native of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose to national prominence for his pioneering work in India’s missile and nuclear programs, particularly his involvement in the 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests. His scientific contributions through institutions such as DRDO and ISRO have had a lasting impact on India’s defense and space capabilities.
Awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour, Dr. Kalam was not only a distinguished scientist but also a beloved educator and author. His books—including Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020—continue to inspire generations of Indians, especially the youth. Fondly remembered as the “People’s President,” he remained committed to education and youth empowerment until his final moments, passing away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture.

Title: India clinch thriller against South Africa, top Points Table in women’s Tri-Nation series
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:52:05 +0000
Content: In the second match of the Women’s Tri-Nation Tournament, India edged out South Africa in a nail-biting contest, securing a 15-run victory. With this win, Team India leads the points table with four points, having won both of their matches against hosts Sri Lanka and now South Africa.
Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur continued her good run with the coin, just like in the opening match. This time, however, she chose to set a target rather than chase. India posted a competitive total of 276/6 in 50 overs.
The foundation for the total was laid by young opener Pratika Rawal, who continued her excellent form. She shared an 83-run opening stand with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana, who contributed a steady 36 before being dismissed by Annerie Dercksen.
Pratika then stitched together another crucial 68-run partnership with Harleen Deol for the second wicket. She went on to score a blistering 76, showcasing both skill and temperament.
Captain Harmanpreet Kaur played a vital anchoring role with an unbeaten 41, while Jemimah Rodrigues added a quickfire 41 off 32 balls. Richa Ghosh further boosted the total with a cameo of 24 off just 14 deliveries.
For South Africa, Nonkululeko Mlaba was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets. Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Nadine de Klerk, and Annerie Dercksen picked up a wicket each.
Chasing 277, South Africa got off to a strong start, thanks to their openers — captain Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits — who put on a solid 140-run stand in 27.1 overs. The Indian medium-pace duo of Kashvi Gautam and Arundhati Reddy struggled to break the partnership early on.
The breakthrough came via experienced all-rounder Deepti Sharma, who dismissed Wolvaardt for 43. While Brits continued to hold one end, wickets began to fall regularly at the other.
India’s recalled off-spinner for the series, Sneh Rana, turned the match decisively with a superb spell. She picked up five key wickets, applying the brakes to South Africa’s momentum. She was deservedly named Player of the Match for her brilliant fifer.
South Africa was eventually bowled out for 261 in 48.3 overs, falling short by 15 runs.
Brief Scores:
India 276/6 in 50 overs
(Pratika Rawal 76, Harmanpreet Kaur 41*, Jemimah Rodrigues 41; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2/45)
South Africa 261 all out in 48.3 overs
(Tazmin Brits 84, Laura Wolvaardt 43; Sneh Rana 5/42, Deepti Sharma 2/37)
Result: India won by 15 runs
Player of the Match: Sneh Rana
Next Match: South Africa face hosts Sri Lanka on Friday.

Title: PM Modi congratulates Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Trinidad and Tobago election victory
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:06:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Kamla Persad-Bissessar for securing a win in the elections held in Trinidad and Tobago and said that he looked forward to working with her to strengthen the partnership for shared prosperity and the well-being of the people of the two nations.
This win marks the comeback of Persad-Bissesar, 73, who served as the Prime Minister from 2010-2015.
In a post shared on X, PM Modi stated, “Heartiest congratulations @MPKamla on your victory in the elections. We cherish our historically close and familial ties with Trinidad and Tobago. I look forward to working closely with you to further strengthen our partnership for shared prosperity and well-being of our people.”
UNC political leader and Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister-elect Kamla Persad Bissessar secured the win in the 2025 general election. At 10:10 p.m. (local time) on April 28, the United National Congress (UNC) defeated the PNM government, with PNM political leader Keith Rowley stating that if the voting trends held, the PNM would be entering the Opposition with 10 to 12 seats, local newspaper Trinidad and Tobago Newsday reported.
Speaking from her constituency office in Siparia, Kamla Persad-Bissessar urged UNC supporters not to be boastful or arrogant as the vote counting was underway. She said, “We have a lot of work to do, so we are heading up now to (UNC) party headquarters.”
She said the UNC held its 19 seats and flipped several seats previously held by the PNM. However, she did not want to declare any of these flipped seats since counting was still underway. She said TPP had won the two Tobago seats.
A few minutes later, at Balisier House, Rowley, joined by outgoing Prime Minister Stuart Young and PNM deputy political leader Rohan Sinanan, conceded the defeat. He said that, based on the numbers coming into Balisier House, they were heading into the Opposition with 10 or 12 seats.
He said, “Tonight is not a good night for the PNM, but it might be a good night for the people of TT,” Trinidad and Tobago Newsday reported. He stated, “Things have gone very well with the processes, the results are coming in now, but from what we have coming in to Balisier House, it would appear that we have lost the election.”
Conceding defeat in the election, he said, “We are conceding defeat on election night, but tomorrow is another day. We conceded in 1986, we conceded in 1995, and we conceded in 2010, so, in this 70-year-old party, sometimes you win and sometimes you don’t win.”
He said that they had made comeback from one seat and added that “10 to 12 seats don’t count us out,” Trinidad and Tobago Newsdayreported. Rowley called the election results surprising and added that the PNM will start its campaign for the next general election in the next five years.

Title: Mark Carney, crisis-fighting central banker, to lead Canada through US trade war
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:03:19 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberal Party won Canada’s election on Monday, is a two-time central banker and crisis fighter who now faces his biggest challenge of all: steering Canada through U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Carney’s ruling Liberals completed their comeback win over Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives, but secured a minority government that fell short of the strong mandate that the former central banker had sought.
Carney, 60, had never held office, which would in normal times have undermined his candidacy in Canada. But a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, with the Liberal leader arguing he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.
Usually speaking in a monotone, Carney ran a low-key five-week campaign and steered clear of major gaffes. His blend of tough talk and bland competence was a deliberate strategy, Liberal strategists said.
“Unlike Pierre Poilievre, I’ve managed budgets before. I’ve managed economies before. I’ve managed crises before. This is the time for experience, not experiments,” he told reporters last week.
Carney was elected Liberal leader in March, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned amid low approval ratings after nearly a decade in office. Carney was the first person to become Canadian prime minister without having experience as a legislator or cabinet member.
He quickly axed an unpopular carbon tax on consumers and capital gains tax measures, then called the election, stressing the need to stand up to Trump.
Carney was born in Fort Smith in the remote Northwest Territories. He attended Harvard University, where he played college-level ice hockey as a goaltender.
A globetrotter who spent 13 years at U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top job in Canada’s Department of Finance and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of just 42.
POACHED BY BANK OF ENGLAND
Carney won praise for his handling of the financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record-low levels for a specific period of time.
Even at that stage, rumors swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.
“Why don’t I become a circus clown?” he told a reporter in 2012 when asked about possible political ambitions.
The Bank of England was impressed enough though to poach him in 2013, making him the first non-British governor in the central bank’s three-century history, and the first person to head two G7 central banks. Britain’s finance minister at the time, George Osborne, called Carney the “outstanding central bank governor of his generation.”
Carney, though, had a challenging time, forced to face zero inflation and the political chaos of Brexit.
He struggled to deploy his trademark policy of signaling the likely path of interest rates. The central bank said its guidance came with caveats, but media often interpreted it as more of a guarantee, with Labour legislator Pat McFadden dubbing the BoE under Carney as an “unreliable boyfriend.”
When sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the central bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.
“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” Ana Botin, Santander’s executive chair, said in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.
‘HIGH PRIEST OF PROJECT FEAR’
But Carney infuriated Brexit supporters by talking about the economic damage that he said was likely to be caused by leaving the European Union. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear,” but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.
From 2011 to 2018, Carney also headed the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies.
After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, Carney served as a United Nations envoy on finance and climate change.
After launching the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021 to act as an umbrella group for financial sector efforts to get to net-zero emissions, Carney oversaw a surge in membership as boards rushed to signal a willingness to act.
As the implications of moving to renewable energy began to filter down to the economy, though, a political backlash from some U.S. Republican-controlled states accusing companies of breaching anti-trust rules ultimately led a number of large U.S. companies to drop their membership.
Carney also served on the board of Brookfield Asset Management and was chair of the Bloomberg board, but resigned his U.N. special envoy position and left all commercial posts after he launched his bid for the Liberal leadership.
“If it’s not a crisis, you wouldn’t be seeing me. I am most useful in a crisis. I am not that good in peacetime,” Carney told supporters in February

It later surged to an intra-day high of 80,661 before erasing most of its gains amid selling pressure, dropping to a low of 80,122 — down 539 points from the day’s peak. The index recovered in the final hours to close at 80,288, up 0.1 per cent.
The NSE Nifty followed a similar trajectory. It opened at 24,370, reached an early high of 24,457, and then slipped to an intra-day low of 24,290. The index settled at 24,336, a seven-point rise from the previous close.
“Investors are treading cautiously due to uncertainty around the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff moves,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity. He added that market participants are keeping a close watch on upcoming corporate earnings and key economic data from the U.S., which are expected to influence investor sentiment and shape expectations for future growth.
On the gainers’ list, technology stocks led the rally. Tech Mahindra, Eternal (formerly Zomato), HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, and TCS rose between 1 and 2 per cent.
On the flip side, UltraTech Cement and Sun Pharma were the worst performers, each declining by 2 per cent. Other notable losers included Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC, SBI, and Nestle India.
Broader market indices reflected mixed sentiment. The BSE MidCap index edged up by 0.2 per cent, while the SmallCap index gained 0.1 per cent.
Among sectoral indices, the BSE IT and Capital Goods indices rose by 1 per cent each. However, the Metal index declined by 1 per cent, while Power and Bankex indices slipped 0.5 per cent each.
Hrishikesh Yedve, Technical Analyst at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (a Pantomath Group Company), noted that the Nifty formed a ‘shooting star’ pattern on the daily chart — a sign of selling pressure at higher levels.
“Resistance is expected around 24,460. If the index sustains above this level, it could potentially rally toward 24,800–24,850. On the downside, key support is placed at the 200-Day Simple Moving Average near 24,050, followed by 23,850. Traders should watch these levels closely for trading cues,” he said.

Title: India’s gold demand crosses 800 tonnes in 2024: report
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:35:13 +0000
Content: India’s gold demand surged past 800 tonnes in 2024, driven by a rise in jewellery consumption and increased investments in gold exchange traded funds (ETFs), according to a new report released on Tuesday.
The report by Zerodha Fund House revealed that India was the world’s largest consumer of gold jewellery in 2024, with total consumption reaching 563 tonnes.
The value of this consumption was estimated at around Rs 3.6 lakh crore. Gold continues to hold a significant place in Indian culture, particularly during weddings and other auspicious occasions, where its use is widespread.
Apart from jewellery, Indians are also investing heavily in gold in the form of bars and coins. In 2024, the country purchased 239 tonnes of gold in bar and coin form, valued at approximately Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
This marks a 60 per cent increase compared to 2023, making India the second-largest investor in gold bars and coins globally.
The report also highlighted that Indian investors are increasingly showing interest in gold ETFs. Over the past five years, gold ETF holdings in India have grown from 21 tonnes to 63 tonnes.
Meanwhile, a recent report from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) pointed out that gold-backed ETFs have seen strong inflows both in India and globally.
In the first quarter of 2025, net inflows into gold ETFs reached $21 billion, equivalent to 226 tonnes — the highest since the second quarter of 2020.
According to the NSE, gold outperformed all other asset classes in FY25, delivering a 41 per cent return in dollar terms.
“India reflected this shift, with the RBI ranking as the third-largest official buyer over the past three and five years, and gold now making up over 11 per cent of its forex reserves,” said the stock exchange in its report on Monday.
The surge in gold prices is largely attributed to global economic uncertainty, which has led many investors to turn to gold as a safe-haven asset.

Title: NPCI directs banks to limit ‘check transaction’ API usage to avoid UPI outage
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:30:34 +0000
Content: The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed banks to limit the use of the ‘Check Transaction’ application programming interface (API) following a major outage in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) on April 12.
The outage, which lasted over five hours, was caused by a surge in transaction status queries sent by banks. The spike in API calls overwhelmed the system, leading to a sharp drop in transaction success rate.
During the disruption, which lasted from 11:40 am to 4:40 pm, UPI transaction success rates reportedly fell to around 50%, affecting millions of users across the country.
To prevent similar issues, NPCI has instructed banks to delay their first ‘Check Transaction’ API call until at least 90 seconds after the transaction is initiated or authenticated. Additional status checks may be made only after intervals of 45 to 60 seconds, with a maximum of three checks allowed within two hours of the original transaction.
Payment service provider (PSP) banks have also been asked to moderate all API traffic to avoid unnecessary repeat calls for the same transaction. NPCI said banks must also undergo system audits by CERT-In empanelled auditors to assess API usage and system behavior, with annual reviews to follow.
UPI, India’s real-time payments system developed by NPCI, has become the dominant mode of digital payments in the country, processing over 10 billion transactions per month.

Title: India, US make ‘positive progress’ in trade talks held In Washington
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:14:25 +0000
Content: India and the United States have made “positive progress” in discussions on a proposed Bilateral Trade Agreement, with officials from both sides meeting in Washington, D.C. between April 23 and 25. The talks come after a previous round of discussions held in New Delhi in March.
Officials from India’s Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative discussed a wide range of issues, including tariff and non-tariff matters. According to an official statement, the talks were productive and focused on paving the way for the first phase of the agreement, which both sides hope to conclude by Fall 2025.
The two countries are exploring opportunities for early “mutual wins” in select sectors as part of a multi-sector agreement that is being negotiated. While sector-specific discussions have so far taken place virtually, in-person engagements are expected to begin at the end of May.
The trade talks are part of a broader push to deepen economic ties and strengthen supply chain linkages, in line with commitments made in the Leaders’ Statement issued in February 2025.
Officials indicated that both sides remain committed to advancing the agreement through constructive dialogue and sustained engagement.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said many top trading partners of the United States had made ‘very good’ proposals to avert U.S. tariffs, and one of the first deals to be signed would likely be with India.

Title: Russia says it’s waiting for Ukraine’s response to May ceasefire and offer of direct talks
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:08:47 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Ukraine had not responded to many offers by Russia President Vladimir Putin to start direct peace negotiations, and that it was unclear whether it would join a three-day ceasefire he has announced for next month.
“It was President Putin who repeatedly said that Russia is ready, without any preconditions, to start the negotiations process,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We have not heard a response from the Kyiv regime so far.”
Putin on Monday declared a three-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine from May 8-10, when Russia plans lavish celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.
Ukraine, in response, questioned why Moscow would not agree to its call for a ceasefire lasting at least 30 days and starting immediately.
“We value people’s lives and not parades,” President Volodymr Zelenskiy said.
Peskov said it was “very difficult to understand” whether Ukraine intended to join the ceasefire.

Title: Amazon launches first Kuiper internet satellites, taking on Starlink
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:05:29 +0000
Content: The first 27 satellites for Amazon’s Kuiper broadband internet constellation were launched into space from Florida on Monday, kicking off the long-delayed deployment of an internet-from-space network that will rival SpaceX’s Starlink.
The satellites are the first of 3,236 that Amazon plans to send into low-Earth orbit for Project Kuiper, a $10 billion effort unveiled in 2019 to beam broadband internet globally for consumers, businesses and governments – customers that SpaceX has courted for years with its powerful Starlink business.
Sitting atop an Atlas V rocket from the Boeing, opens new tab and Lockheed Martin, opens new tab joint-venture United Launch Alliance, the batch of 27 satellites was lofted into space at 7 p.m. EDT pm from the rocket company’s launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Bad weather scrubbed an initial launch attempt on April 9.
Kuiper is arguably Amazon’s biggest bet under way, pitting it against Starlink as well as global telecommunications providers like AT&T, opens new tab and T-Mobile, opens new tab. The company has positioned the service as a boon to rural areas where connectivity is sparse or nonexistent.
The mission to deploy the first operational satellites has been delayed more than a year – Amazon once hoped it could launch the inaugural batch in early 2024. The company faces a deadline set by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to deploy half its constellation, 1,618 satellites, by mid-2026, but its slower start means Amazon is likely to seek an extension, analysts say.
Hours or possibly days after the launch, Amazon is expected to publicly confirm initial contact with all of the satellites from its mission operations center in Redmond, Washington. If all goes as planned, the company said it expects to “begin delivering service to customers later this year.”
ULA could launch up to five more Kuiper missions this year, ULA CEO Tory Bruno told Reuters in an interview this month. Amazon said in a 2020 FCC filing that it could begin service in some northern and southern regions at 578 satellites, with coverage expanding toward Earth’s equator as the company launches more satellites.
The Web services and e-commerce giant’s Project Kuiper is an ambitious foray into space, with a late start in a market dominated by SpaceX. But Amazon executives see the company’s deep consumer product experience and established cloud computing business that Kuiper will connect with as an edge over Starlink.
Amazon launched two prototype satellites in 2023 in tests it said were successful, before de-orbiting them in 2024. It had been relatively quiet about the program’s development until announcing its first Kuiper launch plans earlier this month.
‘ROOM FOR LOTS OF WINNERS’
Elon Musk’s SpaceX, with a unique edge as both a satellite operator and launch company with its reusable Falcon 9, has put more than 8,000 Starlink satellites in orbit since 2019, marking its 250th dedicated Starlink launch on Monday. Its deployment pace has hastened to at least one Starlink mission per week, each rocket with roughly two-dozen satellites on board to expand the network’s bandwidth and replace outdated satellites.
That quick pace has helped Musk’s company amass more than 5 million internet users across 125 countries, upend the global satellite communications market and woo military and intelligence agencies that have sought to use Starlink and its manufacturing line for sensitive national security programs.
Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete with Starlink, telling Reuters in a January interview “there’s insatiable demand” for internet.
“There’s room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well,” he said.
“It will be a primarily commercial system, but there will be defense uses for these LEO constellations, no doubt,” he added, referring to low-Earth orbit.
Amazon in 2023 revealed its Kuiper consumer terminals, an LP vinyl record-sized antenna that communicates with Kuiper satellites overhead, as well as a smaller terminal whose size it compares to its e-book Kindle device. The company expects to make tens of millions of the devices for under $400 each.
Amazon in 2022 booked 83 rocket launches from ULA, France’s Arianespace and Blue Origin, Bezos’ space company, snagging the industry’s biggest-ever launch deal as it prepared to begin Kuiper deployment.

Title: PM Modi congratulates Mark Carney on victory in Canadian elections
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:47:21 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday congratulated Mark Carney on his election as the Prime Minister of Canada and extended his best wishes to the Liberal Party on their electoral victory.
“India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
Carney, a renowned economist and former Governor of the Bank of Canada, was chosen by the Liberal Party as Trudeau’s successor. Throughout his campaign, he pledged to “rebuild” the strained relationship with India and emphasized the need for closer cooperation with like-minded democracies.
“What Canada will be looking to do is to diversify our trading relationships with like-minded countries, and there are opportunities to rebuild the relationship with India,” Carney said during an interaction in Calgary, signaling a shift in Ottawa’s approach toward New Delhi.
Just last week, Carney reiterated the importance of ties with India, saying, “It’s an incredibly important relationship, the Canada-India relationship, on many levels. At this point, where the world economy and the global system are being reshaped, countries like Canada and India can play an outsized role in building an open, shared economy and shared ideas.”
During his tenure as Governor of the Bank of Canada, he helped the country navigate the 2008 global financial crisis. Later, as the head of the Bank of England, he oversaw the UK economy through the turbulence of Brexit. In 2020, he was appointed the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, further broadening his global credentials.
According to his official profile, Carney is now committed to rebuilding the Canadian economy and restoring the country’s standing on the global stage. “Mark offers the proven leadership and real plan we need to deliver change for our party and our country, and to build the strongest economy in the G7,” the profile reads.

Title: Sacred Buddha relic from Sarnath to be exhibited in Vietnam for UN Vesak Day 2025
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:20:03 +0000
Content: In a historic first, the sacred Buddha Relic from Sarnath, India, will travel to Vietnam for a special exposition during the United Nations (UN) Day of Vesak 2025. Organized by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), the event underscores the deep cultural and spiritual ties between India and Vietnam.
The Holy Relic, enshrined at Mulagandha Kuti Vihara in Sarnath, will be ceremonially transported to Delhi on April 30, from Varanasi airport. At 5:30 PM, it will be placed in a protected enclosure at the National Museum for prayers, chanting, and meditation by Buddhist followers, including eminent community members and diplomatic representatives from Buddhist nations.
On May 1, the relic will be escorted with full religious sanctity by senior monks to Ho Chi Minh City via a special Indian Air Force aircraft. A high-level delegation, led by Shri Kiren Rijiju, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Minority Affairs, and including IBC Secretary General Ven. Shartse Khensur Rinpoche Jangchup Choeden, will participate in the exposition and Vesak celebrations.
The relic, excavated from Nagarjuna Konda in Andhra Pradesh, holds immense historical significance as a relic of Sakyamuni Buddha, venerated since his Mahaparinirvana. Unearthed during excavations led by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) from 1927-31, it was gifted to the Mahabodhi Society of India in 1932. The relic will be displayed at key Vietnamese sites: Hanh Tâm Monastery in Ho Chi Minh City (May 2–8), Bà Đen Mountain in Tây Ninh Province (May 9–13), Quán Sứ Monastery in Hanoi (May 14–18), and Tam Chúc Monastery in Hà Nam Province (May 18–21).
Coinciding with UN Vesak Day 2025, themed “Buddhist Approach to Unity and Inclusivity for Human Dignity,” the exposition will draw international delegates from over 100 countries. The IBC will also host three exhibitions showcasing the spread of Buddha Dhamma, including digital restorations of Ajanta Cave murals, Jataka tales, and a comparative study of Indian and Vietnamese Buddhist artifacts.

Title: Justice BR Gavai appointed as next Chief Justice of India
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:40:02 +0000
Content: The Centre on Tuesday cleared the appointment of Supreme Court judge, Justice B.R. Gavai, as the next Chief Justice of India (CJI).
“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India, the President is pleased to appoint Shri Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai, Judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from 14th May, 2025,” said a notification issued by the Union Ministry of Law and Justice.
Incumbent CJI Sanjiv Khanna is due to retire on May 13 on attainment of the age of 65 years.
He had recommended Justice Gavai as his successor earlier this month.
Justice Gavai, in line to be the 52nd CJI, will have a tenure of over 6 months, and he will demit office on November 23, 2025.
Justice Gavai was elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court on May 29, 2019. Appointed as Additional Judge of the Bombay High Court in November 2003, he became a permanent Judge in November 2005.
Before elevation to the Bench, he practised in constitutional law and administrative law, and acted as Standing Counsel for Municipal Corporation of Nagpur, Amravati Municipal Corporation, and Amravati University. He was appointed as Assistant Government Pleader and Additional Public Prosecutor in the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench in August 1992 and served till July 1993. He was appointed as Government Pleader and Public Prosecutor for the Nagpur Bench on January 17, 2000.
In the apex court, Justice Gavai, a part of the 7-judge Constitution Bench dealing with the question of whether a sub-classification amongst reserved category groups for giving more beneficial treatment would be permissible under the Constitution, suggested the application of the “creamy layer” principle to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for availing benefits of affirmative action.
In his detailed opinion, Justice Gavai said: “When the 9-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney held that applicability of such a test (creamy layer test) insofar as Other Backward Classes are concerned would advance equality as enshrined in the Constitution, then why such a test should not also be made applicable to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe.”
“Can a child of IAS/IPS or Civil Service officers be equated with a child of a disadvantaged member belonging to Scheduled Castes, studying in a Gram Panchayat/Zilla Parishad school in a village?” he asked.
Justice Gavai said putting the children of the parents from the SCs and STs who, on account of the benefit of reservation, have reached a high position and ceased to be socially, economically and educationally backward and the children of parents doing manual work in the villages in the same category would defeat the constitutional mandate.

Title: Restaurant fire kills 22 in northeast China’s Liaoning
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:29:20 +0000
Content: The fire broke out at 12:25 p.m. (0425 GMT) in a restaurant in a residential area of Liaoning Province’s Liaoyang City, state broadcaster CCTV said. Three people were injured.
Footage circulating on social media including X and Chinese platform Douyin, unverified by Reuters, showed bright orange flames engulfing a storefront on street level alongside scores of parked vehicles. Smoke was seen billowing out as paramedics tended to people on stretchers.
Hao Peng, secretary of Liaoning’s provincial ruling party committee, said 22 fire trucks and 85 firefighters were deployed to the scene. Hao said the on-site rescue work had been completed and people had been evacuated.
It was the latest in a spate of similar incidents across the country in recent years. In April, 20 people were killed in a fire that broke out in an apartment for the elderly at a nursing home in the northern province of Hebei.
Gas leaks caused at least two high-profile explosions in residential areas last year, with a blast at a restaurant in Hebei province killing two people and injuring 26 in March, and an explosion in a highrise building in southern Shenzhen province in September killing one person.

Title: France accuses Russian intelligence of repeated cyber attacks since 2021
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:21:07 +0000
Content: France’s foreign ministry explicitly accused Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency on Tuesday of mounting cyber attacks on a dozen entities including ministries, defence firms and think tanks since 2021 in an attempt to destabilise France.
The accusations, levelled at GRU unit APT28, which officials said was based in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, are not the first by a Western power, but it is the first time Paris has blamed the Russian state on the basis of its own intelligence.
The ministry said in a statement that APT28’s attacks on France go as far back as 2015, when the station TV5 Monde was taken off air in a hack claimed by purported Islamic State militants.
France said APT28 had been behind the attack, and another in the 2017 presidential election when emails linked to the party and campaign of the eventual winner, Emmanuel Macron, were leaked and mixed with disinformation.
According to a report by France’s National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), APT28 has sought to obtain strategic intelligence from entities across Europe and North America.
Officials said the government had decided to go public to keep the public informed at a time of uncertainty in domestic politics and over Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Russia’s embassy in Paris did not respond to a request for comment.
ANSSI said there had been a jump last year in the number of attacks on French ministries, local administrations, defence companies, aerospace firms, think tanks and entities in the financial and economic sector.
They said APT28’s most recent attack was in December, and that some 4,000 cyber attacks had been ascribed to Russian actors in 2024, an increase of 15% on 2023.
“These destabilising activities are unacceptable and unworthy of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,” the foreign ministry said.
“Alongside its partners, France is determined to use all means at its disposal to anticipate, deter and respond to Russia’s malicious behaviour in cyberspace.”
APT28 has been active worldwide since at least 2004, primarily in the field of cyberespionage, hacking experts say.
In May 2024, Germany accused APT28 of launching cyber attacks on its defence and aerospace firms and ruling party, as well as targets in other countries.
At the time, Russia’s embassy in Berlin called the accusations “another unfriendly step aimed at inciting anti-Russian sentiments in Germany”.

Content: Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday highlighted opportunities for further investments to strengthen India-UK bilateral economic ties at a roundtable of businessmen and CEOs of the two countries.
“Addressed the India-UK Business Roundtable, bringing together prominent business leaders and CEOs from both countries. Highlighted opportunities to strengthen economic ties, drive innovation-led growth, and expand investment avenues between India and the UK,” the minister said in a post on X.
The Commerce Minister is on a five-day visit to London, Oslo and Brussels this week, for strengthening India’s trade and investment relations with the UK, Norway and the European Union.
He also met Al Cook, CEO of De Beers Group, and his team to explore global trends in the gems and jewellery sector.
“We discussed India’s opportunities, sustainable practices, and growth prospects for the diamond industry,” said the minister.
Goyal also met Martin Gilbert, Chairperson of Revolut, and exchanged views on the immense opportunities in India’s fintech ecosystem and the importance of partnerships with global players to drive innovation and growth.
Earlier, Goyal held a meeting with the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade, J. Reynolds, to advance Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between India and the UK.
The Indian minister termed the meeting with his British counterpart “as productive” and part of the commitment to deepen the India-UK economic ties.
“Arrived in London for two days of engaging discussions aimed at strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations. In my first engagement, held a productive meeting with the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade J. Reynolds to advance Free Trade Agreement negotiations, reinforcing our commitment to deepening India-UK economic ties,” Goyal said on X, after the meeting.
The visit started with the London leg of the trip, aimed at wrapping up the negotiations for the proposed FTA between India and the UK, as talks have entered the last lap.
India and the UK are looking to conclude talks for the proposed FTA sooner, as international trade is expected to face challenges due to steeper tariffs from the US. There are 26 chapters in the agreement, which include goods, services, investments, and intellectual property rights.

Title: India clinch thriller against South Africa, top Points Table in women’s Tri-Nation series
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:52:05 +0000
Content: In the second match of the Women’s Tri-Nation Tournament, India edged out South Africa in a nail-biting contest, securing a 15-run victory. With this win, Team India leads the points table with four points, having won both of their matches against hosts Sri Lanka and now South Africa.
Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur continued her good run with the coin, just like in the opening match. This time, however, she chose to set a target rather than chase. India posted a competitive total of 276/6 in 50 overs.
The foundation for the total was laid by young opener Pratika Rawal, who continued her excellent form. She shared an 83-run opening stand with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana, who contributed a steady 36 before being dismissed by Annerie Dercksen.
Pratika then stitched together another crucial 68-run partnership with Harleen Deol for the second wicket. She went on to score a blistering 76, showcasing both skill and temperament.
Captain Harmanpreet Kaur played a vital anchoring role with an unbeaten 41, while Jemimah Rodrigues added a quickfire 41 off 32 balls. Richa Ghosh further boosted the total with a cameo of 24 off just 14 deliveries.
For South Africa, Nonkululeko Mlaba was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets. Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Nadine de Klerk, and Annerie Dercksen picked up a wicket each.
Chasing 277, South Africa got off to a strong start, thanks to their openers — captain Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits — who put on a solid 140-run stand in 27.1 overs. The Indian medium-pace duo of Kashvi Gautam and Arundhati Reddy struggled to break the partnership early on.
The breakthrough came via experienced all-rounder Deepti Sharma, who dismissed Wolvaardt for 43. While Brits continued to hold one end, wickets began to fall regularly at the other.
India’s recalled off-spinner for the series, Sneh Rana, turned the match decisively with a superb spell. She picked up five key wickets, applying the brakes to South Africa’s momentum. She was deservedly named Player of the Match for her brilliant fifer.
South Africa was eventually bowled out for 261 in 48.3 overs, falling short by 15 runs.
Brief Scores:
India 276/6 in 50 overs
(Pratika Rawal 76, Harmanpreet Kaur 41*, Jemimah Rodrigues 41; Nonkululeko Mlaba 2/45)
South Africa 261 all out in 48.3 overs
(Tazmin Brits 84, Laura Wolvaardt 43; Sneh Rana 5/42, Deepti Sharma 2/37)
Result: India won by 15 runs
Player of the Match: Sneh Rana
Next Match: South Africa face hosts Sri Lanka on Friday.

UNC political leader and Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister-elect Kamla Persad Bissessar secured the win in the 2025 general election. At 10:10 p.m. (local time) on April 28, the United National Congress (UNC) defeated the PNM government, with PNM political leader Keith Rowley stating that if the voting trends held, the PNM would be entering the Opposition with 10 to 12 seats, local newspaper Trinidad and Tobago Newsday reported.
Speaking from her constituency office in Siparia, Kamla Persad-Bissessar urged UNC supporters not to be boastful or arrogant as the vote counting was underway. She said, “We have a lot of work to do, so we are heading up now to (UNC) party headquarters.”
She said the UNC held its 19 seats and flipped several seats previously held by the PNM. However, she did not want to declare any of these flipped seats since counting was still underway. She said TPP had won the two Tobago seats.
A few minutes later, at Balisier House, Rowley, joined by outgoing Prime Minister Stuart Young and PNM deputy political leader Rohan Sinanan, conceded the defeat. He said that, based on the numbers coming into Balisier House, they were heading into the Opposition with 10 or 12 seats.
He said, “Tonight is not a good night for the PNM, but it might be a good night for the people of TT,” Trinidad and Tobago Newsday reported. He stated, “Things have gone very well with the processes, the results are coming in now, but from what we have coming in to Balisier House, it would appear that we have lost the election.”
Conceding defeat in the election, he said, “We are conceding defeat on election night, but tomorrow is another day. We conceded in 1986, we conceded in 1995, and we conceded in 2010, so, in this 70-year-old party, sometimes you win and sometimes you don’t win.”
He said that they had made comeback from one seat and added that “10 to 12 seats don’t count us out,” Trinidad and Tobago Newsdayreported. Rowley called the election results surprising and added that the PNM will start its campaign for the next general election in the next five years.

Title: Mark Carney, crisis-fighting central banker, to lead Canada through US trade war
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:03:19 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberal Party won Canada’s election on Monday, is a two-time central banker and crisis fighter who now faces his biggest challenge of all: steering Canada through U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Carney’s ruling Liberals completed their comeback win over Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives, but secured a minority government that fell short of the strong mandate that the former central banker had sought.
Carney, 60, had never held office, which would in normal times have undermined his candidacy in Canada. But a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, with the Liberal leader arguing he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.
Usually speaking in a monotone, Carney ran a low-key five-week campaign and steered clear of major gaffes. His blend of tough talk and bland competence was a deliberate strategy, Liberal strategists said.
“Unlike Pierre Poilievre, I’ve managed budgets before. I’ve managed economies before. I’ve managed crises before. This is the time for experience, not experiments,” he told reporters last week.
Carney was elected Liberal leader in March, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned amid low approval ratings after nearly a decade in office. Carney was the first person to become Canadian prime minister without having experience as a legislator or cabinet member.
He quickly axed an unpopular carbon tax on consumers and capital gains tax measures, then called the election, stressing the need to stand up to Trump.
Carney was born in Fort Smith in the remote Northwest Territories. He attended Harvard University, where he played college-level ice hockey as a goaltender.
A globetrotter who spent 13 years at U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top job in Canada’s Department of Finance and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of just 42.
POACHED BY BANK OF ENGLAND
Carney won praise for his handling of the financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record-low levels for a specific period of time.
Even at that stage, rumors swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.
“Why don’t I become a circus clown?” he told a reporter in 2012 when asked about possible political ambitions.
The Bank of England was impressed enough though to poach him in 2013, making him the first non-British governor in the central bank’s three-century history, and the first person to head two G7 central banks. Britain’s finance minister at the time, George Osborne, called Carney the “outstanding central bank governor of his generation.”
Carney, though, had a challenging time, forced to face zero inflation and the political chaos of Brexit.
He struggled to deploy his trademark policy of signaling the likely path of interest rates. The central bank said its guidance came with caveats, but media often interpreted it as more of a guarantee, with Labour legislator Pat McFadden dubbing the BoE under Carney as an “unreliable boyfriend.”
When sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the central bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.
“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” Ana Botin, Santander’s executive chair, said in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.
‘HIGH PRIEST OF PROJECT FEAR’
But Carney infuriated Brexit supporters by talking about the economic damage that he said was likely to be caused by leaving the European Union. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear,” but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.
From 2011 to 2018, Carney also headed the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies.
After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, Carney served as a United Nations envoy on finance and climate change.
After launching the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021 to act as an umbrella group for financial sector efforts to get to net-zero emissions, Carney oversaw a surge in membership as boards rushed to signal a willingness to act.
As the implications of moving to renewable energy began to filter down to the economy, though, a political backlash from some U.S. Republican-controlled states accusing companies of breaching anti-trust rules ultimately led a number of large U.S. companies to drop their membership.
Carney also served on the board of Brookfield Asset Management and was chair of the Bloomberg board, but resigned his U.N. special envoy position and left all commercial posts after he launched his bid for the Liberal leadership.
“If it’s not a crisis, you wouldn’t be seeing me. I am most useful in a crisis. I am not that good in peacetime,” Carney told supporters in February

Title: Sensex ends higher amid volatile trade; Nifty closes at 24,336
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:36:39 +0000
Content: Equity markets witnessed a choppy session on Tuesday, with benchmark indices oscillating between gains and losses before ending marginally in the green. Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and investor caution, the Sensex closed 70 points higher, while the Nifty posted a modest gain of seven points.
The BSE Sensex opened on a strong note, climbing nearly 180 points to touch 80,396. It later surged to an intra-day high of 80,661 before erasing most of its gains amid selling pressure, dropping to a low of 80,122 — down 539 points from the day’s peak. The index recovered in the final hours to close at 80,288, up 0.1 per cent.
The NSE Nifty followed a similar trajectory. It opened at 24,370, reached an early high of 24,457, and then slipped to an intra-day low of 24,290. The index settled at 24,336, a seven-point rise from the previous close.
“Investors are treading cautiously due to uncertainty around the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff moves,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity. He added that market participants are keeping a close watch on upcoming corporate earnings and key economic data from the U.S., which are expected to influence investor sentiment and shape expectations for future growth.
On the gainers’ list, technology stocks led the rally. Tech Mahindra, Eternal (formerly Zomato), HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, and TCS rose between 1 and 2 per cent.
On the flip side, UltraTech Cement and Sun Pharma were the worst performers, each declining by 2 per cent. Other notable losers included Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC, SBI, and Nestle India.
Broader market indices reflected mixed sentiment. The BSE MidCap index edged up by 0.2 per cent, while the SmallCap index gained 0.1 per cent.
Among sectoral indices, the BSE IT and Capital Goods indices rose by 1 per cent each. However, the Metal index declined by 1 per cent, while Power and Bankex indices slipped 0.5 per cent each.
Hrishikesh Yedve, Technical Analyst at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (a Pantomath Group Company), noted that the Nifty formed a ‘shooting star’ pattern on the daily chart — a sign of selling pressure at higher levels.
“Resistance is expected around 24,460. If the index sustains above this level, it could potentially rally toward 24,800–24,850. On the downside, key support is placed at the 200-Day Simple Moving Average near 24,050, followed by 23,850. Traders should watch these levels closely for trading cues,” he said.

Title: India’s gold demand crosses 800 tonnes in 2024: report
Publication Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:35:13 +0000
Content: India’s gold demand surged past 800 tonnes in 2024, driven by a rise in jewellery consumption and increased investments in gold exchange traded funds (ETFs), according to a new report released on Tuesday.
The report by Zerodha Fund House revealed that India was the world’s largest consumer of gold jewellery in 2024, with total consumption reaching 563 tonnes.
The value of this consumption was estimated at around Rs 3.6 lakh crore. Gold continues to hold a significant place in Indian culture, particularly during weddings and other auspicious occasions, where its use is widespread.
Apart from jewellery, Indians are also investing heavily in gold in the form of bars and coins. In 2024, the country purchased 239 tonnes of gold in bar and coin form, valued at approximately Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
This marks a 60 per cent increase compared to 2023, making India the second-largest investor in gold bars and coins globally.
The report also highlighted that Indian investors are increasingly showing interest in gold ETFs. Over the past five years, gold ETF holdings in India have grown from 21 tonnes to 63 tonnes.
Meanwhile, a recent report from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) pointed out that gold-backed ETFs have seen strong inflows both in India and globally.
In the first quarter of 2025, net inflows into gold ETFs reached $21 billion, equivalent to 226 tonnes — the highest since the second quarter of 2020.
According to the NSE, gold outperformed all other asset classes in FY25, delivering a 41 per cent return in dollar terms.
“India reflected this shift, with the RBI ranking as the third-largest official buyer over the past three and five years, and gold now making up over 11 per cent of its forex reserves,” said the stock exchange in its report on Monday.
The surge in gold prices is largely attributed to global economic uncertainty, which has led many investors to turn to gold as a safe-haven asset.

Title: North Korea conducts first test firing of its new warship’s weapons system
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:36:05 +0000
Content: North Korea earlier this week conducted the first test-firing of the weapons system of the new “Choe Hyon-class” warship it recently unveiled, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday.
Cruise and anti-air missiles were launched and artillery fired as part of the test-firing attended by leader Kim Jong Un and senior officials, the report said.
The time has come for North Korea’s navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament for maritime sovereignty and for the sake of national defence, Kim was quoted as saying.
The intelligence agencies of South Korea and the U.S. were closely monitoring North Korea’s shipbuilding activities, an official at Seoul’s defence ministry said.
More work might be needed before the new naval destroyer could take to the sea under its own propulsion, said 38 North, a think tank focusing on North Korea, noting a satellite image of tug boats nudging the ship back towards a floating drydock.
“The use of tugboats to move the ship into place and back again could indicate the lack of a functioning propulsion system,” the think tank said.
North Korean state media on Saturday revealed the 5,000-tonne warship that it said was equipped with the “most powerful weapons.”
Kim, in a speech from the launch reported by KCNA, said the warship would be handed over to the navy and go into service early next year.
The “Choe Hyon-class” ship was named after anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter Choe Hyon, according to KCNA.

Title: Cabinet approves ₹22,864-crore greenfield highway project connecting Meghalaya and Assam
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:31:27 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved a ₹22,864 crore project to build a 166.8 km four-lane greenfield access-controlled highway between Mawlyngkhung in Meghalaya and Panchgram in Assam. The project will be executed under the Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM).
Out of the total stretch, 144.80 km falls in Meghalaya and 22.00 km in Assam. This high-speed corridor, part of National Highway No. 06, is expected to transform regional connectivity and boost economic activity.
The highway will significantly reduce travel distance and time between Guwahati and Silchar. It will improve access to Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam’s Barak Valley, thereby enhancing logistics and reducing transportation costs across the region.
Passing through key cement and coal-producing areas, the highway will support Meghalaya’s industrial growth. It will also improve access to tourist destinations across the Northeast, benefiting travelers arriving via Guwahati, Shillong, and Silchar airports.
The corridor will ease congestion on the existing NH-06 and integrate with major routes like NH-27, NH-106, NH-206, and NH-37. It will pass through important districts such as Ri Bhoi, East Khasi Hills, West and East Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, and Cachar in Assam.
Key towns including Diengpasoh, Ummulong, Phramer, Khliehriat, Ratacherra, Umkiang, and Kalain will be connected, improving inter-city travel and accessibility.
Aligned with the PM Gati Shakti Master Plan and the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, this critical project will boost infrastructure, generate employment, and promote socio-economic development across five Northeastern states: Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.

Title: Caste enumeration to be included in upcoming census, says government
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:27:01 +0000
Content: In a major decision, the central government on Wednesday announced that caste enumeration will be included in the upcoming population census.
Briefing the media on the Union Cabinet’s decisions, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that while some states have carried out caste-based surveys, conducting a census falls strictly within the jurisdiction of the central government.
“The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) has decided today that caste enumeration will be part of the forthcoming census,” Vaishnaw stated.
He criticized previous Congress governments, accusing them of consistently opposing the idea of a caste census.
“Since independence, caste was never included in any official census. In 2010, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had assured the Lok Sabha that the matter would be taken up by the cabinet. A Group of Ministers was formed to deliberate on the issue, and most political parties supported a caste census. However, the Congress-led government at the time opted only for a caste-based survey — the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) — instead of a full-fledged census,” he said.
Vaishnaw further alleged that the Congress and its INDI alliance partners have used the issue of caste census purely for political purposes.
He emphasized that under Article 246 of the Constitution, the census is listed at Entry 69 of the Union List in the Seventh Schedule, making it exclusively a Union subject.
“While some states have conducted caste surveys — some effectively, others for political gain in a non-transparent manner — the central government believes that a transparent caste enumeration as part of the official census will prevent the politicization of this sensitive issue,” he said.
The minister asserted that this move will contribute to strengthening the country’s social and economic framework.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs has taken this decision, demonstrating the government’s commitment to the values and aspirations of society,” he added.
Vaishnaw also highlighted the Modi government’s past efforts in social justice, including the introduction of a 10 per cent reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), which was implemented without adversely affecting any existing category.

Title: Bangladesh HC grants bail to prominent Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:20:17 +0000
Content: Chinmoy Krishna Das, a prominent Hindu leader and spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot, has been granted bail by the High Court on Wednesday in an alleged sedition case.
The bench of Justice Atoar Rahman and Justice Ali Reza passed the order after a final hearing.
Earlier this year, the High Court issued a rule after hearing Das’s application for bail in the case, seeking an explanation as to why the applicant should not be granted bail.
Last week, the High Court set April 30 as the date for the rule hearing, following which the Court declared the rule absolute and delivered its verdict, Bangladesh’s leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo reported on Wednesday.
Arrested on November 25 from the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on charges of sedition, Das has remained in jail despite widespread demands for his release.
Chinmoy Krishna was taken into custody by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, an act which was criticised throughout the world and exposed the crimes being committed against the Hindu community of Bangladesh.
Krishna was not only associated with the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajot (BJHM), a grand national alliance of 23 religious organisations in the country, but also with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). The news of his arrest led to several protests demanding his immediate release.
The incidents of vandalism, looting, arson, land grabbing, and threats to leave the country have been repeatedly inflicted on the Hindu community after the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on August 8 following the fall of Awami League regime led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Even though Yunus and his religious affairs advisor A.F.M. Khalid Hossain assured that the current establishment believes in communal harmony, the communal violence, which began immediately after Hasina left Dhaka, continued to cause widespread fear, anxiety, and uncertainty among the minorities in Bangladesh, especially Hindus.
Last month, a report of the Dhaka-based human rights organisation, Ain O Salish Kendra (AsK), highlighted that there are reports of a total of 147 incidents of vandalising houses, temples, and business establishments of the Hindu community across the country.
Some 408 households were vandalised in these incidents, including 36 cases of arson. Besides, there have been reports of 113 incidents of vandalising business establishments owned by the minority community, 32 incidents of attack on temples and mosques of the Ahmadiyya sect, and 92 incidents of vandalising idols in 92 temples.
There have been several incidents of attacks on the minorities all over the country, particularly the Hindu community, after the fall of the Awami League government with their areas, including houses, business establishments, and places of worship coming under attack and even set on fire in certain instances.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
India has repeatedly raised concerns over the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh, hoping that the interim government in the country led by Yunus will take strong action against the perpetrators of violence.

Title: Iran, UK, France, Germany to hold nuclear talks on Friday
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:08:55 +0000
Content: Iran will hold nuclear talks in Rome on Friday with Britain, France and Germany, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday, with the aim of improving strained ties at a time of high-stakes nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.
The meeting will precede a fourth round of nuclear talks this weekend between Iran and the United States, also to be held in Italy.
“In my opinion, the three European countries have lost their role (in the nuclear file) due to the wrong policies they have adopted. Of course, we do not want this and are ready to hold talks with them in Rome,” Araqchi told state media.
Media reported on Monday that Tehran had proposed meeting the European countries, collectively known as the E3, which are parties to Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
E3 political directors confirmed they would meet with Iran on Friday.
Trump has threatened to attack Iran unless it agrees to a new nuclear deal. Iran has far exceeded the 2015 agreement’s curbs on its nuclear programme since the United States withdrew, and the European countries share Washington’s concern that Tehran could seek an atomic bomb. Iran says its programme is peaceful.
A U.N. Security Council resolution ratifying the 2015 accord expires in October, and France’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that Paris would not think twice about re-imposing international sanctions if negotiations fail to reach a deal.
“These sanctions would permanently close off Iranian access to technology, investment, and the European market, with devastating effects on the country’s economy,” Jean-Noel Barrot said.
Iran’s U.N. representative responded: “If France and its partners are truly seeking a diplomatic solution, they must stop threatening.”
On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on what it described as a network based in Iran and China accused of procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Araqchi said U.S. sanctions during negotiations sent the “wrong message”.
Trump has said he is confident of clinching a new pact that would block Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb.

Title: Cabinet approves higher sugarcane FRP for 2025–26 season
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:04:41 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane for the 2025–26 season at ₹355 per quintal for a basic recovery rate of 10.25 per cent. The decision was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
According to an official statement, the revised FRP is expected to benefit around five crore sugarcane farmers and their families, along with approximately five lakh workers employed in sugar mills and associated sectors.
The revised FRP marks a 4.41 per cent increase over the current season’s rate and is more than double the estimated cost of production, which stands at ₹173 per quintal. For every 0.1 per cent increase in recovery over the base rate, the FRP will increase by ₹3.46 per quintal. Similarly, the price will be reduced by ₹3.46 per quintal for every 0.1 per cent decrease in recovery.
However, in a measure designed to safeguard the interests of farmers in regions with lower sugar recovery, the government has decided that no deduction will be made if the recovery rate falls below 9.5 per cent. In such cases, farmers will receive ₹329.05 per quintal for their produce in the 2025–26 season, which runs from October to September.
The FRP has been fixed based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and after consultations with State governments and other stakeholders.
Official data shows that in the 2023–24 sugar season, nearly 99.92 per cent of the cane dues—amounting to ₹1,11,782 crore—had been cleared as of April 28, 2025. In the ongoing 2024–25 season, about ₹85,094 crore of the ₹97,270 crore dues have been paid so far, accounting for roughly 87 per cent of the total.

Title: Sensex ends slightly lower as caution prevails amid geopolitical tensions
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:41:20 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market remained subdued for the second consecutive session on Wednesday, as investors adopted a cautious stance amid global geopolitical uncertainties and ahead of Thursday’s trading holiday for Maharashtra Day.
Both benchmark indices — the Sensex and Nifty — traded within narrow ranges throughout the day, driven largely by stock-specific activity.
The Sensex opened around 80 points higher at 80,371 and climbed to an intraday high of 80,526 in the final 30 minutes of trade. However, the gains were short-lived as the index reversed sharply to hit a low of 79,879 — a drop of 647 points from its peak. It eventually settled at 80,024, down 46 points from the previous close.
The Nifty followed a similar trajectory, moving in a 200-point range. It touched a high of 24,396 before dipping to 24,199 and ended marginally lower by two points at 24,334.
“The Nifty continues to consolidate within a narrow band as traders preferred to stay on the sidelines ahead of the holiday,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.
Among the major losers, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv fell over 5% after releasing their Q4 earnings, which failed to inspire confidence among investors. Tata Motors and SBI also declined by around 3%.
Other laggards on the 30-share index included UltraTech Cement, Tata Steel, and Asian Paints.
On the other hand, Maruti Suzuki India posted strong gains, rising over 3%. Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma, and Power Grid Corporation also ended in positive territory, gaining between 1-2%.
The broader market mirrored the cautious sentiment, with the BSE MidCap index slipping 1% and the SmallCap index tumbling 2%.
Sectorally, BSE Power and Capital Goods indices fell by over 1%, while the Realty index bucked the trend, gaining more than 1%.
“The weakening US dollar and India’s economic resilience have made the country appealing to global investors,” said V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “That said, after a strong rally, some stocks are trading at elevated levels. It may be prudent for investors to book partial profits and increase cash positions.”

Title: Farm and rural workers get respite as inflation burden eases further in March
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:37:30 +0000
Content: Farm and rural households saw some financial relief in March as inflation continued its downward trend, according to data released by the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Wednesday. The year-on-year inflation based on the All-India Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) eased to 3.73 per cent, while the index for Rural Labourers (CPI-RL) stood at 3.86 per cent. These figures mark a sharp decline from the 7.15 per cent and 7.08 per cent recorded in March last year.
The moderation in inflation was also evident on a month-on-month basis. In February, CPI-AL was recorded at 4.05 per cent and CPI-RL at 4.61 per cent. The sustained decline in inflation over the past six months comes as a welcome respite for low-income households, particularly those in rural areas, who have been disproportionately affected by price rises.
Lower inflation means rural workers now have more disposable income, improving their ability to afford essential goods and enhancing their overall quality of life.
This easing in rural inflation aligns with a broader trend seen across the country. India’s overall retail inflation fell to 3.34 per cent in March—its lowest level since August 2019—according to figures released earlier this month by the Ministry of Statistics.
Food inflation, in particular, dropped to 2.69 per cent in March, the lowest since November 2021. The decline is largely attributed to falling prices of vegetables, eggs, pulses, meat and fish, cereals, and milk, according to the official statement.
The Reserve Bank of India has also revised its inflation outlook. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra recently announced that the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee has reduced the inflation forecast for 2025–26 to 4 per cent from the earlier projection of 4.2 per cent.
“Headline inflation moderated during January and February following a sharp correction in food prices,” Malhotra said. “The outlook for food inflation has turned decisively positive. Concerns over rabi crop output have eased considerably, and the second advance estimates point to record wheat production and higher pulse output compared to last year.”
He added that robust kharif arrivals are expected to further support this trend, paving the way for a sustained decline in food inflation. According to him, the recent sharp fall in inflation expectations—both three months and one year ahead—will also help keep future inflation in check.
Additionally, falling global crude oil prices are seen as a positive development for India’s inflation outlook. However, the RBI cautioned that global market uncertainties and potential weather-related supply disruptions remain as risks to the inflation trajectory.

Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:52:11 +0000
Content: President Vladimir Putin is open to peace in Ukraine and intense work is going on with the United States, but the conflict is so complicated that the rapid progress which Washington wants is difficult to achieve, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.
“The president remains open to political and diplomatic methods of resolving this conflict,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Peskov said that Russia’s aims must be achieved and that Moscow’s preference was to achieve those aims peacefully.
He noted that Putin had expressed a willingness for direct talks with Ukraine, but that there had been no answer yet from Kyiv.
“Unfortunately, we haven’t heard any statements in this context from Kyiv. So we don’t know whether Kyiv is ready or not,” Peskov told reporters in English.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the “bloodbath” of the more than three-year war in Ukraine – which his administration now casts as a proxy conflict between the United States and Russia.
“We understand that Washington is willing to achieve a quick success in this process,” Peskov said in English. But TASS quoted Peskov as saying that the root causes of the Ukraine were too complex to be resolved in one day.
Trump said on Tuesday he thought that Putin wants to stop the war in Ukraine, adding that if it was not for Trump then Russia would try to take the whole of Ukraine.
“If it weren’t for me, I think he’d want to take over the whole country,” Trump said. Trump refused to answer a question about whether the United States would halt military aid to Ukraine if Washington walked away from talks.
Putin’s decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022 triggered the worst confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis – which is considered to be the time when the two Cold War superpowers came closest to intentional nuclear war.

Title: Pahalgam attack: Key cabinet meetings at PM Modi’s residence conclude
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:31:58 +0000
Content: The second meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was held on Wednesday, following the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.
The CCS, along with the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), met at the Prime Minister’s residence in New Delhi.
The second CCS meeting focused on reviewing security preparedness in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
A cabinet briefing is scheduled for 4:00 pm.
In its earlier briefing, the CCS had underscored “cross-border linkages” to the Pahalgam attack and announced a series of punitive measures against Pakistan. These included the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, closure of the Integrated Check Post at Attari, revocation of visas for Pakistani nationals, and a reduction in the diplomatic presence of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
“The CCS resolved that perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. India will be unrelenting in pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,” Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said during a special press conference on April 23.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi chaired a high-level meeting attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also participated in the discussions.

Title: US targets Iran with fresh sanctions ahead of next nuclear talks
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:21:17 +0000
Content: The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on entities it accused of being involved in the illicit trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemicals ahead of a new round of U.S.-Iran negotiations on Saturday, as Washington seeks to ramp up pressure on Tehran.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement it was imposing sanctions on seven entities based in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Iran that it accused of trading Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products. Two vessels were also targeted.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a separate statement that the action targeted four sellers and one buyer of Iranian petrochemicals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Wednesday’s action is the latest move targeting Tehran since Trump restored his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports to zero and help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.
The President is committed to driving Iran’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports – including exports to China – to zero under his maximum pressure campaign,” Rubio said.
Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The action comes as the United States has relaunched talks with Iran over its nuclear program. U.S. and Iranian negotiators will reconvene in Rome on Saturday.
In his first 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s uranium enrichment activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions.
Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal’s limits on uranium enrichment.
Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian power purposes.

Title: US economy contracts in the first quarter
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:56:53 +0000
Content: The U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, swamped by a flood of imports as businesses raced to avoid higher costs from tariffs and underscoring the disruptive nature of President Donald Trump’s often chaotic trade policy.
The Commerce Department’s advance gross domestic product (GDP) report on Wednesday, however, grossly exaggerated the economy’s dimming prospects. Though consumer spending slowed considerably, the pace of growth remained healthy. Businesses also boosted investment in equipment.
Nonetheless, both consumer and business spending likely reflected front-loading before the import duties kicked in. As such, the report reinforced Americans’ growing disapproval of Trump’s handling of the economy as he marks 100 days in office.
Trump swept to victory last November on voter angst over the economy, especially inflation. Consumer confidence is near five-year lows and business sentiment has tanked, while airlines have pulled their 2025 financial forecasts, citing uncertainty over spending on nonessential travel because of tariffs, which economists said will raise costs for companies and households.
“If the blowout on trade was the result of firms pre-buying imported inputs to beat the tariffs, the decay in the trade balance will reverse in second quarter,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “That will generate some GDP growth. However, corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes – tariffs are a tax on imports – will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.” Gross domestic product decreased at a 0.3% annualized rate last quarter, the first decline since the first quarter of 2022, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP.
It was also weighed down by a decline in federal government spending, likely linked to the Trump administration’s aggressive funding cuts, marked by mass firings and shuttering of programs.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that GDP increased at a 0.3% pace in the January-March period.
The survey was, however, concluded before data on Tuesday showed the goods trade deficit surged to an all-time high in March amid record imports, which prompted most economists to sharply downgrade their GDP estimates. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the fourth quarter.
Imports jumped at a 41.3% rate, the largest rise since the third quarter of 2020, when the nation was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, which fractured global supply chains. That obliterated a modest rise in exports, resulting in a large trade gap that chopped off a record 4.83 percentage points from GDP.
Imports were driven by both consumer and capital goods. The BEA said it had identified and removed an increase in imports of silver bars as a form of investment in the first quarter.
Transactions in valuables, such as nonmonetary gold and silver, are not treated as investments and therefore purchases of these metals are not included in consumer spending, gross private domestic investment or government spending, it said.
An unusually large amount of non-monetary gold had accounted for some of the jump in imports in the past months, leading to a wide disparity in the GDP estimates. Inventory accumulation rebounded sharply after two straight quarterly declines, blunting some of the hit on GDP from imports.
U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
FRONT-LOADING SUPPORTS CONSUMER SPENDING
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, grew at a 1.8% rate after a robust 4.0% in the fourth quarter. It was supported by outlays on both services and goods, mostly healthcare, housing and nondurable goods. Most households pulled forward spending to avoid higher prices. With the labor market also cooling, consumers are mostly saving.
Trump on Tuesday softened the blow of his auto tariffs through an executive order mixing credits with relief from other levies on parts and materials.
A 145% tariff on Chinese goods, which unleashed a trade war between Washington and Beijing, remains in place, as does an array of other import duties. Trump sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
Business spending on equipment soared at a 22.5% rate. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which exclude trade, inventories and government spending, grew at a solid 3.0% rate. But this traditional measure of domestic demand has been distorted by tariffs.
Inflation heated up last quarter. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index excluding the volatile food and energy components surged at a 3.5% rate, an acceleration from the October-December’s 2.6% pace. The so-called core PCE inflation is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% target.
Economists expect the U.S. central bank to resume cutting interest rates at some point this year.

Title: Kyiv ready to sign resources deal with US, Ukraine government source says
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:02:55 +0000
Content: Ukraine is ready to sign a mineral resources deal with the United States and could do so later on Wednesday, a Ukrainian government source told media.
First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was travelling to the United States to sign the agreement, the source said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Ukrainian officials hope that signing the deal promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump will help to firm up softening American support for Kyiv in the war triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion more than three years ago.
The two sides signed a memorandum, published on April 18, as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resources in Ukraine. In the memorandum, they said they aimed to complete talks by April 26 and sign the deal as soon as possible.
Trump and his administration’s officials threatened to walk away from efforts to broker a peace deal earlier this month unless there are clear signs of progress soon.
Ukraine has relied on military aid from the U.S., ranging from air defence to long-range missiles, to repel Russia’s onslaught for more than three years.
In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that American aid comprised around 30% of the weapons and equipment used to defend the country.
On April 28, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv had agreed that past U.S. aid provided to Kyiv would not be counted as part of a minerals deal.
During a trip to the United States last week, Shmyhal met U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and reported “good progress” on the agreement.
Shmyhal also said that Kyiv had clearly defined the red lines regarding the agreement’s compliance with Ukraine’s European obligations and Ukrainian legislation.

Title: Goyal holds talks in Oslo to strengthen India-Norway trade & investment ties
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:59:01 +0000
Content: Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal held separate meetings here, on Wednesday, with Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide and the Scandinavian country’s Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth to discuss the implementation of the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement and strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries.
“In my first engagement after arriving in Oslo, held a bilateral meeting with Espen Barth Eide, the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs. We discussed the implementation of the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), strengthening bilateral ties, and boosting trade and investment between our nations,” Minister Goyal posted on X.
This was followed up with another bilateral meeting with his Norwegian counterpart, Cecilie Myrseth.
“Delighted to meet Cecilie Myrseth, Minister of Trade and Industry, Norway. Our talks focused on deepening trade engagement in alignment with the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement and on exploring new opportunities to further elevate India-Norway bilateral ties,” Goyal wrote on X.
The Indian minister also co-chaired the Norway India Business Executive Roundtable alongside Myrseth. “Discussions centred on expanding economic cooperation, fostering innovation-led growth, and exploring potential collaborations to further strengthen business ties between the two nations,” Goyal said.
He also visited the Norwegian Parliament – Stortinget and interacted with “some of the distinguished members”.
“Had an extensive discussion on enhancing India-Norway trade and economic ties. We also exchanged views on our strong democratic traditions and commitment to development, rooted in people-centric governance”, Goyal said.
Goyal is on a five-day visit to London, Oslo, and Brussels for strengthening India’s trade and investment relations with the UK, Norway and the European Union.
The visit to Oslo comes against the backdrop of India having signed a comprehensive free trade agreement with the four-nation European bloc EFTA in March last year. It is expected to be implemented this year. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) comprises Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
The two sides signed the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) in March, last year. India has received a commitment of a $100 billion investment over 15 years from the grouping, while allowing products such as Swiss watches, chocolates, and cut and polished diamonds from the region to come into the country at lower or zero duties as part of the agreement.
Negotiations have also picked up momentum for a trade agreement with the 27-nation European Union (EU). India and the EU are exploring the possibility of an early harvest agreement before finalising a comprehensive pact. The 11th round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled from May 12–16 in New Delhi.

Title: India’s GCCs record robust rise in women staffers at senior levels
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:45:18 +0000
Content: While India is rapidly becoming a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs), the development has ushered in a promising trend in women’s career advancement with a significant increase in female representation in mid and senior positions in the sector, according to a TeamLease Digital report released on Wednesday.
The report states that apart from playing an integral role in driving innovation and digital transformation in the country, GCCs are leading the way in fostering gender diversity, especially in contractual hiring. This trend is largely driven by structured Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, alignment with global workforce standards, and the growth of roles in areas such as finance, human resources, and digital operations – fields where women have traditionally been more prominently represented.
From 2023 to 2024, GCCs have shown a commendable commitment to improving gender diversity, particularly at mid and senior levels, with the percentage in mid-levels growing from 12.12 per cent in 2023 to 13.68 per cent in 2024 and the senior levels witnessing a growth from 8.14 per cent in 2023 to 13.6 per cent in 2024, the report by the staffing firm states.
This rise in women advancing into leadership roles signals a promising shift in workplace dynamics and underlines the potential for long-term structural transformation, the report further states. However, the report also points out that there is a gender pay gap at senior levels in GCCs, with female employees on average paid 16.4 per cent lower salaries than their male counterparts.
“Crucially, the analysis indicates a disparity of 16 per cent between male and female employees, highlighting persistent systemic inequalities and barriers that affect women’s career advancement and salary negotiations. This underscores the need for continued efforts to ensure equitable compensation alongside improved representation,” the report states.
In its city-wise analysis, the report reveals that in Tier 1 cities, female participation in GCCs remains relatively high despite challenges like high-pressure work environments and limited career advancement opportunities. In Tier 1 cities, women make up almost 40 per cent compared to the 23.36 per cent in Tier 2 cities.
Despite the challenges, the findings capture a spirit of optimism. It points to the narrowing of gaps in some areas and the steady increase of women entering the workforce across sectors.

Content: The Central government on Wednesday constituted a High-Level Committee under the chairmanship of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and three others as its members to oversee matters related to the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
The committee includes Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery as its members.
The committee has been constituted exercising the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 8B of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (53 of 2005), a Ministry of Home Affairs notification mentions.
The constitution of the committee aims at strengthening national preparedness and response under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
This committee plays a critical role in guiding policy decisions and ensuring coordinated efforts among various ministries and agencies during times of disaster. Its formation is aimed at enhancing the country’s resilience to both natural and man-made disasters, including floods, earthquakes, pandemics, and industrial accidents.
By bringing together key figures from finance, agriculture, and planning, the committee ensures a multi-sectoral approach to disaster management. This is particularly significant given the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events and other emergencies, which require timely resource allocation, robust planning, and effective mitigation strategies.
Officials say the panel will also oversee the implementation of long-term risk reduction measures and review the readiness of states and Union Territories, reinforcing India’s national disaster response mechanism.

Title: North Korea conducts first test firing of its new warship’s weapons system
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:36:05 +0000
Content: North Korea earlier this week conducted the first test-firing of the weapons system of the new “Choe Hyon-class” warship it recently unveiled, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday.
Cruise and anti-air missiles were launched and artillery fired as part of the test-firing attended by leader Kim Jong Un and senior officials, the report said.
The time has come for North Korea’s navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament for maritime sovereignty and for the sake of national defence, Kim was quoted as saying.
The intelligence agencies of South Korea and the U.S. were closely monitoring North Korea’s shipbuilding activities, an official at Seoul’s defence ministry said.
More work might be needed before the new naval destroyer could take to the sea under its own propulsion, said 38 North, a think tank focusing on North Korea, noting a satellite image of tug boats nudging the ship back towards a floating drydock.
“The use of tugboats to move the ship into place and back again could indicate the lack of a functioning propulsion system,” the think tank said.
North Korean state media on Saturday revealed the 5,000-tonne warship that it said was equipped with the “most powerful weapons.”
Kim, in a speech from the launch reported by KCNA, said the warship would be handed over to the navy and go into service early next year.
The “Choe Hyon-class” ship was named after anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter Choe Hyon, according to KCNA.

Title: Cabinet approves ₹22,864-crore greenfield highway project connecting Meghalaya and Assam
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:31:27 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved a ₹22,864 crore project to build a 166.8 km four-lane greenfield access-controlled highway between Mawlyngkhung in Meghalaya and Panchgram in Assam. The project will be executed under the Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM).
Out of the total stretch, 144.80 km falls in Meghalaya and 22.00 km in Assam. This high-speed corridor, part of National Highway No. 06, is expected to transform regional connectivity and boost economic activity.
The highway will significantly reduce travel distance and time between Guwahati and Silchar. It will improve access to Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam’s Barak Valley, thereby enhancing logistics and reducing transportation costs across the region.
Passing through key cement and coal-producing areas, the highway will support Meghalaya’s industrial growth. It will also improve access to tourist destinations across the Northeast, benefiting travelers arriving via Guwahati, Shillong, and Silchar airports.
The corridor will ease congestion on the existing NH-06 and integrate with major routes like NH-27, NH-106, NH-206, and NH-37. It will pass through important districts such as Ri Bhoi, East Khasi Hills, West and East Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, and Cachar in Assam.
Key towns including Diengpasoh, Ummulong, Phramer, Khliehriat, Ratacherra, Umkiang, and Kalain will be connected, improving inter-city travel and accessibility.
Aligned with the PM Gati Shakti Master Plan and the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, this critical project will boost infrastructure, generate employment, and promote socio-economic development across five Northeastern states: Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.

Title: Caste enumeration to be included in upcoming census, says government
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:27:01 +0000
Content: In a major decision, the central government on Wednesday announced that caste enumeration will be included in the upcoming population census.
Briefing the media on the Union Cabinet’s decisions, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that while some states have carried out caste-based surveys, conducting a census falls strictly within the jurisdiction of the central government.
“The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) has decided today that caste enumeration will be part of the forthcoming census,” Vaishnaw stated.
He criticized previous Congress governments, accusing them of consistently opposing the idea of a caste census.
“Since independence, caste was never included in any official census. In 2010, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had assured the Lok Sabha that the matter would be taken up by the cabinet. A Group of Ministers was formed to deliberate on the issue, and most political parties supported a caste census. However, the Congress-led government at the time opted only for a caste-based survey — the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) — instead of a full-fledged census,” he said.
Vaishnaw further alleged that the Congress and its INDI alliance partners have used the issue of caste census purely for political purposes.
He emphasized that under Article 246 of the Constitution, the census is listed at Entry 69 of the Union List in the Seventh Schedule, making it exclusively a Union subject.
“While some states have conducted caste surveys — some effectively, others for political gain in a non-transparent manner — the central government believes that a transparent caste enumeration as part of the official census will prevent the politicization of this sensitive issue,” he said.
The minister asserted that this move will contribute to strengthening the country’s social and economic framework.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs has taken this decision, demonstrating the government’s commitment to the values and aspirations of society,” he added.
Vaishnaw also highlighted the Modi government’s past efforts in social justice, including the introduction of a 10 per cent reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), which was implemented without adversely affecting any existing category.

Title: Bangladesh HC grants bail to prominent Hindu leader Chinmoy Krishna Das
Publication Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:20:17 +0000
Content: Chinmoy Krishna Das, a prominent Hindu leader and spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot, has been granted bail by the High Court on Wednesday in an alleged sedition case.
The bench of Justice Atoar Rahman and Justice Ali Reza passed the order after a final hearing.
Earlier this year, the High Court issued a rule after hearing Das’s application for bail in the case, seeking an explanation as to why the applicant should not be granted bail.
Last week, the High Court set April 30 as the date for the rule hearing, following which the Court declared the rule absolute and delivered its verdict, Bangladesh’s leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo reported on Wednesday.
Arrested on November 25 from the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on charges of sedition, Das has remained in jail despite widespread demands for his release.
Chinmoy Krishna was taken into custody by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, an act which was criticised throughout the world and exposed the crimes being committed against the Hindu community of Bangladesh.
Krishna was not only associated with the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajot (BJHM), a grand national alliance of 23 religious organisations in the country, but also with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). The news of his arrest led to several protests demanding his immediate release.
The incidents of vandalism, looting, arson, land grabbing, and threats to leave the country have been repeatedly inflicted on the Hindu community after the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on August 8 following the fall of Awami League regime led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Even though Yunus and his religious affairs advisor A.F.M. Khalid Hossain assured that the current establishment believes in communal harmony, the communal violence, which began immediately after Hasina left Dhaka, continued to cause widespread fear, anxiety, and uncertainty among the minorities in Bangladesh, especially Hindus.
Last month, a report of the Dhaka-based human rights organisation, Ain O Salish Kendra (AsK), highlighted that there are reports of a total of 147 incidents of vandalising houses, temples, and business establishments of the Hindu community across the country.
Some 408 households were vandalised in these incidents, including 36 cases of arson. Besides, there have been reports of 113 incidents of vandalising business establishments owned by the minority community, 32 incidents of attack on temples and mosques of the Ahmadiyya sect, and 92 incidents of vandalising idols in 92 temples.
There have been several incidents of attacks on the minorities all over the country, particularly the Hindu community, after the fall of the Awami League government with their areas, including houses, business establishments, and places of worship coming under attack and even set on fire in certain instances.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Yunus on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.
India has repeatedly raised concerns over the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh, hoping that the interim government in the country led by Yunus will take strong action against the perpetrators of violence.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday extended greetings to the people of Maharashtra and Gujarat on the occasion of their Statehood Day, celebrating the cultural, historical, and economic contributions of both states to the nation. President Droupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, and other senior leaders also conveyed their best wishes, acknowledging the pivotal role of Maharashtra and Gujarat in India’s development.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister praised Maharashtra for its enduring role in India’s growth and its deep-rooted cultural heritage. “Maharashtra Day greetings to the people of the state, which has always played a vital role in India’s development. When one thinks of Maharashtra, its glorious history and the courage of the people come to our mind. The state remains a strong pillar of progress and at the same time has remained connected to its roots. My best wishes for the state’s progress,” he said.
On Gujarat Day, PM Modi lauded the state for its entrepreneurial spirit and dynamic progress across various sectors. “On the proud occasion of their Statehood Day, my best wishes to the people of Gujarat. The state has distinguished itself for its culture, spirit of enterprise and dynamism. The people of Gujarat have excelled in various fields. May the state keep attaining new heights of progress,” the Prime Minister said.
President Droupadi Murmu also took to X to greet the people of Gujarat, calling it a land that has shaped India’s moral and political legacy. “On the foundation day of Gujarat state, I extend my heartiest greetings to all my countrymen, especially my Gujarati brothers and sisters living in India and abroad,” she said.
She highlighted Gujarat as the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, remarking that the state’s contributions have enhanced India’s reputation on the global stage. “The people here have increased India’s prestige across the world, on the strength of their talent, dedication and hard work. I am confident that Gujarat will set new standards of progress and will make a significant contribution in making India a world power,” the President added added.
Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar echoed similar sentiments, saying: “Warm greetings on Gujarat Statehood Day. The land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gujarat, continues to inspire through its legacy of leadership, resilience and innovation. Wishing the state continued advancement as it reaches new heights.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah extended his heartfelt wishes, celebrating Gujarat’s natural diversity, historical richness, and industrious people. “Gujarat has always attracted people from all over the world with its talent, hard work and practical skills. I pray to Dada Somnath for the continued progress and upliftment of the people of Gujarat,” he said in a post on X.
Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel also marked the day with a special announcement. He unveiled a plan to observe the decade from 2025 to 2035 as the “Utkarsh Gujarat Diamond Festival,” culminating in the Diamond Jubilee of Gujarat’s formation in 2035. The initiative aims to celebrate the state’s legacy and chart a roadmap for its future growth.
May 1 is observed annually as Maharashtra Day and Gujarat Day, commemorating the formation of the two states in 1960. Following the passage of the Bombay Reorganisation Act, the erstwhile Bombay State was divided on linguistic lines, giving rise to Maharashtra for Marathi speakers and Gujarat for Gujarati speakers. Over the decades, both states have emerged as cultural, industrial, and economic powerhouses, playing key roles in shaping India’s post-independence journey.

Title: Increasing urban vegetation can save over 1.1 mn lives from heat-related deaths: Study
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 06:22:13 +0000
Content: As climate change intensifies, leading to a rise in global temperatures and heat-related deaths, a new study highlights the life-saving potential of increasing urban green cover. According to researchers from Monash University, expanding vegetation in cities by 30 per cent could prevent up to 1.16 million deaths globally that are currently attributed to extreme heat.
Published in The Lancet Planetary Health, the study is based on a 20-year modelling analysis covering more than 11,000 urban areas worldwide, from 2000 to 2019. The researchers found that increasing vegetation by 10, 20, and 30 per cent could lower the global population-weighted mean temperature during the warm season by 0.08°C, 0.14°C, and 0.19°C, respectively.
This temperature reduction translates into an estimated prevention of 0.86 million, 1.02 million, and 1.16 million deaths, depending on the level of green coverage implemented.
“This is the first modelling study to assess both the cooling and modifying effects of urban greenness, offering a more holistic view of how green infrastructure can reduce heat-related mortality,” said Professor Yuming Guo, the lead author of the study.
The research found that urban areas in Southern Asia, Eastern Europe, and Eastern Asia would see the greatest reduction in heat-related deaths with increased vegetation.
Heat exposure remains a growing public health threat, especially as climate change worsens. Between 2000 and 2019, it was linked to around 500,000 deaths annually — approximately 0.91 per cent of all global deaths. Under the most severe global warming scenarios, future projections estimate heat-related mortality could rise to between 2.5 per cent in Northern Europe and 16.7 per cent in Southeast Asia by the end of the century.
Urban vegetation helps reduce heat by providing shade, reflecting solar radiation, and facilitating evapotranspiration — a process that releases moisture from the ground and plants, which cools the surrounding air. Beyond lowering temperatures, green spaces may also benefit mental health, social interaction, physical activity, and air quality.
The study underscores the urgent need for urban planning strategies that prioritize greenery, not just for environmental benefits but for saving lives.

Title: Australia Votes: Understanding the General Election Process
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 06:01:17 +0000
Content: Australia will hold a general election on Saturday, May 3.
Opinion polls indicate Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s ruling centre-left Labor party is ahead of the conservative Liberal-National coalition led by Peter Dutton, as global uncertainty fuelled by U.S. President Donald Trump makes some voters more risk-averse.
A large number of independent and minor parties are also seeking reelection and could become king-makers if either major bloc falls short of a majority government.
Labor returned to power in 2022 after nine years of Liberal-National coalition rule.
Here are some facts on how elections work in Australia:
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Australia is one of the few countries in the world with compulsory voting for all citizens aged 18 years and older. Around 4.8 million of 18 million eligible voters had cast a ballot at early voting centres by Thursday.
Counting of ballots will start from 6 p.m. Australian Eastern Time (0800 GMT) on Saturday after polling closes. Election tallies are progessively published on the Australian Electoral Commission website.
The commission never officially declares the results of a federal election on election night. Whether analysts or political parties declare a result on Saturday evening will depend on how close the race is.
Most postal votes will be counted after the election day.
AUSTRALIA’S PARLIAMENT
There are two houses of parliament, with the government formed by the party or coalition holding a majority in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. The prime minister is chosen by the governing party from the House.
The upper house, the Senate, has 76 members – 12 from each of the six states and two from each of Australia’s two less-populous territories.
Half of the Senate seats will be contested at this election.
WHAT’S THE STATE OF PLAY NOW?
Labor holds 77 House of Representatives seats, the Liberal-National coalition holds 53 seats, the Greens hold 4, and 15 are held by micro parties and independents.
A loose grouping of seven “Teal” independents are women who won Liberal seats by focusing on climate change and government accountability.
To form majority government in the 2025 election, a party or coalition needs 76 seats out of 150.
If neither Labor nor the Liberal-National coalition has a majority of seats in the House of Representatives after polling day, a minority government can be formed with an agreement of support from independent members or minor parties.
Such an agreement is not legally binding, and is only a political pledge of support which can be changed at any time, because a member of parliament cannot contract their vote, according to constitutional law experts.
HOW DO AUSTRALIANS VOTE?
Australia has a preferential voting system for the House of Representatives. Voters rank local candidates in order of preference on their ballot papers.
A candidate who gets more than 50% of the first-preference votes wins the seat. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the one with the fewest votes is excluded, and their votes are distributed to the person each of those voters nominated as their second preference. This continues until one candidate passes the 50% threshold.

Title: Global nuclear fusion project crosses milestone with world’s most powerful magnet
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 05:30:59 +0000
Content: A much-delayed nuclear fusion project involving more than 30 countries is ready to assemble the world’s most powerful magnet – a key part of efforts to generate clean energy by smashing atoms together at super-high temperatures.
The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, based in southern France and backed by the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the European Union, needs the magnetic system to create an “invisible cage” to confine super-hot plasma particles that combine and fuse to release energy.
ITER said late on Wednesday that the final component of the system – the central solenoid – had been completed and tested by the United States, and assembly wasnow underway.
“It is like the bottle in a bottle of wine: of course the wine is maybe more important than the bottle, but you need the bottle in order to put the wine inside,” said Pietro Barabaschi, ITER’s director general.
The magnet was originally scheduled for completion in 2021, but has been beset by delays.
“To be behind schedule by four years after 10 years of effort shows just how troubled this project is,” said Charles Seife, a professor at New York University who writes about nuclear fusion.
Barabaschi said the “crisis” was now over and construction was proceeding at the fastest pace in ITER’s history. The start-up phase of the project will begin in 2033, when it is scheduled to start generating plasma.
He said ITER proved that countries could still cooperate despite geopolitical tensions.
“They have a very, very strong cohesion of objectives and for the time being I see no sign of a withdrawal from anyone.”
Fusion investment has been growing, with dozens of initiatives currently underway. Several private start-ups have said they can build commercial fusion reactors within a decade.
Barabaschi said he was sceptical but supportive of the dozens of ventures in development across the world.
“We already know that we can get fusion,” he said. “The question is, are we going to get fusion in such a way that it would be cost-effective?
“I am quite sceptical that we will be able to achieve this within, say, one or even two decades. Frankly speaking, it will take more time.”

Title: PM Modi chairs 46th PRAGATI meeting, reviews projects worth ₹90,000 crore
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 05:22:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired the 46th edition of PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation), a multi-modal ICT-based platform for coordinated governance involving the centre and states.
During the session, the Prime Minister reviewed eight critical infrastructure projects valued at over ₹90,000 crore. The reviewed projects included three major road projects, two from the railways sector, and two related to ports, shipping, and waterways. These initiatives span multiple states and Union Territories and are aimed at accelerating the country’s infrastructure development.
A key focus of the meeting was the review of grievance redressal mechanisms under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY). The Prime Minister directed all ministries and departments to ensure that beneficiary identification is carried out strictly through biometrics-based Aadhaar authentication or verification. He also suggested integrating complementary schemes related to childcare, health, hygiene, and sanitation to improve the overall well-being of mothers and newborns.
Urban planning was another major point of discussion. While reviewing a project related to the development of a Ring Road, Prime Minister Modi emphasized that such infrastructure must be seamlessly integrated into the broader urban development strategy. He underlined the need to align the Ring Road’s design with the city’s projected growth over the next 25–30 years, and encouraged the study of sustainable urban planning models. He also proposed exploring the integration of a circular rail network as a sustainable public transport alternative.
During the review of the Jal Marg Vikas Project, the Prime Minister advocated for building strong community connections along inland waterway stretches to support cruise tourism. He highlighted the potential for boosting local economies by promoting regional crafts and entrepreneurship through initiatives like ‘One District One Product’ (ODOP). PM Modi reiterated that inland waterways should act as both logistical channels and tourism hubs, helping generate employment and enhance regional development.
The PM also stressed the importance of integrated planning tools such as PM Gati Shakti for enhancing synergy across sectors. He instructed all departments to keep their databases updated, emphasizing that accurate and timely data is essential for informed policy-making and efficient implementation.
Since its launch, 370 projects worth nearly ₹20 lakh crore have been reviewed under the PRAGATI initiative.

Title: Singapore PM urges voters to re-elect his cabinet to deal with US, China
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 05:03:22 +0000
Content: Singaporeans need to vote for candidates who have built up trust and close relationships with counterparts in the U.S. and China, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday, urging voters to re-elect his cabinet at a May 3 poll.
Addressing a 1.4 million-strong labour union on the last day of campaigning, Wong warned of economic turbulence and job losses if U.S. tariffs slow global growth. His government has warned the trade-reliant economy may face a possible recession.
“We must expect more pressure on us and to navigate these pressures, it will take experience and skill. It will take people in government who have built up trust and close relationships with their counterparts in both America and China,” Wong said.
He said voters needed to re-elect his whole team to effectively deal with these economic headwinds.
“I have backups, I have reserves, sure. But everyone knows that the team cannot function at the same level. It’s the same in any organisation, and it will be so in our next cabinet if we end up with such a loss,” he said, referring to the possible loss of his deputy prime minister.
Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party, in power since 1959, is widely expected to be easily re-elected, but there is growing unhappiness with its governance in the face of rising costs of living.
Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong was nominated at the 11th hour in a hotbed contest in a ward in northeast Singapore in an effort to stop the main opposition Workers’ Party, which won 10 seats in the last parliament.
Campaigning in recent days has zeroed in on Gan being new to the area, after an incumbent ruling party candidate called the opposition team strangers. The opposition fired back, asking if Gan was the real stranger to the constituency.
Wong has thrown his weight behind Gan, calling him his “taskforce man” because Gan co-headed the COVID-19 taskforce and is now chairing the “economic resilience” taskforce dealing with the impact of U.S. tariffs.
“The key person in charge of this work is no stranger to you. He is no stranger to the whole of Singapore,” Wong said on Thursday.
This is the first electoral test for Wong, who took over from long-time premier Lee Hsien Loong last year as leader of the People’s Action Party.
Six political parties and an independent candidate have rallies scheduled for Thursday night.

Title: Chelsea beat Man United 1-0 to win sixth straight WSL title
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 04:49:30 +0000
Content: Chelsea wrapped up their sixth consecutive Women’s Super League title and record-extending eighth in total after a 1-0 victory at Manchester United on Wednesday, with Lucy Bronze heading home a corner late in the game.
Sonia Bompastor’s Blues, who needed only a point from Wednesday’s match to secure another title and continue their WSL dominance, sit atop the league table with 54 points for an unassailable nine-point lead over Arsenal with two games remaining. United are third on 43 points.
Despite terrific scoring chances for both sides, the game looked headed for a draw before Bronze leapt to head in Sandy Baltimore’s corner just inside the far post in the 74th minute sparking a celebration that looked like a mix of joy and relief from Bompastor’s players.
“It’s a great achievement,” Bompastor told Sky Sports. “It feels a bit unreal. Tonight it’s a team performance. We bounced back and showed the great character the team has.
“This league is really competitive. Maybe for some people, they just think being Chelsea, it’s really easy for us to achieve this, but it isn’t,” she added. “We work really hard, and we had the right mindset from the beginning of the season until now.”
The team celebrated arm-in-arm in front of Chelsea’s visiting fans.
The title caps a remarkable debut season for Bompastor after she stepped into the shoes of former manager Emma Hayes, who left Chelsea after 12 trophy-laden seasons to coach the United States women’s team.
Bompastor has guided Chelsea to an undefeated season thus far, with 17 victories in their 20 games.
Aston Villa had paved the way for Chelsea to clinch the title with their 5-2 hammering of Arsenal earlier in the evening.
“We knew before the game that Arsenal had got beat, so we knew what we needed, but we wanted to win, we want to go unbeaten all season,” Bronze told Sky. “We get to finish at home at Stamford Bridge. All our fans get to come down and celebrate winning the trophy.”
The one-goal night was not for a lack of chances on both sides.
United squandered an opportunity to break the deadlock just before halftime when Melvine Malard latched on to a back-pass but Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton got out quickly to stifle her chance. The ball then fell to Grace Clinton, who unleashed a shot from 20 yards that Hampton pushed over the bar.
“I don’t think I’ve got enough words to say (how I’m feeling),” Hampton said. “We’re all ecstatic, and we’re not going to let up in the last two games; we want to go the whole season unbeaten.”
United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce made a brilliant triple save in the second half, batting Aggie Beever-Jones’ shot into the path of Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, whose strike hit Tullis-Joyce before Erin Cuthbert fired straight at the keeper.
United had to watch Chelsea celebrate last season as well when they clinched their fifth title in a row with a 6-0 thrashing in Manchester in a fitting finale for Hayes.
Chelsea’s league title comes three days after they were eliminated from Champions League contention by holders Barcelona in the semi-finals.

Title: Pahalgam attack: India shuts airspace to Pakistani aircraft and military flights
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 04:04:14 +0000
Content: India has closed its airspace to all aircraft registered in Pakistan, including those operated or leased by Pakistani airlines and military flights. This decision comes in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed 26 lives.
The ban will be effective from April 30 to May 23 and is subject to further review, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) said on Wednesday.
Pakistan had already imposed a similar restriction on Indian aircraft six days ago. With this, both countries have now closed their airspace to each other’s airlines.
The move follows an increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC), to which the Indian Army has responded firmly. Security forces have also ramped up anti-terror operations across the Kashmir Valley in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The government has granted full operational freedom to the armed forces to determine the appropriate response.

Title: Ukraine, US sign minerals deal sought by Trump
Publication Date: Thu, 01 May 2025 03:43:05 +0000
Content: Ukraine and the U.S. on Wednesday signed a deal heavily promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump that will give the United States preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals and fund investment in Ukraine’s reconstruction.
The two countries signed the accord in Washington after months of sometimes fraught negotiations, with uncertainty persisting until the last moment with word of an eleventh-hour snag.
The accord establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine.
The agreement is central to Kyiv’s efforts to mend ties with Trump and the White House, which frayed after he took office in January. Ukrainian officials have hoped that the deal would ensure continued U.S. support for Ukraine’s defence against Russia.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko were shown signing the agreement in a photo posted on X by the Treasury, which said the deal “clearly signals the Trump Administration’s commitment to a free, sovereign, prosperous Ukraine.”
Svyrydenko wrote on X that the accord provides for Washington to contribute to the fund.
“In addition to direct financial contributions, it may also provide NEW assistance – for example, air defense systems for Ukraine,” she said. Washington did not directly address that suggestion.
The U.S. has been Ukraine’s single largest military donor since Russia’s 2022 invasion, with aid of more than 64 billion euros ($72 billion), according to the Kiel Institute in Germany.
Before the signing, Trump repeated on Wednesday that the U.S. should get something for its aid to Kyiv, hence the effort to secure a deal for Ukraine’s plentiful deposits of rare earth minerals.
In announcing the deal, the U.S. Treasury said the partnership recognized “the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion.”
UKRAINE CONTROLS EXTRACTION DECISIONS
Svyrydenko said the accord allowed Ukraine to “determine what and where to extract” and that its subsoil remains owned by Ukraine.
Ukraine is rich in natural resources including rare earth metals, which are used in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and military applications, among others. Global rare-earth mining is currently dominated by China, which is locked in a trade war with the U.S. after Trump’s sharp tariff increases.
Ukraine also has large reserves of iron, uranium, and natural gas.
Svyrydenko said Ukraine has no debt obligations to the United States under the agreement, a key point in the lengthy negotiations between the two countries.
The deal also, she said, complied with Ukraine’s constitution and Ukraine’s campaign to join the European Union, key elements in Ukraine’s negotiating position.
The minerals deal and U.S. peace efforts have been negotiated separately but reflect Washington’s approach to Ukraine and Russia. Trump has upended U.S. policy by softening the U.S. stance toward Russia and sometimes falsely blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the war.
U.S. peace proposals have called for recognition of Russia’s claim to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and potentially four other Ukrainian regions. Zelenskiy has said Kyiv would never do so because it would contravene Ukraine’s constitution.
“Importantly, the Agreement sends a signal to global partners that long-term cooperation with Ukraine – over decades – is not only possible but reliable,” Svyrydenko said on X.
A draft of the U.S.-Ukraine agreement seen by Reuters earlier on Wednesday showed Ukraine secured the removal of any requirement for it to pay back the U.S. for past military assistance, something Kyiv had staunchly opposed.
The draft did not provide any concrete U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, one of its initial goals.
Separately, Ukraine has discussed with European allies the formation of an international force to help ensure Ukraine’s security if a peace agreement is reached with Russia.
