Title: Israel’s Gaza aid blockade contested in World Court hearings
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 07:04:09 +0000
Content: Israel will face accusations of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into the Gaza Strip when dozens of nations present arguments at the International Court of Justice during a week of hearings starting in The Hague on Monday.
Since March 2, Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, and food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out.
In December, the U.N.’s top court was tasked to form an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations.
Israel has said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Palestinian militant group Hamas releases all remaining hostages.
Germany, France and Britain last week called on Israel to adhere to international law by allowing the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, after Israel reiterated that no aid would be allowed to enter Gaza, in order to pressure Hamas.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid that was allowed into Gaza. Hamas has denied the allegations and has blamed Israel for shortages.
The resolution adopted in December by 137 of the 193 nations in the U.N.’s General Assembly called on Israel to comply with its obligations towards the Palestinian population, as it expressed “grave concern” about the dire humanitarian situation.
Israel, the United States and 10 other countries voted against the resolution, while 22 countries abstained.
Representatives for the Palestinian territories will be among the first to address the court in The Hague on Monday.
Israel is not among the roughly 40 nations that will speak during the five days of hearings scheduled through Friday. The United States will state its opinion on Wednesday.
Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.
The U.N. views Gaza and the West Bank as Israeli-occupied territory. International humanitarian law requires an occupying power to facilitate relief programs for people in need and ensure food, medical care, hygiene and public-health standards.
After the hearings, the World Court will likely take several months to form its opinion.

Title: CBDT launches aggressive drive to curb black money, targets Rs. 2.4 lakh crore in undisclosed income
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 06:50:35 +0000
Content: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has instructed field formations of the Income Tax Department to intensify efforts against black money and tax evasion through a comprehensive, time-bound strategy aimed at bringing unreported and under-reported businesses into the tax net.
According to a media report, the CBDT estimates a potential recovery of undisclosed income amounting to a staggering Rs. 2.4 lakh crore during the current financial year.
Each jurisdiction of the Income Tax Department has been tasked with conducting at least one major search and seizure operation by July 31, followed by a minimum of two additional operations between August 2025 and March 2026, NDTV Profit reported.
The CBDT has further directed that 60% of the overall target be achieved through intrusive measures such as searches and raids, while the remaining 40% should come from non-intrusive methods involving data analytics and financial intelligence.
As part of its strategy, the Investigation Wing has been instructed to prepare focused, data-backed reports on sectors vulnerable to tax evasion and lacking sufficient disclosure. Targeted sectors may include manufacturing, services, mining, liquor trade, international trade, hawala networks, healthcare, scrap dealing, and other ancillary or unregulated industries.
Highlighting the limited visibility into informal transactions, the CBDT emphasized the urgent need to study sectors with high volumes of unreported activity and develop strategies to promote formalisation and improve compliance.
This aggressive push is part of a broader plan to widen the tax base by bringing businesses that have so far evaded scrutiny due to insufficient data into the formal economy, thereby boosting revenue collections.
Meanwhile, India’s direct tax collections for the fiscal year 2024–25 have surpassed expectations. According to the Finance Ministry’s latest figures, provisional net direct tax collections have reached Rs. 11,82,875 crore, marking a 17% increase over the previous year. The tax buoyancy factor — which measures the growth rate of direct taxes relative to GDP growth — stood at 1.57, up from 1.54 in 2023–24, reflecting the strong fiscal health of the country.

Content: Uttrakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami held a virtual meeting on Monday with district magistrates from across the state to review the arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra 2025, which is scheduled to begin on April 30. 
In a post on X, Dhami said, “Hail Baba Kedar…! Shri Kedarnath Dham is being decorated with flowers before the doors open. Devotees will be able to have darshan of Baba from May 2.”
The registration for Char Dham Yatra 2025 also began on Monday, with special counters set up for specially-abled individuals, senior citizens, and foreign nationals. Moreover, 20 free registration counters have been established, according to District Tourism Officer Shushil Nautiyal.

Title: Union Minister Jitendra Singh reviews security arrangements during visit to Udhampur
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:58:41 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Jitendra Singh, visited Udhampur on Sunday to review the security arrangements in the region. The high-level meeting took place against the backdrop of heightened security concerns in Jammu and Kashmir following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 22 lives.
Addressing concerns, Singh assured that all necessary measures would be taken to ensure peace and safety in the region. “We will address all concerns and constraints to ensure peace and safety. Miscreants will be dealt with firmly,” he said.
During his visit, Singh also met Lt Gen Pratik Sharma, who will assume charge as the General Officer Commanding (GoC) Northern Command, Udhampur, from May 1. He lauded the Indian Army for maintaining high public morale through its strategic deployment at sensitive locations.
The Minister also commended the district administration for its ongoing efforts in maintaining law and order and supporting developmental initiatives in the region.
The review meeting involved detailed discussions on potential hotspots, vulnerabilities, and strategies to address them. Singh emphasized the importance of coordination among all security agencies to ensure effective and seamless operations.
Media access was restricted during the high-level security meeting. However, speaking to reporters afterward, Dr. Singh explained that certain operational details could not be disclosed publicly. “Some inputs are exclusively available with concerned security agencies and are acted upon discreetly. The positive outcomes of their actions eventually become visible to the public,” he said.
Reiterating the government’s commitment, Singh added that the security forces had formulated a comprehensive plan to maintain public confidence and ensure that citizens do not feel insecure.
Senior officials present at the meeting included DIG Udhampur-Reasi Range Sarah Rizvi, DC Udhampur Saloni Rai, SSP Amod Nagpure, ADDC Rajinder Singh, ADC Prem Singh, ACR Umesh Shan, SDM Chenani Ranjit Kotwal, SDM Ramnagar Rajinder Singh Rana, SDM Dudu Manmeet Kumar, SDM Basant Garh Waheed Ul Rehman, and others.

Title: Trump urges Russia to stop Ukraine attacks; Rubio says US might walk away from peace efforts
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:36:07 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump urged Russia on Sunday to stop its attacks in Ukraine while his top diplomat said the United States might walk away from peace efforts if it does not see progress.
Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, Trump said he was disappointed that Russia has continued to attack Ukraine, and said his one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Vatican on Saturday had gone well.
“I see him as calmer. I think he understands the picture, and I think he wants to make a deal,” Trump said of Zelenskiy.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said the Trump administration might abandon its attempts to broker a deal if Russia and Ukraine do not make headway.
“It needs to happen soon,” Rubio told the NBC program “Meet the Press.'” “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”
Trump and Zelenskiy, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met in a Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since an angry encounter in the White House Oval Office in February and comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to the conflict.
Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin after that meeting, saying on social media that there is “no reason” for Russia to shoot missiles into civilian areas.
In a pre-taped interview that aired on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would continue to target sites used by Ukraine’s military.
When asked about a Russian strike on Kyiv last week that killed civilians, Lavrov said that “the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian” and that Russia targets only “sites which are used by the military.”
Zelenskiy wrote on the messaging app Telegram that his top military commander reported that Russia had already conducted nearly 70 attacks on Sunday.
“The situation at the front and the real activity of the Russian army prove that there is currently insufficient pressure on Russia from the world to end this war,” Zelenskiy said.
DIFFERING PROPOSALS
Ukrainian and European officials pushed back last week against some U.S. proposals on how to end the war, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions.
American proposals called for U.S. recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as de facto recognition of Russia’s hold on other parts of Ukraine.
In contrast, the European and Ukrainian proposal defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that Ukraine should not agree to the American proposal, saying it went too far in ceding swathes of territory in return for a ceasefire.
Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. president has “expressed his frustration” at both Putin and Zelenskiy but remains determined to help negotiate an agreement.
Waltz also said the United States and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals.
Chuck Schumer, the top U.S. Senate Democrat, said on Sunday that he is concerned Trump will “cave in to Putin.”
“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

Title: India bans 16 Pak YouTube channels for misleading content on Indian Army, security agencies
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:25:33 +0000
Content: The Indian government on Monday banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative and communally sensitive content, along with false and misleading narratives aimed at targeting India, its Army, and security agencies. This decision comes after the tragic Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.
The move was made on the recommendations of the Ministry of Home Affairs, following the attack that led to the loss of innocent lives. The banned channels include prominent names like Dawn News, Irshad Bhatti, SAMAA TV, ARY NEWS, BOL NEWS, Raftar, The Pakistan Reference, Geo News, Samaa Sports, GNN, Uzair Cricket, Umar Cheema Exclusive, Asma Shirazi, Muneeb Farooq, SUNO News HD, and Razi Naama.
These channels were found to be disseminating false and unverified information related to India’s national security, foreign relations, and public order. Collectively, they had a massive reach, with a cumulative viewership exceeding 63.08 million. The content spread by these channels aimed to create panic, fuel communal tensions, and disrupt public order within India, according to an official statement.
The banned channels were particularly active in spreading fake news about topics such as the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, and India’s foreign relations in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.
Following the attack, India launched a strong diplomatic response by summoning Pakistan’s top diplomat in New Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, and issuing a Persona Non Grata notice to all Pakistani military attaches.
This action is part of a broader series of retaliatory measures taken by India, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the assault as a “cowardly attack on innocent civilians.”
The attack, carried out by the Pakistan-based terror group The Resistance Front, has escalated tensions between the two nations. In response, India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), led by Prime Minister Modi, announced several harsh measures, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, the cancellation of the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) for Pakistani nationals, the expulsion of Pakistani military attaches from New Delhi, and the reduction of diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.

Title: North Korea confirms troop deployment to assist Russia in Ukraine conflict
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:10:44 +0000
Content: North Korea confirmed for the first time on Monday that it had sent troops to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean military referred to their involvement as a “sacred mission” designed to strengthen the ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.
According to the state-run KCNA news agency, North Korean soldiers helped Russian forces “completely liberate” the Kursk border region, following an order from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
This admission comes just days after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the North Korean troops for their role in the liberation of the Kursk region during a video conference with President Vladimir Putin on April 26. Putin claimed that Russia had regained control of Kursk, a region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, although Ukraine has denied Russia’s claims.
North Korea’s acknowledgment of its troops’ involvement follows reports from the US, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine about sightings of North Korean soldiers on the frontlines, nearly a year ago. The North Korean government explained that Kim Jong Un saw the participation of its armed forces as a mission to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two nations, promote their prosperity, and protect North Korea’s honor.
In June 2024, Kim Jong Un and Putin signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, committing both nations to military support in the event of war. KCNA also reported that Kim had praised the soldiers who participated in the operation as heroes, and announced plans to erect a monument in Pyongyang to honor those who took part, with flowers to be placed on the graves of those who were killed.
Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned North Korea and other “third countries” for supporting Russia’s war against Ukraine, urging an end to the conflict and Moscow’s support for Pyongyang.

Title: India shared 300 million vaccines globally during COVID-19: Piyush Goyal
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:51:18 +0000
Content: India provided nearly 300 million vaccine doses to less developed and vulnerable countries through the Vaccine Maitri initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic — many of them free of cost — ensuring that no nation was left behind during the global health crisis, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said on Sunday.
Speaking at the World Health Summit (WHS) Regional Meeting Asia 2025 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, Goyal emphasized that, unlike several countries that imposed export controls, India prioritized equitable vaccine access for all. He highlighted that this approach reflected the ancient Indian ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — “the world is one family.”
Goyal expressed gratitude that the first WHS Regional Meeting in Asia focused on “Scaling Access to Ensure Health Equity.” He stressed that access to quality healthcare is vital for sustainable development and shared India’s journey toward achieving greater healthcare access for all citizens.
Recalling his personal interactions with global leaders during the pandemic, Goyal said India had ensured the supply of critical medicines at fair prices, standing firm against the global trend of profit-driven healthcare during crises.
On the issue of health equity, the Minister criticized the extension of pharmaceutical patents through minor incremental innovations, warning that such practices could deprive millions of affordable access to life-saving medicines. He invited WHS delegates to witness first-hand India’s efforts to deliver quality healthcare even in its remotest regions.
Highlighting India’s achievements, Goyal noted that over 620 million people are now eligible for free healthcare under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, the world’s largest government-funded health insurance program. He reiterated that India’s healthcare commitment was motivated not by profit, but by compassion.
Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Goyal said, “For us, healthcare is not just curing a sick patient. Healthcare is preventive healthcare, it is wellness, it is mental healthcare, and it means bridging society under the umbrella of a better lifestyle and a better future.”
He also elaborated on India’s holistic approach to human welfare, mentioning initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission for sanitation, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana providing millions of homes, the Jal Jeevan Mission expanding rural tap water access, the Ujjwala Yojana providing clean cooking fuel, and the free distribution of food grains to 800 million citizens during and beyond the pandemic.

Title: Indian Stock Market Opens Higher, Sensex Rises by 400 Points in Early Trade
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 04:09:19 +0000
Content: The Indian equity benchmark indices opened higher on Monday, supported by mixed global cues. Buying activity was observed in the PSU bank and financial services sectors during early trade.
At around 9:30 AM, the Sensex was up by 400.7 points or 0.51%, reaching 79,613.28, while the Nifty gained 88.65 points or 0.37%, standing at 24,128.00.
The Nifty Bank index rose by 347.85 points or 0.64%, reaching 55,011.90. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up by 230.80 points or 0.43%, trading at 53,801.00. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index saw a slight decline of 28.55 points or 0.17%, reaching 16,518.65.
While the situation at the India-Pakistan border remains a concern for market participants, foreign portfolio investor (FPI) inflows are continuing to lend strong support to Indian equities. Although selling pressure from high net-worth individuals (HNIs) last week kept the markets under some stress, overall sentiment appears to be improving with the start of the new week.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, said, “FPI flows are continuing to support Indian markets along with steady domestic institutional investor (DII) flows. With no major Offer for Sale (OFS) or Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) absorbing liquidity, markets are benefiting from these inflows. However, last week we witnessed declines in both the leading and broader indices, despite positive numbers from both FPIs and DIIs. This suggests that there were outflows from proprietary desks and HNI segments due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Indian subcontinent.”
On the earnings front, several major companies are scheduled to announce their fourth-quarter and full-year results today. These include UltraTech Cement, Indian Railway Finance Corporation, Adani Green Energy Limited, TVS Motor Company, IDBI Bank, Adani Total Gas, Oberoi Realty, Hexaware Technologies, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and UCO Bank. Investors will closely monitor these results for cues on future market direction.
“Investors turned cautious, causing the Nifty to fall below 24,200, as escalating India-Pakistan tensions following the Pahalgam terror attack unsettled sentiment. The Nifty is currently hovering near a support level; a breakdown below 23,800 would signal a continuation of the downtrend. However, with the index currently trading above 24,000, further upward movement remains possible. Technically, as prices remain above all key moving averages, an uptrend is indicated,” said Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose by 0.44 per cent, Taiwan’s Weighted Index gained 0.62 per cent, and South Korea’s KOSPI stayed marginally positive. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped by 0.13 per cent at the time of this report. (ANI)

Title: IPL 2025: RCB seal sixth straight away win to top points table
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 03:55:53 +0000
Content: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continued their impressive run in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, securing their sixth straight away win and seventh overall with a 6-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals (DC). The win propelled RCB to the top of the points table, while the Capitals are now placed fourth.
Chasing a target of 163, RCB endured a shaky start, losing three wickets for just 26 runs. Debutant Jacob Bethell managed 12 runs before falling, while Devdutt Padikkal was dismissed for a duck. Captain Rajat Patidar’s run-out for 6 left the side in trouble at 26/3.
However, a crucial 119-run partnership between Virat Kohli and Krunal Pandya steadied the innings. Kohli played a composed knock of 51 off 47 balls, hitting four boundaries, while Pandya was the star of the night, remaining unbeaten on 73 from 47 deliveries, with five fours and four sixes.
The pair ensured RCB reached 100 in 13.3 overs and kept the required run rate in check.
After Kohli’s dismissal at the hands of Dushmantha Chameera in the 17.5th over, Tim David joined Pandya and played a cameo, scoring 19 runs off just five balls to seal the victory. RCB reached the target in 18.3 overs.
Earlier in the match, DC captain Axar Patel was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with impressive figures of 2/19 from his four overs. Despite his efforts, Delhi couldn’t stop RCB’s momentum.
RCB, now sitting at the top of the standings, will look to maintain their winning form as the tournament heads toward the playoffs.
In the first innings, a brilliant bowling performance from RCB’s Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood restricted Delhi Capitals to 162/8 in their 20 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday.
RCB skipper Rajat Patidar won the toss and elected to bowl first in the away fixture of the ongoing 18th edition of the cash-rich league.
Batters Faf du Plessis and Abhishek Porel opened the innings with a 33-run stand off 22 balls before Porel (28 runs off 11 balls) was dismissed by right-arm seamer Josh Hazlewood in the fourth over.
Following Porel’s departure, right-handed batter Karun Nair (4) came to the crease but was dismissed in the fifth over by left-arm seamer Yash Dayal when the team score was 44.
The Capitals reached the 50-run mark in the sixth over as Du Plessis struck a boundary off the penultimate ball bowled by Hazlewood.
At the score of 72, the Delhi franchise lost their third wicket as Du Plessis (22 off 26 balls) was dismissed by skipper Hardik Pandya in the 10th over.
KL Rahul (41 off 39 balls), Tristan Stubbs (34 off 18 balls), and Axar Patel (15 off 13 balls) contributed crucial runs before being dismissed.
Right-handed batter Ashutosh Sharma came in as an impact substitute but was unable to make a mark, scoring just five runs.
At the end, young uncapped all-rounder Vipraj Nigam played a cameo of 12 runs from just six balls at a strike rate of 200, helping Delhi Capitals post 162/8.
For the Bengaluru franchise, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with 3/33 in 4 overs. Josh Hazlewood claimed 2/36 in his 4-over spell, while Yash Dayal (1/42 in 4 overs) and Krunal Pandya (1/28 in 4 overs) chipped in with a wicket each.
Brief Score:
Delhi Capitals 162/8 in 20 overs (KL Rahul 41, Tristan Stubbs 34; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 3/33)* 
vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru 165/4 in 18.3 overs (Krunal Pandya 73*, Virat Kohli 51; Axar Patel 2/19)

Title: India’s index of industrial production grows by 3% in March 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:59:37 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on Monday released the Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for March 2025, reporting a year-on-year growth of 3%. This comes slightly higher than the revised figure of 2.9% for February 2025. The IIP, calculated with base year 2011–12=100, stood at 164.8 in March 2025 compared to 160.0 in March 2024.
Among the three major sectors, electricity production showed the most robust growth at 6.3%, followed by manufacturing at 3.0% and mining at 0.4%. The sectoral indices for March 2025 were 156.8 for mining, 160.9 for manufacturing, and 217.1 for electricity.
The manufacturing sector saw positive contributions from 13 of the 23 industry groups at the 2-digit NIC level. Leading the growth were “Manufacture of electrical equipment” with a remarkable 15.7% rise, “Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers” at 10.3%, and “Manufacture of basic metals” which increased by 6.9%. Within these categories, specific products like electric heaters, small transformers, and auto components played a significant role in driving growth.
Under the use-based classification, Infrastructure/Construction Goods led the momentum with an 8.8% increase, followed by Primary Goods at 3.1%, and Consumer Durables at 6.6%. However, Consumer Non-Durables experienced a contraction, declining by 4.7% compared to March 2024. The indices for these use-based categories stood at 168.2 for Primary Goods, 134.8 for Capital Goods, 173.1 for Intermediate Goods, 212.3 for Infrastructure/Construction Goods, 138.5 for Consumer Durables, and 147.9 for Consumer Non-Durables.
The cumulative average IIP for the financial year April 2024 to March 2025 registered a growth of 4.0%, with sectoral contributions of 2.9% in mining, 3.9% in manufacturing, and 5.1% in electricity. This marks a slight slowdown from the 5.9% growth recorded in the previous financial year.
Within the detailed industry-wise data, notable growth was seen in “Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products” (21.5%), and “Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.” (8.0%). Some sectors like “Manufacture of pharmaceuticals” and “Manufacture of food products” posted negative growth rates of -4.6% and -8.0% respectively, reflecting industry-specific challenges.
This month’s IIP Quick Estimate is based on a weighted response rate of 88%, while the finalized figures for December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025 reflect updated data with response rates of 95%, 94%, and 94%, respectively.

Title: Canadians vote in election dominated by concerns about Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:16:52 +0000
Content: Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an election campaign in which U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and musings about annexing Canada became the central issue.
Trump’s threats ignited a wave of patriotism that swelled support for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, a political newcomer who previously led two G7 central banks.
Carney briefly paused his campaign, and both he and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre mentioned the tragedy in their final campaign events.
It was unclear if the mass casualty event would have any impact on the election. Duane Bratt, professor of political science at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said he did not expect it to deter voters.
Carney’s Liberals held a four-point lead over Poilievre’s Conservatives in separate polls by Ipsos and Angus Reid, suggesting little movement in the final days. Ipsos on Sunday pegged the Liberals at 42% support and the Conservatives at 38%.
Angus Reid’s Saturday poll placed the Liberals at 44% support, over the Conservatives’ 40% support.
Those results would likely produce a fourth consecutive Liberal mandate, but Carney might only win a minority of seats in the 343-seat House of Commons, leaving him reliant on smaller parties to govern.
Trump re-emerged as a campaign factor last week, declaring that he might raise a 25% tariff on Canadian-made cars because the U.S. does not want them. He said earlier he might use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.
“This is probably the most consequential election in my lifetime,” said Kelly Saunders, a political science professor at Brandon University. “Everything has been so overshadowed by the threats coming out of the United States.”
Carney has emphasized his experience handling economic issues makes him the best leader to deal with Trump, while Poilievre has tapped into concerns about the cost of living, crime and a housing crisis.
“I’m probably going to go Carney on this one just because right now, I feel like we need stability,” said Andy Hill, 37, a Vancouver-based mortgage broker and co-founder of mortgage marketplace EveryRate. “Being in the English banking system and being in the Canadian banking system, he really understands the economy.”
Bob Lowe, a 66-year-old cattle rancher who lives south of Calgary, said he has already cast his ballot for the Conservatives. He said his top concern is Canada’s flagging economic growth.
The economy had seen a fledgling recovery until the U.S. imposed tariffs.
Carney has sought to distance himself from former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was deeply unpopular when he said in January he would resign after nearly a decade in power. The Conservatives led polls by some 20 points around that time.
CONSERVATIVES FOCUS ON ECONOMY
Lowe said the Conservatives have focused on the economy all along, and that he believes the Liberals have been stoking Canadians’ anxieties about Trump to win another term.
“Poilievre has managed to keep the focus on the economy and a strong Canada, and Carney’s campaign is based on fear. That’s it in a nutshell,” Lowe said.
Saunders, however, predicts the Liberals will win a majority of seats, and says it would take a “magical scenario” for the Conservatives to pull off a victory. Tensions with the U.S. have caused supporters of two smaller parties, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals.
A party needs to win 172 electoral districts, called ridings or seats, to form a majority government that does not rely on smaller parties’ support to stay in power.
Much of the Conservative support is in rural areas where there are fewer seats.
Carney, who covered more than 20 cities in his last week of campaigning, has appeared tired but tried to maintain his exuberance at rallies, attended by 1,000 to 2,000 people, according to party figures.
Poilievre’s rallies have been bigger.
Standing on Sunday in front of the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor’s Canadian auto hub with Detroit across the border, Carney pointed to the bridge as a symbol of peace and cooperation between the two countries for almost a century.
“That has changed, and it wasn’t us who did the changing … President Trump, the guy over there,” Carney said. “He’s launched a trade war that has literally ruptured the global economy, and in the process, he’s betrayed us.”
Carney’s rallies have attracted mostly older Canadians and featured placards saying “Jamais Le 51” (“Never 51”) – a reference to Trump’s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state – and “Un Canada Fort” (“A Strong Canada”).
Mentions of Trump have been loudly booed.
Poilievre has attracted more young voters than usual for the Conservatives.
“Time is running out, only one more day to bring home change so that Canadians can afford food and homes and live on safe streets,” Poilievre said at a rally in Oakville, Ontario on Sunday.
Election results will trickle in, starting in eastern provinces, after polls close at staggered times on Monday evening. Ballots are counted by hand.

Title: Nawaz advises PM Shehbaz Sharif against aggressive stance on India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:43:25 +0000
Content: Three-time Prime Minister of Pakistan and founder of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Nawaz Sharif, has urged his younger brother and current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to avoid adopting an aggressive posture towards India. He emphasized the need to utilize all diplomatic avenues to restore peace between the two countries.
The two leaders met in Lahore on Sunday evening, where Shehbaz Sharif briefed Nawaz Sharif on the measures taken by his government following the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, particularly in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after the Pahalgam attack.
According to sources, Prime Minister Shehbaz detailed how Pakistan had reciprocated New Delhi’s actions, including the closure of its airspace to India, and informed his brother about the country’s preparedness to respond to any Indian aggression.
“India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty has dangerously increased the risk of conflict in the region,” a source quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
In response, Nawaz Sharif advised restraint and stressed the importance of pursuing diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has proposed the formation of an international commission—comprising representatives from the United States, Russia, China, and Britain—to investigate the Pahalgam attack. He asserted that Pakistan is ready to present evidence implicating India in the Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan and alleged links with anti-Pakistan groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Even though we know it was a false flag operation, we are willing to cooperate with any international inquiry to expose the truth. However, if India proceeds with any misadventure, it will see Pakistan’s preparedness,” said Khawaja Asif.

Title: ‘Make in India’ booster: HMD Global to launch direct-to-mobile phones in India
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:17:23 +0000
Content: In a major step towards advancing India’s technological landscape, HMD Global, in collaboration with FreeStream Technologies (incubated at IIT Kanpur), Tejas Networks, and other partners, has unveiled plans to address the growing demand for Direct-to-Mobile (D2M) phones in the country. The announcement will be officially made at the ‘World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025,’ set to take place from May 1-4 in Mumbai.
D2M technology represents a breakthrough in next-generation broadcasting by enabling the delivery of OTT and live TV, video, audio, and text messages directly to mobile phones without relying on Wi-Fi or internet services.
This innovation aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ and further strengthens the ‘Make in India’ initiative.
As part of this effort, affordable feature phones, smartphones, and tablets powered by Tejas Networks will be manufactured. These devices are being developed using the innovative SL-3000 chipset from Saankhya Labs, which serves as the cornerstone for enabling the D2M platform.
Over the years, this technology has undergone extensive testing in live networks by Prasar Bharati in partnership with IIT Kanpur and Tejas Networks.
Ravi Kunwar, VP and CEO of HMD India and APAC, said, “This pioneering platform will allow consumers to access a vast range of multimedia content directly on their devices.”
Sumeet Nindrajog, Director of FreeStream Technologies, highlighted the transformative nature of the D2M technology, adding, “This technology is set to revolutionize how content and data are consumed by users.”
He further stated that the collaboration with HMD will help lay the foundation for a robust device ecosystem, which will play a key role in the nationwide rollout of D2M services.
Parag Naik, co-founder of the former Saankhya Labs and Executive Vice President of Tejas Networks, elaborated on the potential of D2M: “The technology would allow the delivery of targeted ads, educational content, emergency alerts, and more, aligning with the government’s vision for a digitally empowered India,” Naik mentioned.
Chris Ripley, President and CEO of Sinclair, Inc., also shared his enthusiasm for the project, stating, “We’re proud to be at the forefront of global deployment and look forward to collaborating with partners like HMD in making India a hub for next-generation broadcast technology.”

Title: Saudi’s Jeddah old town regains glory as the Grand Prix lures tourists
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:54:07 +0000
Content: When Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea port of Jeddah hosted Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and U.S. singer Jennifer Lopez during its Grand Prix this month, visitors found they were also drawn to a less obvious attraction – the historic old town.
Jeddah is known for being the kingdom’s modern commercial hub, and the exodus of its merchant class meant its old town had fallen into neglect.
The kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy and make itself less dependent on oil, however, has included revitalising culture to lure tourism revenue.
Visitors who came for the F1 event found they loved the slower pace of the restored old Jeddah.
Known in Arabic as al-Balad, the Town, has the feel of previous centuries with its Arabic-styled wooden architecture in brown and blue colours that reflect the city’s location between the sand of the Arabian desert and the sea.
“It’s my first time in Saudi Arabia and the old city is very beautiful with earthly tones… and has a very particular architecture,” said Rossella from Milan.
Al-Balad was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2014. Since then, the government has accelerated plans to restore about 650 buildings and revive the district’s local businesses.
Fadil Zahir, 57, was born in the old town and works as a barista there.
“Tourists and visitors are coming to al-Balad in great numbers,” he said.
UNESCO cited historic Jeddah as “the only surviving urban ensemble of the Red Sea,” where coral stone tower houses adorned with Roshan wooden balconies stand alongside mosques as old as the advent of Islam, when the third Caliph Uthman bin Affan declared the city to be Mecca’s official port.
” I am 62 now, I now see what I could see 40 years back. You talk about changes, I say it’s actually going back to the original,” said Ahmed Alkhanbashi, a general manager at Alkhanbashi Business Development Bureau.

Title: JNUSU elections: ABVP shatters decade-long drought with joint secretary post
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:41:23 +0000
Content: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has secured one of the top posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), marking a comeback after a decade, according to results of the students’ union elections declared on Monday.

ABVP’s Vaibhav Meena won the post of Joint Secretary with 1,518 votes. Nitish Kumar of the All India Students’ Association (AISA) was elected President, securing 1,702 votes, while Manisha and Munteha Fatima, both from the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), clinched the Vice-President and General Secretary posts, respectively. Manisha garnered 1,150 votes, while Munteha Fatima won with 1,520 votes, further strengthening DSF’s presence in the central panel.
Although the ABVP fell short of winning the President, Vice-President, and General Secretary posts, the narrow margins of defeat underscored a palpable shift in campus dynamics.

Describing the outcome as an “unprecedented performance,” Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s IT cell, said in a post on X: “Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) conquered: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) candidate Vaibhav Meena has been elected as Joint Secretary. And it doesn’t stop there. ABVP has delivered an unprecedented performance in the JNUSU elections, winning 23 out of 42 councillor seats across 16 schools and special centres — the highest number of seats won by any student organization.”
Nitish Kumar of the All India Students’ Association (AISA) emerged as President, garnering 1,702 votes, while Manisha and Munteha Fatima, both from the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), claimed the posts of Vice-President and General Secretary, respectively. Manisha secured 1,150 votes, while Munteha Fatima’s victory further solidified DSF’s presence in the central panel, with 1,520 votes.
Shikha Swaraj, Nittu Goutham, Kunal Rai, and Vaibhav Meena represented the ABVP in the key positions of President, Vice-President, General Secretary, and Joint Secretary, respectively, as part of their ambitious campaign to challenge the status quo and alter campus politics.
The contest was marked by intense competition among strategic alliances: the All India Students’ Association (AISA) allied with the Democratic Students’ Federation (DSF), while the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) joined forces with the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students’ Association (BAPSA), the All India Students’ Federation (AISF), and the Progressive Students’ Association.
The ABVP contested the election independently.
This year’s turnout of 68.3 per cent, though slightly lower than the record-breaking 73 per cent participation in the 2024 elections, still reflected strong voter engagement.

Title: Indian stock market rebounds sharply; Sensex surges 1,006 points
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:37:28 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market staged a strong rebound on Monday, ending the day with robust gains despite ongoing geo-political tensions. The rally was largely fueled by a sharp uptick in select banking stocks and renewed optimism over a potential India-US trade deal.
The Sensex opened with a positive gap of about 120 points at 79,344 and continued its upward trajectory throughout the session. It touched a fresh yearly high of 80,322 before settling at 80,218, up by 1,006 points, or 1.27 per cent.
The Nifty 50 also posted solid gains, moving between 24,054 and 24,355 during the day, and closed at 24,329, up by 289 points, or 1.2 per cent.
“On the higher end, 24,360 remains a resistance level. The Nifty might consolidate around the current range unless it decisively breaches this mark,” said Rupak De of LKP Securities. He added that a break above 24,360 could potentially push the index towards 24,550, aligning with the 61.80 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous decline from 26,277 to 21,743.
Banking heavyweights like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI were among the major contributors to the rally, together adding nearly 340 points to the Sensex — accounting for about 75 per cent of the day’s total gains.
Among individual gainers, stocks such as Sun Pharma, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Steel, SBI, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, and Larsen & Toubro advanced by 2–3 per cent.
However, a few counters faced losses. HCL Technologies, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, and Eternal declined, with HCL Technologies falling nearly 2 per cent.
In the broader markets, the BSE MidCap index climbed 1.4 per cent, while the SmallCap index edged higher by 0.4 per cent.
Sector-wise, most indices ended in the green, led by the BSE Oil and Gas index, which rose nearly 3 per cent. Banking, capital goods, auto, metal, and healthcare sectors also posted gains of over 1.5 per cent each.
Meanwhile, the rupee strengthened to 84.98 against the US dollar, appreciating by 0.25, supported by strong inflows into the capital markets, where key indices gained over 1.20 per cent, and the banking index rose by 1.41 per cent.

Title: Trump’s first 100 days: America First president is overturning the world order
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:30:56 +0000
Content: He has launched an unprecedented global tariff war and slashed U.S. foreign aid. He has disparaged NATO allies and embraced Russia’s narrative about its invasion of Ukraine. And he has spoken about annexing Greenland, retaking the Panama Canal and making Canada the 51st state.
In the chaotic first 100 days since President Donald Trump returned to office, he has waged an often unpredictable campaign that has upended parts of the rules-based world order that Washington helped build from the ashes of World War II.
“Trump is much more radical now than he was eight years ago,” said Elliott Abrams, a conservative who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush before being appointed U.S. special envoy on Iran and Venezuela in Trump’s first term. “I have been surprised.”
Trump’s second-term “America First” agenda has alienated friends and emboldened adversaries while raising questions about how far he is prepared to go. His actions, coupled with that uncertainty, have so unnerved some governments that they are responding in ways that could be difficult to undo, even if a more traditional U.S. president is elected in 2028.
All this comes amid what the Republican president’s critics see as signs of democratic backsliding at home that have raised concerns abroad. These include verbal attacks on judges, a pressure campaign against universities and the transfer of migrants to a notorious El Salvador prison as part of a broader deportation drive.
“What we’re seeing is a huge disruption in world affairs,” said Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. “No one is certain at this point what to make of what’s happening or what will come next.”
This assessment of Trump’s shakeup of the global system comes from Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials, foreign diplomats and independent analysts in Washington and capitals around the world.
he told me that he needs more weapons but he’s been saying that for three years you know he needs more weapons and we’re going I want to see what happens with respect to Russia, because Russia had been surprised.
Many say that while some of the damage already done could be long-lasting, the situation may not be beyond repair if Trump softens his approach. He has already backtracked on some issues, including the timing and severity of his tariffs.
But they see little chance of a dramatic shift by Trump and instead expect many countries to make lasting changes in their relationships with the U.S. to safeguard against his erratic policy-making.
The fallout has already begun.
Some European allies, for instance, are looking to boost their own defense industries to reduce reliance on U.S. weapons. Debate has intensified in South Korea about developing its own nuclear arsenal. And speculation has grown that deteriorating relations could prompt U.S. partners to move closer to China, at least economically.
The White House rejects the notion that Trump has hurt U.S. credibility, citing instead the need to clean up after what it calls former President Joe Biden’s “feckless leadership” on the world stage.
“President Trump is taking swift action to address challenges by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table to end their war, stemming the flow of fentanyl and protecting American workers by holding China accountable, getting Iran to the negotiating table by reimposing Maximum Pressure,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement.
He said Trump was also “making the Houthis pay for their terrorism … and securing our southern border that was open to invasion for four years.”
More than half of Americans, including one in five Republicans, think Trump is “too closely aligned” with Russia, and the American public has little appetite for the expansionist agenda he has laid out, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on April 21.
HIGH STAKES
At stake, say experts, is the future of a global system that has taken shape over the past eight decades largely under U.S. primacy. It has come to be based on free trade, rule of law and respect for territorial integrity.
But under Trump, who has been scornful of multilateral organizations and often views global affairs through the transactional lens of a former real estate developer, that world order is being shaken up.
Accusing trading partners of “ripping off” the U.S. for decades, Trump has set in motion a sweeping tariffs policy that has roiled financial markets, weakened the dollar and triggered warnings of a slowdown in worldwide economic output and increased risk of recession.
Trump has called the tariffs necessary “medicine” but his objectives remain unclear even as his administration works to negotiate separate deals with dozens of countries.
At the same time, he has all but reversed U.S. policy on Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine and engaged in an Oval Office shouting match with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in late February. He has warmed to Moscow and stirred fears that he will force NATO-backed Kyiv to accept the loss of territory while he prioritizes improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The administration’s belittling of Europe and NATO, long the central pillar of transatlantic security but accused by Trump and his aides of freeloading off the U.S., has caused deep unease.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, after winning February’s election, expressed concern about European relations with the United States, saying it would be difficult if those who put “America First” actually made their motto “America Alone”.
“This really is five minutes to midnight for Europe,” Merz said.
In a further blow to Washington’s global image, Trump has employed expansionist rhetoric long avoided by modern-day presidents, which some analysts say could be used by China as justification if it decides to invade self-governed Taiwan.
With his blustery style, he has insisted that the U.S. will “get” Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish island. He has angered Canada by saying it has little reason to exist and should become part of the U.S. He has threatened to seize the Panama Canal, which was handed over to Panama in 1999. And he has proposed that Washington take over war-ravaged Gaza and transform the Palestinian enclave into a Riviera-style resort.
Some analysts say Trump may be seeking to resurrect a Cold War-style global structure in which big powers carve up geographic spheres of influence.
Even so, he has offered no details on how the U.S. could acquire more territory, and some experts suggest he may be assuming extreme and even over-the-top positions as bargaining ploys.
But some countries are taking him seriously.
“When you demand to take over a part of the Kingdom of Denmark’s territory, when we are met by pressure and by threats from our closest ally, what are we to believe in about the country that we have admired for so many years?” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a news conference in Greenland in early April. “This is about the world order that we have built together across the Atlantic over generations.”
COPING WITH TRUMP 2.0
Other governments are also beginning to recalibrate.
The European Union — which Trump has claimed, without evidence, was formed to “screw” the U.S. — has prepared a range of retaliatory tariffs if negotiations fail.
Some countries such as Germany and France are looking at spending more on their militaries, something Trump has demanded but which could also mean investing more in their own defense industries and buying fewer arms from the U.S.
With its historic friendship with the U.S. now strained, Canada is seeking to strengthen economic and security links to Europe. This comes against the backdrop of Canada’s national elections on Monday dominated by voter resentment of Trump’s actions, which have triggered a nationalist wave and fueled perceptions that the U.S. is no longer a reliable partner.
South Korea, too, has been rattled by Trump’s policies, including his threats to withdraw U.S. troops. But Seoul has vowed to try to work with Trump and preserve the alliance it regards as critical against the threat of nuclear-armed North Korea.
U.S. ally Japan is also on edge. It was taken by surprise by the magnitude of Trump’s tariffs and “is now scrambling to respond,” said a senior Japanese government official close to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
A key question is whether some governments will quietly hedge their bets by forging closer trade ties to China, Trump’s number one tariff target.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing in early April, and China said recently it exchanged views with the EU on bolstering economic cooperation.
Beijing has cast itself as a solution for nations that feel bullied by Trump’s trade approach, despite its own record of sometimes predatory practices internationally, and is also trying to fill the vacuum left by his cuts in humanitarian aid.
Aaron David Miller, a former veteran U.S. diplomat in Republican and Democratic administrations, said it’s not too late for Trump to shift course on foreign policy, especially if he begins to feel pressure from fellow Republicans uneasy over economic risks as they seek to retain control of Congress in next year’s mid-term elections.
If Trump holds firm, the next president could try to re-establish Washington’s role as guarantor of the world order, but the obstacles could be steep.
“What’s happening is not yet beyond the point of no return,” said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “But how much damage is being done now to our relations with friends and how much adversaries will be probably incalculable.

Title: India signs ₹63,000 crore Rafale Marine aircraft deal with France
Publication Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:28:07 +0000
Content: India and France on Monday signed a ₹63,000 crore defence agreement for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine combat aircraft.
 
The agreement was signed at the Defence Ministry headquarters at South Block in New Delhi, the Indian Navy said. The Cabinet Committee on Security had approved the deal earlier this month.
 
Representing France was its Ambassador to India, while Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh led the Indian delegation. The Defence Ministers of both countries also attended the signing ceremony remotely. The French Defence Minister was initially scheduled to attend in person but had to cancel his visit due to personal reasons.
 
The Indian Navy urgently requires new carrier-borne fighter jets to replace its aging MiG-29K fleet, which has faced operational challenges due to maintenance issues. The newly acquired Rafale Marine aircraft are expected to be deployed aboard INS Vikrant, India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier currently in service.
 
The government-to-government contract includes the purchase of 22 single-seater and four twin-seater Rafale M jets, specially configured to meet Indian requirements and integrate with Indian aircraft carriers.
 
This procurement serves as an interim solution until India develops its own carrier-borne fighter aircraft. The contract also includes a comprehensive package covering maintenance support, logistics, training, and the manufacturing of indigenous components.
 
The Rafale M jets will operate alongside the existing MiG-29K fleet on INS Vikrant, enhancing the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities.
 
The Indian Air Force already operates 36 Rafale aircraft acquired through a separate deal signed in 2016, with squadrons based in Ambala and Hasimara.
 
With the new acquisition, India’s Rafale fleet will grow to 62 aircraft, significantly strengthening its inventory of 4.5-generation fighter jets. (ANI)
