Title: Australian Open: Rohan Bopanna-Zhang Shuai storm into mixed doubles quarter-finals
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:08:59 +0000
Content: The mixed doubles pair of Rohan Bopanna (India) and Zhang Shuai (China) advanced to the quarter-finals of the ongoing Australian Open 2025 after receiving a walkover against fourth seeds Taylor Townsend (USA) and Hugo Nys (Monaco) in the second round on Sunday.
Zhang Shuai, a two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 2, teamed up with Rohan Bopanna to reach the final eight. The Indo-Chinese pair will face the winners of the match between Australia’s Olivia Gadecki and John Peers and Hungary’s Timea Babos with El Salvador’s Marcelo Arevalo.
In the first round, Bopanna and Zhang defeated France’s Kristina Mladenovic and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig 6-4, 6-4 at the season’s first tennis Grand Slam.
In the men’s doubles event, Rohan Bopanna partnered with Colombian Nicolas Barrientos. However, the Indo-Colombian duo lost in the opening round, falling 7-5, 7(7)-6(5) to Spain’s Pedro Martinez and Jaume Munar.
Last year, Bopanna became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam title in the Open Era when he secured the Australian Open men’s doubles crown with Matthew Ebden. However, the pair split at the end of 2024, and neither Bopanna nor Ebden progressed beyond the first round in this year’s men’s doubles event.
Bopanna’s campaign in mixed doubles remains India’s final challenge at the Australian Open 2025. Other Indian players faced early exits: Yuki Bhambri and his French partner Albano Olivetti, along with Rithvik Bollipalli and Ryan Seggerman (USA), were eliminated in the first round of the men’s doubles.
Meanwhile, N Sriram Balaji and his Mexican partner Miguel Angel Reyes-Varela crashed out in the second round. In singles action, Sumit Nagal was ousted in the first round after a loss to Czechia’s Tomas Machac.

Title: PM Modi urges citizens to exercise their “right to vote,” hails ECI for strengthening the voting process
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 08:48:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged citizens to exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become active participants in the country’s democratic process.  
Addressing the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2025, PM Modi highlighted that January 25, celebrated as ‘National Voters’ Day,’ is an important day as it marks the establishment of the Election Commission of India.  
Lauding the Election Commission, the PM said it has modernized and strengthened the voting process, empowering the people.
PM Modi said, “25 January is National Voters’ Day. This day is important because the ‘Election Commission of India’ was established on this day… The Election Commission has been given a very important place in the Constitution, as have people’s participation in democracy. Some were doubtful about the survival of the country’s democracy, but India has proven all such apprehensions wrong – after all, India is the Mother of Democracy. Over the decades, the country’s democracy has strengthened and prospered.”  
“I would also like to thank the Election Commission, which has, from time to time, modernized and strengthened our voting process. The Commission has harnessed the power of technology to empower the people. I congratulate the Election Commission for its commitment to fair elections. I urge the citizens to always exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become a part of the democratic process, thereby strengthening it,” he added.  
As the nation prepares for the Republic Day celebrations, PM Modi said that this year’s ‘Republic Day’ is very special and extended advance greetings to the countrymen. 
“Today marks the first Mann Ki Baat of 2025. You may have noticed that Mann Ki Baat usually takes place on the last Sunday of the month, but this time we are meeting a week earlier, on the third Sunday, instead of the fourth, because Republic Day falls on the following Sunday. I wish all the countrymen a Happy Republic Day in advance”, he said.
“This year’s Republic Day is particularly significant as it marks the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic. This year also marks 75 years since the Constitution came into force. I salute all the great personalities of the Constituent Assembly who gave us our sacred Constitution,” the PM added.  
Speaking about the Constituent Assembly, PM Modi mentioned the various topics discussed and played clips of the famous personalities, including Babasaheb Ambedkar, the first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee.

Highlighting aspects from the clips, he said, “Babasaheb emphasized that the Constituent Assembly should remain united and work together for the welfare of all. Dr. Rajendra Prasad spoke about the commitment to human values, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee discussed the importance of equal opportunities. I hope you enjoyed listening to these audio clips’ the prime minister said.

Title: PM Modi, President Biden raised US-India partnership to new heights: Eric Garcetti
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:25:16 +0000
Content: US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, on Sunday highlighted that US-India relations have reached new heights, thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden.
During a visit to India with his family, Garcetti met with PM Modi and acknowledged that the two leaders had achieved record-breaking milestones in various areas, including visas, trade, defense collaboration, space cooperation, student exchanges, and investments.
In a post on X, Garcetti said, “Had a great final visit with PM Modi with my family. It’s clear that he and President Biden have raised our compelling and consequential US-India partnership to new heights—record visas, record trade, record defense collaboration, record space cooperation, record students, record investments, and so much more.”
Garcetti expressed his gratitude to PM Modi and the people of India for their warm hospitality during his final visit to the country. He emphasized that the US-India partnership has become indispensable and will continue to grow stronger in the coming years.
“What was seen as unthinkable a generation ago will seem indispensable a generation from now, thanks to the work of these leaders and the people of our nations. Thank you, Prime Minister, and thank you to all Indians. It’s been a daily joy to help co-write this chapter with you,” he added.
While attending the inauguration ceremony of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru on Friday, Garcetti noted that it was not the beginning of a new US presence in India, but rather an expansion of the existing one.
“We are not beginning a new presence here in Karnataka; we are expanding our existing presence here, a commitment America makes to this great state and city in this amazing nation as well. And thank you to all of our honorable dignitaries,” he said.
The US Ambassador also reflected on the rich history of US-India relations, dating back to 1776 when the US opened its second-ever consulate in Kolkata, India. He noted that the recent inauguration of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru marks an expansion of US presence in India, rather than a new beginning.
“We’ve been talking about this for a long time, right? We started together to make sure this beginning plants a seed that will flower for decades to come. Our relationship with India is not new. Many Americans don’t know, and very few Indians know, that our second consulate in the world was here in India. The first, after the independence of a new America in 1776, was in Lyon, France, and then the second was in Kolkata, showing back then the importance of India to a new American nation. Since then, we have grown to five posts, seven if you count our commercial offices, including here and in Ahmedabad”, Garcett said.
“This is now the second-largest US mission in the world. It produces the second-most visas and the most students. We’re breaking records every single year—record employees, record visas, record students, record military exercises, record engagement from the seabed to space,” he added.

Title: Startup India Mission marks nine years of growth and innovation
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:16:11 +0000
Content: On the ninth anniversary of the Startup India mission, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, highlighted the significant role the initiative continues to play in driving India’s economic growth. The minister emphasized that much of the success of the Startup India mission can be attributed to key funding mechanisms, particularly the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS).
Administered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and financed by the Government of India, this initiative has been pivotal in mobilizing private capital, with a particular focus on supporting startups in Tier II and Tier III cities. Through this approach, the government has empowered startups to scale their operations and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s economy.
Goyal highlighted the transformative power of these funding tools, noting how they have empowered startups to scale their operations and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy. He also emphasized the importance of private funding in fueling the next phase of India’s startup movement. “The Startup movement will gain momentum with more private funding in the days to come,” he added. During the event, the Minister launched the Bharat Startup Grand Challenge and the Prabhaav Factbook.
The minister also spoke about the pivotal role of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) in driving innovation and accelerating the growth of Indian startups. “Our collaboration with PE and VC firms has been instrumental in supporting innovation and accelerating the journey of startups from ideation to execution,” Goyal stated.
He explained that this partnership not only provides funding but also introduces global expertise and networks that help Indian startups compete internationally. Through initiatives like the BHASKAR platform, the government is connecting startups with mentorship, financial instruments, and opportunities for collaboration across the country.
Beyond their economic impact, startups have emerged as agents of change, addressing some of the most pressing challenges, including sustainability, renewable energy, healthcare, and digital transformation. “Through their innovation and resilience, they are shaping a better future for all of us,” Goyal said.
India’s startup ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with 76 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in 2024 alone. The country now ranks as the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, with 1,59,157 startups as of January 15, 2025—up from around 500 in 2016. These startups have generated 17.2 lakh direct jobs and received total funding of Rs 13 trillion from the government.
The commerce minister emphasized the government’s continued commitment to supporting the startup ecosystem, noting the expansion of technological sectors ranging from digitech to artificial intelligence. “I would like to reaffirm the Government’s unwavering commitment to the faster growth of India’s startup ecosystem and to provide support to the entrepreneurial spirit of India,” he said. Goyal credited policy-driven initiatives for positioning India as a global leader in innovation and technology-driven growth.
Looking ahead, the minister said that India is entering a crucial phase in its development, with strong macroeconomic fundamentals setting the stage for the next 25 years. “Our startups will play a crucial role in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, inclusive, and globally competitive India,” he added. The government is committed to providing all necessary support, including policy initiatives, infrastructure, and access to capital.
The commerce minister also noted India’s leadership in producing STEM graduates, with women constituting 43% of graduates. “Women are at the heart of India’s growth story,” he emphasized, pointing to targeted initiatives like the Women Entrepreneurship Platform that empower women-led startups.
The event also served as the curtain raiser for the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, set to begin in April. Goyal announced that 2,500 startups would participate in this event, highlighting India’s growing role as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.
In addition, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) launched the PRABHAAV Factbook, a comprehensive guide to India’s startup ecosystem and its growth from 2016 to 2024. The Factbook captures the achievements of every region in India, showcasing the dynamic growth story of the country’s startup sector.
The Bharat Startup Grand Challenge was also unveiled, aiming to unleash 75 challenges across various sectors. Industry leaders and innovators will invite thinkers to solve business challenges in areas such as renewable energy, blockchain, agritech, and smart manufacturing. The challenge will provide startups with procurement opportunities, cash prizes, funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.

Before his departure, Vaishnaw emphasized India’s remarkable progress in ensuring equitable opportunities for all, particularly for marginalized communities.
India’s Model of Inclusive Growth
Before his departure for the prestigious global event, Vaishnaw outlined India’s impressive strides in ensuring development for all sections of society, with a particular focus on those who have historically been excluded from progress. He pointed out that Prime Minister Modi’s focus on inclusive development has brought about transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid.
“The Prime Minister of India has focused on inclusive development that brings transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid. From financial inclusion through bank accounts to providing essential services like toilets, gas connections, tap water, and improving infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, this is something which the world wants to understand,” the railway minister said .
Vaishnaw also highlighted that the WEF discussions will delve into inclusive growth, emphasizing investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure, as well as the democratization of technology. These themes are at the core of India’s development agenda, which aims to provide equitable opportunities to all.
India’s Digital Revolution in the Global Spotlight
In addition to highlighting India’s inclusive growth initiatives, Vaishnaw emphasized the global interest in the country’s remarkable digital transformation. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, India has embarked on an ambitious digital journey that has garnered significant attention worldwide.
“The world is keen to understand India’s economic policies, the digital transformation brought about by the Digital India programme, and the way technology has been democratized to empower citizens across all strata of society,” he said.
India’s innovative digital infrastructure, developed through the Digital India initiative, is now considered a global benchmark for leveraging technology to drive inclusive development. The initiative has made a profound impact by enhancing connectivity, improving access to services, and creating a more transparent and efficient public service delivery system. These advancements are expected to be a key area of focus during the discussions at the World Economic Forum.

Title: Saif Ali Khan attacker arrested after three days, cops suspect he is illegal Bangladeshi
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 06:07:45 +0000
Content: Mumbai Police have arrested a man accused of stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra West residence in the early hours of January 16. The suspect, identified as Mohammad Alian, was apprehended in Thane on Sunday and confessed to entering the actor’s home and carrying out the attack.
The cops suspect that Alian is a Bangladeshi and changed his name after entering India illegally.
“There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the accused is a Bangladeshi. He does not have valid Indian documents. Some items seized indicate that he is a Bangladeshi national,” Dixit Gedam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said during a press conference.
The suspect, reportedly employed as a waiter at a pub in Thane, was located at a labour camp near a metro construction site in Hiranandani Estate.
The accused will be produced before the court, DCP Gedam said, adding, “We will seek police custody. We doubt that the accused is of Bangladeshi origin and thus, we have invoked relevant sections of the Passport Act as well.”
Saif Ali Khan was stabbed multiple times in his Bandra apartment during the early hours of Thursday.
The actor sustained severe injuries, including stab wounds to his thoracic spine, and was immediately rushed to Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital for treatment.
Hospital authorities have confirmed that he is recovering well and has been shifted from the ICU to a normal room.

Title: India to grow at 6.7% for next two years: World Bank
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 05:09:22 +0000
Content: India is projected to sustain its position as the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of 6.7% in both FY26 and FY27, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, outpacing a global growth projection of 2.7% for 2025-26.
The GEP report attributes India’s robust growth to a thriving services sector and a revitalized manufacturing base, driven by transformative government initiatives. From modernizing infrastructure to streamlining taxes, these measures are fueling domestic growth while positioning India as a cornerstone of global economic stability. As China’s growth slows to 4% next year, India’s ascent represents not just an economic milestone but a powerful narrative of innovation, ambition, and unmatched potential.
Complementing the World Bank’s insights, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts a similarly strong trajectory for India, with growth projected at 6.5% for both 2025 and 2026. These consistent predictions underline the nation’s stable economic fundamentals and its ability to navigate global uncertainties effectively. Together, the World Bank and IMF projections underscore India’s growing prominence as a key driver of global economic growth.
The GEP report is a flagship publication of the World Bank that examines global economic trends and challenges, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. The January 2025 edition marks a milestone, providing a comprehensive review of these economies’ progress since 2000 and their prospects for the next quarter-century.
India’s growth story stands out prominently in the report. Key findings include a stable annual growth rate of 6.7% for FY26 and FY27, robust performance in the services sector, and strengthening manufacturing activity supported by government efforts to enhance logistics and tax reforms. Private consumption is set to increase due to a stronger labor market, improved access to credit, and lower inflation, while investment growth remains robust, buoyed by rising private investments, better corporate balance sheets, and favorable financing conditions.
Globally, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) now account for 45% of global GDP, up from 25% at the start of the century. India, alongside China and Brazil, has collectively driven approximately 60% of annual global growth since 2000, emphasizing the transformative role of these economies.
India’s impressive economic performance is underpinned by visionary government schemes. Infrastructure projects like the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and initiatives like Startup India and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme are transforming key sectors. These reforms are fostering innovation, enhancing manufacturing capabilities, and promoting financial inclusion, reflecting India’s commitment to building a resilient and globally competitive economy.
India’s economic trajectory highlights its commitment to inclusive growth and innovation-driven development. With forward-thinking policies, a robust infrastructure, and digital transformation, the nation is redefining its global standing.
As the fastest-growing large economy, with consistent growth projected at 6.7% over the next two fiscal years, India continues to outpace its global peers. By fostering entrepreneurship, enhancing manufacturing, and streamlining governance, India is setting an example of resilience and strategic progress.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:53:49 +0000
Content: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.”
Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday.
“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.”
TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.
Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.
The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.
“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement.
The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.

Title: China both hopeful and on edge as Trump returns to White House
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:32:58 +0000
Content: Chinese officials and ordinary people are hopeful but on edge as Donald Trump returns to the White House, eager to avoid a repeat of the bruising trade war that drove a wedge between the economic superpowers during his first term.
Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, in meetings with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other members of the U.S. business community in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration, said he hoped U.S.
companies would “take root” in China and help to stabilise bilateral relations, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
When Trump was last president, he heaped tariffs on more than $300 billion of Chinese imports. In recent months, he has said he would add tariffs of at least 10% on top of what is already imposed on Chinese goods, a move that would hurt China at a time when its economy is struggling to find a firm footing.
At the same time, the U.S. president-elect made the seemingly conciliatory move of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration on Monday. Xi sent Han in his place, a gesture of goodwill given that China was only represented by its ambassador at the previous two U.S. presidential inaugurations.
At their meeting on Sunday, Han told Musk, appointed by Trump to lead a department aimed at creating a more efficient U.S. government, that he “welcomed Tesla TSLA.O and other U.S. companies” to share in the benefits of China’s development and contribute to China-U.S. relations.
The vice president’s meeting with U.S. businesses was chaired by FedEx FDX.N CEO, Rajesh Subramaniam, on the U.S. side, and included the heads of eight U.S. firms from a range of industries including technology, banking and logistics, according to an American executive in the room, who added that the meeting overran its allotted time and was very cordial.
“(Han Zheng) is seen as someone, because of his time in Shanghai, who understands the concerns of the foreign business community, he understands the economy,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters in Beijing.
“It’s a nice fig leaf, or whatever you want to call it, so that’s positive.”
Xi and Trump were upbeat after speaking by phone on Friday, with Trump calling it “a very good one” and Xi saying he and Trump both hoped for a positive start to U.S.-China relations.
On Monday, China and Hong Kong stocks rose as their phone call eased some geopolitical concerns. The mainland’s blue-chip CSI300 Index CSI300 climbed 0.9% by the lunch break, adding to the 2.1% gain last week. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index HSI jumped 2.3%, the most in five weeks.
“What I can see is that China’s economy is not very good at the moment, due to the impact of the pandemic, and (the fact that) Trump himself is a crazy, wild person (doesn’t help matters on our side),” said a Beijinger surnamed Wang, 36.
“The pressure still remains quite big (for us).”

Title: Uttarakhand Cabinet approves Uniform Civil Code manual
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:28:29 +0000
Content: A cabinet meeting was held on Monday at the State Secretariat under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, where the cabinet approved the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) manual.
The approval follows a thorough scrutiny by the legislative Department, which had already reviewed the manual.
On UCC, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami Said that our government kept the promises we made before the 2022 elections.
He asserted that the dates of implementation will be announced soon.
“We had promised the people of Uttarakhand in 2022 that we would bring the UCC Bill as soon as our government was formed. We brought it. The draft committee drafted it, it was passed, the President approved it and it became an act. The process of training is also almost complete… After analysing everything, we will announce the dates soon,” Dhami said to media persons after the meeting.
The BJP government introduced the UCC Bill during a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly on February 6 this year and it was passed with a comfortable majority a day later on February 7.
Following the Uttarakhand Assembly, the UCC Bill was passed in February, and President Droupadi Murmu signed it on March 13, paving the way for Uttarakhand to potentially become the first state in India to enact the UCC.
The Uniform Civil Code seeks to establish a set of uniform personal laws that apply to all citizens, regardless of religion, gender, or caste. This would cover aspects such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession.

Foden opened the scoring in the 27th minute before teeing up Mateo Kovacic to double City’s advantage three minutes later, and Foden then added another goal in the 42nd minute to send his side in 3-0 up at the break.
Jeremy Doku netted the fourth with a deflected effort just after halftime before setting up Erling Haaland to score, and substitute James McAtee completed the rout in the 69th minute with a looping header.

Title: Trump plans sweeping executive orders on immigration, energy, and more on first day in office
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:48:44 +0000
Content: Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as U.S. president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration.
Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a “shock and awe” effort.
Transition advisers have been preparing drafts for Trump to choose from. Decisions have yet to be made on which will be released on Monday and which in the days that follow.
Here is what we know about the executive orders so far:
IMMIGRATION
Many of the actions that Trump plans on his first day as president are aimed at ramping up immigration enforcement and following through on his pledge to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
The executive actions would give federal immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and restart construction of the border wall, Reuters reported in November.
Trump is expected to declare illegal immigration a national emergency to unlock military funds for border wall construction. He also signaled in a Truth Social post in November that he would shift military resources to assist with his deportation plans.
“We’re going to make it so if you’re illegal, you’re not coming in through a port of entry or even if you’re trying to come into a port of entry illegally, you’re not going to be allowed in,” Trump adviser Jason Miller told National Public Radio.
Trump also plans to end temporary “parole” programs, which under President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from certain countries to enter legally on humanitarian grounds and access work permits, Reuters reported.
In addition, Trump has vowed to end automatic citizenship for those born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally, and advisers say his team is working on an executive order to this effect.
The U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the post-Civil War period, provides for granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”
Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge.
“We have to end it. It’s ridiculous,” Trump told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December.
ENERGY
Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump’s transition team have said that Trump is considering a suite of executive orders to roll out within days of taking office targeting everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration.
Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows.
Trump’s executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden’s climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules.
TARIFFS
One move that Trump could take on his first day or early in his new administration is to follow through on his threats to increase tariffs on imported goods from America’s biggest trading partners.
Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers.
PARDONS
Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE
Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration’s policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with.
That care can include hormone therapy and surgery.
“On Day One, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care,” Trump said.
TRANSGENDER RIGHTS
Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools.
As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women’s sports.
DIVERSITY PROGRAMS
During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies.
Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office.
Trump has also criticized “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies inside universities.
DRUG CARTELS
Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl.
REQUIRING FEDERAL WORKERS TO RETURN TO THE OFFICE
Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them.
In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.”
By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.

Title: Maha Kumbh 2025 to generate 12 lakh gig and temporary jobs, benefit over 8 lakh workers
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:33:28 +0000
Content: The 45-day Maha Kumbh 2025 is anticipated to generate an estimated 1.2 million (12 lakh) gig and temporary jobs, benefitting over eight lakh workers across various sectors, according to a report on Monday.
The historic congregation at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a powerhouse for temporary employment and economic growth in the country.
This landmark event is projected to boost commerce not only in Prayagraj but also in neighbouring regions, with key industries such as tourism, transportation and logistics, healthcare, IT, and retail expected to see substantial benefits.
According to the report by NLB Services, a global technology and digital talent solutions provider, beyond its profound spiritual significance, the sacred gathering has transformed into a major driver of economic activity.
The Uttar Pradesh government anticipates welcoming 40 crore devotees, making it one of history’s largest peaceful gatherings.
According to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), the event is expected to generate a staggering Rs 2 lakh crore in economic activity, creating unprecedented opportunities across various sectors.
“The economic ripple effect extends through infrastructure development, event management, security services, local trade, tourism, entertainment, and horticulture, fostering growth in both traditional and modern business segments,” said Sachin Alug, CEO, NLB Services.
The surge in temporary jobs in these diverse sectors is providing a significant boost to both the formal and informal employment sectors.
“In the tourism and hospitality industry, roles such as hotel staff, tour guides, porters, travel consultants, and coordinators are expected to grow substantially, contributing approximately 4.5 lakh to manage the massive influx of visitors,” Alug noted.
Similarly, the transportation and logistics sector will experience heightened demand for drivers, supply chain managers, courier personnel, and other support staff, creating employment for an estimated three lakh.
Temporary medical camps set up during the event will provide freelance nurses, paramedics, and allied healthcare professionals with opportunities, generating around 1.5 lakh to ensure the safety and well-being of millions of attendees.
“Meanwhile, the IT and technology sector is likely to witness a surge in demand, with two lakh professionals required to manage virtual darshan apps, real-time event update applications, and cybersecurity for seamless digital experiences,” the report mentioned.
Retail businesses catering to the needs of devotees are expected to create approximately one lakh jobs for on-ground sales and customer support staff to meet the demand for religious items, souvenirs, and local products.
Till now, at least 7.72 crore devotees have taken the holy dip at the world’s largest spiritual congregation.

Title: RBI steps to boost liquidity in banking system are smart, pragmatic: SBI
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:02:26 +0000
Content: More changes in the RBI Liquidity Management Framework are likely after the daily dynamic VRR (variable rate repo) has been taken as the first step to manage liquidity in the banking system, according to an SBI research report.
“Such changes and frontloading next round of moves are smart and pragmatic by the RBI…A delicate mix of temporary and permanent liquidity injection and withdrawal remains a work in progress,” the report states.
As a corollary to intervention in the forex markets juxtaposed with volatile movements in government cash balances, liquidity has been shrinking in the banking system and alarmingly blowing past the comfort zone
This persistent liquidity conundrum, along with the anticipation of a rally in DXY has prompted the regulator to revert to daily dynamic VRR to effectively manage the liquidity along the revised LMF (Liquidity Management Framework) in place from February 2020.
Given that such daily VRR transactions are akin to transient liquidity injections, repo transactions should ideally compensate for changes in government cash balances, but this is somehow also substituting for permanent durable liquidity shortfall arising out of currency leakage and liquidity impact of RBI forex intervention, the report observes.
“To negate this, in a smart move RBI has started to sell in Spot and NDF forwards and then doing short-term buy-sell swaps to replace the maturing forward sale position and also to counter the durable liquidity drain from spot intervention. We also think RBI may announce longer term (2-3 years) buy sell swaps to shore up reserves and release liquidity,” according to the SBI report.
In principle, liquidity management still has some operational challenges like improving the market microstructure, a proper indicator of liquidity tightness in the system and most importantly maintaining a delicate balance between an effective mix of durable and transient liquidity injection or withdrawal, the report points out.
According to the report, the system liquidity situation remained tight and turned to injection mode since 16 December 2024, due to many reasons like tax outflows, GST payment, forex market intervention and volatility in capital flows. Further with the implementation of Just in Time (JIT), the system liquidity has been impacted through movements in government cash balances
System liquidity moved from a surplus of Rs 1.35 lakh crore in November to a deficit of Rs 0.65 lakh crore in December, further to Rs 1.58 lakh crore deficit in January (till January 16). If we look at the injection-absorption ratio, which has increased to about 4 X, indicating persistent borrowings from the LAF window, the report added.

Title: ‘We thank President Trump’: TikTok on process of restoring service in US
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:31:54 +0000
Content: Chinese social media app TikTok has expressed gratitude to President-elect Donald Trump for “providing the necessary clarity and assurance” after confirming it is in the process of restoring service in the United States.
This development follows Trump’s pledge to restore access to TikTok, which had ceased functioning in the US on Saturday night to comply with the Biden administration’s ban order.
In a post on X on Sunday, TikTok said, “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”
The post further added, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”
Trump announced on Truth Social that he plans to issue an executive order on Monday to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 90 days.
“I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” he said.
“The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,” he added.
He also outlined a proposal for the US to hold a 50% ownership stake in a joint venture involving TikTok.
“I would like the US to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands, and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars—maybe trillions,” he said.
“Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners, whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase we so choose,” he added.
TikTok went offline in the US on Saturday night (local time), just hours before a law banning the app was set to take effect, CNN reported.
Users who tried to access the platform were met with a message stating, “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”
The ban follows a Supreme Court ruling on Friday that upheld a law passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by US President Joe Biden in April.

Title: Kho Kho World Cup: India clinches historic double victory in men’s and women’s titles; PM Modi congratulates teams
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:05:34 +0000
Content: The inaugural Kho Kho World Cup in New Delhi ended on a historic note as India secured both the men’s and women’s titles in thrilling fashion. In a masterful display of speed, strategy, and skill, the Indian women’s kho kho team claimed the 2025 title at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Sunday night, defeating Nepal 78-40. Meanwhile, the men’s team followed suit with a 54-36 victory over Nepal in their final.
The Indian women dominated from the outset, with skipper Priyanka Ingle leading by example. In Turn 1, the Women in Blue racked up 34 points, effectively neutralizing the Nepalese team. Despite a brief comeback attempt by Nepal in Turn 2, led by Dipa BK, India held firm. In Turn 4, Chaithra B orchestrated a Dream Run, extending India’s lead to 78 points and sealing the historic victory.
India’s path to the title included commanding wins over South Korea, Iran, and Malaysia in the group stages, followed by triumphs against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals and South Africa in the semi-finals. This victory not only crowned India as the first-ever Kho Kho World Cup champions but also spotlighted the sport’s growing global appeal.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the women’s team, emphasizing how this triumph brought renewed attention to one of India’s oldest traditional sports. “Their unparalleled skill, determination, and teamwork have inspired countless young athletes across the nation,” he tweeted.
The men’s final saw a similarly dominant performance. Led by captain Pratik Waikar and standout player Ramji Kashyap, India started strong with a 26-0 lead in Turn 1, thanks to exceptional skydive maneuvers. Though Nepal mounted a spirited comeback, India’s defense, bolstered by Waikar and Sachin Bhargo, proved too strong. The 54-36 win marked the culmination of India’s remarkable journey, which included victories over Brazil, Peru, and Bhutan in the group stages, and knockout wins over Bangladesh and South Africa.
Dignitaries such as former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Supreme Court Judge Pankaj Mithal, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju were present to witness the historic event, further underscoring Kho Kho’s rising prominence. This landmark victory, paired with the growing interest in the sport, sets the stage for Kho Kho’s future as a global phenomenon, with aspirations of becoming an Olympic sport.
PM Modi also congratulated the men’s team following their victory. In a post on X, he said: “Today’s a great day for Indian Kho Kho. Incredibly proud of the Indian Men’s Kho Kho team for winning the Kho Kho World Cup title. Their grit and dedication is commendable. This win will contribute to further popularising Kho Kho among the youth.”
India’s double triumph in the inaugural Kho Kho World Cup has not only established them as champions but also brought new recognition to this indigenous game on the international stage.

Title: Facebook, X, YouTube to do more against online hate speech, EU says
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 12:44:04 +0000
Content: Meta’s Facebook, Elon Musk’s X, Google’s YouTube and other tech companies have agreed to do more to tackle online hate speech under an updated code of conduct that will now be integrated into EU tech rules, the European Commission said on Monday.
Other signatories to the voluntary code set up in May 2016 are Dailymotion, Instagram, Jeuxvideo.com, LinkedIn, Microsoft hosted consumer services, Snapchat, Rakuten Viber, TikTok and Twitch.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online. I welcome the stakeholders’ commitment to a strengthened Code of conduct under the Digital Services Act (DSA),” EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.
The DSA requires tech companies to do more to combat illegal and harmful content on their platforms. Compliance with the updated code could impact regulators’ enforcement of the Act, EU officials said.
Under the revised code, the companies pledged to allow not-for-profit or public entities with expertise on illegal hate speech to monitor how they review hate speech notices, and to assess at least two thirds of these notices received from them within 24 hours.
The companies will also take measures, such as the use automatic detection tools to reduce hate speech on their platforms, and provide information on the role of recommendation systems and the organic and algorithmic reach of illegal content prior to its removal.
They will present country-level data broken down by the internal classification of hate speech such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.

Title: Bangladesh: Foreign Adviser Touhid departed for China on 5-day state visit

Content: Bangladesh Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain today departed for China on a 5-day state visit aiming to forge a new dimension of Dhaka-Beijing relations. The five-day official visit will focus on lowering interest rates on loans, exchanging hydrological information, advancing medical treatment cooperation, and encouraging greater Chinese involvement in resolving the Myanmar situation, reports Bangladesh Sanghbad Sangstha (BSS).
Touhid is set to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Muhammad Rafiqul Alam told media during the weekly briefing in Dhaka on Thursday.
Earlier on Sunday the Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen briefed the foreign adviser on key issues for the visit. Wen also hinted that Beijing is ready to sign an implementation plan on hydrological information exchange, fulfilling a previous request from Dhaka, reports BSS.
Beyond official talks with the Chinese foreign minister, the adviser is scheduled to meet with Chinese Communist Party leaders and deliver speeches at the China Institute of International Studies and the Shanghai Institute of International Studies, apart from engaging with business representatives in Shanghai to attract Chinese investments in Bangladesh, according to foreign ministry officials, reports BSS.
The adviser’s visit would focus on economic cooperation, commerce and trade expansion and a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis among others, said Rafiqul.
Both the countries were going to celebrate the 50 years of their diplomatic relations this year, he said, adding that although the amount of trade between the two countries stood at $25 billion, it was heavily tilted to China.
He said that the visit would be very crucial since the bilateral relations between China and Bangladesh was already elevated to ‘comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.
Rafiqul said that the adviser would also hold a meeting with a business community of Shanghai for increasing China’s investment in Bangladesh.

Title: US: Melania Trump launches her cryptocurrency
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 12:26:05 +0000
Content: Former US First Lady Melania Trump has introduced her own cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, just days after her husband Donald Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin, CNN reported.
In a social media announcement on Sunday, Melania unveiled her digital currency, writing, “The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now. https://melaniameme.com.” The launch coincided with a dip in the value of Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency, which had been trading strongly since its debut two days earlier.
Meme coins, known for their volatility and lack of intrinsic value, are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet culture. While their prices can fluctuate dramatically, they often gain traction through community engagement and popularity.
Donald Trump, who previously criticized Bitcoin as being “based on thin air,” had embraced meme coins with the release of $TRUMP. In his launch post on Friday, Trump declared, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to http://gettrumpmemes.com — Have Fun!”
Both $TRUMP and $MELANIA are trading on the Solana blockchain. $TRUMP initially saw a surge in value, reaching over USD 70 by Sunday afternoon before falling to USD 40 following Melania’s launch. As of early Monday, $TRUMP had recovered to around USD 60, while $MELANIA was trading at just over USD 12, according to CoinGecko.
The Trump coin has gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency market. With a circulating supply of 200 million coins, its market capitalization is currently capped at USD 13 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the next three years, the total supply of $TRUMP is expected to reach 1 billion coins.
Both cryptocurrencies’ websites emphasize that the coins are meant to represent and engage with their respective brands’ values rather than serve as traditional investment opportunities. They also disclaim any political affiliation. However, 80% of the $TRUMP coin supply is held by Trump Organization-affiliated entities, CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which are bound by a three-year unlocking schedule, restricting them from selling their holdings all at once.
The $TRUMP website promotes the coin as “the only official Trump meme,” branding it as a celebration of a leader who “doesn’t back down, no matter the odds.” Meanwhile, Melania Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency adds a competitive edge to the meme coin market as both coins vie for attention and engagement.
Donald Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency marks a significant shift in his stance. In July 2024, he addressed crypto’s largest convention and appointed Howard Lutnick, a cryptocurrency advocate and supporter of Tether, to lead the US Commerce Department. This move signaled the former president’s growing support for the digital asset sector.

Title: Trump’s second term marks new cryptocurrency era

Content: Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday.
The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy.
Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests.
The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend.
Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump’s inner circle.
SCOTT BESSENT
A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump’s pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto.

“Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do,” Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. “Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin.”
ELON MUSK
The Tesla chief and world’s richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin.
His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble.
The acronym for Musk’s cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world’s seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko.
In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed.
VIVEK RAMASWAMY
Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management.
Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch, opens new tab an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments.
The company’s wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans’ investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release.
In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure.
DAVID SACKS
A former PayPal executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry.
Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows.
STEVE WITKOFF
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November.
World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company’s revenues.
JD VANCE
U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure.
The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy’s asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows.
In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether.
Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump’s sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said – without providing evidence – that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes.
PAUL ATKINS
Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump’s choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler.
Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners, a consultancy. Patomak advises “cutting-edge crypto-native companies” and traditional financial firms on how to “leverage digital assets for growth,” its website says.

Title: Indian stock market ends higher as US gears up for Trump 2.0
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:46:10 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed Monday’s trading session on a positive note, buoyed by solid third-quarter earnings and optimism surrounding US President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration as the 47th President of the United States.
The BSE Sensex climbed 454 points or 0.59%, closing at 77,073.44, while the Nifty 50 advanced by 141.55 points or 0.61% to close at 18,283.90.
Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 29 ended in the green during the session. On the Sensex, 19 stocks recorded gains. Market analysts attributed the uptrend to positive cues from Asian and European markets, driven by growing anticipation around Trump’s leadership. Banking and telecom sectors were at the forefront of the recovery.
Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities, said, “While the market gains are influenced by sentiment, the prevailing mood is one of caution, with volatility persisting. Domestic investors are primarily focusing on the Union Budget announcement on February 1 and its measures to tackle the ongoing economic slowdown. Trump’s trade policies also add an element of uncertainty.”
Among the top gainers on the Nifty 50 was Kotak Mahindra Bank, which surged 9.35%. Other notable gainers included Wipro, NTPC, Bajaj Finserv, and Bajaj Finance. On the downside, SBI Life emerged as the session’s biggest loser, followed by Tech Mahindra, TCS, HDFC Life, and others.

Experts noted that robust sentiment across Asian markets provided a solid boost to domestic indices, setting the tone for a strong start to the week.

Title: India ranks 7th in global coffee production as exports hit $1.29 billion
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:23:39 +0000
Content: India has emerged as the world’s seventh-largest coffee producer, with exports reaching $1.29 billion in FY 2023-24, almost double the $719.42 million recorded in 2020-21, according to a press release from the Commerce Ministry.
India’s coffee exports have grown significantly due to the increasing global demand for its rich and unique flavors. In the first half of January 2025 India exported over 9,300 tonnes of coffee with top buyers including Italy, Belgium, and Russia. Approximately three-fourths of India’s coffee production consists of Arabica and Robusta beans. These are primarily exported as unroasted beans.
However, there is a growing demand for value-added products like roasted and instant coffee, further fueling the export boom.
Due to rise of cafe culture, higher disposable incomes and a growing preference for coffee over tea, coffee consumption in India is also steadily increasing. This trend has been observed particularly in both urban and rural areas. Domestic consumption has increased from 84,000 tonnes in 2012 to 91,000 tonnes in 2023. This surge reflects a broader shift in drinking habits, as coffee becomes a staple in daily life.
India’s coffee is primarily grown in the ecologically rich Western and Eastern Ghats, areas famous for their biodiversity. Karnataka leads in production, contributing 248,020 million tonnes in 2022-23, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu. These areas are home to shaded plantations that not only support the coffee industry but also play a vital role in preserving the natural environment, helping to maintain the ecological balance of these biodiversity hotspots.
India’s journey with coffee began centuries ago, when a Sufi saint Baba Budan brought seven Mocha seeds to the hills of Karnataka in the 1600s. His simple act of planting these seeds in the courtyard of his hermitage in Baba Budan Giri unknowingly set in motion the rise of India as one of the world’s prominent coffee producers. Over the centuries, the cultivation of coffee in India has evolved from a humble practice to a thriving industry with the country’s coffee now widely loved across the globe.

Title: Advanced Light Helicopters will not participate in Republic Day flypast: defence secretary
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:04:52 +0000
Content: Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh announced on Monday that the Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), indigenously designed and developed, will not participate in this year’s Republic Day flypast following the grounding of the fleet after a recent crash.
“The ALH will not be participating in the parade, but 39 other aircraft will feature in the flypast, showcasing 12 different formations,” Singh stated during a press conference.
The decision comes after a tragic crash of an ALH belonging to the Coast Guard in Porbandar, Gujarat, on January 5, which claimed the lives of three Coast Guard personnel. Following the incident, the armed forces grounded the entire fleet of approximately 330 ALH choppers as a precautionary measure.
Despite this, the Republic Day parade retains its military essence. Singh said. “The military and martial character of the parade is being maintained, but we are also bringing wider societal and cultural participation,” he added.
Preparations for the grand event are in full swing. Rehearsals at Kartavya Path on Monday featured MI-17 V-5 helicopters, Apache attack helicopters, Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher systems, and all-terrain vehicles.
Security measures have also been heightened ahead of the Republic Day celebrations on January 26. The CISF has intensified passenger security checks across Metro stations, leading to potential queues, particularly during peak hours. Passengers are advised to plan their commutes with additional time and cooperate with security personnel.
Amid these preparations, the Indian Army’s Motorcycle Rider Display Team, known as the “Daredevils,” achieved a world record at Kartavya Path on January 20. The team, part of the Corps of Signals, formed the highest human pyramid on moving motorcycles, standing an impressive 20.4 feet tall. The formation, comprising 40 men on 7 motorcycles, covered a distance of 2 kilometers from Vijay Chowk to India Gate.

Title: Sanjay Roy sentenced to life imprisonment in RG Kar rape and murder case
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 10:37:54 +0000
Content: A West Bengal court on Monday sentenced Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on Roy.
The case, which drew widespread public attention, saw the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) pushing for the death penalty. However, the Sealdah court ruled that the crime did not meet the threshold of the “rarest of the rare” and handed down a life sentence instead.
During the proceedings, the court addressed the accused, explaining the charges for which he had been convicted. Despite the charges, Roy maintained his innocence, claiming he had been “falsely implicated” in the crime. “I have not done anything, neither rape nor murder. I am being falsely implicated. You have seen everything. I am innocent. I already told you that I was tortured. They made me sign whatever they wanted,”.
Roy’s defense lawyer argued that even in the rarest of rare cases, there should be room for reformation and rehabilitation, asserting that the prosecution must prove that the accused was beyond reformation. The lawyer called for consideration of reformative measures instead of a more extreme punishment.
On the other hand, the victim’s family’s lawyer demanded the maximum punishment for the accused, calling for the death sentence. The victim’s father, who had consistently fought for justice, expressed his belief that the harshest punishment should be given to the convict. “Our fight will continue on the streets and in the courts,” he said, reiterating his demand for justice.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also spoke out on the case, stating that her government had cooperated with the investigation and always sought justice for the victim. “We have cooperated with the investigation… we had demanded justice, but the judiciary had to run its course, so that’s why it took this much time,” she said before the court hearing on Monday.
The case revolves around the tragic rape and murder of a trainee doctor, whose body was discovered on August 9 in the seminar room of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Roy, a civic volunteer at the hospital, was arrested following the incident. His conviction has sparked widespread protests and calls for justice.
The Sealdah court had previously convicted Roy on Saturday, stating that he had assaulted and murdered the young doctor who had been resting in the seminar room. The court framed sections 64, 66, and 103/1 of the BNS Act against the accused.

Title: Trump outlines sweeping border crackdown, mass deportation push
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 19:59:47 +0000
Content: Newly sworn-in U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he will declare illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a national emergency, send troops there and ramp up deportations of criminal offenders, outlining the crackdown in his inaugural address.
Trump said be would invoke a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act to target foreign gang members in the U.S., a legal authority last used to detain noncitizens of Japanese, German, and Italian descent in internment camps during World War Two.
Shortly after the inauguration, U.S. border authorities said they had shut down outgoing President Joe Biden’s legal entry program known as CBP One that had allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. legally by scheduling an appointment on an app. Existing appointments were canceled, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Trump said he would designate criminal cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, part of a slate of moves that could shake up U.S.-Mexico relations.
Earlier, a Trump official who asked not to be named said the new president plans to issue a sweeping proclamation blocking access to all seeking asylum at the Mexico border. Trump also intends to challenge U.S. citizenship for children born to parents in the U.S. illegally, the official said, a right that stems from an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House after promising to intensify border security and deport record numbers of migrants. While Trump criticized Democrat Biden for high levels of illegal immigration during his presidency, migrant arrests fell dramatically after Biden toughened his policies in June and as Mexico stepped up enforcement.
Republicans say large-scale deportations are necessary after millions of immigrants crossed illegally during Biden’s presidency. There were roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with a temporary status at the start of 2022, according to a U.S. government estimate, a figure that some analysts now place at 13 million to 14 million.
Trump’s critics and immigrant advocates say mass deportations could disrupt businesses, split families and cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have been preparing for possible litigation, a strategy that stymied many of Trump’s hardline policies during his first term. California and other Democratic-led states that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement also could clash with Trump.
The official said Trump would take 10 executive orders and actions on Monday aimed at stepping up border security, calling illegal immigration an “invasion.”
The official said Trump will take steps intended to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal immigration status. That move will almost certainly trigger legal challenges. Trump also plans to suspend the U.S. refugee resettlement program for at least four months and will order a review of security to see if travelers from certain nations should be subject to a travel ban.
Kristi Noem, Trump’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, said at a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Friday that she would end Biden-era legal entry programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. on a temporary basis.
Trump said in his address that he would reinstate his first-term “remain in Mexico” program, which forced non-Mexico asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for the outcome of the U.S. cases. Biden ended the program in 2021, saying migrants were stuck waiting in squalid conditions.
Mexico’s presidency, foreign ministry, and economy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s plans. In a regular press conference on Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm and insisted her government had to see the details of Trump’s actions before responding.

Title: Usha becomes first Indian-American Second Lady as JD Vance takes oath as US Vice President
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 19:43:48 +0000
Content: Usha Vance became the first Indian-American and Hindu Second Lady after her husband J.D. Vance was sworn in as the 50th Vice President of the US on Monday.
She held the Bible in one hand, and their daughter Mirabel Rose in the other, as Vance placed his left hand on the religious text, and raising his right hand took the oath of office.
President Donald Trump said later that Usha Vance is smarter than her husband and that he might have picked her as the Vice President.
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a mentor to Usha Vance, administered the oath to her husband.
J.D. Vance was sworn in before President Donald Trump took the oath of office.
Before the Vances came to the podium, military personnel in ceremonial uniforms brought their children, Ewan Blaine, 7, Vivek, 4, and Mirabel Rose, 3, to the podium.
The boys wore formal suits, and Usha Vance was dressed in pink.
She beamed and looked admiringly at J.D. Vance as he repeated the oath after Kavanaugh.
J.D. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins who has given up drugs, stood with the family during the ceremony.
Usha Vance is the daughter of Telugu immigrants from India, Radhakrishna “Krish” Chilukuri, an aerospace engineer, and Lakshmi Chilukuri, the provost at the University of California, San Diego.
J.D. Vance and Usha met while they were studying law at Yale University.
J.D. Vance, who came from a broken family with his mother a drug addict, and suffered poverty, credited Usha in his memoir with being his “spirit guide” who helped him navigate the Ivy League university and professional life.
Raised by his grandmother, Vance joined the military to escape the dysfunction of life in Middleton, Ohio, and got his break with admission to Yale, where he said he felt out of place.
He wrote: “In a place that always seemed a little foreign, Usha’s presence made me feel at home.”
They married in 2014.
After briefly practicing law, J.D. Vance turned to business as a venture capitalist.
Entering politics, he was elected to the Senate in 2022.
Usha Vance is a corporate litigator who left a prestigious law firm after he was named the Vice President candidate.
She worked previously as a clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Kavanaugh while he was an appeals court judge.
J.D. Vance also influenced her.
She switched her membership from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.

Title: Will take back Panama Canal & leave Paris climate accord: Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 18:29:22 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump on Monday said he will issue executive orders that will declare a national emergency along the border and all illegal entry will be immediately halted, adding that he will start the process of sending back people who came to the U.S. illegally.
Trump also said he will be ordering troops to secure the border.
The President announced a slew of measures that he said would end American decline and mark the beginning of a golden age. They include a new body to collect tariffs levied on foreign products, renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and starting the process to bring back the Panama Canal under U.S. control.
His office also said in a factsheet that the US will be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, which he had done in the first term as well.
“I will declare a National Emergency at our southern border,” Trump said in his inaugural address of executive orders that will be issued by his administration.
“All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate our Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,” he said.
President Trump also said he would be announcing new tariffs as he had promised and indicated on the campaign trail.
“I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. We are establishing an external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. There will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources, the American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government,” he said.
The President did not specify what tariffs will be levied and on whom.
On foreign policy broadly, he said that as in his first term “we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success, not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.”
“My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” he said.
“That’s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world,” he added.
He added that he would issue an order in a short time to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
He said that the US will take back the Panama Canal. “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty have also been violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” the President said.

Jill Biden and Melania Trump rode together to the Capitol in a separate car as did Kamala Harris and her successor J D Vance.
They had gathered at the White House for a traditional tea ceremony, at which Biden welcomed the incoming President with two words: “Welcome home”, according to media reports.
Guests for the swearing-in had begun arriving at the Capitol Rotunda where the ceremony took place; indoors instead of the traditional venue outside because of frigid conditions. This will be only the second instance of the swearing-in taking place indoors; the last time was in 1985 when President Ronald Reagan took the oath for his second term.
Trump’s return to the White House is also only the second time for an American President to serve two non-consecutive terms. The first was Grover Cleveland at the end of the 19th century.
The swearing-in was attended by Trump’s nominees to the cabinet such as Marco Rubio, for secretary of state, who is expected to be the first to be confirmed, as early as Monday; Robert Kennedy Jr, Doug Burgum, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth and others.
Among the first people high-ranking officials to arrive at the Capitol Rotunda on Monday was Gen. CQ Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who sat on the platform where Trump took his oath. Current and former House and Senate leaders also arrived, including former Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife former Trump Cabinet member Elaine Chao. Former House speakers Kevin McCarthy, John Boehner and Newt Gingrich also took their seats.
According to pool reports, supporters were filling Emancipation Hall at the Capitol, the overflow viewing room in the Capitol Visitor Center, where Trump is expected to speak after the inauguration ceremony. Notable attendees include AI billionaires Sam Altman and Alexandr Wang, YouTube influencers and brothers Logan and Jake Paul, indicted New York Mayor Eric Adams, mixed martial artist and boxer Conor McGregor, comedian and podcaster Theo Von and former race car driver Danica Patrick. House and Senate spouses have also been seated in the overflow space.
Trump started Monday’s inauguration proceedings by attending a private service at St John’s Church with the incoming first lady Melania Trump, Vice-President-elect JD Vance and wife Usha Vance and some members of the cabinet.
No TV cameras were allowed inside but the Trump inauguration team released pictures from inside that showed other attendees including Trump’s sons Barron Trump, Don Trump Jr, Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner.
Also among Trump’s guests were Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla and Space X’s Elon Musk, and Google’s Sundar Pichai. They would go on to also attend the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, former President George W Bush and his wife Laura Bush, and former President Barack Obama minus his wife Michelle Obama attended the oath-taking ceremony as is the tradition, which was broken by President Trump who skipped Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

Title: PM Modi congratulates ‘dear friend’ Trump on his inauguration as 47th US President
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 17:55:51 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated Republican Party member Donald Trump on his return to the White House for a historic second term. Trump took the oath as the 47th President of the US during a programme held at the Capitol Rotunda.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote: “Congratulations my dear friend President @realDonaldTrump on your historic inauguration as the 47th President of the United States! I look forward to working closely together once again, to benefit both our countries and to shape a better future for the world. Best wishes for a successful term ahead.”
Trump was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice John Roberts.
Outgoing President Joe Biden and Trump rode together to the US Capitol for the latter’s oath-taking programme after a traditional tea ceremony at the White House along with their wives, Kamala Harris and her successor J.D. Vance and their spouses.
Jill Biden and Melania Trump rode together to the Capitol in a separate car as did Kamala Harris and her successor J.D. Vance.
This is only the second instance of the swearing-in taking place indoors — the last time was in 1985 when President Ronald Reagan took the oath for his second term.
Earlier, Biden welcomed Trump to the White House for a traditional tea ceremony with two words: “Welcome home”, according to media reports.

Title: Trump sworn in a second time, vows ‘golden age of America’
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 17:27:12 +0000
Content: Donald Trump vowed to usher in a new era of American greatness, minutes after he was sworn in as president for the second time to complete an extraordinary political comeback following two assassination attempts, a felony conviction and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss.
“The golden age of America begins right now,” he said.
Trump took the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend” the U.S. Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET inside the U.S. Capitol, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him.
Trump intends to sign a raft of executive actions in his first hours as president, incoming White House officials said on Monday, including 10 focused on border security and immigration, his top priority.
The president will declare a national emergency at the southern border, send armed troops there and resume a policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court dates, officials told reporters.
He will also seek to end so-called birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal status, a move some legal scholars have said would be unconstitutional.
The inauguration completes a triumphant comeback for a political disruptor who survived two impeachment trials, a felony conviction, two assassination attempts and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss.
The ceremony was moved inside the Capitol due to the extreme cold, four years after a mob of Trump supporters breached the building, a symbol of American democracy, in an unsuccessful effort to forestall Trump’s loss to Joe Biden.
Biden and outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, were on hand inside the Capitol’s Rotunda, along with former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, arrived with her husband Bill, but Obama’s wife, Michelle, chose not to attend.
Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration – including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trump’s family.
Trump, the first U.S. president since the 19th century to win a second term after losing the White House, has said he will pardon “on Day One” many of the more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. He skipped Biden’s inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged.
Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has targeted for retaliation, including former White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, former Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.
Trump will restore the federal death penalty, which Biden had suspended, and require that official U.S. documents such as passports reflect citizens’ gender as assigned at birth, incoming administration officials told reporters.
They said he will also sign an order ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government on Monday, which is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
But Trump will not immediately impose new tariffs on Monday, instead directing federal agencies to evaluate trade relationships with Canada, China and Mexico, a Trump official confirmed, an unexpected development that unleashed a broad slide in the U.S. dollar and a rally in global stock markets on a day when U.S. financial markets are closed.
Some of the executive orders are likely to face legal challenges.
Even as he prepared to retake office, Trump continued to expand his business ventures, raising billions in market value by launching a “meme coin” crypto token over the weekend that prompted ethical and regulatory questions.
Shortly before 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), Trump and incoming first lady Melania Trump arrived at the White House, where Biden and outgoing first lady Jill Biden greeted them with handshakes.
“Welcome home,” Biden said.
DISRUPTIVE FORCE
As he did in 2017, Trump enters office as a chaotic and disruptive force, vowing to remake the federal government and expressing deep skepticism about the U.S.-led alliances that have shaped post-World War Two global politics.
The former president returns to Washington emboldened after winning the national popular vote over Harris by more than 2 million votes thanks to a groundswell of voter frustration over persistent inflation, though he still fell just short of a 50% majority.
In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College – and the presidency – despite receiving nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.
Trump, who surpassed Biden as the oldest president ever to be sworn into office, will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress that have been almost entirely purged of any intra-party dissenters. His advisers have outlined plans to replace nonpartisan bureaucrats with hand-picked loyalists.
Even before taking office, Trump established a rival power center in the weeks after his election victory, meeting world leaders and causing consternation by musing aloud about seizing the Panama Canal, taking control of NATO ally Denmark’s territory of Greenland and imposing tariffs on the biggest U.S. trading partners.
His influence has already been felt in the Israel-Hamas announcement last week of a ceasefire deal. Trump, whose envoy joined the negotiations in Qatar, had warned of “hell to pay” if Hamas did not release its hostages before the inauguration.
Unlike in 2017, when he filled many top jobs with institutionalists, Trump has prioritized fealty over experience in nominating a bevy of controversial cabinet picks, some of whom are outspoken critics of the agencies they have been tapped to lead.
The inauguration took place amid heavy security after a campaign highlighted by an increase in political violence that included two assassination attempts against Trump, including one in which a bullet grazed his ear.
‘AMERICAN CARNAGE’
Eight years ago, Trump delivered a bleak inaugural address vowing to end the “American carnage” of what he said were crime-ridden cities and soft borders, a departure from the tone of optimism most newly elected presidents have adopted.
Foreign governments will be scrutinizing the tenor of Trump’s speech on Monday after he waged a campaign laced with inflammatory rhetoric.
The traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House will now take place indoors at the Capital One Arena, where Trump held his victory rally on Sunday. Trump will also attend three inaugural balls in the evening.
Some diehard Trump followers slept in the street in frigid conditions to make sure they were in line to get a seat at the arena.
A desk and chair sat on the stage, where Trump was expected to sign some of his first executive orders in front of his supporters before heading to the White House.
Trump will be the first felon to occupy the White House after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star.
Winning the election also rid Trump of two federal indictments – for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and for retaining classified documents – thanks to a Justice Department policy that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office.
In a report last week, Special Counsel Jack Smith said he had enough evidence to convict Trump in the election case if Trump had reached trial.

Title: India and Japan strengthen bilateral ties in Washington DC meeting
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 15:21:46 +0000
Content: India’s External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya on January 19, in Washington, DC. This meeting was their second in-person interaction, following their previous discussion during the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in Italy in November 2024.
Minister Jaishankar shared the update on X, saying, “Good to meet with FM Takeshi Iwaya of Japan. Reviewed the progress in our bilateral cooperation. Also discussed developments pertaining to Quad.”
The two Ministers discussed various aspects of bilateral collaboration, covering political, security, economic, technological, and cultural areas. They expressed satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation and underlined the need to maintain regular strategic communication through frameworks like the Strategic Dialogue and the 2+2 Dialogue of Foreign and Defence Ministers.
To strengthen the partnership, Jaishankar extended an invitation to Iwaya to visit India.
A key outcome of the meeting was the announcement of the India-Japan Year of Science, Technology, and Innovation, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Science and Technology Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985. Both leaders described this milestone as an opportunity to deepen collaborative efforts in research and development.
The talks highlighted the importance of fostering people-to-people exchanges, particularly in education, skill development, and technology. These efforts aim to reinforce ties between the two nations while enhancing opportunities for professionals and students.
The meeting also recognized the deep-rooted cultural and spiritual connections between India and Japan, tracing back to ancient times. Notable historical figures such as Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose have been instrumental in strengthening this bond.
Japan’s connection with India includes events like the consecration of the Buddha statue in Nara by Indian monk Bodhisena in 752 AD. Today, the relationship is further enriched by the Indian community in Japan, which has grown to over 40,000, including a significant number of students pursuing higher education. Tokyo’s Nishikasai area has become a hub for the Indian diaspora, reflecting the increased demand for Indian cultural and educational institutions.

Title: RG Kar verdict: convict’s lawyer plans appeal despite family’s acceptance of sentence
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 14:56:52 +0000
Content: A special court in Kolkata sentenced Sanjay Roy, the sole accused in the rape and murder of a woman doctor, to life imprisonment on Monday. Despite the sentence, Roy’s lawyer, Sejuti Chakraborty, announced intentions to appeal the verdict in the Calcutta High Court, a stance that contradicts the family’s earlier statements.
The case involves the brutal rape and murder of a doctor within the premises of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in August last year.
On January 18, Roy’s elder sister had publicly stated that the family would not challenge the court’s decision and would accept the punishment handed down to Roy. Following Roy’s conviction on Saturday, she offered an apology to the victim’s family and expressed trust in the justice system.
“We apologize to the victim’s family. The law has declared my brother guilty, and he will face the consequences. The administration will do what it deems right. Our personal desires hold no relevance,” she said at the time.
Roy’s mother remained unreachable on Monday, avoiding any contact by keeping the doors of their South Kolkata residence locked.
However, Chakraborty’s statement on Monday marked a departure from the family’s position. She emphasized the legal right of any convict to appeal and expressed her intention to challenge the lower court’s decision.
“We may take some time to act, but I firmly believe Sanjay is a victim in this case. We will move the higher court to secure his release,” Chakraborty said after the sentencing.
The conflicting narratives have raised questions about how the legal costs for the proposed appeal will be covered, given the family’s apparent reluctance to pursue further legal action.

Title: EAM Jaishankar represents PM Modi as special envoy at Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 14:32:47 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is representing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his Special Envoy at Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States in Washington, D.C., today. Sources reveal that Jaishankar is carrying a personal letter from PM Modi addressed to President Trump.
As per established protocol, India often delegates Special Envoys of the Prime Minister to attend such inaugural events of Heads of State and Government. For instance, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh participated in the swearing-in ceremony of Nigeria’s President in May 2023, while then-Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju attended the inauguration of the Maldives President in November 2023. In July 2024, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari represented India at the swearing-in of Iran’s President.
Last year, Minister of State for External Affairs Pabitra Margherita attended the inaugurations of the Presidents of both Indonesia and Mexico. Similarly, in June 2022, the then Minister for External Affairs, Raj Kumar Ranjan Singh, attended the swearing-in of the President of the Philippines.
Meanwhile, large crowds have gathered outside the US Capitol Rotunda, where the ceremonial event will take place. Donald Trump, who is embarking on his second term as US President, will be officially sworn in alongside Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. The inauguration marks two weeks since Trump’s electoral college victory was certified by the US Congress.
The ceremony will commence with Trump’s visit to St. John’s Church for a prayer service, followed by a stop at Blair House, the President’s Guest House. At the North Portico, outgoing President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will welcome Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, President-elect Donald Trump, and Melania Trump.
Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take his oath of office before Trump is sworn in. Following the swearing-in, President Trump will deliver his inaugural remarks. A farewell ceremony for Joe and Jill Biden, as well as Kamala Harris and her husband, will then take place.
The inauguration will conclude with Trump and Vance participating in the signing ceremony—a tradition where the new President, along with congressional members and aides, signs official documents, such as nominations or executive orders, in the President’s Room near the Senate Chamber. This tradition, initiated by former President Ronald Reagan in 1981, is one of the first official acts of the new US President. (ANI)
