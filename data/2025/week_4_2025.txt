Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:08:59 +0000
Content: The mixed doubles pair of Rohan Bopanna (India) and Zhang Shuai (China) advanced to the quarter-finals of the ongoing Australian Open 2025 after receiving a walkover against fourth seeds Taylor Townsend (USA) and Hugo Nys (Monaco) in the second round on Sunday.
Zhang Shuai, a two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 2, teamed up with Rohan Bopanna to reach the final eight. The Indo-Chinese pair will face the winners of the match between Australia’s Olivia Gadecki and John Peers and Hungary’s Timea Babos with El Salvador’s Marcelo Arevalo.
In the first round, Bopanna and Zhang defeated France’s Kristina Mladenovic and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig 6-4, 6-4 at the season’s first tennis Grand Slam.
In the men’s doubles event, Rohan Bopanna partnered with Colombian Nicolas Barrientos. However, the Indo-Colombian duo lost in the opening round, falling 7-5, 7(7)-6(5) to Spain’s Pedro Martinez and Jaume Munar.
Last year, Bopanna became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam title in the Open Era when he secured the Australian Open men’s doubles crown with Matthew Ebden. However, the pair split at the end of 2024, and neither Bopanna nor Ebden progressed beyond the first round in this year’s men’s doubles event.
Bopanna’s campaign in mixed doubles remains India’s final challenge at the Australian Open 2025. Other Indian players faced early exits: Yuki Bhambri and his French partner Albano Olivetti, along with Rithvik Bollipalli and Ryan Seggerman (USA), were eliminated in the first round of the men’s doubles.
Meanwhile, N Sriram Balaji and his Mexican partner Miguel Angel Reyes-Varela crashed out in the second round. In singles action, Sumit Nagal was ousted in the first round after a loss to Czechia’s Tomas Machac.

Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 08:48:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged citizens to exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become active participants in the country’s democratic process.  
Addressing the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2025, PM Modi highlighted that January 25, celebrated as ‘National Voters’ Day,’ is an important day as it marks the establishment of the Election Commission of India.  
Lauding the Election Commission, the PM said it has modernized and strengthened the voting process, empowering the people.
PM Modi said, “25 January is National Voters’ Day. This day is important because the ‘Election Commission of India’ was established on this day… The Election Commission has been given a very important place in the Constitution, as have people’s participation in democracy. Some were doubtful about the survival of the country’s democracy, but India has proven all such apprehensions wrong – after all, India is the Mother of Democracy. Over the decades, the country’s democracy has strengthened and prospered.”  
“I would also like to thank the Election Commission, which has, from time to time, modernized and strengthened our voting process. The Commission has harnessed the power of technology to empower the people. I congratulate the Election Commission for its commitment to fair elections. I urge the citizens to always exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become a part of the democratic process, thereby strengthening it,” he added.  
As the nation prepares for the Republic Day celebrations, PM Modi said that this year’s ‘Republic Day’ is very special and extended advance greetings to the countrymen. 
“Today marks the first Mann Ki Baat of 2025. You may have noticed that Mann Ki Baat usually takes place on the last Sunday of the month, but this time we are meeting a week earlier, on the third Sunday, instead of the fourth, because Republic Day falls on the following Sunday. I wish all the countrymen a Happy Republic Day in advance”, he said.
“This year’s Republic Day is particularly significant as it marks the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic. This year also marks 75 years since the Constitution came into force. I salute all the great personalities of the Constituent Assembly who gave us our sacred Constitution,” the PM added.  
Speaking about the Constituent Assembly, PM Modi mentioned the various topics discussed and played clips of the famous personalities, including Babasaheb Ambedkar, the first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee.

Title: PM Modi, President Biden raised US-India partnership to new heights: Eric Garcetti
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:25:16 +0000
Content: US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, on Sunday highlighted that US-India relations have reached new heights, thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden.
During a visit to India with his family, Garcetti met with PM Modi and acknowledged that the two leaders had achieved record-breaking milestones in various areas, including visas, trade, defense collaboration, space cooperation, student exchanges, and investments.
In a post on X, Garcetti said, “Had a great final visit with PM Modi with my family. It’s clear that he and President Biden have raised our compelling and consequential US-India partnership to new heights—record visas, record trade, record defense collaboration, record space cooperation, record students, record investments, and so much more.”
Garcetti expressed his gratitude to PM Modi and the people of India for their warm hospitality during his final visit to the country. He emphasized that the US-India partnership has become indispensable and will continue to grow stronger in the coming years.
“What was seen as unthinkable a generation ago will seem indispensable a generation from now, thanks to the work of these leaders and the people of our nations. Thank you, Prime Minister, and thank you to all Indians. It’s been a daily joy to help co-write this chapter with you,” he added.
While attending the inauguration ceremony of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru on Friday, Garcetti noted that it was not the beginning of a new US presence in India, but rather an expansion of the existing one.
“We are not beginning a new presence here in Karnataka; we are expanding our existing presence here, a commitment America makes to this great state and city in this amazing nation as well. And thank you to all of our honorable dignitaries,” he said.
The US Ambassador also reflected on the rich history of US-India relations, dating back to 1776 when the US opened its second-ever consulate in Kolkata, India. He noted that the recent inauguration of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru marks an expansion of US presence in India, rather than a new beginning.
“We’ve been talking about this for a long time, right? We started together to make sure this beginning plants a seed that will flower for decades to come. Our relationship with India is not new. Many Americans don’t know, and very few Indians know, that our second consulate in the world was here in India. The first, after the independence of a new America in 1776, was in Lyon, France, and then the second was in Kolkata, showing back then the importance of India to a new American nation. Since then, we have grown to five posts, seven if you count our commercial offices, including here and in Ahmedabad”, Garcett said.
“This is now the second-largest US mission in the world. It produces the second-most visas and the most students. We’re breaking records every single year—record employees, record visas, record students, record military exercises, record engagement from the seabed to space,” he added.

Title: Startup India Mission marks nine years of growth and innovation
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:16:11 +0000
Content: On the ninth anniversary of the Startup India mission, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, highlighted the significant role the initiative continues to play in driving India’s economic growth. The minister emphasized that much of the success of the Startup India mission can be attributed to key funding mechanisms, particularly the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS).
Administered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and financed by the Government of India, this initiative has been pivotal in mobilizing private capital, with a particular focus on supporting startups in Tier II and Tier III cities. Through this approach, the government has empowered startups to scale their operations and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s economy.
Goyal highlighted the transformative power of these funding tools, noting how they have empowered startups to scale their operations and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy. He also emphasized the importance of private funding in fueling the next phase of India’s startup movement. “The Startup movement will gain momentum with more private funding in the days to come,” he added. During the event, the Minister launched the Bharat Startup Grand Challenge and the Prabhaav Factbook.
The minister also spoke about the pivotal role of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) in driving innovation and accelerating the growth of Indian startups. “Our collaboration with PE and VC firms has been instrumental in supporting innovation and accelerating the journey of startups from ideation to execution,” Goyal stated.
He explained that this partnership not only provides funding but also introduces global expertise and networks that help Indian startups compete internationally. Through initiatives like the BHASKAR platform, the government is connecting startups with mentorship, financial instruments, and opportunities for collaboration across the country.
Beyond their economic impact, startups have emerged as agents of change, addressing some of the most pressing challenges, including sustainability, renewable energy, healthcare, and digital transformation. “Through their innovation and resilience, they are shaping a better future for all of us,” Goyal said.
India’s startup ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with 76 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in 2024 alone. The country now ranks as the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, with 1,59,157 startups as of January 15, 2025—up from around 500 in 2016. These startups have generated 17.2 lakh direct jobs and received total funding of Rs 13 trillion from the government.
The commerce minister emphasized the government’s continued commitment to supporting the startup ecosystem, noting the expansion of technological sectors ranging from digitech to artificial intelligence. “I would like to reaffirm the Government’s unwavering commitment to the faster growth of India’s startup ecosystem and to provide support to the entrepreneurial spirit of India,” he said. Goyal credited policy-driven initiatives for positioning India as a global leader in innovation and technology-driven growth.
Looking ahead, the minister said that India is entering a crucial phase in its development, with strong macroeconomic fundamentals setting the stage for the next 25 years. “Our startups will play a crucial role in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, inclusive, and globally competitive India,” he added. The government is committed to providing all necessary support, including policy initiatives, infrastructure, and access to capital.
The commerce minister also noted India’s leadership in producing STEM graduates, with women constituting 43% of graduates. “Women are at the heart of India’s growth story,” he emphasized, pointing to targeted initiatives like the Women Entrepreneurship Platform that empower women-led startups.
The event also served as the curtain raiser for the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, set to begin in April. Goyal announced that 2,500 startups would participate in this event, highlighting India’s growing role as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.
In addition, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) launched the PRABHAAV Factbook, a comprehensive guide to India’s startup ecosystem and its growth from 2016 to 2024. The Factbook captures the achievements of every region in India, showcasing the dynamic growth story of the country’s startup sector.
The Bharat Startup Grand Challenge was also unveiled, aiming to unleash 75 challenges across various sectors. Industry leaders and innovators will invite thinkers to solve business challenges in areas such as renewable energy, blockchain, agritech, and smart manufacturing. The challenge will provide startups with procurement opportunities, cash prizes, funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.

Title: Saif Ali Khan attacker arrested after three days, cops suspect he is illegal Bangladeshi
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 06:07:45 +0000
Content: Mumbai Police have arrested a man accused of stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra West residence in the early hours of January 16. The suspect, identified as Mohammad Alian, was apprehended in Thane on Sunday and confessed to entering the actor’s home and carrying out the attack.
The cops suspect that Alian is a Bangladeshi and changed his name after entering India illegally.
“There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the accused is a Bangladeshi. He does not have valid Indian documents. Some items seized indicate that he is a Bangladeshi national,” Dixit Gedam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said during a press conference.
The suspect, reportedly employed as a waiter at a pub in Thane, was located at a labour camp near a metro construction site in Hiranandani Estate.
The accused will be produced before the court, DCP Gedam said, adding, “We will seek police custody. We doubt that the accused is of Bangladeshi origin and thus, we have invoked relevant sections of the Passport Act as well.”
Saif Ali Khan was stabbed multiple times in his Bandra apartment during the early hours of Thursday.
The actor sustained severe injuries, including stab wounds to his thoracic spine, and was immediately rushed to Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital for treatment.
Hospital authorities have confirmed that he is recovering well and has been shifted from the ICU to a normal room.

Title: India to grow at 6.7% for next two years: World Bank
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 05:09:22 +0000
Content: India is projected to sustain its position as the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of 6.7% in both FY26 and FY27, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, outpacing a global growth projection of 2.7% for 2025-26.
The GEP report attributes India’s robust growth to a thriving services sector and a revitalized manufacturing base, driven by transformative government initiatives. From modernizing infrastructure to streamlining taxes, these measures are fueling domestic growth while positioning India as a cornerstone of global economic stability. As China’s growth slows to 4% next year, India’s ascent represents not just an economic milestone but a powerful narrative of innovation, ambition, and unmatched potential.
Complementing the World Bank’s insights, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts a similarly strong trajectory for India, with growth projected at 6.5% for both 2025 and 2026. These consistent predictions underline the nation’s stable economic fundamentals and its ability to navigate global uncertainties effectively. Together, the World Bank and IMF projections underscore India’s growing prominence as a key driver of global economic growth.
The GEP report is a flagship publication of the World Bank that examines global economic trends and challenges, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. The January 2025 edition marks a milestone, providing a comprehensive review of these economies’ progress since 2000 and their prospects for the next quarter-century.
India’s growth story stands out prominently in the report. Key findings include a stable annual growth rate of 6.7% for FY26 and FY27, robust performance in the services sector, and strengthening manufacturing activity supported by government efforts to enhance logistics and tax reforms. Private consumption is set to increase due to a stronger labor market, improved access to credit, and lower inflation, while investment growth remains robust, buoyed by rising private investments, better corporate balance sheets, and favorable financing conditions.
Globally, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) now account for 45% of global GDP, up from 25% at the start of the century. India, alongside China and Brazil, has collectively driven approximately 60% of annual global growth since 2000, emphasizing the transformative role of these economies.
India’s impressive economic performance is underpinned by visionary government schemes. Infrastructure projects like the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and initiatives like Startup India and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme are transforming key sectors. These reforms are fostering innovation, enhancing manufacturing capabilities, and promoting financial inclusion, reflecting India’s commitment to building a resilient and globally competitive economy.
India’s economic trajectory highlights its commitment to inclusive growth and innovation-driven development. With forward-thinking policies, a robust infrastructure, and digital transformation, the nation is redefining its global standing.
As the fastest-growing large economy, with consistent growth projected at 6.7% over the next two fiscal years, India continues to outpace its global peers. By fostering entrepreneurship, enhancing manufacturing, and streamlining governance, India is setting an example of resilience and strategic progress.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:53:49 +0000
Content: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.”
Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday.
“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.”
TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.
Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.
The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.
“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement.
The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.
