Title: Australian Open: Rohan Bopanna-Zhang Shuai storm into mixed doubles quarter-finals
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:08:59 +0000
Content: The mixed doubles pair of Rohan Bopanna (India) and Zhang Shuai (China) advanced to the quarter-finals of the ongoing Australian Open 2025 after receiving a walkover against fourth seeds Taylor Townsend (USA) and Hugo Nys (Monaco) in the second round on Sunday.
Zhang Shuai, a two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 2, teamed up with Rohan Bopanna to reach the final eight. The Indo-Chinese pair will face the winners of the match between Australia’s Olivia Gadecki and John Peers and Hungary’s Timea Babos with El Salvador’s Marcelo Arevalo.
In the first round, Bopanna and Zhang defeated France’s Kristina Mladenovic and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig 6-4, 6-4 at the season’s first tennis Grand Slam.
In the men’s doubles event, Rohan Bopanna partnered with Colombian Nicolas Barrientos. However, the Indo-Colombian duo lost in the opening round, falling 7-5, 7(7)-6(5) to Spain’s Pedro Martinez and Jaume Munar.
Last year, Bopanna became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam title in the Open Era when he secured the Australian Open men’s doubles crown with Matthew Ebden. However, the pair split at the end of 2024, and neither Bopanna nor Ebden progressed beyond the first round in this year’s men’s doubles event.
Bopanna’s campaign in mixed doubles remains India’s final challenge at the Australian Open 2025. Other Indian players faced early exits: Yuki Bhambri and his French partner Albano Olivetti, along with Rithvik Bollipalli and Ryan Seggerman (USA), were eliminated in the first round of the men’s doubles.
Meanwhile, N Sriram Balaji and his Mexican partner Miguel Angel Reyes-Varela crashed out in the second round. In singles action, Sumit Nagal was ousted in the first round after a loss to Czechia’s Tomas Machac.

Title: PM Modi urges citizens to exercise their “right to vote,” hails ECI for strengthening the voting process
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 08:48:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged citizens to exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become active participants in the country’s democratic process.  
Addressing the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2025, PM Modi highlighted that January 25, celebrated as ‘National Voters’ Day,’ is an important day as it marks the establishment of the Election Commission of India.  
Lauding the Election Commission, the PM said it has modernized and strengthened the voting process, empowering the people.
PM Modi said, “25 January is National Voters’ Day. This day is important because the ‘Election Commission of India’ was established on this day… The Election Commission has been given a very important place in the Constitution, as have people’s participation in democracy. Some were doubtful about the survival of the country’s democracy, but India has proven all such apprehensions wrong – after all, India is the Mother of Democracy. Over the decades, the country’s democracy has strengthened and prospered.”  
“I would also like to thank the Election Commission, which has, from time to time, modernized and strengthened our voting process. The Commission has harnessed the power of technology to empower the people. I congratulate the Election Commission for its commitment to fair elections. I urge the citizens to always exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become a part of the democratic process, thereby strengthening it,” he added.  
As the nation prepares for the Republic Day celebrations, PM Modi said that this year’s ‘Republic Day’ is very special and extended advance greetings to the countrymen. 
“Today marks the first Mann Ki Baat of 2025. You may have noticed that Mann Ki Baat usually takes place on the last Sunday of the month, but this time we are meeting a week earlier, on the third Sunday, instead of the fourth, because Republic Day falls on the following Sunday. I wish all the countrymen a Happy Republic Day in advance”, he said.
“This year’s Republic Day is particularly significant as it marks the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic. This year also marks 75 years since the Constitution came into force. I salute all the great personalities of the Constituent Assembly who gave us our sacred Constitution,” the PM added.  
Speaking about the Constituent Assembly, PM Modi mentioned the various topics discussed and played clips of the famous personalities, including Babasaheb Ambedkar, the first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee.

Highlighting aspects from the clips, he said, “Babasaheb emphasized that the Constituent Assembly should remain united and work together for the welfare of all. Dr. Rajendra Prasad spoke about the commitment to human values, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee discussed the importance of equal opportunities. I hope you enjoyed listening to these audio clips’ the prime minister said.

Title: PM Modi, President Biden raised US-India partnership to new heights: Eric Garcetti
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:25:16 +0000
Content: US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, on Sunday highlighted that US-India relations have reached new heights, thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden.
During a visit to India with his family, Garcetti met with PM Modi and acknowledged that the two leaders had achieved record-breaking milestones in various areas, including visas, trade, defense collaboration, space cooperation, student exchanges, and investments.
In a post on X, Garcetti said, “Had a great final visit with PM Modi with my family. It’s clear that he and President Biden have raised our compelling and consequential US-India partnership to new heights—record visas, record trade, record defense collaboration, record space cooperation, record students, record investments, and so much more.”
Garcetti expressed his gratitude to PM Modi and the people of India for their warm hospitality during his final visit to the country. He emphasized that the US-India partnership has become indispensable and will continue to grow stronger in the coming years.
“What was seen as unthinkable a generation ago will seem indispensable a generation from now, thanks to the work of these leaders and the people of our nations. Thank you, Prime Minister, and thank you to all Indians. It’s been a daily joy to help co-write this chapter with you,” he added.
While attending the inauguration ceremony of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru on Friday, Garcetti noted that it was not the beginning of a new US presence in India, but rather an expansion of the existing one.
“We are not beginning a new presence here in Karnataka; we are expanding our existing presence here, a commitment America makes to this great state and city in this amazing nation as well. And thank you to all of our honorable dignitaries,” he said.
The US Ambassador also reflected on the rich history of US-India relations, dating back to 1776 when the US opened its second-ever consulate in Kolkata, India. He noted that the recent inauguration of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru marks an expansion of US presence in India, rather than a new beginning.
“We’ve been talking about this for a long time, right? We started together to make sure this beginning plants a seed that will flower for decades to come. Our relationship with India is not new. Many Americans don’t know, and very few Indians know, that our second consulate in the world was here in India. The first, after the independence of a new America in 1776, was in Lyon, France, and then the second was in Kolkata, showing back then the importance of India to a new American nation. Since then, we have grown to five posts, seven if you count our commercial offices, including here and in Ahmedabad”, Garcett said.
“This is now the second-largest US mission in the world. It produces the second-most visas and the most students. We’re breaking records every single year—record employees, record visas, record students, record military exercises, record engagement from the seabed to space,” he added.

Title: Startup India Mission marks nine years of growth and innovation
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:16:11 +0000
Content: On the ninth anniversary of the Startup India mission, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, highlighted the significant role the initiative continues to play in driving India’s economic growth. The minister emphasized that much of the success of the Startup India mission can be attributed to key funding mechanisms, particularly the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS).
Administered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and financed by the Government of India, this initiative has been pivotal in mobilizing private capital, with a particular focus on supporting startups in Tier II and Tier III cities. Through this approach, the government has empowered startups to scale their operations and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s economy.
Goyal highlighted the transformative power of these funding tools, noting how they have empowered startups to scale their operations and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy. He also emphasized the importance of private funding in fueling the next phase of India’s startup movement. “The Startup movement will gain momentum with more private funding in the days to come,” he added. During the event, the Minister launched the Bharat Startup Grand Challenge and the Prabhaav Factbook.
The minister also spoke about the pivotal role of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) in driving innovation and accelerating the growth of Indian startups. “Our collaboration with PE and VC firms has been instrumental in supporting innovation and accelerating the journey of startups from ideation to execution,” Goyal stated.
He explained that this partnership not only provides funding but also introduces global expertise and networks that help Indian startups compete internationally. Through initiatives like the BHASKAR platform, the government is connecting startups with mentorship, financial instruments, and opportunities for collaboration across the country.
Beyond their economic impact, startups have emerged as agents of change, addressing some of the most pressing challenges, including sustainability, renewable energy, healthcare, and digital transformation. “Through their innovation and resilience, they are shaping a better future for all of us,” Goyal said.
India’s startup ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with 76 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in 2024 alone. The country now ranks as the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, with 1,59,157 startups as of January 15, 2025—up from around 500 in 2016. These startups have generated 17.2 lakh direct jobs and received total funding of Rs 13 trillion from the government.
The commerce minister emphasized the government’s continued commitment to supporting the startup ecosystem, noting the expansion of technological sectors ranging from digitech to artificial intelligence. “I would like to reaffirm the Government’s unwavering commitment to the faster growth of India’s startup ecosystem and to provide support to the entrepreneurial spirit of India,” he said. Goyal credited policy-driven initiatives for positioning India as a global leader in innovation and technology-driven growth.
Looking ahead, the minister said that India is entering a crucial phase in its development, with strong macroeconomic fundamentals setting the stage for the next 25 years. “Our startups will play a crucial role in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, inclusive, and globally competitive India,” he added. The government is committed to providing all necessary support, including policy initiatives, infrastructure, and access to capital.
The commerce minister also noted India’s leadership in producing STEM graduates, with women constituting 43% of graduates. “Women are at the heart of India’s growth story,” he emphasized, pointing to targeted initiatives like the Women Entrepreneurship Platform that empower women-led startups.
The event also served as the curtain raiser for the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, set to begin in April. Goyal announced that 2,500 startups would participate in this event, highlighting India’s growing role as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.
In addition, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) launched the PRABHAAV Factbook, a comprehensive guide to India’s startup ecosystem and its growth from 2016 to 2024. The Factbook captures the achievements of every region in India, showcasing the dynamic growth story of the country’s startup sector.
The Bharat Startup Grand Challenge was also unveiled, aiming to unleash 75 challenges across various sectors. Industry leaders and innovators will invite thinkers to solve business challenges in areas such as renewable energy, blockchain, agritech, and smart manufacturing. The challenge will provide startups with procurement opportunities, cash prizes, funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.

Before his departure, Vaishnaw emphasized India’s remarkable progress in ensuring equitable opportunities for all, particularly for marginalized communities.
India’s Model of Inclusive Growth
Before his departure for the prestigious global event, Vaishnaw outlined India’s impressive strides in ensuring development for all sections of society, with a particular focus on those who have historically been excluded from progress. He pointed out that Prime Minister Modi’s focus on inclusive development has brought about transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid.
“The Prime Minister of India has focused on inclusive development that brings transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid. From financial inclusion through bank accounts to providing essential services like toilets, gas connections, tap water, and improving infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, this is something which the world wants to understand,” the railway minister said .
Vaishnaw also highlighted that the WEF discussions will delve into inclusive growth, emphasizing investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure, as well as the democratization of technology. These themes are at the core of India’s development agenda, which aims to provide equitable opportunities to all.
India’s Digital Revolution in the Global Spotlight
In addition to highlighting India’s inclusive growth initiatives, Vaishnaw emphasized the global interest in the country’s remarkable digital transformation. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, India has embarked on an ambitious digital journey that has garnered significant attention worldwide.
“The world is keen to understand India’s economic policies, the digital transformation brought about by the Digital India programme, and the way technology has been democratized to empower citizens across all strata of society,” he said.
India’s innovative digital infrastructure, developed through the Digital India initiative, is now considered a global benchmark for leveraging technology to drive inclusive development. The initiative has made a profound impact by enhancing connectivity, improving access to services, and creating a more transparent and efficient public service delivery system. These advancements are expected to be a key area of focus during the discussions at the World Economic Forum.

Title: Saif Ali Khan attacker arrested after three days, cops suspect he is illegal Bangladeshi
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 06:07:45 +0000
Content: Mumbai Police have arrested a man accused of stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra West residence in the early hours of January 16. The suspect, identified as Mohammad Alian, was apprehended in Thane on Sunday and confessed to entering the actor’s home and carrying out the attack.
The cops suspect that Alian is a Bangladeshi and changed his name after entering India illegally.
“There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the accused is a Bangladeshi. He does not have valid Indian documents. Some items seized indicate that he is a Bangladeshi national,” Dixit Gedam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said during a press conference.
The suspect, reportedly employed as a waiter at a pub in Thane, was located at a labour camp near a metro construction site in Hiranandani Estate.
The accused will be produced before the court, DCP Gedam said, adding, “We will seek police custody. We doubt that the accused is of Bangladeshi origin and thus, we have invoked relevant sections of the Passport Act as well.”
Saif Ali Khan was stabbed multiple times in his Bandra apartment during the early hours of Thursday.
The actor sustained severe injuries, including stab wounds to his thoracic spine, and was immediately rushed to Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital for treatment.
Hospital authorities have confirmed that he is recovering well and has been shifted from the ICU to a normal room.

Title: India to grow at 6.7% for next two years: World Bank
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 05:09:22 +0000
Content: India is projected to sustain its position as the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of 6.7% in both FY26 and FY27, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, outpacing a global growth projection of 2.7% for 2025-26.
The GEP report attributes India’s robust growth to a thriving services sector and a revitalized manufacturing base, driven by transformative government initiatives. From modernizing infrastructure to streamlining taxes, these measures are fueling domestic growth while positioning India as a cornerstone of global economic stability. As China’s growth slows to 4% next year, India’s ascent represents not just an economic milestone but a powerful narrative of innovation, ambition, and unmatched potential.
Complementing the World Bank’s insights, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts a similarly strong trajectory for India, with growth projected at 6.5% for both 2025 and 2026. These consistent predictions underline the nation’s stable economic fundamentals and its ability to navigate global uncertainties effectively. Together, the World Bank and IMF projections underscore India’s growing prominence as a key driver of global economic growth.
The GEP report is a flagship publication of the World Bank that examines global economic trends and challenges, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. The January 2025 edition marks a milestone, providing a comprehensive review of these economies’ progress since 2000 and their prospects for the next quarter-century.
India’s growth story stands out prominently in the report. Key findings include a stable annual growth rate of 6.7% for FY26 and FY27, robust performance in the services sector, and strengthening manufacturing activity supported by government efforts to enhance logistics and tax reforms. Private consumption is set to increase due to a stronger labor market, improved access to credit, and lower inflation, while investment growth remains robust, buoyed by rising private investments, better corporate balance sheets, and favorable financing conditions.
Globally, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) now account for 45% of global GDP, up from 25% at the start of the century. India, alongside China and Brazil, has collectively driven approximately 60% of annual global growth since 2000, emphasizing the transformative role of these economies.
India’s impressive economic performance is underpinned by visionary government schemes. Infrastructure projects like the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and initiatives like Startup India and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme are transforming key sectors. These reforms are fostering innovation, enhancing manufacturing capabilities, and promoting financial inclusion, reflecting India’s commitment to building a resilient and globally competitive economy.
India’s economic trajectory highlights its commitment to inclusive growth and innovation-driven development. With forward-thinking policies, a robust infrastructure, and digital transformation, the nation is redefining its global standing.
As the fastest-growing large economy, with consistent growth projected at 6.7% over the next two fiscal years, India continues to outpace its global peers. By fostering entrepreneurship, enhancing manufacturing, and streamlining governance, India is setting an example of resilience and strategic progress.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:53:49 +0000
Content: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.”
Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday.
“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.”
TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.
Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.
The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.
“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement.
The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.

Title: China both hopeful and on edge as Trump returns to White House
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:32:58 +0000
Content: Chinese officials and ordinary people are hopeful but on edge as Donald Trump returns to the White House, eager to avoid a repeat of the bruising trade war that drove a wedge between the economic superpowers during his first term.
Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, in meetings with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other members of the U.S. business community in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration, said he hoped U.S.
companies would “take root” in China and help to stabilise bilateral relations, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
When Trump was last president, he heaped tariffs on more than $300 billion of Chinese imports. In recent months, he has said he would add tariffs of at least 10% on top of what is already imposed on Chinese goods, a move that would hurt China at a time when its economy is struggling to find a firm footing.
At the same time, the U.S. president-elect made the seemingly conciliatory move of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration on Monday. Xi sent Han in his place, a gesture of goodwill given that China was only represented by its ambassador at the previous two U.S. presidential inaugurations.
At their meeting on Sunday, Han told Musk, appointed by Trump to lead a department aimed at creating a more efficient U.S. government, that he “welcomed Tesla TSLA.O and other U.S. companies” to share in the benefits of China’s development and contribute to China-U.S. relations.
The vice president’s meeting with U.S. businesses was chaired by FedEx FDX.N CEO, Rajesh Subramaniam, on the U.S. side, and included the heads of eight U.S. firms from a range of industries including technology, banking and logistics, according to an American executive in the room, who added that the meeting overran its allotted time and was very cordial.
“(Han Zheng) is seen as someone, because of his time in Shanghai, who understands the concerns of the foreign business community, he understands the economy,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters in Beijing.
“It’s a nice fig leaf, or whatever you want to call it, so that’s positive.”
Xi and Trump were upbeat after speaking by phone on Friday, with Trump calling it “a very good one” and Xi saying he and Trump both hoped for a positive start to U.S.-China relations.
On Monday, China and Hong Kong stocks rose as their phone call eased some geopolitical concerns. The mainland’s blue-chip CSI300 Index CSI300 climbed 0.9% by the lunch break, adding to the 2.1% gain last week. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index HSI jumped 2.3%, the most in five weeks.
“What I can see is that China’s economy is not very good at the moment, due to the impact of the pandemic, and (the fact that) Trump himself is a crazy, wild person (doesn’t help matters on our side),” said a Beijinger surnamed Wang, 36.
“The pressure still remains quite big (for us).”

Title: Uttarakhand Cabinet approves Uniform Civil Code manual
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:28:29 +0000
Content: A cabinet meeting was held on Monday at the State Secretariat under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, where the cabinet approved the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) manual.
The approval follows a thorough scrutiny by the legislative Department, which had already reviewed the manual.
On UCC, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami Said that our government kept the promises we made before the 2022 elections.
He asserted that the dates of implementation will be announced soon.
“We had promised the people of Uttarakhand in 2022 that we would bring the UCC Bill as soon as our government was formed. We brought it. The draft committee drafted it, it was passed, the President approved it and it became an act. The process of training is also almost complete… After analysing everything, we will announce the dates soon,” Dhami said to media persons after the meeting.
The BJP government introduced the UCC Bill during a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly on February 6 this year and it was passed with a comfortable majority a day later on February 7.
Following the Uttarakhand Assembly, the UCC Bill was passed in February, and President Droupadi Murmu signed it on March 13, paving the way for Uttarakhand to potentially become the first state in India to enact the UCC.
The Uniform Civil Code seeks to establish a set of uniform personal laws that apply to all citizens, regardless of religion, gender, or caste. This would cover aspects such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession.

Foden opened the scoring in the 27th minute before teeing up Mateo Kovacic to double City’s advantage three minutes later, and Foden then added another goal in the 42nd minute to send his side in 3-0 up at the break.
Jeremy Doku netted the fourth with a deflected effort just after halftime before setting up Erling Haaland to score, and substitute James McAtee completed the rout in the 69th minute with a looping header.

Title: Trump plans sweeping executive orders on immigration, energy, and more on first day in office
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:48:44 +0000
Content: Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as U.S. president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration.
Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a “shock and awe” effort.
Transition advisers have been preparing drafts for Trump to choose from. Decisions have yet to be made on which will be released on Monday and which in the days that follow.
Here is what we know about the executive orders so far:
IMMIGRATION
Many of the actions that Trump plans on his first day as president are aimed at ramping up immigration enforcement and following through on his pledge to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
The executive actions would give federal immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and restart construction of the border wall, Reuters reported in November.
Trump is expected to declare illegal immigration a national emergency to unlock military funds for border wall construction. He also signaled in a Truth Social post in November that he would shift military resources to assist with his deportation plans.
“We’re going to make it so if you’re illegal, you’re not coming in through a port of entry or even if you’re trying to come into a port of entry illegally, you’re not going to be allowed in,” Trump adviser Jason Miller told National Public Radio.
Trump also plans to end temporary “parole” programs, which under President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from certain countries to enter legally on humanitarian grounds and access work permits, Reuters reported.
In addition, Trump has vowed to end automatic citizenship for those born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally, and advisers say his team is working on an executive order to this effect.
The U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the post-Civil War period, provides for granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”
Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge.
“We have to end it. It’s ridiculous,” Trump told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December.
ENERGY
Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump’s transition team have said that Trump is considering a suite of executive orders to roll out within days of taking office targeting everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration.
Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows.
Trump’s executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden’s climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules.
TARIFFS
One move that Trump could take on his first day or early in his new administration is to follow through on his threats to increase tariffs on imported goods from America’s biggest trading partners.
Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers.
PARDONS
Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE
Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration’s policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with.
That care can include hormone therapy and surgery.
“On Day One, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care,” Trump said.
TRANSGENDER RIGHTS
Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools.
As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women’s sports.
DIVERSITY PROGRAMS
During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies.
Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office.
Trump has also criticized “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies inside universities.
DRUG CARTELS
Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl.
REQUIRING FEDERAL WORKERS TO RETURN TO THE OFFICE
Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them.
In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.”
By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.

This landmark event is projected to boost commerce not only in Prayagraj but also in neighbouring regions, with key industries such as tourism, transportation and logistics, healthcare, IT, and retail expected to see substantial benefits.

Similarly, the transportation and logistics sector will experience heightened demand for drivers, supply chain managers, courier personnel, and other support staff, creating employment for an estimated three lakh.
Temporary medical camps set up during the event will provide freelance nurses, paramedics, and allied healthcare professionals with opportunities, generating around 1.5 lakh to ensure the safety and well-being of millions of attendees.
“Meanwhile, the IT and technology sector is likely to witness a surge in demand, with two lakh professionals required to manage virtual darshan apps, real-time event update applications, and cybersecurity for seamless digital experiences,” the report mentioned.
Retail businesses catering to the needs of devotees are expected to create approximately one lakh jobs for on-ground sales and customer support staff to meet the demand for religious items, souvenirs, and local products.
Till now, at least 7.72 crore devotees have taken the holy dip at the world’s largest spiritual congregation.

Title: RBI steps to boost liquidity in banking system are smart, pragmatic: SBI
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:02:26 +0000
Content: More changes in the RBI Liquidity Management Framework are likely after the daily dynamic VRR (variable rate repo) has been taken as the first step to manage liquidity in the banking system, according to an SBI research report.
“Such changes and frontloading next round of moves are smart and pragmatic by the RBI…A delicate mix of temporary and permanent liquidity injection and withdrawal remains a work in progress,” the report states.
As a corollary to intervention in the forex markets juxtaposed with volatile movements in government cash balances, liquidity has been shrinking in the banking system and alarmingly blowing past the comfort zone
This persistent liquidity conundrum, along with the anticipation of a rally in DXY has prompted the regulator to revert to daily dynamic VRR to effectively manage the liquidity along the revised LMF (Liquidity Management Framework) in place from February 2020.
Given that such daily VRR transactions are akin to transient liquidity injections, repo transactions should ideally compensate for changes in government cash balances, but this is somehow also substituting for permanent durable liquidity shortfall arising out of currency leakage and liquidity impact of RBI forex intervention, the report observes.
“To negate this, in a smart move RBI has started to sell in Spot and NDF forwards and then doing short-term buy-sell swaps to replace the maturing forward sale position and also to counter the durable liquidity drain from spot intervention. We also think RBI may announce longer term (2-3 years) buy sell swaps to shore up reserves and release liquidity,” according to the SBI report.
In principle, liquidity management still has some operational challenges like improving the market microstructure, a proper indicator of liquidity tightness in the system and most importantly maintaining a delicate balance between an effective mix of durable and transient liquidity injection or withdrawal, the report points out.
According to the report, the system liquidity situation remained tight and turned to injection mode since 16 December 2024, due to many reasons like tax outflows, GST payment, forex market intervention and volatility in capital flows. Further with the implementation of Just in Time (JIT), the system liquidity has been impacted through movements in government cash balances
System liquidity moved from a surplus of Rs 1.35 lakh crore in November to a deficit of Rs 0.65 lakh crore in December, further to Rs 1.58 lakh crore deficit in January (till January 16). If we look at the injection-absorption ratio, which has increased to about 4 X, indicating persistent borrowings from the LAF window, the report added.

Title: ‘We thank President Trump’: TikTok on process of restoring service in US
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:31:54 +0000
Content: Chinese social media app TikTok has expressed gratitude to President-elect Donald Trump for “providing the necessary clarity and assurance” after confirming it is in the process of restoring service in the United States.
This development follows Trump’s pledge to restore access to TikTok, which had ceased functioning in the US on Saturday night to comply with the Biden administration’s ban order.
In a post on X on Sunday, TikTok said, “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”
The post further added, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”
Trump announced on Truth Social that he plans to issue an executive order on Monday to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 90 days.
“I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” he said.
“The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,” he added.
He also outlined a proposal for the US to hold a 50% ownership stake in a joint venture involving TikTok.
“I would like the US to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands, and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars—maybe trillions,” he said.
“Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners, whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase we so choose,” he added.
TikTok went offline in the US on Saturday night (local time), just hours before a law banning the app was set to take effect, CNN reported.
Users who tried to access the platform were met with a message stating, “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”
The ban follows a Supreme Court ruling on Friday that upheld a law passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by US President Joe Biden in April.

Title: Kho Kho World Cup: India clinches historic double victory in men’s and women’s titles; PM Modi congratulates teams
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:05:34 +0000
Content: The inaugural Kho Kho World Cup in New Delhi ended on a historic note as India secured both the men’s and women’s titles in thrilling fashion. In a masterful display of speed, strategy, and skill, the Indian women’s kho kho team claimed the 2025 title at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Sunday night, defeating Nepal 78-40. Meanwhile, the men’s team followed suit with a 54-36 victory over Nepal in their final.
The Indian women dominated from the outset, with skipper Priyanka Ingle leading by example. In Turn 1, the Women in Blue racked up 34 points, effectively neutralizing the Nepalese team. Despite a brief comeback attempt by Nepal in Turn 2, led by Dipa BK, India held firm. In Turn 4, Chaithra B orchestrated a Dream Run, extending India’s lead to 78 points and sealing the historic victory.
India’s path to the title included commanding wins over South Korea, Iran, and Malaysia in the group stages, followed by triumphs against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals and South Africa in the semi-finals. This victory not only crowned India as the first-ever Kho Kho World Cup champions but also spotlighted the sport’s growing global appeal.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the women’s team, emphasizing how this triumph brought renewed attention to one of India’s oldest traditional sports. “Their unparalleled skill, determination, and teamwork have inspired countless young athletes across the nation,” he tweeted.
The men’s final saw a similarly dominant performance. Led by captain Pratik Waikar and standout player Ramji Kashyap, India started strong with a 26-0 lead in Turn 1, thanks to exceptional skydive maneuvers. Though Nepal mounted a spirited comeback, India’s defense, bolstered by Waikar and Sachin Bhargo, proved too strong. The 54-36 win marked the culmination of India’s remarkable journey, which included victories over Brazil, Peru, and Bhutan in the group stages, and knockout wins over Bangladesh and South Africa.
Dignitaries such as former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Supreme Court Judge Pankaj Mithal, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju were present to witness the historic event, further underscoring Kho Kho’s rising prominence. This landmark victory, paired with the growing interest in the sport, sets the stage for Kho Kho’s future as a global phenomenon, with aspirations of becoming an Olympic sport.
PM Modi also congratulated the men’s team following their victory. In a post on X, he said: “Today’s a great day for Indian Kho Kho. Incredibly proud of the Indian Men’s Kho Kho team for winning the Kho Kho World Cup title. Their grit and dedication is commendable. This win will contribute to further popularising Kho Kho among the youth.”
India’s double triumph in the inaugural Kho Kho World Cup has not only established them as champions but also brought new recognition to this indigenous game on the international stage.
