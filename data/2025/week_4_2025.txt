Title: Australian Open: Rohan Bopanna-Zhang Shuai storm into mixed doubles quarter-finals
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:08:59 +0000
Content: The mixed doubles pair of Rohan Bopanna (India) and Zhang Shuai (China) advanced to the quarter-finals of the ongoing Australian Open 2025 after receiving a walkover against fourth seeds Taylor Townsend (USA) and Hugo Nys (Monaco) in the second round on Sunday.
Zhang Shuai, a two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 2, teamed up with Rohan Bopanna to reach the final eight. The Indo-Chinese pair will face the winners of the match between Australia’s Olivia Gadecki and John Peers and Hungary’s Timea Babos with El Salvador’s Marcelo Arevalo.
In the first round, Bopanna and Zhang defeated France’s Kristina Mladenovic and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig 6-4, 6-4 at the season’s first tennis Grand Slam.
In the men’s doubles event, Rohan Bopanna partnered with Colombian Nicolas Barrientos. However, the Indo-Colombian duo lost in the opening round, falling 7-5, 7(7)-6(5) to Spain’s Pedro Martinez and Jaume Munar.
Last year, Bopanna became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam title in the Open Era when he secured the Australian Open men’s doubles crown with Matthew Ebden. However, the pair split at the end of 2024, and neither Bopanna nor Ebden progressed beyond the first round in this year’s men’s doubles event.
Bopanna’s campaign in mixed doubles remains India’s final challenge at the Australian Open 2025. Other Indian players faced early exits: Yuki Bhambri and his French partner Albano Olivetti, along with Rithvik Bollipalli and Ryan Seggerman (USA), were eliminated in the first round of the men’s doubles.
Meanwhile, N Sriram Balaji and his Mexican partner Miguel Angel Reyes-Varela crashed out in the second round. In singles action, Sumit Nagal was ousted in the first round after a loss to Czechia’s Tomas Machac.

Title: PM Modi urges citizens to exercise their “right to vote,” hails ECI for strengthening the voting process
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 08:48:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged citizens to exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become active participants in the country’s democratic process.  
Addressing the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2025, PM Modi highlighted that January 25, celebrated as ‘National Voters’ Day,’ is an important day as it marks the establishment of the Election Commission of India.  
Lauding the Election Commission, the PM said it has modernized and strengthened the voting process, empowering the people.
PM Modi said, “25 January is National Voters’ Day. This day is important because the ‘Election Commission of India’ was established on this day… The Election Commission has been given a very important place in the Constitution, as have people’s participation in democracy. Some were doubtful about the survival of the country’s democracy, but India has proven all such apprehensions wrong – after all, India is the Mother of Democracy. Over the decades, the country’s democracy has strengthened and prospered.”  
“I would also like to thank the Election Commission, which has, from time to time, modernized and strengthened our voting process. The Commission has harnessed the power of technology to empower the people. I congratulate the Election Commission for its commitment to fair elections. I urge the citizens to always exercise their right to vote in large numbers and become a part of the democratic process, thereby strengthening it,” he added.  
As the nation prepares for the Republic Day celebrations, PM Modi said that this year’s ‘Republic Day’ is very special and extended advance greetings to the countrymen. 
“Today marks the first Mann Ki Baat of 2025. You may have noticed that Mann Ki Baat usually takes place on the last Sunday of the month, but this time we are meeting a week earlier, on the third Sunday, instead of the fourth, because Republic Day falls on the following Sunday. I wish all the countrymen a Happy Republic Day in advance”, he said.
“This year’s Republic Day is particularly significant as it marks the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic. This year also marks 75 years since the Constitution came into force. I salute all the great personalities of the Constituent Assembly who gave us our sacred Constitution,” the PM added.  
Speaking about the Constituent Assembly, PM Modi mentioned the various topics discussed and played clips of the famous personalities, including Babasaheb Ambedkar, the first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee.

Highlighting aspects from the clips, he said, “Babasaheb emphasized that the Constituent Assembly should remain united and work together for the welfare of all. Dr. Rajendra Prasad spoke about the commitment to human values, and Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee discussed the importance of equal opportunities. I hope you enjoyed listening to these audio clips’ the prime minister said.

Title: PM Modi, President Biden raised US-India partnership to new heights: Eric Garcetti
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:25:16 +0000
Content: US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, on Sunday highlighted that US-India relations have reached new heights, thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden.
During a visit to India with his family, Garcetti met with PM Modi and acknowledged that the two leaders had achieved record-breaking milestones in various areas, including visas, trade, defense collaboration, space cooperation, student exchanges, and investments.
In a post on X, Garcetti said, “Had a great final visit with PM Modi with my family. It’s clear that he and President Biden have raised our compelling and consequential US-India partnership to new heights—record visas, record trade, record defense collaboration, record space cooperation, record students, record investments, and so much more.”
Garcetti expressed his gratitude to PM Modi and the people of India for their warm hospitality during his final visit to the country. He emphasized that the US-India partnership has become indispensable and will continue to grow stronger in the coming years.
“What was seen as unthinkable a generation ago will seem indispensable a generation from now, thanks to the work of these leaders and the people of our nations. Thank you, Prime Minister, and thank you to all Indians. It’s been a daily joy to help co-write this chapter with you,” he added.
While attending the inauguration ceremony of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru on Friday, Garcetti noted that it was not the beginning of a new US presence in India, but rather an expansion of the existing one.
“We are not beginning a new presence here in Karnataka; we are expanding our existing presence here, a commitment America makes to this great state and city in this amazing nation as well. And thank you to all of our honorable dignitaries,” he said.
The US Ambassador also reflected on the rich history of US-India relations, dating back to 1776 when the US opened its second-ever consulate in Kolkata, India. He noted that the recent inauguration of the US Consulate office in Bengaluru marks an expansion of US presence in India, rather than a new beginning.
“We’ve been talking about this for a long time, right? We started together to make sure this beginning plants a seed that will flower for decades to come. Our relationship with India is not new. Many Americans don’t know, and very few Indians know, that our second consulate in the world was here in India. The first, after the independence of a new America in 1776, was in Lyon, France, and then the second was in Kolkata, showing back then the importance of India to a new American nation. Since then, we have grown to five posts, seven if you count our commercial offices, including here and in Ahmedabad”, Garcett said.
“This is now the second-largest US mission in the world. It produces the second-most visas and the most students. We’re breaking records every single year—record employees, record visas, record students, record military exercises, record engagement from the seabed to space,” he added.

Title: Startup India Mission marks nine years of growth and innovation
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:16:11 +0000
Content: On the ninth anniversary of the Startup India mission, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, highlighted the significant role the initiative continues to play in driving India’s economic growth. The minister emphasized that much of the success of the Startup India mission can be attributed to key funding mechanisms, particularly the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS).
Administered by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and financed by the Government of India, this initiative has been pivotal in mobilizing private capital, with a particular focus on supporting startups in Tier II and Tier III cities. Through this approach, the government has empowered startups to scale their operations and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s economy.
Goyal highlighted the transformative power of these funding tools, noting how they have empowered startups to scale their operations and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy. He also emphasized the importance of private funding in fueling the next phase of India’s startup movement. “The Startup movement will gain momentum with more private funding in the days to come,” he added. During the event, the Minister launched the Bharat Startup Grand Challenge and the Prabhaav Factbook.
The minister also spoke about the pivotal role of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) in driving innovation and accelerating the growth of Indian startups. “Our collaboration with PE and VC firms has been instrumental in supporting innovation and accelerating the journey of startups from ideation to execution,” Goyal stated.
He explained that this partnership not only provides funding but also introduces global expertise and networks that help Indian startups compete internationally. Through initiatives like the BHASKAR platform, the government is connecting startups with mentorship, financial instruments, and opportunities for collaboration across the country.
Beyond their economic impact, startups have emerged as agents of change, addressing some of the most pressing challenges, including sustainability, renewable energy, healthcare, and digital transformation. “Through their innovation and resilience, they are shaping a better future for all of us,” Goyal said.
India’s startup ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with 76 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in 2024 alone. The country now ranks as the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, with 1,59,157 startups as of January 15, 2025—up from around 500 in 2016. These startups have generated 17.2 lakh direct jobs and received total funding of Rs 13 trillion from the government.
The commerce minister emphasized the government’s continued commitment to supporting the startup ecosystem, noting the expansion of technological sectors ranging from digitech to artificial intelligence. “I would like to reaffirm the Government’s unwavering commitment to the faster growth of India’s startup ecosystem and to provide support to the entrepreneurial spirit of India,” he said. Goyal credited policy-driven initiatives for positioning India as a global leader in innovation and technology-driven growth.
Looking ahead, the minister said that India is entering a crucial phase in its development, with strong macroeconomic fundamentals setting the stage for the next 25 years. “Our startups will play a crucial role in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, inclusive, and globally competitive India,” he added. The government is committed to providing all necessary support, including policy initiatives, infrastructure, and access to capital.
The commerce minister also noted India’s leadership in producing STEM graduates, with women constituting 43% of graduates. “Women are at the heart of India’s growth story,” he emphasized, pointing to targeted initiatives like the Women Entrepreneurship Platform that empower women-led startups.
The event also served as the curtain raiser for the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, set to begin in April. Goyal announced that 2,500 startups would participate in this event, highlighting India’s growing role as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.
In addition, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) launched the PRABHAAV Factbook, a comprehensive guide to India’s startup ecosystem and its growth from 2016 to 2024. The Factbook captures the achievements of every region in India, showcasing the dynamic growth story of the country’s startup sector.
The Bharat Startup Grand Challenge was also unveiled, aiming to unleash 75 challenges across various sectors. Industry leaders and innovators will invite thinkers to solve business challenges in areas such as renewable energy, blockchain, agritech, and smart manufacturing. The challenge will provide startups with procurement opportunities, cash prizes, funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.

Before his departure, Vaishnaw emphasized India’s remarkable progress in ensuring equitable opportunities for all, particularly for marginalized communities.
India’s Model of Inclusive Growth
Before his departure for the prestigious global event, Vaishnaw outlined India’s impressive strides in ensuring development for all sections of society, with a particular focus on those who have historically been excluded from progress. He pointed out that Prime Minister Modi’s focus on inclusive development has brought about transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid.
“The Prime Minister of India has focused on inclusive development that brings transformative changes in the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid. From financial inclusion through bank accounts to providing essential services like toilets, gas connections, tap water, and improving infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, this is something which the world wants to understand,” the railway minister said .
Vaishnaw also highlighted that the WEF discussions will delve into inclusive growth, emphasizing investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure, as well as the democratization of technology. These themes are at the core of India’s development agenda, which aims to provide equitable opportunities to all.
India’s Digital Revolution in the Global Spotlight
In addition to highlighting India’s inclusive growth initiatives, Vaishnaw emphasized the global interest in the country’s remarkable digital transformation. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, India has embarked on an ambitious digital journey that has garnered significant attention worldwide.
“The world is keen to understand India’s economic policies, the digital transformation brought about by the Digital India programme, and the way technology has been democratized to empower citizens across all strata of society,” he said.
India’s innovative digital infrastructure, developed through the Digital India initiative, is now considered a global benchmark for leveraging technology to drive inclusive development. The initiative has made a profound impact by enhancing connectivity, improving access to services, and creating a more transparent and efficient public service delivery system. These advancements are expected to be a key area of focus during the discussions at the World Economic Forum.

Title: Saif Ali Khan attacker arrested after three days, cops suspect he is illegal Bangladeshi
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 06:07:45 +0000
Content: Mumbai Police have arrested a man accused of stabbing actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra West residence in the early hours of January 16. The suspect, identified as Mohammad Alian, was apprehended in Thane on Sunday and confessed to entering the actor’s home and carrying out the attack.
The cops suspect that Alian is a Bangladeshi and changed his name after entering India illegally.
“There is preliminary evidence to suggest that the accused is a Bangladeshi. He does not have valid Indian documents. Some items seized indicate that he is a Bangladeshi national,” Dixit Gedam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said during a press conference.
The suspect, reportedly employed as a waiter at a pub in Thane, was located at a labour camp near a metro construction site in Hiranandani Estate.
The accused will be produced before the court, DCP Gedam said, adding, “We will seek police custody. We doubt that the accused is of Bangladeshi origin and thus, we have invoked relevant sections of the Passport Act as well.”
Saif Ali Khan was stabbed multiple times in his Bandra apartment during the early hours of Thursday.
The actor sustained severe injuries, including stab wounds to his thoracic spine, and was immediately rushed to Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital for treatment.
Hospital authorities have confirmed that he is recovering well and has been shifted from the ICU to a normal room.

Title: India to grow at 6.7% for next two years: World Bank
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 05:09:22 +0000
Content: India is projected to sustain its position as the fastest-growing major economy, with a growth rate of 6.7% in both FY26 and FY27, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, outpacing a global growth projection of 2.7% for 2025-26.
The GEP report attributes India’s robust growth to a thriving services sector and a revitalized manufacturing base, driven by transformative government initiatives. From modernizing infrastructure to streamlining taxes, these measures are fueling domestic growth while positioning India as a cornerstone of global economic stability. As China’s growth slows to 4% next year, India’s ascent represents not just an economic milestone but a powerful narrative of innovation, ambition, and unmatched potential.
Complementing the World Bank’s insights, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts a similarly strong trajectory for India, with growth projected at 6.5% for both 2025 and 2026. These consistent predictions underline the nation’s stable economic fundamentals and its ability to navigate global uncertainties effectively. Together, the World Bank and IMF projections underscore India’s growing prominence as a key driver of global economic growth.
The GEP report is a flagship publication of the World Bank that examines global economic trends and challenges, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. The January 2025 edition marks a milestone, providing a comprehensive review of these economies’ progress since 2000 and their prospects for the next quarter-century.
India’s growth story stands out prominently in the report. Key findings include a stable annual growth rate of 6.7% for FY26 and FY27, robust performance in the services sector, and strengthening manufacturing activity supported by government efforts to enhance logistics and tax reforms. Private consumption is set to increase due to a stronger labor market, improved access to credit, and lower inflation, while investment growth remains robust, buoyed by rising private investments, better corporate balance sheets, and favorable financing conditions.
Globally, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) now account for 45% of global GDP, up from 25% at the start of the century. India, alongside China and Brazil, has collectively driven approximately 60% of annual global growth since 2000, emphasizing the transformative role of these economies.
India’s impressive economic performance is underpinned by visionary government schemes. Infrastructure projects like the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and initiatives like Startup India and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme are transforming key sectors. These reforms are fostering innovation, enhancing manufacturing capabilities, and promoting financial inclusion, reflecting India’s commitment to building a resilient and globally competitive economy.
India’s economic trajectory highlights its commitment to inclusive growth and innovation-driven development. With forward-thinking policies, a robust infrastructure, and digital transformation, the nation is redefining its global standing.
As the fastest-growing large economy, with consistent growth projected at 6.7% over the next two fiscal years, India continues to outpace its global peers. By fostering entrepreneurship, enhancing manufacturing, and streamlining governance, India is setting an example of resilience and strategic progress.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
Publication Date: Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:53:49 +0000
Content: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.”
Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday.
“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.”
TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.
Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.
The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.
“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement.
The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.

Title: China both hopeful and on edge as Trump returns to White House
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:32:58 +0000
Content: Chinese officials and ordinary people are hopeful but on edge as Donald Trump returns to the White House, eager to avoid a repeat of the bruising trade war that drove a wedge between the economic superpowers during his first term.
Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, in meetings with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other members of the U.S. business community in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration, said he hoped U.S.
companies would “take root” in China and help to stabilise bilateral relations, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
When Trump was last president, he heaped tariffs on more than $300 billion of Chinese imports. In recent months, he has said he would add tariffs of at least 10% on top of what is already imposed on Chinese goods, a move that would hurt China at a time when its economy is struggling to find a firm footing.
At the same time, the U.S. president-elect made the seemingly conciliatory move of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration on Monday. Xi sent Han in his place, a gesture of goodwill given that China was only represented by its ambassador at the previous two U.S. presidential inaugurations.
At their meeting on Sunday, Han told Musk, appointed by Trump to lead a department aimed at creating a more efficient U.S. government, that he “welcomed Tesla TSLA.O and other U.S. companies” to share in the benefits of China’s development and contribute to China-U.S. relations.
The vice president’s meeting with U.S. businesses was chaired by FedEx FDX.N CEO, Rajesh Subramaniam, on the U.S. side, and included the heads of eight U.S. firms from a range of industries including technology, banking and logistics, according to an American executive in the room, who added that the meeting overran its allotted time and was very cordial.
“(Han Zheng) is seen as someone, because of his time in Shanghai, who understands the concerns of the foreign business community, he understands the economy,” Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters in Beijing.
“It’s a nice fig leaf, or whatever you want to call it, so that’s positive.”
Xi and Trump were upbeat after speaking by phone on Friday, with Trump calling it “a very good one” and Xi saying he and Trump both hoped for a positive start to U.S.-China relations.
On Monday, China and Hong Kong stocks rose as their phone call eased some geopolitical concerns. The mainland’s blue-chip CSI300 Index CSI300 climbed 0.9% by the lunch break, adding to the 2.1% gain last week. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index HSI jumped 2.3%, the most in five weeks.
“What I can see is that China’s economy is not very good at the moment, due to the impact of the pandemic, and (the fact that) Trump himself is a crazy, wild person (doesn’t help matters on our side),” said a Beijinger surnamed Wang, 36.
“The pressure still remains quite big (for us).”

Title: Uttarakhand Cabinet approves Uniform Civil Code manual
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 07:28:29 +0000
Content: A cabinet meeting was held on Monday at the State Secretariat under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, where the cabinet approved the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) manual.
The approval follows a thorough scrutiny by the legislative Department, which had already reviewed the manual.
On UCC, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami Said that our government kept the promises we made before the 2022 elections.
He asserted that the dates of implementation will be announced soon.
“We had promised the people of Uttarakhand in 2022 that we would bring the UCC Bill as soon as our government was formed. We brought it. The draft committee drafted it, it was passed, the President approved it and it became an act. The process of training is also almost complete… After analysing everything, we will announce the dates soon,” Dhami said to media persons after the meeting.
The BJP government introduced the UCC Bill during a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly on February 6 this year and it was passed with a comfortable majority a day later on February 7.
Following the Uttarakhand Assembly, the UCC Bill was passed in February, and President Droupadi Murmu signed it on March 13, paving the way for Uttarakhand to potentially become the first state in India to enact the UCC.
The Uniform Civil Code seeks to establish a set of uniform personal laws that apply to all citizens, regardless of religion, gender, or caste. This would cover aspects such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession.

Foden opened the scoring in the 27th minute before teeing up Mateo Kovacic to double City’s advantage three minutes later, and Foden then added another goal in the 42nd minute to send his side in 3-0 up at the break.
Jeremy Doku netted the fourth with a deflected effort just after halftime before setting up Erling Haaland to score, and substitute James McAtee completed the rout in the 69th minute with a looping header.

Title: Trump plans sweeping executive orders on immigration, energy, and more on first day in office
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:48:44 +0000
Content: Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders and directives after he is sworn in as U.S. president on Monday to put his stamp on his new administration on matters ranging from energy to immigration.
Two sources familiar with the planning said more than 100 such orders and directives could be released starting on Day One in what is known internally as a “shock and awe” effort.
Transition advisers have been preparing drafts for Trump to choose from. Decisions have yet to be made on which will be released on Monday and which in the days that follow.
Here is what we know about the executive orders so far:
IMMIGRATION
Many of the actions that Trump plans on his first day as president are aimed at ramping up immigration enforcement and following through on his pledge to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
The executive actions would give federal immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and restart construction of the border wall, Reuters reported in November.
Trump is expected to declare illegal immigration a national emergency to unlock military funds for border wall construction. He also signaled in a Truth Social post in November that he would shift military resources to assist with his deportation plans.
“We’re going to make it so if you’re illegal, you’re not coming in through a port of entry or even if you’re trying to come into a port of entry illegally, you’re not going to be allowed in,” Trump adviser Jason Miller told National Public Radio.
Trump also plans to end temporary “parole” programs, which under President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from certain countries to enter legally on humanitarian grounds and access work permits, Reuters reported.
In addition, Trump has vowed to end automatic citizenship for those born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally, and advisers say his team is working on an executive order to this effect.
The U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the post-Civil War period, provides for granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”
Any move by Trump to end birthright citizenship would face a legal challenge.
“We have to end it. It’s ridiculous,” Trump told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December.
ENERGY
Sources familiar with the plans of members of Trump’s transition team have said that Trump is considering a suite of executive orders to roll out within days of taking office targeting everything from electric vehicles to withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, an action he took in his first administration.
Members of his transition team are recommending sweeping changes to cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking the import of cars, components and battery materials from China, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows.
Trump’s executive orders will also likely seek to roll back Biden’s climate regulations on power plants, end his pause on liquefied natural gas exports, and revoke waivers allowing California and other states to have tighter pollution rules.
TARIFFS
One move that Trump could take on his first day or early in his new administration is to follow through on his threats to increase tariffs on imported goods from America’s biggest trading partners.
Trump believes tariffs would help boost economic growth in the United States, although opponents warn that the costs would likely be passed along to consumers.
PARDONS
Trump has also said he will take action immediately on taking office to issue pardons for some of the hundreds of people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE
Trump said in a campaign video in 2023 that on his first day in office he would revoke the Biden administration’s policies that provide information and resources to those seeking medical care so they can align their bodies with the gender they identify with.
That care can include hormone therapy and surgery.
“On Day One, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called gender-affirming care,” Trump said.
TRANSGENDER RIGHTS
Trump has vowed to sign an executive order ending transgender rights in the U.S. military and inside U.S. schools.
As for transgender athletes, he told a rally on Sunday that he would act on his first day to stop the participation of trans athletes in women’s sports.
DIVERSITY PROGRAMS
During his first term, Trump signed an executive order to curtail efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace, through programs including diversity training inside companies.
Biden reversed that executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, and Trump is likely to reinstate his original order early in his second term, and perhaps on his first day in office.
Trump has also criticized “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies inside universities.
DRUG CARTELS
Trump plans to classify drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an early executive order, Punchbowl News reported on Sunday, fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail to crack down on the sources of the lethal opioid fentanyl.
REQUIRING FEDERAL WORKERS TO RETURN TO THE OFFICE
Trump has railed against work-from-home arrangements for tens of thousands of federal employees, which were greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has vowed to end them.
In December, Trump said if federal workers refuse to return to the office, “they’re going to be dismissed.”
By forcing government workers back into the office Trump and his allies hope it could trigger large-scale resignations, which would assist in their goal of reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.

Title: Maha Kumbh 2025 to generate 12 lakh gig and temporary jobs, benefit over 8 lakh workers
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:33:28 +0000
Content: The 45-day Maha Kumbh 2025 is anticipated to generate an estimated 1.2 million (12 lakh) gig and temporary jobs, benefitting over eight lakh workers across various sectors, according to a report on Monday.
The historic congregation at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a powerhouse for temporary employment and economic growth in the country.
This landmark event is projected to boost commerce not only in Prayagraj but also in neighbouring regions, with key industries such as tourism, transportation and logistics, healthcare, IT, and retail expected to see substantial benefits.
According to the report by NLB Services, a global technology and digital talent solutions provider, beyond its profound spiritual significance, the sacred gathering has transformed into a major driver of economic activity.
The Uttar Pradesh government anticipates welcoming 40 crore devotees, making it one of history’s largest peaceful gatherings.
According to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), the event is expected to generate a staggering Rs 2 lakh crore in economic activity, creating unprecedented opportunities across various sectors.
“The economic ripple effect extends through infrastructure development, event management, security services, local trade, tourism, entertainment, and horticulture, fostering growth in both traditional and modern business segments,” said Sachin Alug, CEO, NLB Services.
The surge in temporary jobs in these diverse sectors is providing a significant boost to both the formal and informal employment sectors.
“In the tourism and hospitality industry, roles such as hotel staff, tour guides, porters, travel consultants, and coordinators are expected to grow substantially, contributing approximately 4.5 lakh to manage the massive influx of visitors,” Alug noted.
Similarly, the transportation and logistics sector will experience heightened demand for drivers, supply chain managers, courier personnel, and other support staff, creating employment for an estimated three lakh.
Temporary medical camps set up during the event will provide freelance nurses, paramedics, and allied healthcare professionals with opportunities, generating around 1.5 lakh to ensure the safety and well-being of millions of attendees.
“Meanwhile, the IT and technology sector is likely to witness a surge in demand, with two lakh professionals required to manage virtual darshan apps, real-time event update applications, and cybersecurity for seamless digital experiences,” the report mentioned.
Retail businesses catering to the needs of devotees are expected to create approximately one lakh jobs for on-ground sales and customer support staff to meet the demand for religious items, souvenirs, and local products.
Till now, at least 7.72 crore devotees have taken the holy dip at the world’s largest spiritual congregation.

Title: RBI steps to boost liquidity in banking system are smart, pragmatic: SBI
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:02:26 +0000
Content: More changes in the RBI Liquidity Management Framework are likely after the daily dynamic VRR (variable rate repo) has been taken as the first step to manage liquidity in the banking system, according to an SBI research report.
“Such changes and frontloading next round of moves are smart and pragmatic by the RBI…A delicate mix of temporary and permanent liquidity injection and withdrawal remains a work in progress,” the report states.
As a corollary to intervention in the forex markets juxtaposed with volatile movements in government cash balances, liquidity has been shrinking in the banking system and alarmingly blowing past the comfort zone
This persistent liquidity conundrum, along with the anticipation of a rally in DXY has prompted the regulator to revert to daily dynamic VRR to effectively manage the liquidity along the revised LMF (Liquidity Management Framework) in place from February 2020.
Given that such daily VRR transactions are akin to transient liquidity injections, repo transactions should ideally compensate for changes in government cash balances, but this is somehow also substituting for permanent durable liquidity shortfall arising out of currency leakage and liquidity impact of RBI forex intervention, the report observes.
“To negate this, in a smart move RBI has started to sell in Spot and NDF forwards and then doing short-term buy-sell swaps to replace the maturing forward sale position and also to counter the durable liquidity drain from spot intervention. We also think RBI may announce longer term (2-3 years) buy sell swaps to shore up reserves and release liquidity,” according to the SBI report.
In principle, liquidity management still has some operational challenges like improving the market microstructure, a proper indicator of liquidity tightness in the system and most importantly maintaining a delicate balance between an effective mix of durable and transient liquidity injection or withdrawal, the report points out.
According to the report, the system liquidity situation remained tight and turned to injection mode since 16 December 2024, due to many reasons like tax outflows, GST payment, forex market intervention and volatility in capital flows. Further with the implementation of Just in Time (JIT), the system liquidity has been impacted through movements in government cash balances
System liquidity moved from a surplus of Rs 1.35 lakh crore in November to a deficit of Rs 0.65 lakh crore in December, further to Rs 1.58 lakh crore deficit in January (till January 16). If we look at the injection-absorption ratio, which has increased to about 4 X, indicating persistent borrowings from the LAF window, the report added.

Title: ‘We thank President Trump’: TikTok on process of restoring service in US
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:31:54 +0000
Content: Chinese social media app TikTok has expressed gratitude to President-elect Donald Trump for “providing the necessary clarity and assurance” after confirming it is in the process of restoring service in the United States.
This development follows Trump’s pledge to restore access to TikTok, which had ceased functioning in the US on Saturday night to comply with the Biden administration’s ban order.
In a post on X on Sunday, TikTok said, “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”
The post further added, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”
Trump announced on Truth Social that he plans to issue an executive order on Monday to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 90 days.
“I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” he said.
“The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,” he added.
He also outlined a proposal for the US to hold a 50% ownership stake in a joint venture involving TikTok.
“I would like the US to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands, and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars—maybe trillions,” he said.
“Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners, whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase we so choose,” he added.
TikTok went offline in the US on Saturday night (local time), just hours before a law banning the app was set to take effect, CNN reported.
Users who tried to access the platform were met with a message stating, “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”
The ban follows a Supreme Court ruling on Friday that upheld a law passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by US President Joe Biden in April.

Title: Kho Kho World Cup: India clinches historic double victory in men’s and women’s titles; PM Modi congratulates teams
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 05:05:34 +0000
Content: The inaugural Kho Kho World Cup in New Delhi ended on a historic note as India secured both the men’s and women’s titles in thrilling fashion. In a masterful display of speed, strategy, and skill, the Indian women’s kho kho team claimed the 2025 title at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Sunday night, defeating Nepal 78-40. Meanwhile, the men’s team followed suit with a 54-36 victory over Nepal in their final.
The Indian women dominated from the outset, with skipper Priyanka Ingle leading by example. In Turn 1, the Women in Blue racked up 34 points, effectively neutralizing the Nepalese team. Despite a brief comeback attempt by Nepal in Turn 2, led by Dipa BK, India held firm. In Turn 4, Chaithra B orchestrated a Dream Run, extending India’s lead to 78 points and sealing the historic victory.
India’s path to the title included commanding wins over South Korea, Iran, and Malaysia in the group stages, followed by triumphs against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals and South Africa in the semi-finals. This victory not only crowned India as the first-ever Kho Kho World Cup champions but also spotlighted the sport’s growing global appeal.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the women’s team, emphasizing how this triumph brought renewed attention to one of India’s oldest traditional sports. “Their unparalleled skill, determination, and teamwork have inspired countless young athletes across the nation,” he tweeted.
The men’s final saw a similarly dominant performance. Led by captain Pratik Waikar and standout player Ramji Kashyap, India started strong with a 26-0 lead in Turn 1, thanks to exceptional skydive maneuvers. Though Nepal mounted a spirited comeback, India’s defense, bolstered by Waikar and Sachin Bhargo, proved too strong. The 54-36 win marked the culmination of India’s remarkable journey, which included victories over Brazil, Peru, and Bhutan in the group stages, and knockout wins over Bangladesh and South Africa.
Dignitaries such as former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Supreme Court Judge Pankaj Mithal, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju were present to witness the historic event, further underscoring Kho Kho’s rising prominence. This landmark victory, paired with the growing interest in the sport, sets the stage for Kho Kho’s future as a global phenomenon, with aspirations of becoming an Olympic sport.
PM Modi also congratulated the men’s team following their victory. In a post on X, he said: “Today’s a great day for Indian Kho Kho. Incredibly proud of the Indian Men’s Kho Kho team for winning the Kho Kho World Cup title. Their grit and dedication is commendable. This win will contribute to further popularising Kho Kho among the youth.”
India’s double triumph in the inaugural Kho Kho World Cup has not only established them as champions but also brought new recognition to this indigenous game on the international stage.

Title: Facebook, X, YouTube to do more against online hate speech, EU says
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 12:44:04 +0000
Content: Meta’s Facebook, Elon Musk’s X, Google’s YouTube and other tech companies have agreed to do more to tackle online hate speech under an updated code of conduct that will now be integrated into EU tech rules, the European Commission said on Monday.
Other signatories to the voluntary code set up in May 2016 are Dailymotion, Instagram, Jeuxvideo.com, LinkedIn, Microsoft hosted consumer services, Snapchat, Rakuten Viber, TikTok and Twitch.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online. I welcome the stakeholders’ commitment to a strengthened Code of conduct under the Digital Services Act (DSA),” EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.
The DSA requires tech companies to do more to combat illegal and harmful content on their platforms. Compliance with the updated code could impact regulators’ enforcement of the Act, EU officials said.
Under the revised code, the companies pledged to allow not-for-profit or public entities with expertise on illegal hate speech to monitor how they review hate speech notices, and to assess at least two thirds of these notices received from them within 24 hours.
The companies will also take measures, such as the use automatic detection tools to reduce hate speech on their platforms, and provide information on the role of recommendation systems and the organic and algorithmic reach of illegal content prior to its removal.
They will present country-level data broken down by the internal classification of hate speech such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.

Title: Bangladesh: Foreign Adviser Touhid departed for China on 5-day state visit

Content: Bangladesh Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain today departed for China on a 5-day state visit aiming to forge a new dimension of Dhaka-Beijing relations. The five-day official visit will focus on lowering interest rates on loans, exchanging hydrological information, advancing medical treatment cooperation, and encouraging greater Chinese involvement in resolving the Myanmar situation, reports Bangladesh Sanghbad Sangstha (BSS).
Touhid is set to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Muhammad Rafiqul Alam told media during the weekly briefing in Dhaka on Thursday.
Earlier on Sunday the Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen briefed the foreign adviser on key issues for the visit. Wen also hinted that Beijing is ready to sign an implementation plan on hydrological information exchange, fulfilling a previous request from Dhaka, reports BSS.
Beyond official talks with the Chinese foreign minister, the adviser is scheduled to meet with Chinese Communist Party leaders and deliver speeches at the China Institute of International Studies and the Shanghai Institute of International Studies, apart from engaging with business representatives in Shanghai to attract Chinese investments in Bangladesh, according to foreign ministry officials, reports BSS.
The adviser’s visit would focus on economic cooperation, commerce and trade expansion and a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis among others, said Rafiqul.
Both the countries were going to celebrate the 50 years of their diplomatic relations this year, he said, adding that although the amount of trade between the two countries stood at $25 billion, it was heavily tilted to China.
He said that the visit would be very crucial since the bilateral relations between China and Bangladesh was already elevated to ‘comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.
Rafiqul said that the adviser would also hold a meeting with a business community of Shanghai for increasing China’s investment in Bangladesh.

Title: US: Melania Trump launches her cryptocurrency
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 12:26:05 +0000
Content: Former US First Lady Melania Trump has introduced her own cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, just days after her husband Donald Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin, CNN reported.
In a social media announcement on Sunday, Melania unveiled her digital currency, writing, “The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now. https://melaniameme.com.” The launch coincided with a dip in the value of Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency, which had been trading strongly since its debut two days earlier.
Meme coins, known for their volatility and lack of intrinsic value, are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet culture. While their prices can fluctuate dramatically, they often gain traction through community engagement and popularity.
Donald Trump, who previously criticized Bitcoin as being “based on thin air,” had embraced meme coins with the release of $TRUMP. In his launch post on Friday, Trump declared, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to http://gettrumpmemes.com — Have Fun!”
Both $TRUMP and $MELANIA are trading on the Solana blockchain. $TRUMP initially saw a surge in value, reaching over USD 70 by Sunday afternoon before falling to USD 40 following Melania’s launch. As of early Monday, $TRUMP had recovered to around USD 60, while $MELANIA was trading at just over USD 12, according to CoinGecko.
The Trump coin has gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency market. With a circulating supply of 200 million coins, its market capitalization is currently capped at USD 13 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the next three years, the total supply of $TRUMP is expected to reach 1 billion coins.
Both cryptocurrencies’ websites emphasize that the coins are meant to represent and engage with their respective brands’ values rather than serve as traditional investment opportunities. They also disclaim any political affiliation. However, 80% of the $TRUMP coin supply is held by Trump Organization-affiliated entities, CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which are bound by a three-year unlocking schedule, restricting them from selling their holdings all at once.
The $TRUMP website promotes the coin as “the only official Trump meme,” branding it as a celebration of a leader who “doesn’t back down, no matter the odds.” Meanwhile, Melania Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency adds a competitive edge to the meme coin market as both coins vie for attention and engagement.
Donald Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency marks a significant shift in his stance. In July 2024, he addressed crypto’s largest convention and appointed Howard Lutnick, a cryptocurrency advocate and supporter of Tether, to lead the US Commerce Department. This move signaled the former president’s growing support for the digital asset sector.

Title: Trump’s second term marks new cryptocurrency era

Content: Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday.
The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy.
Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests.
The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend.
Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump’s inner circle.
SCOTT BESSENT
A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump’s pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto.

“Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do,” Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. “Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin.”
ELON MUSK
The Tesla chief and world’s richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin.
His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble.
The acronym for Musk’s cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world’s seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko.
In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed.
VIVEK RAMASWAMY
Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management.
Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch, opens new tab an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments.
The company’s wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans’ investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release.
In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure.
DAVID SACKS
A former PayPal executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry.
Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows.
STEVE WITKOFF
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November.
World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company’s revenues.
JD VANCE
U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure.
The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy’s asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows.
In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether.
Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump’s sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said – without providing evidence – that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes.
PAUL ATKINS
Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump’s choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler.
Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners, a consultancy. Patomak advises “cutting-edge crypto-native companies” and traditional financial firms on how to “leverage digital assets for growth,” its website says.

Title: Indian stock market ends higher as US gears up for Trump 2.0
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:46:10 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed Monday’s trading session on a positive note, buoyed by solid third-quarter earnings and optimism surrounding US President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration as the 47th President of the United States.
The BSE Sensex climbed 454 points or 0.59%, closing at 77,073.44, while the Nifty 50 advanced by 141.55 points or 0.61% to close at 18,283.90.
Out of the 50 Nifty stocks, 29 ended in the green during the session. On the Sensex, 19 stocks recorded gains. Market analysts attributed the uptrend to positive cues from Asian and European markets, driven by growing anticipation around Trump’s leadership. Banking and telecom sectors were at the forefront of the recovery.
Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities, said, “While the market gains are influenced by sentiment, the prevailing mood is one of caution, with volatility persisting. Domestic investors are primarily focusing on the Union Budget announcement on February 1 and its measures to tackle the ongoing economic slowdown. Trump’s trade policies also add an element of uncertainty.”
Among the top gainers on the Nifty 50 was Kotak Mahindra Bank, which surged 9.35%. Other notable gainers included Wipro, NTPC, Bajaj Finserv, and Bajaj Finance. On the downside, SBI Life emerged as the session’s biggest loser, followed by Tech Mahindra, TCS, HDFC Life, and others.

Experts noted that robust sentiment across Asian markets provided a solid boost to domestic indices, setting the tone for a strong start to the week.

Title: India ranks 7th in global coffee production as exports hit $1.29 billion
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:23:39 +0000
Content: India has emerged as the world’s seventh-largest coffee producer, with exports reaching $1.29 billion in FY 2023-24, almost double the $719.42 million recorded in 2020-21, according to a press release from the Commerce Ministry.
India’s coffee exports have grown significantly due to the increasing global demand for its rich and unique flavors. In the first half of January 2025 India exported over 9,300 tonnes of coffee with top buyers including Italy, Belgium, and Russia. Approximately three-fourths of India’s coffee production consists of Arabica and Robusta beans. These are primarily exported as unroasted beans.
However, there is a growing demand for value-added products like roasted and instant coffee, further fueling the export boom.
Due to rise of cafe culture, higher disposable incomes and a growing preference for coffee over tea, coffee consumption in India is also steadily increasing. This trend has been observed particularly in both urban and rural areas. Domestic consumption has increased from 84,000 tonnes in 2012 to 91,000 tonnes in 2023. This surge reflects a broader shift in drinking habits, as coffee becomes a staple in daily life.
India’s coffee is primarily grown in the ecologically rich Western and Eastern Ghats, areas famous for their biodiversity. Karnataka leads in production, contributing 248,020 million tonnes in 2022-23, followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu. These areas are home to shaded plantations that not only support the coffee industry but also play a vital role in preserving the natural environment, helping to maintain the ecological balance of these biodiversity hotspots.
India’s journey with coffee began centuries ago, when a Sufi saint Baba Budan brought seven Mocha seeds to the hills of Karnataka in the 1600s. His simple act of planting these seeds in the courtyard of his hermitage in Baba Budan Giri unknowingly set in motion the rise of India as one of the world’s prominent coffee producers. Over the centuries, the cultivation of coffee in India has evolved from a humble practice to a thriving industry with the country’s coffee now widely loved across the globe.

Title: Advanced Light Helicopters will not participate in Republic Day flypast: defence secretary
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 11:04:52 +0000
Content: Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh announced on Monday that the Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), indigenously designed and developed, will not participate in this year’s Republic Day flypast following the grounding of the fleet after a recent crash.
“The ALH will not be participating in the parade, but 39 other aircraft will feature in the flypast, showcasing 12 different formations,” Singh stated during a press conference.
The decision comes after a tragic crash of an ALH belonging to the Coast Guard in Porbandar, Gujarat, on January 5, which claimed the lives of three Coast Guard personnel. Following the incident, the armed forces grounded the entire fleet of approximately 330 ALH choppers as a precautionary measure.
Despite this, the Republic Day parade retains its military essence. Singh said. “The military and martial character of the parade is being maintained, but we are also bringing wider societal and cultural participation,” he added.
Preparations for the grand event are in full swing. Rehearsals at Kartavya Path on Monday featured MI-17 V-5 helicopters, Apache attack helicopters, Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher systems, and all-terrain vehicles.
Security measures have also been heightened ahead of the Republic Day celebrations on January 26. The CISF has intensified passenger security checks across Metro stations, leading to potential queues, particularly during peak hours. Passengers are advised to plan their commutes with additional time and cooperate with security personnel.
Amid these preparations, the Indian Army’s Motorcycle Rider Display Team, known as the “Daredevils,” achieved a world record at Kartavya Path on January 20. The team, part of the Corps of Signals, formed the highest human pyramid on moving motorcycles, standing an impressive 20.4 feet tall. The formation, comprising 40 men on 7 motorcycles, covered a distance of 2 kilometers from Vijay Chowk to India Gate.

Title: Sanjay Roy sentenced to life imprisonment in RG Kar rape and murder case
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 10:37:54 +0000
Content: A West Bengal court on Monday sentenced Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on Roy.
The case, which drew widespread public attention, saw the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) pushing for the death penalty. However, the Sealdah court ruled that the crime did not meet the threshold of the “rarest of the rare” and handed down a life sentence instead.
During the proceedings, the court addressed the accused, explaining the charges for which he had been convicted. Despite the charges, Roy maintained his innocence, claiming he had been “falsely implicated” in the crime. “I have not done anything, neither rape nor murder. I am being falsely implicated. You have seen everything. I am innocent. I already told you that I was tortured. They made me sign whatever they wanted,”.
Roy’s defense lawyer argued that even in the rarest of rare cases, there should be room for reformation and rehabilitation, asserting that the prosecution must prove that the accused was beyond reformation. The lawyer called for consideration of reformative measures instead of a more extreme punishment.
On the other hand, the victim’s family’s lawyer demanded the maximum punishment for the accused, calling for the death sentence. The victim’s father, who had consistently fought for justice, expressed his belief that the harshest punishment should be given to the convict. “Our fight will continue on the streets and in the courts,” he said, reiterating his demand for justice.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also spoke out on the case, stating that her government had cooperated with the investigation and always sought justice for the victim. “We have cooperated with the investigation… we had demanded justice, but the judiciary had to run its course, so that’s why it took this much time,” she said before the court hearing on Monday.
The case revolves around the tragic rape and murder of a trainee doctor, whose body was discovered on August 9 in the seminar room of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Roy, a civic volunteer at the hospital, was arrested following the incident. His conviction has sparked widespread protests and calls for justice.
The Sealdah court had previously convicted Roy on Saturday, stating that he had assaulted and murdered the young doctor who had been resting in the seminar room. The court framed sections 64, 66, and 103/1 of the BNS Act against the accused.

Title: Trump outlines sweeping border crackdown, mass deportation push
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 19:59:47 +0000
Content: Newly sworn-in U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he will declare illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a national emergency, send troops there and ramp up deportations of criminal offenders, outlining the crackdown in his inaugural address.
Trump said be would invoke a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act to target foreign gang members in the U.S., a legal authority last used to detain noncitizens of Japanese, German, and Italian descent in internment camps during World War Two.
Shortly after the inauguration, U.S. border authorities said they had shut down outgoing President Joe Biden’s legal entry program known as CBP One that had allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. legally by scheduling an appointment on an app. Existing appointments were canceled, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Trump said he would designate criminal cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, part of a slate of moves that could shake up U.S.-Mexico relations.
Earlier, a Trump official who asked not to be named said the new president plans to issue a sweeping proclamation blocking access to all seeking asylum at the Mexico border. Trump also intends to challenge U.S. citizenship for children born to parents in the U.S. illegally, the official said, a right that stems from an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House after promising to intensify border security and deport record numbers of migrants. While Trump criticized Democrat Biden for high levels of illegal immigration during his presidency, migrant arrests fell dramatically after Biden toughened his policies in June and as Mexico stepped up enforcement.
Republicans say large-scale deportations are necessary after millions of immigrants crossed illegally during Biden’s presidency. There were roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with a temporary status at the start of 2022, according to a U.S. government estimate, a figure that some analysts now place at 13 million to 14 million.
Trump’s critics and immigrant advocates say mass deportations could disrupt businesses, split families and cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have been preparing for possible litigation, a strategy that stymied many of Trump’s hardline policies during his first term. California and other Democratic-led states that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement also could clash with Trump.
The official said Trump would take 10 executive orders and actions on Monday aimed at stepping up border security, calling illegal immigration an “invasion.”
The official said Trump will take steps intended to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal immigration status. That move will almost certainly trigger legal challenges. Trump also plans to suspend the U.S. refugee resettlement program for at least four months and will order a review of security to see if travelers from certain nations should be subject to a travel ban.
Kristi Noem, Trump’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, said at a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Friday that she would end Biden-era legal entry programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S. on a temporary basis.
Trump said in his address that he would reinstate his first-term “remain in Mexico” program, which forced non-Mexico asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for the outcome of the U.S. cases. Biden ended the program in 2021, saying migrants were stuck waiting in squalid conditions.
Mexico’s presidency, foreign ministry, and economy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s plans. In a regular press conference on Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm and insisted her government had to see the details of Trump’s actions before responding.

Title: Usha becomes first Indian-American Second Lady as JD Vance takes oath as US Vice President
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 19:43:48 +0000
Content: Usha Vance became the first Indian-American and Hindu Second Lady after her husband J.D. Vance was sworn in as the 50th Vice President of the US on Monday.
She held the Bible in one hand, and their daughter Mirabel Rose in the other, as Vance placed his left hand on the religious text, and raising his right hand took the oath of office.
President Donald Trump said later that Usha Vance is smarter than her husband and that he might have picked her as the Vice President.
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a mentor to Usha Vance, administered the oath to her husband.
J.D. Vance was sworn in before President Donald Trump took the oath of office.
Before the Vances came to the podium, military personnel in ceremonial uniforms brought their children, Ewan Blaine, 7, Vivek, 4, and Mirabel Rose, 3, to the podium.
The boys wore formal suits, and Usha Vance was dressed in pink.
She beamed and looked admiringly at J.D. Vance as he repeated the oath after Kavanaugh.
J.D. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins who has given up drugs, stood with the family during the ceremony.
Usha Vance is the daughter of Telugu immigrants from India, Radhakrishna “Krish” Chilukuri, an aerospace engineer, and Lakshmi Chilukuri, the provost at the University of California, San Diego.
J.D. Vance and Usha met while they were studying law at Yale University.
J.D. Vance, who came from a broken family with his mother a drug addict, and suffered poverty, credited Usha in his memoir with being his “spirit guide” who helped him navigate the Ivy League university and professional life.
Raised by his grandmother, Vance joined the military to escape the dysfunction of life in Middleton, Ohio, and got his break with admission to Yale, where he said he felt out of place.
He wrote: “In a place that always seemed a little foreign, Usha’s presence made me feel at home.”
They married in 2014.
After briefly practicing law, J.D. Vance turned to business as a venture capitalist.
Entering politics, he was elected to the Senate in 2022.
Usha Vance is a corporate litigator who left a prestigious law firm after he was named the Vice President candidate.
She worked previously as a clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Kavanaugh while he was an appeals court judge.
J.D. Vance also influenced her.
She switched her membership from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.

Title: Will take back Panama Canal & leave Paris climate accord: Trump
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 18:29:22 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump on Monday said he will issue executive orders that will declare a national emergency along the border and all illegal entry will be immediately halted, adding that he will start the process of sending back people who came to the U.S. illegally.
Trump also said he will be ordering troops to secure the border.
The President announced a slew of measures that he said would end American decline and mark the beginning of a golden age. They include a new body to collect tariffs levied on foreign products, renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and starting the process to bring back the Panama Canal under U.S. control.
His office also said in a factsheet that the US will be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, which he had done in the first term as well.
“I will declare a National Emergency at our southern border,” Trump said in his inaugural address of executive orders that will be issued by his administration.
“All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate our Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,” he said.
President Trump also said he would be announcing new tariffs as he had promised and indicated on the campaign trail.
“I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. We are establishing an external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. There will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources, the American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government,” he said.
The President did not specify what tariffs will be levied and on whom.
On foreign policy broadly, he said that as in his first term “we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success, not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.”
“My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” he said.
“That’s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world,” he added.
He added that he would issue an order in a short time to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
He said that the US will take back the Panama Canal. “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty have also been violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” the President said.

Jill Biden and Melania Trump rode together to the Capitol in a separate car as did Kamala Harris and her successor J D Vance.
They had gathered at the White House for a traditional tea ceremony, at which Biden welcomed the incoming President with two words: “Welcome home”, according to media reports.
Guests for the swearing-in had begun arriving at the Capitol Rotunda where the ceremony took place; indoors instead of the traditional venue outside because of frigid conditions. This will be only the second instance of the swearing-in taking place indoors; the last time was in 1985 when President Ronald Reagan took the oath for his second term.
Trump’s return to the White House is also only the second time for an American President to serve two non-consecutive terms. The first was Grover Cleveland at the end of the 19th century.
The swearing-in was attended by Trump’s nominees to the cabinet such as Marco Rubio, for secretary of state, who is expected to be the first to be confirmed, as early as Monday; Robert Kennedy Jr, Doug Burgum, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth and others.
Among the first people high-ranking officials to arrive at the Capitol Rotunda on Monday was Gen. CQ Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who sat on the platform where Trump took his oath. Current and former House and Senate leaders also arrived, including former Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife former Trump Cabinet member Elaine Chao. Former House speakers Kevin McCarthy, John Boehner and Newt Gingrich also took their seats.
According to pool reports, supporters were filling Emancipation Hall at the Capitol, the overflow viewing room in the Capitol Visitor Center, where Trump is expected to speak after the inauguration ceremony. Notable attendees include AI billionaires Sam Altman and Alexandr Wang, YouTube influencers and brothers Logan and Jake Paul, indicted New York Mayor Eric Adams, mixed martial artist and boxer Conor McGregor, comedian and podcaster Theo Von and former race car driver Danica Patrick. House and Senate spouses have also been seated in the overflow space.
Trump started Monday’s inauguration proceedings by attending a private service at St John’s Church with the incoming first lady Melania Trump, Vice-President-elect JD Vance and wife Usha Vance and some members of the cabinet.
No TV cameras were allowed inside but the Trump inauguration team released pictures from inside that showed other attendees including Trump’s sons Barron Trump, Don Trump Jr, Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner.
Also among Trump’s guests were Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla and Space X’s Elon Musk, and Google’s Sundar Pichai. They would go on to also attend the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, former President George W Bush and his wife Laura Bush, and former President Barack Obama minus his wife Michelle Obama attended the oath-taking ceremony as is the tradition, which was broken by President Trump who skipped Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

Title: PM Modi congratulates ‘dear friend’ Trump on his inauguration as 47th US President
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 17:55:51 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated Republican Party member Donald Trump on his return to the White House for a historic second term. Trump took the oath as the 47th President of the US during a programme held at the Capitol Rotunda.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote: “Congratulations my dear friend President @realDonaldTrump on your historic inauguration as the 47th President of the United States! I look forward to working closely together once again, to benefit both our countries and to shape a better future for the world. Best wishes for a successful term ahead.”
Trump was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice John Roberts.
Outgoing President Joe Biden and Trump rode together to the US Capitol for the latter’s oath-taking programme after a traditional tea ceremony at the White House along with their wives, Kamala Harris and her successor J.D. Vance and their spouses.
Jill Biden and Melania Trump rode together to the Capitol in a separate car as did Kamala Harris and her successor J.D. Vance.
This is only the second instance of the swearing-in taking place indoors — the last time was in 1985 when President Ronald Reagan took the oath for his second term.
Earlier, Biden welcomed Trump to the White House for a traditional tea ceremony with two words: “Welcome home”, according to media reports.
Guests for the swearing-in had begun arriving at the Capitol Rotunda where the ceremony took place; indoors instead of the traditional venue outside.

Title: Trump sworn in a second time, vows ‘golden age of America’
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 17:27:12 +0000
Content: Donald Trump vowed to usher in a new era of American greatness, minutes after he was sworn in as president for the second time to complete an extraordinary political comeback following two assassination attempts, a felony conviction and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss.
“The golden age of America begins right now,” he said.
Trump took the oath of office to “preserve, protect and defend” the U.S. Constitution at 12:01 p.m. ET inside the U.S. Capitol, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. His vice president, JD Vance, was sworn in just before him.
Trump intends to sign a raft of executive actions in his first hours as president, incoming White House officials said on Monday, including 10 focused on border security and immigration, his top priority.
The president will declare a national emergency at the southern border, send armed troops there and resume a policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court dates, officials told reporters.
He will also seek to end so-called birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children whose parents lack legal status, a move some legal scholars have said would be unconstitutional.
The inauguration completes a triumphant comeback for a political disruptor who survived two impeachment trials, a felony conviction, two assassination attempts and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss.
The ceremony was moved inside the Capitol due to the extreme cold, four years after a mob of Trump supporters breached the building, a symbol of American democracy, in an unsuccessful effort to forestall Trump’s loss to Joe Biden.
Biden and outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, were on hand inside the Capitol’s Rotunda, along with former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, arrived with her husband Bill, but Obama’s wife, Michelle, chose not to attend.
Numerous tech executives who have sought to curry favor with the incoming administration – including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – had prominent seats on stage, next to cabinet nominees and members of Trump’s family.
Trump, the first U.S. president since the 19th century to win a second term after losing the White House, has said he will pardon “on Day One” many of the more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. He skipped Biden’s inauguration and has continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was rigged.
Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has targeted for retaliation, including former White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, former Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.
Trump will restore the federal death penalty, which Biden had suspended, and require that official U.S. documents such as passports reflect citizens’ gender as assigned at birth, incoming administration officials told reporters.
They said he will also sign an order ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government on Monday, which is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
But Trump will not immediately impose new tariffs on Monday, instead directing federal agencies to evaluate trade relationships with Canada, China and Mexico, a Trump official confirmed, an unexpected development that unleashed a broad slide in the U.S. dollar and a rally in global stock markets on a day when U.S. financial markets are closed.
Some of the executive orders are likely to face legal challenges.
Even as he prepared to retake office, Trump continued to expand his business ventures, raising billions in market value by launching a “meme coin” crypto token over the weekend that prompted ethical and regulatory questions.
Shortly before 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), Trump and incoming first lady Melania Trump arrived at the White House, where Biden and outgoing first lady Jill Biden greeted them with handshakes.
“Welcome home,” Biden said.
DISRUPTIVE FORCE
As he did in 2017, Trump enters office as a chaotic and disruptive force, vowing to remake the federal government and expressing deep skepticism about the U.S.-led alliances that have shaped post-World War Two global politics.
The former president returns to Washington emboldened after winning the national popular vote over Harris by more than 2 million votes thanks to a groundswell of voter frustration over persistent inflation, though he still fell just short of a 50% majority.
In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College – and the presidency – despite receiving nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.
Trump, who surpassed Biden as the oldest president ever to be sworn into office, will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress that have been almost entirely purged of any intra-party dissenters. His advisers have outlined plans to replace nonpartisan bureaucrats with hand-picked loyalists.
Even before taking office, Trump established a rival power center in the weeks after his election victory, meeting world leaders and causing consternation by musing aloud about seizing the Panama Canal, taking control of NATO ally Denmark’s territory of Greenland and imposing tariffs on the biggest U.S. trading partners.
His influence has already been felt in the Israel-Hamas announcement last week of a ceasefire deal. Trump, whose envoy joined the negotiations in Qatar, had warned of “hell to pay” if Hamas did not release its hostages before the inauguration.
Unlike in 2017, when he filled many top jobs with institutionalists, Trump has prioritized fealty over experience in nominating a bevy of controversial cabinet picks, some of whom are outspoken critics of the agencies they have been tapped to lead.
The inauguration took place amid heavy security after a campaign highlighted by an increase in political violence that included two assassination attempts against Trump, including one in which a bullet grazed his ear.
‘AMERICAN CARNAGE’
Eight years ago, Trump delivered a bleak inaugural address vowing to end the “American carnage” of what he said were crime-ridden cities and soft borders, a departure from the tone of optimism most newly elected presidents have adopted.
Foreign governments will be scrutinizing the tenor of Trump’s speech on Monday after he waged a campaign laced with inflammatory rhetoric.
The traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House will now take place indoors at the Capital One Arena, where Trump held his victory rally on Sunday. Trump will also attend three inaugural balls in the evening.
Some diehard Trump followers slept in the street in frigid conditions to make sure they were in line to get a seat at the arena.
A desk and chair sat on the stage, where Trump was expected to sign some of his first executive orders in front of his supporters before heading to the White House.
Trump will be the first felon to occupy the White House after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star.
Winning the election also rid Trump of two federal indictments – for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and for retaining classified documents – thanks to a Justice Department policy that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office.
In a report last week, Special Counsel Jack Smith said he had enough evidence to convict Trump in the election case if Trump had reached trial.

Title: India and Japan strengthen bilateral ties in Washington DC meeting
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 15:21:46 +0000
Content: India’s External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya on January 19, in Washington, DC. This meeting was their second in-person interaction, following their previous discussion during the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in Italy in November 2024.
Minister Jaishankar shared the update on X, saying, “Good to meet with FM Takeshi Iwaya of Japan. Reviewed the progress in our bilateral cooperation. Also discussed developments pertaining to Quad.”
The two Ministers discussed various aspects of bilateral collaboration, covering political, security, economic, technological, and cultural areas. They expressed satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation and underlined the need to maintain regular strategic communication through frameworks like the Strategic Dialogue and the 2+2 Dialogue of Foreign and Defence Ministers.
To strengthen the partnership, Jaishankar extended an invitation to Iwaya to visit India.
A key outcome of the meeting was the announcement of the India-Japan Year of Science, Technology, and Innovation, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Science and Technology Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985. Both leaders described this milestone as an opportunity to deepen collaborative efforts in research and development.
The talks highlighted the importance of fostering people-to-people exchanges, particularly in education, skill development, and technology. These efforts aim to reinforce ties between the two nations while enhancing opportunities for professionals and students.
The meeting also recognized the deep-rooted cultural and spiritual connections between India and Japan, tracing back to ancient times. Notable historical figures such as Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose have been instrumental in strengthening this bond.
Japan’s connection with India includes events like the consecration of the Buddha statue in Nara by Indian monk Bodhisena in 752 AD. Today, the relationship is further enriched by the Indian community in Japan, which has grown to over 40,000, including a significant number of students pursuing higher education. Tokyo’s Nishikasai area has become a hub for the Indian diaspora, reflecting the increased demand for Indian cultural and educational institutions.

Title: RG Kar verdict: convict’s lawyer plans appeal despite family’s acceptance of sentence
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 14:56:52 +0000
Content: A special court in Kolkata sentenced Sanjay Roy, the sole accused in the rape and murder of a woman doctor, to life imprisonment on Monday. Despite the sentence, Roy’s lawyer, Sejuti Chakraborty, announced intentions to appeal the verdict in the Calcutta High Court, a stance that contradicts the family’s earlier statements.
The case involves the brutal rape and murder of a doctor within the premises of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in August last year.
On January 18, Roy’s elder sister had publicly stated that the family would not challenge the court’s decision and would accept the punishment handed down to Roy. Following Roy’s conviction on Saturday, she offered an apology to the victim’s family and expressed trust in the justice system.
“We apologize to the victim’s family. The law has declared my brother guilty, and he will face the consequences. The administration will do what it deems right. Our personal desires hold no relevance,” she said at the time.
Roy’s mother remained unreachable on Monday, avoiding any contact by keeping the doors of their South Kolkata residence locked.
However, Chakraborty’s statement on Monday marked a departure from the family’s position. She emphasized the legal right of any convict to appeal and expressed her intention to challenge the lower court’s decision.
“We may take some time to act, but I firmly believe Sanjay is a victim in this case. We will move the higher court to secure his release,” Chakraborty said after the sentencing.
The conflicting narratives have raised questions about how the legal costs for the proposed appeal will be covered, given the family’s apparent reluctance to pursue further legal action.

Title: EAM Jaishankar represents PM Modi as special envoy at Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony
Publication Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2025 14:32:47 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is representing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his Special Envoy at Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States in Washington, D.C., today. Sources reveal that Jaishankar is carrying a personal letter from PM Modi addressed to President Trump.
As per established protocol, India often delegates Special Envoys of the Prime Minister to attend such inaugural events of Heads of State and Government. For instance, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh participated in the swearing-in ceremony of Nigeria’s President in May 2023, while then-Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju attended the inauguration of the Maldives President in November 2023. In July 2024, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari represented India at the swearing-in of Iran’s President.
Last year, Minister of State for External Affairs Pabitra Margherita attended the inaugurations of the Presidents of both Indonesia and Mexico. Similarly, in June 2022, the then Minister for External Affairs, Raj Kumar Ranjan Singh, attended the swearing-in of the President of the Philippines.
Meanwhile, large crowds have gathered outside the US Capitol Rotunda, where the ceremonial event will take place. Donald Trump, who is embarking on his second term as US President, will be officially sworn in alongside Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. The inauguration marks two weeks since Trump’s electoral college victory was certified by the US Congress.
The ceremony will commence with Trump’s visit to St. John’s Church for a prayer service, followed by a stop at Blair House, the President’s Guest House. At the North Portico, outgoing President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will welcome Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, President-elect Donald Trump, and Melania Trump.
Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take his oath of office before Trump is sworn in. Following the swearing-in, President Trump will deliver his inaugural remarks. A farewell ceremony for Joe and Jill Biden, as well as Kamala Harris and her husband, will then take place.
The inauguration will conclude with Trump and Vance participating in the signing ceremony—a tradition where the new President, along with congressional members and aides, signs official documents, such as nominations or executive orders, in the President’s Room near the Senate Chamber. This tradition, initiated by former President Ronald Reagan in 1981, is one of the first official acts of the new US President. (ANI)

Title: Bangladesh: Yunus administration unveils new uniforms for police and other law enforcement agencies
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 07:27:35 +0000
Content: In a move aimed at modernising the appearance of law enforcement agencies, the Yunus Administration of Bangladesh unveiled new uniforms for the police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and Ansar-Village Defence Party on Monday.
Home Affairs Adviser of Bangladesh, Lieutenant General (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said, “We have finalised three new uniform designs for the police, RAB, and Ansar. These uniforms will be phased in gradually, with the current attire being replaced over time.” The new uniforms will feature distinct colours for each force. The police will now wear iron-coloured uniforms, RAB personnel will wear olive green, and Ansar will be dressed in golden wheat, he added.
However, politicians and rights campaigners on Monday said that the change in the uniforms was far from bringing real reforms to the forces. They argued that uniform changes only offer superficial, external improvements and do not address the core issues of police accountability, mentality, and efficiency.
Political leaders and rights campaigners emphasised the need for legal and structural reforms, such as changes to the colonial-era police act, to ensure the police serve the public effectively.
Moreover, Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed said that the mentality of the police needed to be changed, and they required motivation to develop as servants of the people, reports New Age newspaper.
Salahuddin said that changes in uniforms would not make the police and other law enforcement agencies more people-oriented.
New Age quotes Supreme Court lawyer Shahdeen Malik as saying, “Changes in the uniforms of the law enforcement agencies would bring only an external change; it would not ensure fundamental changes in the forces.” He added that changes in integrity, efficiency, and accountability within the state forces should take priority, while altering the dress code could have been addressed later.
Following the July uprising, numerous murder cases were filed with police stations across the country, often listing 200–300 unknown accused. Malik said this raised doubts about whether justice for the murders would be done. The efficiency of the police force must be improved to ensure proper investigation of the cases, as people are seeking justice, he said.

Title: Mahakumbh 2025: Over 45 crore devotees, including 15 lakh foreign tourists, expected to attend
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 07:26:45 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Government of Uttar Pradesh briefed foreign journalists on the immense spiritual, cultural, and economic significance of Mahakumbh 2025, which is expected to draw a record-breaking 45 crore devotees, including 15 lakh foreign tourists, according to a press release issued by the Ministry on Tuesday.
The briefing, held at Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan in New Delhi, highlighted Mahakumbh’s status as the world’s largest religious gathering.
Scheduled from January 13 to February 26, Mahakumbh traces its origins to the mythological event of Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), where drops of nectar are believed to have fallen at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. This sacred event symbolizes spiritual purification and self-realisation.
UP government officials detailed the vast preparations for the Mahakumbh, comparing its expected attendance to other global gatherings such as Rio Carnival, Haj, and Oktoberfest, with Mahakumbh surpassing them all. More than 45 crore attendees, including 15 lakh foreign tourists, are expected—far surpassing the 25 crore devotees who attended the 2019 Kumbh Mela.
The Mahakumbh 2025 is projected to generate an economic boost of up to Rs. 2 lakh crore, significantly impacting Uttar Pradesh’s GDP, which is expected to grow by over 1%. The event will stimulate trade in various sectors, including daily essentials (Rs. 17,310 crore), hotels and travel (Rs. 2,800 crore), religious materials (Rs. 2,000 crore), and flowers (Rs. 800 crore).
Infrastructure in Prayagraj has been extensively upgraded to accommodate the massive influx of devotees. Key developments include 14 new flyovers, 9 permanent ghats, 7 new bus stations, and 12 kilometers of temporary ghats. Security measures are stringent, with 37,000 policemen, 14,000 home guards, and 2,750 AI-based CCTV cameras being deployed to ensure safety.
Healthcare services are well-prepared, with 6,000 beds across 43 hospitals, as well as air ambulances ready for emergencies. To maintain cleanliness, 10,200 sanitation workers and 1,800 Ganga Sevadut volunteers will be stationed throughout the event.
One of the key highlights of Mahakumbh 2025 is the participation of 13 Akharas, including the Kinnar Akhara, Dashnam Sanyasini Akhara, and women’s Akharas. Their inclusion symbolizes gender equality and a progressive approach to religious practices, promoting unity across caste, religion, and cultural diversity.
In addition to its religious importance, Mahakumbh 2025 will serve as a global platform to showcase India’s cultural heritage and economic strength, further solidifying its position as one of the world’s most significant events.

Title: Will use US oil reserves to assert power globally, says Trump
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 07:08:53 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump will use the US oil reserves as a weapon to assert its power and prevent both friends and foes from “pushing it around.”
“We’re not going to let any nation, whether friendly or unfriendly, push us around from any standpoint, including the economy because we have something that they don’t have,” he said on Monday.
“We have a power that they don’t have — liquid gold beneath our feet, the likes of which no other nation possesses,” he said about his strength through energy policy.
Exploiting the vast petroleum and gas reserves in the US was a key plank of his election platform, both to bring down prices and assert US power abroad.
Trump was speaking to members of the military at the Commander in Chief’s Ball, where they celebrated his inauguration as president.
He promised to strengthen the military and ensure success by winning without fighting, showcasing the nation’s strength. “Through our power and might, we will lead the world to peace. Our friends will respect us, our enemies will fear us, and the whole world will admire the unrivalled greatness of the United States military,” he added.
“We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,” he said. “It’s called Peace through strength,” he continued.
“We don’t have to fight the worst if we can do it without fighting, as long as we have total victory, we do it without fighting,” he said.
Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance danced with their wives, followed by two female soldiers, while the women danced with two male soldiers. The crowd, including a South Korean contingent participating via video, cheered.
That ball, along with two others, capped the daylong inauguration festivities for the president.
At the Liberty Ball, Vance claimed their victory was too large to rig, referencing the 2020 loss, which Trump insists was stolen from him.
Trump said that the people were “longing for common sense” and his election would bring a return to it.
Men will no longer play in women’s sports, and there will be no more gender change operations for all, he said.
Country singer Jason Aldean, rapper Nelly, and the Village People performed at the ball.
Trump’s day, which began with a church service, was to be capped by the Starlight Ball before he returns to the White House.

Title: Oyster blood protein helps fight against superbugs: study
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 06:38:48 +0000
Content: A protein found in the blood of Australian oysters could help in the fight against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, according to a study published on Tuesday.
The study, led by a team from Southern Cross University (SCU) in Australia, discovered that a protein in the blood of the Sydney rock oyster is capable of killing bacteria as well as increasing the effectiveness of some antibiotics against a range of bacteria, Xinhua news agency reported.
In laboratory tests, they found that the protein was effective at killing Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, the bacteria that cause pneumonia and strep throat, respectively.
When used with antibiotics, the protein made them two to 32 times more effective at killing Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The researchers said that the study supported the potential use of natural products from oysters to treat bacterial infections.
They found that the protein is not toxic to human cells, suggesting that it may be possible to develop a safe antibiotic derived from oyster blood. Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) superbugs, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that no longer respond to antibiotics designed to kill them, have been identified as a major threat to global public health.
According to the World Health Organization, infections that have developed AMR can be difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability, and death.
The research team discovered that the oyster protein can kill bacterial pathogens in biofilms, communities of organisms that stick together, enabling them to evade antibiotics and the human immune system.
“The oyster hemolymph proteins prevent biofilm formation and disrupt existing biofilms, making the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics at lower doses,” said co-author Kirsten Benkendorff from SCU’s Faculty of Science and Engineering.
She said that the discovery provided a great opportunity for researchers and the aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries to collaborate on developing a new antibiotic.

Title: Trump revokes Biden 50% EV target, freezes unspent charging funds
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 06:36:54 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday took aim at electric vehicles, revoking a 2021 executive order signed by his predecessor Joe Biden that sought to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in the United States by 2030 were electric.
Biden’s 50% target, which was not legally binding, had won the support of U.S. and foreign automakers.
Trump said in an executive order he was halting distribution of unspent government funds for vehicle charging stations from a $5 billion fund, called for ending a waiver for states to adopt zero emission vehicle rules by 2035 and said his administration would consider ending EV tax credits.
Trump plans to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider rules mandating more stringent emissions rules that would require automakers to sell between 30% to 56% EVs by 2032 in order to comply with federal emissions rules, as well as parallel rules issued by the U.S. Transportation Department.
Trump said in his order on Monday he was seek the repeal of a waiver granted to California in December by the EPA allowing the state to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. That rule has been adopted by 11 other states.
Trump said the EPA should terminate “where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.”
His order said Trump’s administration should consider “the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase.”
Trump said previously he could take other actions on EVs, including seeking to repeal the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation.
Trump campaigned on ending Biden’s “EV mandate,” without spelling out specific targeted policies. Biden repeatedly refused to endorse setting a date to end the sale of internal combustion engines.
Trump promised while campaigning to boost U.S. oil production, even as it has hit record highs, and to roll back Biden’s clean-energy initiatives, which also include subsidies for wind and solar power and the mass production of hydrogen.

Title: Premier League: Chelsea beat Wolves to move up to fourth
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 06:25:41 +0000
Content: Chelsea ended their five-match winless streak in the Premier League with a 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge and moved up to fourth in the table.
Tosin Adarabioyo, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke were all on target as the Blues climbed back into the top four.
Chelsea enjoyed a positive start and took a deserved lead through Tosin Adarabioyo midway through the first half when the centre back scored with a composed finish.
Tosin became Chelsea’s 13th different Premier League goalscorer this season (excluding own goals) only Arsenal (14) have had more in the competition in 2024/25.
Matt Doherty pulled level from a corner in first-half injury-time but the Blues regained control with two goals around the hour mark.
Marc Cucurella scored with a close-range finish to put us back in front before Noni Madueke applied the final touch after Trevoh Chalobah looked set to score on his Chelsea return five minutes later.
Enzo Maresca’s side leapfrogged Newcastle United and Manchester City to fourth place, while Wolves remain 17th and only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.
“The first 40 minutes we were top. The performance was excellent and we dominated the game. We scored and created many more chances,” Chelsea manager Maresca said after the match.
“Then in the last five minutes what has been happening in the last five games happened again. Wolves had a little bit of confidence and got their goal and then we started to struggle a little bit. Second half we started quite well and then after the second and third goals we were in control,” he added.

Title: Australia Open 2025: Novak Djokovic to face Carlos Alcaraz in men’s singles quarterfinals
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 06:12:54 +0000
Content: The ongoing Australian Open 2025 will witness one of the biggest matches as Serbia’s Novak Djokovic locks horns with Carlos Alcaraz of Spain in the men’s singles quarterfinal on Tuesday.
The Novak Djokovic vs Carlos Alcaraz Australian Open 2025 quarterfinal clash at the Rod Laver Arena will be available for live streaming and live telecast in India. The match is scheduled to start at 2:40 PM IST.
Djokovic, 37, last played Alcaraz, 21, in the final of the Paris 2024 Olympics, where the Serbian clinched the gold after a 7(7)-6(3), 7(7)-6(2) straight-set victory.
Seeded seventh at the 2025 Australian Open, Djokovic has faced Alcaraz seven times so far, with the Serbian leading their head-to-head record 4-3 against the young Spaniard.
Djokovic, also a bronze medalist at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, holds the record for the most men’s Grand Slam titles (24) in history, with ten of those coming at the Australian Open—also a record.
He defeated 24th seed Jiri Lehecka of Czechia 6-3, 6-4, 7(7)-6(4) in the fourth round and has dropped just two sets on his way to the quarterfinals this year.
The 37-year-old’s last Australian Open triumph came in 2023 when he defeated Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6(7-4), 7-6(7-5) in the final.
Third-seed Carlos Alcaraz, on the other hand, is yet to win the Australian Open. He was knocked out in the quarterfinals in the previous two editions of the season’s first Grand Slam.
Although the Australian Open has proven elusive for the young Spaniard, he has already won one French Open, two Wimbledons, and a US Open so far.
Carlos Alcaraz received a walkover in his fourth-round encounter against Jack Draper of Great Britain. The Spaniard was leading 7-5, 6-1 against the 15th-seeded Draper before the latter decided to concede.
Olympic silver medalist Alcaraz has dropped only one set against Portugal’s Nuno Borges in the third round on his way to the Australian Open quarterfinals.

Title: US President Trump issues executive order to withdraw from WHO
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 06:01:28 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to formally withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The decision, announced on Monday (local time), comes after a prolonged period of criticism directed at the WHO, which Trump blamed for mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to address the broader global health crises.
In the executive order, President Trump emphasized that the United States’ decision to withdraw, originally announced in July 2020, was due to what he described as the WHO’s failure to handle the outbreak of COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, and the organization’s overall ineffectiveness in addressing other major health concerns. The order also cited the WHO’s failure to adopt necessary reforms and its continued vulnerability to political influence from its member states.
“The United States began its withdrawal from the World Health Organization in 2020, following its mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies,” the order said. “Additionally, the WHO failed to implement reforms and continues to be heavily influenced by political forces within its member states.”
Trump’s executive order also pointed to a disparity in financial contributions, with the US shouldering a far greater financial burden compared to other nations. The order specifically criticized the financial obligations placed on the US, asserting that the payments demanded were disproportionate to those made by other countries, particularly China.
“Furthermore, the WHO continues to demand unfair financial contributions from the United States, which are far out of proportion with the assessments made for other countries. For example, China, with a population of 1.4 billion, contributes nearly 90% less to the WHO than the United States,” the order continued.
Trump further explained the financial inequality in a statement made in the Oval Office, pointing out that the US had paid $500 million to the WHO, while China, despite its much larger population, contributed only $39 million. This significant imbalance, according to Trump, was a key factor in his decision to cut ties with the organization.
“We paid 500 million dollars to the World Health Organization, while China, with 1.4 billion people, paid just 39 million,” Trump added. “It seemed a little unfair to me.”
The President’s remarks also extended to the ongoing situation with TikTok, where Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China if the country did not approve a deal with the social media platform. The potential for trade sanctions on China was framed as a bargaining chip in negotiations, underscoring Trump’s approach of using economic leverage to push for favorable outcomes for the US.
“If China doesn’t approve the TikTok deal, we could put tariffs on China,” Trump stated. “Until I came along, China never paid a cent to this country. They ripped us off, and they never paid anything.”
Trump’s executive order to withdraw from the WHO marks a decisive shift in US foreign policy under his administration, signaling an end to the country’s participation in the global health organization. It also comes as he begins his second term in office, having been sworn in earlier in the day as the 47th President of the United States.

Title: WHO regrets Trump’s decision to withdraw; hopes US will reconsider
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 12:31:57 +0000
Content: The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday expressed regret over the decision of US President Donald Trump to walk out of the global health body, and hoped the administration will reconsider it.
“The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,” the WHO said in a statement.
The agency noted that it “hopes the US will reconsider” the decision, “for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe”.
Shortly after his inauguration to a second term, Trump signed the executive order on the withdrawal stating that the WHO mishandled the Covid pandemic and that the agency required “unfairly onerous payments” from the US that were disproportionate to the sums provided by other, larger countries, such as China.
The WHO said it played a crucial role in protecting the health and security of the world’s people, including Americans.
This was achieved by targeting “the root causes of disease, building stronger health systems, and detecting, preventing, and responding to health emergencies”.
Notably, the US was a founding member of WHO in 1948. The country is an active participant in the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, alongside 193 other Member States.
The WHO noted that in the last 70 years, “WHO and the US have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats”.
“Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,” the health agency said that American institutions have both contributed and benefited from membership of the WHO.
“With the participation of the US and other Member States, WHO has over the past 7 years implemented the largest set of reforms in its history, to transform our accountability, cost-effectiveness, and impact in countries. This work continues,” the UN health body said.
Meanwhile, several global health experts have expressed their concerns about the executive order by Trump to withdraw from the WHO. This means “all personnel and contractors will be stopped. Withdraw from the pandemic treaty negotiations. Anyone cheering this has no idea of global health,” said Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, from the Erasmus University in the Netherlands, in a post on social media platform X.
Vaccine researcher Prof Peter Hotez called the decision “disappointing”.
“This will weaken our nation’s biosecurity/pandemic preparedness at a time when pathogens like H5N1, SARS-like CoVs, dengue/arboviruses accelerating because of climate change/urbanisation,” said Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center, on X.

Title: South Korea’s Yoon defends actions at impeachment hearing over martial law decree
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 12:08:59 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol attended on Tuesday a Constitutional Court hearing of his impeachment trial where he denied ordering military commanders to drag lawmakers out of parliament during his short-lived bid to impose martial law.
Near the start of the hearing, Yoon said he had worked in public service with “a firm commitment to free democracy”, when invited by the acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, to speak.
Dressed in a navy-coloured suit with a burgundy tie, Yoon, a career prosecutor before his 2022 election as president, pledged to answer any questions the court might have.
Yoon has been incarcerated since last week under a separate criminal probe on charges of leading an insurrection with his attempt to impose martial law in early December, a move that shocked the nation and was overturned within hours by parliament.
Yoon told the hearing that special forces troops sent to parliament on Dec. 3 were not there to disable the legislature or prevent it from blocking his martial law because he knew such an action would have led to an indefensible crisis.
“In this country, parliament and news media are far more powerful than the president, in a far superior position,” he told the court.
His lawyers outlined arguments in defence of Yoon’s martial law declaration, saying it was meant to sound the alarm over abuses committed by the opposition Democratic Party.
They argued the opposition’s actions had paralysed government and pushed the country’s democratic and constitutional order to the brink of collapse.
“The decree was intended simply to establish the format of martial law and never intended to be executed, nor was it possible to execute it because of the potential for conflict with higher-level laws,” lawyer Cha Gi-hwan told the court.
Cha also denied testimony by military commanders involved in the martial law declaration who said Yoon and his top aides ordered the arrest of some members of parliament who had politically clashed with the president.
The opposition Democratic Party, joined by minority parties and also 12 members of Yoon’s People Power Party, voted with a two-thirds majority to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14.
HELICOPTERS LANDING AT PARLIAMENT
The Constitutional Court began the trial on Dec. 27 to review an impeachment motion that accused Yoon of violating his constitutional duty by imposing martial law with no justifiable grounds.
The parliament’s legal team presented testimony from military commanders and video footage showing military helicopters landing on parliament grounds with special forces troops breaking into the main building, as well as troops moving in on the National Election Commission.
One of the lawyers also criticised unproven claims of irregularities at the election commission, which Yoon cited as a factor for justifying martial law.
“In South Korea’s current national chaos, the conspiracy theory of election fraud can destroy our community itself,” said the lawyer.
The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to remove Yoon from office permanently or reinstate him.
Yoon was driven to the hearing from the Seoul Detention Centre, where he is being held, in a correctional service vehicle escorted by a Presidential Security Service motorcade.
He was permitted to change from the khaki prison uniform he currently has to wear.
After the hearing, Yoon visited a medical facility to receive medical attention with prior authorization from the head of the detention centre, the Justice Ministry which oversees correctional service said in a statement.
It did not provide further details on privacy grounds.
Yoon’s decision to attend the impeachment hearing contrasts with his vigorous resistance to criminal proceedings against him where he has refused to answer summons by investigators or attend interrogation sessions.
Yoon’s legal team has denied he masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even technically by the death penalty.
Security was heightened at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, after a mob of angry Yoon supporters went on a rampage through the district court that issued a warrant to extend his detention early on Sunday.
Dozens of police buses were lined bumper-to-bumper on both sides of the street, keeping hundreds of Yoon supporters more than 100 metres (109 yards) away from the court.

Title: India’s Space Economy Reaches $8 Billion, projected to hit $44 billion in next decade: Dr. Jitendra Singh

Content: AI can add $4.4 trillion to global economy, but digital divide must be removed: WEF report
Davos, Jan 21 (IANS) India’s space economy has grown to $8 billion and is set to expand to $44 billion over the next decade, according to Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Dr. Jitendra Singh, according to a press release issued by the Ministry on Tuesday.
In a conversation with Rajya Sabha Member Vijay Tankha on Sansad TV, Dr. Singh credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s space sector reforms for opening the industry to private investment, enabling significant growth.
Dr. Singh highlighted major milestones, such as the indigenous Gaganyaan Mission, the forthcoming Chandrayaan-4 (2027), Shukrayaan (2028), and the Indian Space Station (2030), marking India’s progress in space exploration. He lauded the role of startups and foreign direct investment (FDI) in driving innovation, mentioning key advancements like SPADEX’s docking capabilities and the Vyom Mitra robo mission, a precursor to human space exploration.
In addition to space, Dr. Singh spoke about India’s bio-economy, emphasizing the country’s abundant natural resources and its status as one of the first nations to adopt a dedicated bio-economy policy. He projected that biomanufacturing and bio foundries would propel the Fourth Industrial Revolution, positioning India as a leader in global innovation for recycling, manufacturing, and startups. He also mentioned India’s pioneering efforts under the BIO-E3 policy.
Dr. Singh further highlighted PM Modi’s citizen-centric governance model, with initiatives like Mission Karmayogi for capacity building in bureaucracy, and digital innovations such as face-recognition-enabled digital life certificates. These efforts have eased citizen services and streamlined governance.
Addressing climate change, Dr. Singh reiterated India’s commitment to tackling diverse climatic challenges, with the PM’s Mission LiFE promoting sustainable living practices. He also underscored India’s leadership in preventive healthcare, meeting global standards in addressing both health and environmental concerns.
With a collaborative and transparent approach, India has emerged as a reliable global partner, solidifying its position as a leader in technology, sustainability, and governance under PM Modi’s leadership. The conducive environment has made India a hub for startups, businesses, and industries, fueling its growth across sectors.

Title: India cannot be ignored as it is the fastest-growing economy: Rajan Bharti Mittal at Davos
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 11:55:25 +0000
Content: Rajan Bharti Mittal, Vice Chairman of Bharti Enterprises on Tuesday said that India’s global image, both economically and politically, is on the rise, and the country cannot be ignored.
“I’ve been coming here for many years, and I can tell you with every visit, India’s image globally, economically, and politically is on the rise,” Mittal said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
“There is no doubt. Especially with this government, we have seen the kind of relationship they have developed, both economically and politically, and in a sense, that is helping India’s economic growth.”
India is the fastest-growing economy, and hence, “India cannot be ignored,” he said.
India’s manufacturing sector has received a significant boost, he added, particularly praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“I have to say, the Prime Minister has been very clear; we have to Make in India. And I think the Viksit Bharat growth that he has laid out for manufacturing, which has been lower, is now getting traction. What we are seeing is that manufacturing, EV (electric vehicles), and renewables are gaining momentum. We also see that FDI is still holding up. Last year, we received USD 46 billion,” he added.
“I’m sure more FDI is coming in many more sectors. As you know, infrastructure is key for our growth, and I think a lot of investment is going in, both private and public.”
Regarding expectations from the Union Budget for 2025-26, Mittal suggested that levies on telecom services be rationalized.
“On the telecom side, we definitely have an expectation that the levies are very high. If Digital India is to be the vehicle for so many things, I think that’s one ask from the industry in this budget — that levies must be rationalized,” he explained.
“Generally, I think consumption also has to grow, which means more money has to be in the hands of spenders,” he added.
Mittal also hopes for some tax rebates in the upcoming budget. “So, these are the two things that I would expect the budget to deliver,” he said.
Asked about Donald Trump’s presidency and its potential impact on India and Bharti Enterprises’ global operations, Mittal, without saying much, asserted, “We’ll have to see. Eventually, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.”
“We’ll have to wait and watch. We do expect some blips, but I think the India-U.S. relationship is very robust. Both countries will be, I would say, sensible nations, ensuring that we engage with each other in a level-based economic and political relationship.”

Title: Gautam Adani praises MahaKumbh management as a subject of study for management institutes

Content: Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani praised the Uttar Pradesh administration for its outstanding management of the MahaKumbh Mela during his visit to Prayagraj on Tuesday.
Adani highlighted the meticulous organization of the event, describing it as a remarkable example of efficient administration that should serve as a case study for management institutes and corporate houses. He lauded the efforts of police personnel and sanitation workers who ensure seamless arrangements for millions of visitors.
Speaking on the scale of the operations, Adani said, “The way millions of people are accommodated, and the manner in which the arrangements are maintained, is a subject worthy of study for management institutes and corporate houses. There is nothing greater than receiving the blessings of Maa Ganga.”
Adani also emphasized Uttar Pradesh’s immense potential for growth, citing its population of 27 crore as a significant resource for development. He reiterated the Adani Group’s commitment to increasing investments in the state and contributing to its progress.
On a personal note, Adani shared details about his son Jeet Adani’s upcoming wedding, scheduled for February 7.

Title: Germany to lobby Trump on WHO withdrawal, agency hopes for U-turn

Content: Berlin will try to talk U.S. President Donald Trump out of his decision to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organisation, Germany’s health minister said on Tuesday.
The U.N. agency also said that it hoped that its top donor country would change its mind and looked forward to a constructive dialogue with Trump’s team.
“The new U.S. president’s announcement to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is a serious blow to the international fight against global health crises,” Karl Lauterbach said.
“We will try to persuade Donald Trump to reconsider this decision,” he added.
Germany is the second largest national donor to the WHO, contributing around 3% of the agency’s funding.
Trump announced the withdrawal on Monday, alleging that the global health agency had mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic and other international health crises.
In the U.N. agency’s first reaction to the move, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević told reporters in Geneva: “We hope that United States will reconsider, and we really hope that there will be constructive dialogue for the benefit of everyone, for Americans but also for people around the world.”

Title: Sensex plunges over 1,200 points, Nifty ends at 23,024 amid Trump 2.0 concerns
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 10:45:45 +0000
Content: The Indian stock markets experienced a sharp decline on Tuesday, driven by global jitters surrounding US President Donald Trump’s second term, marked by his signing of executive orders and warnings of steep trade tariffs. The Sensex fell by 1,235 points (1.6%) to close at 75,838, while the Nifty 50 slipped 320.1 points (1.37%) to end at 23,024.
Market experts attributed the slide to Trump’s comments targeting BRICS nations and signaling a 100% tariff on countries reducing their dependency on the US dollar for international trade. These statements led to a surge in negative investor sentiment in the Indian markets.
The market downturn erased over ₹7 lakh crore of investor wealth. On the BSE Sensex, UltraTech Cement and HCLTech were the only stocks to end in positive territory, while Zomato faced the steepest losses, plunging nearly 11%. Other heavyweights like ICICI Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra also recorded substantial declines.
On the Nifty 50 index, eight stocks managed to stay in the green, with Apollo Hospitals leading gains at 2.76%, followed by UltraTech Cement, BPCL, Tata Consumer Products, and JSW Steel. However, major losses came from Trent, which fell by 4.5%, along with ICICI Bank, NTPC, and Mahindra & Mahindra.
Market analyst Vikram Kasat of PL Capital noted that large-cap stocks like Zomato, Reliance Industries, and Kotak Bank dragged the indices down significantly. Zomato’s sharp decline came after the company reported a 57% year-on-year drop in its December quarter net profit, contributing 170 points to the Sensex’s fall.
Weak Q3 earnings and persistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who offloaded equities worth ₹48,023 crore as of January 20, added to the bearish sentiment.
Among sectors, FMCG eked out a marginal gain of 0.34%, while all others recorded losses. The Consumer Durables sector led the declines, falling 3.59%, followed by the Realty sector, down 3.04%. Financial services, auto, media, and banking sectors also ended in the red.
Broader markets mirrored the trend, with the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices dropping 1.7% and 1.68%, respectively. The India VIX index, a measure of market volatility, surged 5.92% to 17.39, reflecting heightened investor anxiety.
The rupee showed resilience in early trade, strengthening by 0.20 paise to 86.29 against the dollar, buoyed by overnight weakness in the greenback. This softness was partly triggered by Trump’s inaugural actions, including imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which fueled global market uncertainty.
US markets were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.

Title: India projected to account for 16% of global consumption by 2050: report
Publication Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 10:19:50 +0000
Content: India is projected to account for 16% of global consumption by 2050, up from 9% in 2023, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute titled “Dependency and Depopulation: Confronting the Consequences of New Demographic Reality.”
By 2050, only North America, with a projected 17% share, will surpass India’s global consumption share. These estimates are based on purchasing power parity, which adjusts for price differences across countries.
India’s rise in global consumption share is primarily attributed to its young and growing population, alongside increasing incomes. The report also highlights a global demographic shift driven by falling fertility rates in advanced economies, leading to ageing populations.
By 2050, only 26% of the global population will reside in the first-wave regions (those with historically lower fertility rates), a sharp decline from 42% in 1997. The remaining population will be concentrated in later-wave regions, including India, Latin America, West Asia, and Africa, which have experienced fertility rate declines more recently.
India’s role in this demographic transformation is significant. By 2050, India’s labour force will account for two-thirds of global working hours. Emerging markets, particularly later-wave regions, are expected to contribute over half of global consumption within the next 25 years, driven by their younger populations and rising incomes.
The report notes that India’s share of the global population, which stood at 23% in 2023, will decrease to 17% by 2050. However, India’s demographic dividend—a rise in GDP per capita due to an increasing working-age population—added an average of 0.7% to GDP per capita growth between 1997 and 2023.
Significantly, the report underscores the potential impact of increased female workforce participation. It estimates that if India raises its women’s labour force participation rate by 10 percentage points, GDP per capita could increase by 4-5%.

Title: India and China should jointly maintain peace and tranquility in border areas: Chinese diplomat
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 07:33:03 +0000
Content: Wang Lei, Charge d’Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in India, on Tuesday expressed China’s readiness to work with India “in the spirit of looking to the future and pursuing win-win cooperation to invest their resources into development and revitalization, placing the border issue in an appropriate position within bilateral ties.”
He hosted a reception in New Delhi for the Chinese New Year, where he emphasized the need for India and China to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in their border areas. He noted that 2025 marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Wang recalled that India was one of the first nations to recognize New China and establish diplomatic relations with it.
Wang said, “As two major developing countries and important members of the Global South, China-India relations maintain healthy development, aligning with the interests of over 2.8 billion people in both countries.” He added that China is ready to work with India to promote win-win cooperation and prioritize the border issue within bilateral relations.
He also highlighted the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October, where both sides agreed to enhance strategic communication and safeguard peace along the border.
Speaking about the 23rd meeting of Special Representatives for the China-India Boundary Question in December, Wang mentioned that the two sides had reached a six-point consensus on the border issue.
Regarding trade exchanges, Wang noted that the trade volume between India and China reached 126.6 billion USD in the first 11 months of 2024, showing a 1.9 percent year-on-year growth. He also pointed to the rapid growth in people-to-people exchanges, with the Chinese Embassy issuing 280,000 visas to Indians last year.
Wang further mentioned that 2024 marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and highlighted its strategic plans for high-quality development. Chinese Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, shared pictures from the event, noting the presence of representatives from the Indian government, political parties, think tanks, media, and students.

Title: Centre introduces Diamond Imprest Authorization scheme to revive sector
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 07:06:53 +0000
Content: In a bid to enhance the competitiveness of India’s diamond industry, the Union government has introduced the Diamond Imprest Authorization (DIA) Scheme for the duty-free import of natural cut and polished diamonds.
Set to take effect from April 1, the DIA Scheme offers a streamlined process to facilitate the duty-free import of natural cut and polished diamonds under ¼ carat (25 cents), with the aim of promoting value addition and driving export growth, according to a press release by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry.
The scheme comes with an export obligation that mandates a 10 percent value addition, the statement said. Diamond exporters with Two Star Export House status or higher, and those with annual exports of at least $15 million are eligible for availing the benefit under this scheme, it added.
The initiative responds to ‘Beneficiation’ policies adopted by several natural diamond mining countries, such as Botswana, Namibia, and Angola, where manufacturers are required to establish cut and polishing facilities for a minimum percentage of value addition.
The scheme is also designed to preserve India’s position as a global leader in the diamond industry’s entire value chain.
“The scheme is crafted to provide a level-playing field for Indian diamond exporters, particularly MSME exporters, enabling them to compete effectively with larger peers,” stated the Commerce Ministry.
Additionally, the scheme is expected to generate more employment opportunities, particularly for diamond assorters and in the processing of semi-finished diamonds. By facilitating Indian exporters, it seeks to protect the domestic diamond processing industry and sustain associated employment.
The diamond industry is currently facing a steep decline in exports and job losses among workers. This scheme is expected to counter these trends and help rejuvenate the sector.
According to the latest data from the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), India’s gross exports of gems and jewellery in December 2024 stood at $1,967.98 million, marking a decline of 10.29 percent compared to the same period last year. This decline is attributed to economic uncertainty, with buyers turning to gold as a safer investment option instead of spending on lifestyle products, according to the Council.

Title: A Decade of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao: Empowering India’s Daughters
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 06:58:33 +0000
Content: The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 22, 2015, in Panipat, Haryana, has completed a decade of remarkable progress. The initiative, aimed at addressing the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and promoting the survival, protection, and education of the girl child, has emerged as a transformative social reform in India.
In his statement, Prime Minister Modi emphasized the significance of empowering girls, saying, “Our government prioritizes empowering the girl child and strengthening Nari Shakti. Ensuring dignity and opportunities for girls has been a cornerstone of our development agenda.”
Since 2021, the BBBP scheme has been integrated with Mission Shakti, a comprehensive program focusing on women’s safety and empowerment. Mission Shakti encompasses two sub-schemes: Sambal, which addresses safety and security through initiatives such as One Stop Centres and Women Helplines, and Samarthya, which promotes empowerment by providing Shakti Sadans, rehabilitation homes, and Palna-Creche facilities for working women. Additionally, the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) has been enhanced to provide support for the second child if female, improving maternal health and compensating for wage loss during pregnancy.
Over the past ten years, BBBP has achieved significant milestones in improving the lives of girls across the country. The national Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) has increased from 918 in 2014-15 to 933 in 2022-23, showcasing the success of initiatives aimed at reducing gender-biased practices. Enrollment in secondary education has also witnessed growth, with the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) for girls rising from 75.51% in 2014-15 to 79.4% in 2021-22. Institutional deliveries have surged from 87% in 2014-15 to over 94% by 2019-20, ensuring safer childbirth and reducing maternal and infant mortality rates.
Community campaigns like “Selfie with Daughters” and “Beti Janmotsav” have played a vital role in creating societal acceptance and celebrating the girl child. Additionally, collaborations with the Ministry of Skill Development have introduced vocational training and higher education opportunities, particularly for girls from minority communities.
The scheme also addresses critical issues such as gender-biased sex selection, access to education and healthcare for girls, and menstrual hygiene awareness. Initiatives like “Khelo India” encourage girls’ participation in sports, while efforts to improve school infrastructure have led to the construction of toilets and the installation of sanitary pad vending machines, ensuring a healthier and safer environment.
BBBP operates as a centrally sponsored scheme with funding based on district SRB levels. Districts with an SRB of 918 or below receive Rs. 40 lakh annually, while those with an SRB between 919 and 952 receive Rs. 30 lakh, and districts with an SRB above 952 receive Rs. 20 lakh.
As the scheme enters its second decade, its focus shifts toward creating long-term societal change through inclusive policies, better implementation, and greater community participation. Celebrated annually on January 24 as National Girl Child Day, BBBP has laid a strong foundation for valuing and empowering every girl child in India.

Title: Thousands descend on Ayodhya on first anniversary of Ram temple ceremony
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 06:54:01 +0000
Content: The first anniversary celebration of the consecration of Ram Lalla idol in the Ayodhya temple has brought to the city thousands of devotees from across the country. The historic event, held on January 22, 2024, witnessed Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing the main rituals, turning a centuries-old dream into reality.  
Despite the chilly weather, devotees from across the country are thronging the temple to offer prayers. Many credited PM Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for their pivotal roles in bringing the Ram temple project to fruition.  
“In Ayodhya, the atmosphere is filled with joy and devotion as we go for Ram Lalla’s darshan,” said Amita, a devotee. “There is great happiness and excitement among all the devotees here. All the credit goes to PM Modi and CM Yogi,” she added.  
Anand, another devotee, praised the arrangements, stating, “The government has done a good job with the arrangements; no one is facing any problems. This was a very nice experience, and everyone should experience it.”  
Amar Gathe, who traveled from Nashik, reflected on the temple’s historical significance. “We have come here from Kumbh. The 500 years of struggle ended one year ago due to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS, and other organizations who worked tirelessly to make this dream come true,” he said.  
With a surge in tourists and pilgrims, Ayodhya Police have intensified security measures. SP City Madhuban Singh stated, “The Pran Pratishtha ceremony is completing one year, and as the Kumbh Mela is ongoing, the number of devotees in Ayodhya is increasing. For efficient crowd management, the entire Ayodhya Dham has been divided into six zones and 17 sectors.”  
The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra recently concluded the ‘Pratishtha Dwadashi Mahotsav,’ commemorating one year since the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla, as per the Hindu calendar.  
The grand celebration on January 11, 2025, coincided with Kurma Dwadashi during Shukla Paksha in the Paush month. Rituals marking the anniversary drew overwhelming numbers of devotees to Ayodhya, showcasing the unity and faith of millions.

Title: 41 Indian Fishermen Released by Sri Lanka Return to Chennai
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 06:41:40 +0000
Content: Forty-one fishermen from Tamil Nadu, arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy in September last year for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL), arrived at Chennai Airport late Tuesday night, officials said on Wednesday.
According to Tamil Nadu coastal police officials, of the 41 fishermen, 35 are from Ramanathapuram, while the remaining six hail from Nagapattinam and Pudukottai districts. Upon arrival, they underwent citizenship verification, customs checks, and other formalities.
This release follows the return of another group of 15 Tamil Nadu fishermen who reached Chennai on January 16, after being arrested earlier by the Sri Lankan Navy.
The issue of recurring arrests of Indian fishermen by Sri Lankan authorities was raised by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar during discussions with Sri Lankan President Anura Dissanayake during the latter’s recent visit to India.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has also urged the Union government to address the continuing arrests and ensure the safety of fishermen from the state.
Fishermen associations across Tamil Nadu have staged widespread protests in coastal districts, demanding decisive action. They have submitted petitions to the President of India, requesting intervention to stop the mid-sea arrests and the seizure of mechanized fishing boats, which are vital to their livelihoods.

Title: Swiatek charges into Australian Open semi-finals
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:58:21 +0000
Content: A rampaging Iga Swiatek stormed into her second Australian Open semi-final with a 6-1 6-2 centre court demolition of eighth seed Emma Navarro on Wednesday as the world number two underlined her title credentials once again at Melbourne Park.
The quarter-final passed with a note of controversy, though, with Swiatek scooping up a drop shot that looked perilously close to a double-bounce in the fifth game of the second set, which proved a hammer blow for Navarro.
A throbbing ball of energy from the first point to the last, Swiatek’s win at a sundrenched Rod Laver Arena set up another American match-up with Madison Keys, who overhauled Elina Svitolina 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the earlier quarter-final.
“I think it was much more tougher than the score shows,” Swiatek said on court.
The Pole has a 4-1 record against her next opponent Keys but expected a tough test against the American.
“Madison is a great player and really experienced, so you never know. The match that I lost, she kind of killed me, so I think it can be tricky,” she added.
After beating Ukrainian Svitolina, Keys had said she looked forward to cheering on Navarro as her compatriot took on the five-times Grand Slam champion.
But she was left to ponder the scale of her task as she looks to secure her first Grand Slam final since the 2017 U.S. Open.
Most eyes had been focused on the top half of the women’s draw, where favourite and double defending champion Aryna Sabalenka booked a semi-final with Paula Badosa on Tuesday.
But it may be the free-swinging Swiatek in pole position for the title, having conceded only 14 games in her five matches.
Though the scoreline suggested otherwise, Navarro gave Swiatek a proper battle in the second set and had a break point in the fifth game tinged by controversy.
Swiatek bolted forward to retrieve a drop shot that appeared to have bounced twice on certain angles of the replay before her racket scooped it up.
Play went on, though, with Swiatek winning both the point and the game with a passing shot, leaving Navarro to remonstrate fruitlessly with the chair umpire.
Navarro could not recover from the blow, losing the next three games to bow out.
While Swiatek squandered a first match point with a poor return into the net, she sealed it on the second when a desperate Navarro fired just wide of the line.
FEARLESS
Keys had earlier blasted into a third Australian Open semi-final with characteristic aggression to notch up her 10th win in succession.
“To be here 10 years later in the semi-finals again, I’m really proud of myself and really excited to play another semi- final here in Melbourne,” said Keys, who reached the last four in 2015 and 2022.
“I kind of just had to start playing a little bit more aggressive and try to get to the net a bit quicker.
“I think I played a little bit smarter for sure. Probably a little bit less fearless.”
The 29-year-old from Rock Island, Illinois had lost the last two of her three Grand Slam match-ups with Svitolina, most recently in the fourth round of the 2019 U.S. Open.
And she appeared set for another setback as the counter-punching Ukrainian took full advantage of Keys’ early waywardness on a cool and breezy morning.
Keys dropped serve in the eighth game with an unforced error and then gifted the set with another error as Gael Monfils nodded approval at his wife Svitolina from the player’s box.
Keys raised her game, though, pressuring Svitolina on serve to earn a break point in the fourth game of the second set.
But Svitolina saved it with a brilliant reflex volley that left the American smiling ruefully.
Two games later, Svitolina finally buckled on serve as Keys found her range with a forehand winner. Keys had two set points at 5-3 but blew one with a wild forehand into the tramlines before closing it out with a big serve.
She kept up the firepower, raising two break points at 2-2 in the third set with a forehand down the line before taking Svitolina’s serve with a ferocious backhand return.
Keys marched on in a barrage of power hitting, claiming the win on the first match point when a harried Svitolina thumped a backhand well past the baseline.

Title: Vice-President Dhankhar highlights challenges of illegal migration and calls for national unity
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:49:43 +0000
Content: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday raised concerns about the growing issue of illegal migration, warning that it is escalating to unmanageable levels, threatening India’s electoral systems and straining essential resources.
Addressing the students of NIT Raipur, IIT Bhilai, IIM Raipur on the theme- “Ideas for building Better Bharat” at Raipur, Dhankhar underscored the severe economic and social impacts of illegal migration, highlighting its strain on employment, education, healthcare, and other sectors.  
“Illegal migration in millions is a monstrous problem that requires immediate resolution. Every passing day adds complexity to this issue,” he said. The vice-president called for prioritising the nation over petty political gains and urged a resolute approach to tackle this growing concern.  
Dhankhar also emphasised the need for political and social consensus on critical issues like the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). He pointed out that the UCC is enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy and urged stakeholders to view it as a constitutional obligation rather than a divisive agenda.  
The vice-president expressed concern over orchestrated demographic disruptions and conversions aimed at destabilising democracy. While respecting individual rights, Dhankar cautioned against demographic manipulation driven by allurements. He called for proactive efforts to maintain organic demographic harmony.  
Institutional roles and political consensus 
Highlighting the importance of institutional harmony, Dhankhar stressed that each organ of the state—the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary—must function within its constitutionally defined boundaries. “No institution should interfere in the roles of others. Democracy thrives on mutual respect and restraint,” he noted.  
The vice-president urged political parties to resolve differences through dialogue and consensus on issues like nationalism, development, and security. Drawing inspiration from India’s ancient tradition of structured debates, he emphasised the need for collective wisdom in addressing national challenges.  
The vice-president condemned the destruction of public property and disruptions to public order. Referring to incidents like the vandalism of Vande Bharat trains, he stressed the need for exemplary punishment and financial accountability for perpetrators. “Such actions bring no honour to our nation. Young people must use the power of social media to name and shame those responsible,” he added.

Title: Djokovic outclasses Alcaraz in late-night blockbuster at Australian Open
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:46:09 +0000
Content: History-chasing Novak Djokovic turned back the clock at the Australian Open for a vintage display that sent his young rival Carlos Alcaraz spinning out of the Grand Slam and the 37-year-old Serb into his 50th major semi-final on Tuesday.
Paula Badosa stunned Coco Gauff to reach the last four at a major for the first time and will next meet her best friend and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who booked the intriguing match-up with a battling win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.
Alexander Zverev overcame Tommy Paul to also go through but the focus on the 10th day of the championships was mostly on the evening blockbuster that determined his next opponent.
Djokovic, who is eyeing a record 25th Grand Slam title and 11th at his happiest hunting ground, delighted fans with a 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4 victory over 21-year-old French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz to end his ambitious career Grand Slam bid.
“Best match of the tournament for me and possibly one of the best matches that was played on the men’s side,” said Djokovic, who overcame an early injury to prevail in three hours and 37 minutes, finishing past 1 a.m. at Melbourne Park.
“I’m super proud to push this one through in four sets. Carlos brings so much energy and intensity on the court. He always demands the best of his opponent in order to have a chance to win against him.
“Credit to him for fighting. I think we both gave all on the court tonight. Hopefully people saw that.”
Sabalenka also had an extended spell on Rod Laver Arena, as she negotiated windy conditions for a 6-2 2-6 6-3 win over 27th- seeded Russian Pavlyuchenkova that kept her quest for a third straight title at Melbourne Park going.
“Honestly, I was just praying today. I was just praying to put the ball back in these tough conditions,” Sabalenka said.
A familiar rival lies in wait for Sabalenka after Badosa defeated Gauff 7-5 6-4 to bring a shuddering halt to the third-seeded American’s 13-match winning streak.
IN CONTROL
Gauff’s compatriot Paul had the better of the first three sets against second seed Zverev but ended up on the wrong side of a 7-6(1) 7-6(0) 2-6 6-1 scoreline on a steamy centre court.
Zverev counted his blessings after making the last four at Melbourne Park for the third time in five years, but was in no doubt what the tennis world was waiting for.
“No reason to stay here after you’ve just witnessed Zverev v Paul,” the German joked to the crowd as he looked forward to the clash between Djokovic and four-times Grand Slam winner Alcaraz.
“It’s two of the best players that probably ever touched a racket. Novak is the greatest of all time right now, Carlos is going to be one of them.”
Alcaraz said he felt in control after winning the first set but allowed Djokovic back into the match and paid for it.
“In the second set I had to play a little bit better just to push him even more to the limit,” Alcaraz said.
“Yeah, I saw that he had issues just moving a little bit. I had to push him a little bit more to the limit. I didn’t do it. After that, he started to feel better and played such a great level. That was my biggest mistake today.
“Obviously when Novak is at this level, it’s difficult. I had my chances. It was a really close match. I think most of the crucial points, it went to his side. When Novak is playing at this level, it’s really difficult to find the way.”
Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion, was philosophical after her defeat, saying she would have felt crushed a couple of years ago but the world had not ended.
“Now I think it’s just (feeling) disappointed that I could have done a little bit better in some areas,” she said.
Defeats for Gauff and Paul removed two of the five Americans who made the quarter-finals, with Emma Navarro, Madison Keys and Ben Shelton in action on Wednesday.

Title: Liverpool beat Lille to maintain perfect record and reach last 16
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:25:50 +0000
Content: Liverpool booked their spot in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 2-1 victory over 10-man Lille on Tuesday at Anfield, thanks to goals from talisman Mohamed Salah and substitute Harvey Elliott.
Arne Slot’s men maintained their 100% record and are top of the 36-team table with 21 points, three points clear of second-placed Barcelona with one game of the league phase remaining. Lille are 11th with 13 points.
Salah netted his 50th European goal for Liverpool in the 34th minute when he sprinted onto a long pass from Curtis Jones after Kostas Tsimikas won the ball inside the Reds’ half, and then curled a shot around goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.
“Special is, I think, the word that describes Mo’s performance at this club,” Slot said. “Or maybe there are even better words to use, but he’s been outstanding for this club for so many years, and still he does. Today, great goal.”
Despite being reduced to 10 men when Aissa Mandi was shown his second yellow card in the 59th minute for his tackle on Luis Diaz, Jonathan David levelled for the visitors three minutes later when he hammered home the loose ball after Hakon Arnar Haraldsson’s shot was blocked.
The strike was David’s fifth in the competition’s league phase this season and only the second goal Liverpool had conceded, with the first coming in their opening game at AC Milan.
Liverpool quickly regained the lead when a corner was headed out to the edge of the box and Elliott fired a crisp shot that took a wild deflection into the net in the 67th minute.
“Very good team,” David said of Liverpool. “I think they might be the best team in the world at the moment.
“We came against the first of the Champions League group so we knew it was going to be a complicated game even more so when we went to 10 men,” he added. “It’s frustrating, we wanted to hold on as long as we could but it’s very difficult.”
Darwin Nunez celebrated what he thought was Liverpool’s third goal just before added time, but it was chalked off for offside. The Anfield crowd chanted Nunez’s name in appreciation of the effort.
Lille showed why they were unbeaten in 21 successive games in all competitions inside the opening minute on Tuesday when Gabriel Gudmundsson’s thunderous shot from outside of the box sailed just wide of the net.
Salah squandered several terrific chances. He could not quite connect with Diaz’s blistering square ball in the first half, and then had only the keeper to beat in the 44th minute but shot wide of the post.
Liverpool travel to PSV Eindhoven for their final match of the league phase on Jan. 29, while Lille host Feyenoord.

Title: Trump announces private-sector $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 05:16:52 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology.
Trump said that ChatGPT’s creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said will build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
The first of the project’s data centers are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference. Twenty will be built, half a million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyzes electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
The executives gave Trump credit for the news. “We wouldn’t have decided to do this,” Son told Trump, “unless you won.”
“For AGI to get built here,” said Altman, referring to more powerful technology called artificial general intelligence, “we wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.”
It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a $100 billion data center project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer also called “Stargate” set to launch in 2028.
POWER-HUNGRY DATA CENTERS
The announcement on Trump’s second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
AI requires enormous computing power, pushing demand for specialized data centers that enable tech companies to link thousands of chips together in clusters.
“They have to produce a lot of electricity, and we’ll make it possible for them to get that production done very easily at their own plants if they want,” Trump said.
As U.S. power consumption rises from AI data centers and the electrification of buildings and transportation, about half of the country is at increased risk of power supply shortfalls in the next decade, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation said in December.
As a candidate in 2016, Trump promised to push a $1 trillion infrastructure bill through Congress but did not. He talked about the topic often during his first term as president from 2017 to 2021, but never delivered on a large investment, and “Infrastructure Week” became a punchline.
Oracle shares were up 7% on initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and shares also rose.
Investment in AI has surged since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, as companies across sectors have sought to integrate artificial intelligence into their products and services.

Title: Centre seeks to accelerate ₹24,000 crore PM JANMAN initiative for tribal welfare
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:28:15 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) hosted a National Conference of District Magistrates at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi on Tuesday, to accelerate the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN).
Launched on November 15, 2023, to commemorate Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, the initiative seeks to enhance the socio-economic conditions of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) across the country.
With a ₹24,000 crore budget allocated over three years (2023-2026), PM JANMAN aims to bridge developmental gaps in tribal areas by providing essential services, including housing, healthcare, education, clean drinking water, road connectivity, and sustainable livelihood opportunities. The program is a collaborative effort involving nine Ministries and Departments, with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs serving as the nodal body.
The conference brought together District Magistrates and their teams from 88 districts across 18 states. Discussions centered on six key focus areas: housing, road connectivity, drinking water, operationalization of Anganwadis, establishment of school hostels, and development of Multi-Purpose Centres (MPCs).
Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram, in his inaugural address, highlighted the vital role of District Magistrates as nodal officers in ensuring the effective implementation of PM JANMAN. He urged them to prioritize the active participation of tribal communities to fulfill vision of Viksit Bharat. Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Durgadas Uikey emphasized the importance of efficient execution.
The conference sessions were organized around thematic discussions moderated by representatives from various Ministries. Topics included the progress of housing construction under rural development schemes, improvements in road connectivity, ensuring reliable drinking water supply under the Jal Jeevan Mission, operationalizing Anganwadi Centres for early childhood care, establishing school hostels, and developing Multi-Purpose Centres to serve PVTG communities. The scaling up of Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs) to promote tribal livelihoods was also a key focus.
High-performing districts shared their best practices, offering valuable insights for replication in other regions. The conference concluded with the presentation of consolidated action plans and a renewed commitment to bridging the policy-to-grassroots gap.

Title: CBI to seek death penalty for Sanjay Roy in RG Kar rape and murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:15:08 +0000
Content: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will seek the death penalty for Sanjay Roy, the convict in the RG Kar rape and murder case. According to sources, the application may be filed in the Calcutta High Court within the next two days.
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 27.
Earlier today, the West Bengal government appealed to the High Court division bench against the trial court’s life imprisonment verdict convicting Sanjay Roy.
Advocate General Kishore Dutta approached the division bench of Justice Debangshu Basak, seeking the death penalty. The matter has been allowed to be filed.
The Sealdah Civil and Criminal Court announced life imprisonment for the accused Sanjay Roy in the RG Kar rape and murder case. Along with this, the court has also fined Rs 50,000 to the accused.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has publicly opposed the life sentence given to Roy, and said that if the Kolkata police had investigated the case then they would have ensured a death penalty.
“I learned about the sentencing from the media. We have always demanded capital punishment and we continue to stand by it. However, this is the court’s decision and I can’t say much about this. For three other cases, Kolkata police ensured capital punishment through thorough investigations concluded within 54-60 days. This was a serious case. Had it been under our purview, we would have ensured the death penalty long back,” CM Mamata said while addressing the media at Malda.
On Monday, RG Kar’s rape and murder case victim’s father rejected the Rs 17 lakh compensation and said that he will move to a higher court seeking the death penalty for the accused.
BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari extended support to the parents of the trainee doctor and also supported their decision to challenge the life sentence of main culprit.
Speaking to ANI, after meeting with the family of RG Kar rape and murder case victim Adhikari said, “I am standing with the family since the first day. I have talked to the parents. We support the family’s decision to reject the compensation and move to the higher courts for the further fight.”

Title: $500 billion Stargate AI project in US presents golden opportunity for India: Industry
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:14:24 +0000
Content: The $500 billion Stargate Project, a brainchild of OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle, and others, presents a golden opportunity for India to accelerate its AI ambitions by deepening partnerships with the US, industry experts said on Wednesday.
This can be achieved by leveraging India’s role in the Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) agreement between the two nations and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)—co-developing cutting-edge technologies and scaling its domestic capabilities.
“Proactive diplomacy, leveraging India’s role in iCET and IPEF, strategic investments, and collaborative approaches will be key to ensuring that India not only benefits from the global advancements in AI but also establishes itself as a formidable player in the international AI landscape,” said Ashok Chandak, President of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).
While the primary objective of the Stargate Project is to solidify the US’ leadership in the AI ecosystem, it also offers opportunities for India to leverage.
Major companies supporting this initiative—such as Nvidia, Arm, Microsoft, Softbank, Oracle, and OpenAI—already have a significant presence in India and actively utilize Indian talent.
“This offers Indian professionals opportunities to contribute to this monumental project, helping them enhance their expertise in cutting-edge AI technologies,” Chandak added.
There is cautious optimism that the US administration might consider industry feedback during the 120-day review period and adopt a more relaxed stance on AI export controls, especially toward India and other strategic partners.
According to Dr. Ajai Chowdhry, founder of HCL and chairman of the National Quantum Mission, this initiative shows serious intent by the US to maintain strong control over AI, in addition to dominating the ownership of large language models (LLMs).
“For strategic autonomy, we must create our own AI doctrine and start controlling our own data strongly. Also, we must develop domestic hardware for data centers, as it will be increasingly difficult to control our data otherwise,” Chowdhry emphasized.
The government and the industry must work together to create a fresh strategy for AI, he added.
India launched the IndiaAI Mission last year to enhance AI-related developments in the country. The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved an allocation of over Rs 10,300 crore for the IndiaAI Mission, marking a significant step toward bolstering the AI ecosystem in the country.
According to the government, nearly 8.6 lakh candidates have enrolled in the IndiaAI ‘Future Skills’ initiative, developed in collaboration with industry partners, to provide training aligned with the latest requirements.

Title: India’s soft power at its grandest
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:52:33 +0000
Content: Mahakumbh is creating waves in India and abroad. Hindu devotees having connections to various branches of Sanatana thought, Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shaakta, those who follow the tenets of a particular Guru or Ashram and those who follow no one….all are converging in Prayagraj, so aptly called Teetharaj or the king of pilgrimages in our scriptures. 
The primary aim of every person joining this sea of humanity is to take a dip in the Sangam, the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the not-visible-but very-much-there Saraswati.
Though grossly inadequate, the only analogy that comes to mind while describing the Mahakumbh is the oft quoted story of the Elephant and the six blind men.
Is the Mahakumbh the biggest human congregation on the planet? It is.
Is the Mahakumbh a melting pot where saints, philosophers, connoisseurs of all schools of thought of Hinduism converge to debate and discuss their contradictions and commonalities? It is. 
Is the Mahakumbh the biggest occasion for local traders, artisans, performers and producers of goods to showcase their talent and products to an audience and customer base that is not humanly possible otherwise? It is.
Is it an unending source of news or ‘content’ (as it is known today) for the mass media? It is.
Is it a photographers/ videographers’ delight and an endless source of ‘characters’ to story tellers and writers? It is.
Is it Bharat pulsating with its unity and diversity at every step? It is.
The Mahakumbh is all of these and a lot, lot more. It is beyond the realm of words to describe what the Kumbh stands for.
For the media, the Mahakumbh is an occasion to capture glimpses of Naga Sadhus, saints and ascetics who are Digamber (sky-clad) and are rarely seen in society except during Kumbh Melas. While the Naga Sadhu parampara (tradition) tells us how far saints and ascetics have gone to become warriors for Dharma, it would be a travesty to focus only on Naga Sadhus in the Kumbh. Likewise with the Akharas and Ashrams.
Today, the Mahakumbh stands as a collage of India’s soft power. It is exotic but also progressive. It has modern tents and yagyashalas with state of the art facilities where the enlightened are debating the Shastras and deliberating on the challenges ahead for Hinduism. It has philanthropists pumping in crores for charity while small time traders go for a killing by showcasing their goods to a customer base they could never have imagined.
For those who care to look, it shows why Sanatana continues to be what the term stands for….FOREVER!
It shows why India is and will remain proud of its roots.
Bhakti and Brand
Now let us take a look at some statistics. By a conservative estimate, the Mahakumbh is expected to generate a business of at least two lakh crores. A columnist termed it as the ultimate confluence of Brand and Bhakti. Actually it should have been Bhakti and Brand because it is the spiritual that motivates one to proceed to the Mahakumbh but once you are there you need your daily necessaries and a little more.
Infrastructure/ Tertiary Growth :
It is naive to think that 40 crores (400 million) people could be accommodated from all far corners of India and the world without a massive infra boost to support it. This columnist is an eye witness to the removal of encroachments and widening of roads undertaken three years ago to prepare the holy city of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh. 
Very small issues which often escape the eye like introduction of battery operated three wheelers, developing multiple railway stations to spread the passenger load, encouraging locals to make home stays and a highway connectivity with all parts of Uttar Pradesh had been undertaken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the run up to the ultimate event.
Tourism cannot be divorced from Adhyatma :
One cannot segregate tourism from Teertha in this country. From time immemorial, Indians have combined their wanderlust with the thirst for spiritual. Is it not a fact that an ordinary Indian family always enquires about the famous local temple the moment it comes out of a railway station or the airport? From Kamakhya in Guwahati to Rameshwaram in the South, vacations and pilgrimages have always been one ‘package’ for the average Indian.
Back to Basics:
The Mahakumbh could have been left to its own devices much like the previous years. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is firm on his belief that Bharat’s spiritual moorings are not to be ashamed of. They are the bedrock of our culture and civilisational strength. India cannot progress if it is divorced or segregated from its spiritual moorings.
That is why the Mahakumbh is NOT a spectacle as the BBC prod have us believe.
It is the spiritual foundation on which centuries of Sanatana traditions have evolved and flourished to give mankind the direction for a more enlightened outlook towards life.
The Mahakumbh is Bharat displayed in all its entirety within a span of 4000 hectares. It’s where humanity resides and the Gods descend to share the bliss.

Title: Mumbai Police visit Saif Ali Khan’s home to record statement in stabbing case
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:49:37 +0000
Content: Mumbai Police visited Saif Ali Khan’s Bandra residence on Wednesday to record his statement regarding the stabbing incident.  
Khan, who was attacked at his home last week, was discharged from Lilavati Hospital on Tuesday after five days of treatment. His return home was accompanied by heavy police security, with visuals showing the actor leaving the hospital smiling and waving at the paparazzi. Khan also greeted fans and media gathered outside his residence as he made his way back.  
Notably, actor Ronit Roy, known for his work in television and films, was seen accompanying Khan during his return. Roy’s presence raised questions as he appeared to coordinate with police officials and oversee security arrangements at the residence shared by Khan and his wife, Kareena Kapoor.  
It was later confirmed that Saif had hired Ronit Roy’s security firm, ‘Ace Security and Protection’, to enhance his safety following the attack.  
Last week, an intruder identified as Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad entered Khan’s residence with the intent to steal. A violent confrontation ensued when the actor intervened, during which Khan sustained stab wounds to his thoracic spine. He was immediately rushed to Lilavati Hospital for treatment.  
Mumbai Police launched an investigation and registered a case under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS). The accused, Shehzad, was apprehended in Thane’s Hiranandani Estate while attempting to flee to his native village in Bangladesh. 
According to police reports, Shehzad hails from the Jhalokati district of Bangladesh.

Title: Government approves Rs 315 hike in raw jute MSP for 2025-26
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:10:04 +0000
Content: The Centre has approved a Rs. 315 increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of raw jute for the marketing season of 2025-26. The new MSP for raw jute will be set at Rs. 5,650 per quintal, up from Rs. 5,335 per quintal for the previous season.
This increase follows the government’s long-term policy of linking the MSP to the average cost of production. Since 2014-15, the MSP of raw jute has risen from Rs. 2,400 per quintal to the current level, a growth of Rs. 3,250 per quintal (2.35 times). In total, the government has paid Rs. 1,300 crore in MSP to jute farmers between 2014-15 and 2024-25, compared to Rs. 441 crore from 2004-05 to 2013-14.
The jute industry supports the livelihoods of approximately 40 lakh farm families, directly or indirectly. About 4 lakh workers are employed in jute mills and related trades. Last year, jute was procured from 1.7 lakh farmers. West Bengal accounts for 82% of jute production, with Assam and Bihar contributing 9% each.
The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) will remain the central government’s nodal agency for price support operations, according to a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The government will fully reimburse any losses JCI incurs during these operations, the statement added.

Title: India witnesses 8 percent jump in average flat size in 2024, NCR sees 29 percent rise
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:54:58 +0000
Content: The average flat size in India’s top seven cities grew by 8 percent in 2024, rising from 1,420 square feet in 2023 to 1,540 square feet, according to a report released on Wednesday.
The National Capital Region (NCR) saw the steepest rise at 29 percent – from 1,890 square feet in 2023 to 2,435 square feet in 2024, largely due to the increased supply of luxury housing, according to Anarock Group.
In 2019, the average flat size in these cities was 1,145 square feet, indicating a substantial 34 percent increase over the past six years.
Anuj Puri, Chairman of Anarock Group, attributed the surge primarily to the increased supply of new luxury housing in NCR over the past year.
“Developers here are closely tracking and responding to demand, which is why NCR has seen significant new supply in the Rs 1.5 crore and above price bracket. Size is one of the key defining characteristics of luxury homes,” he said.
Of the 36,735 units launched in 2023, the luxury segment comprised 40 percent. In 2024, this segment accounted for 70 percent of the 53,000 units launched in NCR.
“The chronically space-constrained Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) saw the lowest average flat size growth in this six-year period,” Puri added.
The average flat size in MMR was 784 square feet in 2019 and increased by 8 percent to 849 square feet in 2024. From 2020 onward, the average size in MMR reached its highest point in 2024, at 849 square feet.
Average flat sizes in other southern cities, such as Chennai and Bengaluru, were 1,445 and 1,660 square feet, respectively, in 2024. Kolkata’s average flat size stood at 1,149 square feet, while in Pune, it was 1,135 square feet in 2024.
In NCR, the average flat size increased by 95 percent over the last six years – from 1,250 square feet in 2019 to 2,435 square feet in 2024, according to the report.

Title: What is fluoride and why is it added to the US water supply?
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 10:39:42 +0000
Content: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. President Donald Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has said Trump will call for an end to adding fluoride to public water supplies. Trump has not announced a position but said it is possible he would make such a recommendation.
Recent developments surrounding the issue include new studies reporting on the potential risks and benefits of fluoride exposure. Here is what you need to know about fluoridation of drinking water as a public health measure.
WHAT IS FLUORIDE AND WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS?
Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in water, soil and air that has been demonstrated to prevent dental cavities, or tooth decay. It works by strengthening the tooth’s enamel, its hard outer surface, making it more resistant to the acid produced by bacteria that cause tooth decay. Fluoride also reverses early tooth decay by replacing and preventing loss of minerals in teeth.
Prior to the beginning of community water fluoridation, tooth decay was widespread and severe among Americans. After fluoride was added in many places to the U.S. water supply, tooth decay declined in both children and adults, and complete tooth loss in older adults became more rare, according to federal health officials.
WHAT DO RECENT STUDIES SHOW ABOUT FLUORIDE BENEFITS?
In January, researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health who analyzed 74 studies from 10 countries found IQs were lower in children with higher fluoride exposure. In four studies with a low risk of bias involving  4,179 children, urinary fluoride concentrations at levels reportedly common in developed countries were associated with lower IQ scores, the researchers reported.
The results “support concerns for vulnerable populations living in communities with fluoridated water,” according to an editorial published with the report. A second editorial, however, details multiple weaknesses of the NIH analyses and warns that public policy concerning fluoride “should not be affected by the study findings.”
A review published in October 2024 by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews raised questions about the value of fluoridation of public drinking water in wealthy countries based on the findings of 157 studies.
The research suggests that given the widespread addition of fluoride to toothpaste since 1975, community water fluoridation may now have only modest benefits in reducing tooth decay and increasing cavity-free children, compared to the effects seen in earlier studies. New lawsuits, however, are challenging manufacturers on the safety of fluoride levels in toothpaste, too.
The review also found there is not enough evidence to determine the impact of stopping fluoridation or its effect on socioeconomic disparities in dental health.
WHEN DID WATER FLUORIDATION AS A POLICY BEGIN?
In the early 20th century, some U.S. researchers observed that people who lived in areas where community water supplies had naturally occurring high levels of fluoride had teeth that were resistant to decay.
In 1945, the Michigan city of Grand Rapids became the first to add fluoride to its water supply in a controlled manner, kicking off what was in effect a large-scale public health experiment. Data over a 15-year span showed a reduction of more than 60% in tooth decay among 30,000 school children in Grand Rapids, demonstrating fluoride’s protective benefits.
By the 1950s, the U.S. government’s Public Health Service and the American Dental Association acknowledged the success of water fluoridation in reducing cavities. This led to the broad U.S. adoption of adding fluoride in community water supplies and eventually its inclusion in dental products such as toothpaste and mouthwash.
No federal law mandates fluoridation of water supplies. The decision to fluoridate water is typically made by municipal governments, city councils or local water authorities.
HOW WIDESPREAD IS FLUORIDATION IN THE U.S.?
About 63% of all Americans have fluoride in their community water systems, according to CDC statistics as of 2022.
According to the American Dental Association, the average cost per year for U.S. communities to fluoridate their water supplies ranges from 50 cents per person for large communities to $3 per person for small communities.
In most of the world, fluoride is not added to the public water supply. Some countries add fluoride to table salt. In some regions, fluoride levels in water are naturally high.
ARE FLUORIDE LEVELS REGULATED?
The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that drinking water levels for fluoride remain below 0.7 milligrams per liter. Levels above 1.5 mg/L are known to increase health risks such as bone fractures, thyroid disease and nervous system damage.
The enforceable limit as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 4.0 mg/L. A federal judge in California recently ordered the EPA to strengthen its regulations.
WHAT COMPANIES MAKE FLUORIDE?
Fluorosilicic acid is the compound most widely used in water systems as it yields free fluoride rapidly when mixed with water. J.R. Simplot and Nutrien’s  Phosphate Company are among companies that manufacture the product, according to the EPA.
Total U.S. domestic production of fluorosilicic acid from phosphate rock was approximately 29 million kilograms (32,000 tons) in 2019, according to EPA statistics.
WHAT DID KENNEDY SAY?
Kennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who subsequently endorsed Trump, is Trump’s pick to be U.S. health secretary. In a social media post three days before Trump was elected, Kennedy wrote that on Jan. 20, “the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” noting the day of Trump’s inauguration.
Kennedy has claimed in the absence of conclusive evidence that water fluoridation at U.S. levels is associated with numerous health issues including cancer.
WHAT DO PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAY?
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called fluoridation of drinking water one of the nation’s top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century, noting that it effectively prevents tooth decay regardless of a person’s socioeconomic status or access to care.
The American Dental Association has reiterated its support for community water fluoridation to help prevent tooth decay. Studies show that community water fluoridation reduces tooth decay by more than 25% in children and adults even in an era with widespread availability of fluoride from other sources such as toothpaste, the association said.
Adding fluoride to the water supply has been a boon to the dental health of Americans, and research shows there is a very low risk of adverse consequences, according to Kellogg Schwab of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland.
Not all officials agree. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who had a history of controversial public health stances during the COVID-19 pandemic, recently recommended against adding fluoride to community water supplies, citing inconclusive studies that suggest the practice poses a risk to children’s brains.

Title: RG Kar case: CBI approaches Calcutta HC seeking death penalty for convict
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 16:43:59 +0000
Content: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday filed a petition at the Calcutta High Court seeking the death penalty for Sanjay Roy, the sole convict in the case of ghastly rape and murder of a junior woman doctor on the premises of state-run R.G. Kar Medical College & Hospital in Kolkata last year in August.
Sources aware of the development said that the CBI’s special crime unit office in Kolkata has taken this step following an instruction from the central probe agency’s headquarters in Delhi.
Notably, earlier on Wednesday morning, the CBI had opposed the petition by the West Bengal government in the Calcutta High Court challenging the verdict of a special court in Kolkata on January 20 sentencing Roy to life imprisonment. The state government in its plea sought the death penalty for the convict.
The CBI challenged the state government petition on grounds that it does not have any locus standi to make such an appeal.
The contention of the CBI counsel was that it is only CBI, as the sole investigation agency in the matter and the victim’s parents, who could move such a plea at a higher court, and not the state government, which is not a party in the case.
“Whether the state government’s petition on this count will be admissible or not will be heard in the Calcutta High Court on January 27,” a source said.
To recall, after the body of the junior woman doctor was recovered from a seminar hall within the R.G. Kar premises on the morning of August 9, 2024, the initial investigation was carried out by the Kolkata Police.
It was the Kolkata Police which first arrested Roy. However, after five days of initial investigation by the city police, the charge of the probe into the matter was handed over to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court.

Title: Centre seeks to accelerate ₹24,000 crore PM JANMAN initiative for tribal welfare
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:28:15 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) hosted a National Conference of District Magistrates at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi on Tuesday, to accelerate the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN).
Launched on November 15, 2023, to commemorate Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, the initiative seeks to enhance the socio-economic conditions of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) across the country.
With a ₹24,000 crore budget allocated over three years (2023-2026), PM JANMAN aims to bridge developmental gaps in tribal areas by providing essential services, including housing, healthcare, education, clean drinking water, road connectivity, and sustainable livelihood opportunities. The program is a collaborative effort involving nine Ministries and Departments, with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs serving as the nodal body.
The conference brought together District Magistrates and their teams from 88 districts across 18 states. Discussions centered on six key focus areas: housing, road connectivity, drinking water, operationalization of Anganwadis, establishment of school hostels, and development of Multi-Purpose Centres (MPCs).
Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram, in his inaugural address, highlighted the vital role of District Magistrates as nodal officers in ensuring the effective implementation of PM JANMAN. He urged them to prioritize the active participation of tribal communities to fulfill vision of Viksit Bharat. Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Durgadas Uikey emphasized the importance of efficient execution.
The conference sessions were organized around thematic discussions moderated by representatives from various Ministries. Topics included the progress of housing construction under rural development schemes, improvements in road connectivity, ensuring reliable drinking water supply under the Jal Jeevan Mission, operationalizing Anganwadi Centres for early childhood care, establishing school hostels, and developing Multi-Purpose Centres to serve PVTG communities. The scaling up of Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs) to promote tribal livelihoods was also a key focus.
High-performing districts shared their best practices, offering valuable insights for replication in other regions. The conference concluded with the presentation of consolidated action plans and a renewed commitment to bridging the policy-to-grassroots gap.

Title: CBI to seek death penalty for Sanjay Roy in RG Kar rape and murder case
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:15:08 +0000
Content: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will seek the death penalty for Sanjay Roy, the convict in the RG Kar rape and murder case. According to sources, the application may be filed in the Calcutta High Court within the next two days.
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 27.
Earlier today, the West Bengal government appealed to the High Court division bench against the trial court’s life imprisonment verdict convicting Sanjay Roy.
Advocate General Kishore Dutta approached the division bench of Justice Debangshu Basak, seeking the death penalty. The matter has been allowed to be filed.
The Sealdah Civil and Criminal Court announced life imprisonment for the accused Sanjay Roy in the RG Kar rape and murder case. Along with this, the court has also fined Rs 50,000 to the accused.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has publicly opposed the life sentence given to Roy, and said that if the Kolkata police had investigated the case then they would have ensured a death penalty.
“I learned about the sentencing from the media. We have always demanded capital punishment and we continue to stand by it. However, this is the court’s decision and I can’t say much about this. For three other cases, Kolkata police ensured capital punishment through thorough investigations concluded within 54-60 days. This was a serious case. Had it been under our purview, we would have ensured the death penalty long back,” CM Mamata said while addressing the media at Malda.
On Monday, RG Kar’s rape and murder case victim’s father rejected the Rs 17 lakh compensation and said that he will move to a higher court seeking the death penalty for the accused.
BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari extended support to the parents of the trainee doctor and also supported their decision to challenge the life sentence of main culprit.
Speaking to ANI, after meeting with the family of RG Kar rape and murder case victim Adhikari said, “I am standing with the family since the first day. I have talked to the parents. We support the family’s decision to reject the compensation and move to the higher courts for the further fight.”

Title: $500 billion Stargate AI project in US presents golden opportunity for India: Industry
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:14:24 +0000
Content: The $500 billion Stargate Project, a brainchild of OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle, and others, presents a golden opportunity for India to accelerate its AI ambitions by deepening partnerships with the US, industry experts said on Wednesday.
This can be achieved by leveraging India’s role in the Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) agreement between the two nations and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)—co-developing cutting-edge technologies and scaling its domestic capabilities.
“Proactive diplomacy, leveraging India’s role in iCET and IPEF, strategic investments, and collaborative approaches will be key to ensuring that India not only benefits from the global advancements in AI but also establishes itself as a formidable player in the international AI landscape,” said Ashok Chandak, President of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).
While the primary objective of the Stargate Project is to solidify the US’ leadership in the AI ecosystem, it also offers opportunities for India to leverage.
Major companies supporting this initiative—such as Nvidia, Arm, Microsoft, Softbank, Oracle, and OpenAI—already have a significant presence in India and actively utilize Indian talent.
“This offers Indian professionals opportunities to contribute to this monumental project, helping them enhance their expertise in cutting-edge AI technologies,” Chandak added.
There is cautious optimism that the US administration might consider industry feedback during the 120-day review period and adopt a more relaxed stance on AI export controls, especially toward India and other strategic partners.
According to Dr. Ajai Chowdhry, founder of HCL and chairman of the National Quantum Mission, this initiative shows serious intent by the US to maintain strong control over AI, in addition to dominating the ownership of large language models (LLMs).
“For strategic autonomy, we must create our own AI doctrine and start controlling our own data strongly. Also, we must develop domestic hardware for data centers, as it will be increasingly difficult to control our data otherwise,” Chowdhry emphasized.
The government and the industry must work together to create a fresh strategy for AI, he added.
India launched the IndiaAI Mission last year to enhance AI-related developments in the country. The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved an allocation of over Rs 10,300 crore for the IndiaAI Mission, marking a significant step toward bolstering the AI ecosystem in the country.
According to the government, nearly 8.6 lakh candidates have enrolled in the IndiaAI ‘Future Skills’ initiative, developed in collaboration with industry partners, to provide training aligned with the latest requirements.

Title: Sensex jumps 566 points, Nifty holds at 23,000 as US tariff fears ease
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:57:00 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market experienced significant movement on Wednesday, as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty recovered in the latter half of the day after concerns over potential US trade tariffs eased.
At the close of trading, the BSE Sensex rose by 566 points, or 0.75%, to close at 76,404.99. The Nifty 50 gained 130.7 points, or 0.57%, ending at 23,155. During the day, the Sensex reached an intra-day low of 75,817, and the Nifty fell to 22,981 before recovering.

On the Nifty 50, 26 stocks finished in the green, while 24 closed in the red, with one remaining unchanged.
The broader market underperformed compared to the benchmark indices. The Nifty SmallCap index fell by 2.7%, while the Nifty MidCap index dropped 2.3%.
Sector-wise, there was notable weakness in some areas. The Nifty Realty index declined by 5%, the Nifty PSU Bank index fell by 2%, and the Nifty Metal index decreased by 1.8%.

Title: India’s soft power at its grandest
Publication Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:52:33 +0000
Content: Mahakumbh is creating waves in India and abroad. Hindu devotees having connections to various branches of Sanatana thought, Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shaakta, those who follow the tenets of a particular Guru or Ashram and those who follow no one….all are converging in Prayagraj, so aptly called Teetharaj or the king of pilgrimages in our scriptures. 
The primary aim of every person joining this sea of humanity is to take a dip in the Sangam, the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the not-visible-but very-much-there Saraswati.
Though grossly inadequate, the only analogy that comes to mind while describing the Mahakumbh is the oft quoted story of the Elephant and the six blind men.
Is the Mahakumbh the biggest human congregation on the planet? It is.
Is the Mahakumbh a melting pot where saints, philosophers, connoisseurs of all schools of thought of Hinduism converge to debate and discuss their contradictions and commonalities? It is. 
Is the Mahakumbh the biggest occasion for local traders, artisans, performers and producers of goods to showcase their talent and products to an audience and customer base that is not humanly possible otherwise? It is.
Is it an unending source of news or ‘content’ (as it is known today) for the mass media? It is.
Is it a photographers/ videographers’ delight and an endless source of ‘characters’ to story tellers and writers? It is.
Is it Bharat pulsating with its unity and diversity at every step? It is.
The Mahakumbh is all of these and a lot, lot more. It is beyond the realm of words to describe what the Kumbh stands for.
For the media, the Mahakumbh is an occasion to capture glimpses of Naga Sadhus, saints and ascetics who are Digamber (sky-clad) and are rarely seen in society except during Kumbh Melas. While the Naga Sadhu parampara (tradition) tells us how far saints and ascetics have gone to become warriors for Dharma, it would be a travesty to focus only on Naga Sadhus in the Kumbh. Likewise with the Akharas and Ashrams.
Today, the Mahakumbh stands as a collage of India’s soft power. It is exotic but also progressive. It has modern tents and yagyashalas with state of the art facilities where the enlightened are debating the Shastras and deliberating on the challenges ahead for Hinduism. It has philanthropists pumping in crores for charity while small time traders go for a killing by showcasing their goods to a customer base they could never have imagined.
For those who care to look, it shows why Sanatana continues to be what the term stands for….FOREVER!
It shows why India is and will remain proud of its roots.
Bhakti and Brand
Now let us take a look at some statistics. By a conservative estimate, the Mahakumbh is expected to generate a business of at least two lakh crores. A columnist termed it as the ultimate confluence of Brand and Bhakti. Actually it should have been Bhakti and Brand because it is the spiritual that motivates one to proceed to the Mahakumbh but once you are there you need your daily necessaries and a little more.
Infrastructure/ Tertiary Growth :
It is naive to think that 40 crores (400 million) people could be accommodated from all far corners of India and the world without a massive infra boost to support it. This columnist is an eye witness to the removal of encroachments and widening of roads undertaken three years ago to prepare the holy city of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh. 
Very small issues which often escape the eye like introduction of battery operated three wheelers, developing multiple railway stations to spread the passenger load, encouraging locals to make home stays and a highway connectivity with all parts of Uttar Pradesh had been undertaken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the run up to the ultimate event.
Tourism cannot be divorced from Adhyatma :
One cannot segregate tourism from Teertha in this country. From time immemorial, Indians have combined their wanderlust with the thirst for spiritual. Is it not a fact that an ordinary Indian family always enquires about the famous local temple the moment it comes out of a railway station or the airport? From Kamakhya in Guwahati to Rameshwaram in the South, vacations and pilgrimages have always been one ‘package’ for the average Indian.
Back to Basics:
The Mahakumbh could have been left to its own devices much like the previous years. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is firm on his belief that Bharat’s spiritual moorings are not to be ashamed of. They are the bedrock of our culture and civilisational strength. India cannot progress if it is divorced or segregated from its spiritual moorings.
That is why the Mahakumbh is NOT a spectacle as the BBC prod have us believe.
It is the spiritual foundation on which centuries of Sanatana traditions have evolved and flourished to give mankind the direction for a more enlightened outlook towards life.
The Mahakumbh is Bharat displayed in all its entirety within a span of 4000 hectares. It’s where humanity resides and the Gods descend to share the bliss.

Title: Djokovic Braced for Zverev Battle
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 07:14:17 +0000
Content: Djokovic and Zverev have met 12 times before, with the Serb winning on eight occasions including their latest encounter at the 2023 Cincinnati Open.
Zverev, who struggled to hit top form during two seasons disrupted by serious injury, looked back to his best last year, winning the Masters 1000 titles in Rome and Paris as well finishing runner-up at the French Open.
The German knocked out American 12th seed Tommy Paul in the last round to reach a third Australian Open semi-final and he believes he has what it takes to get the better of Djokovic.
“I’m going to prepare myself for a very intense and high-level match,” Zverev told reporters. “I know I have the level. Hopefully I can do that again (beat him).”
At 27, the second seed is still seeking his first Grand Slam title and hopes to become the first German man to win the Australian Open since Boris Becker in 1996.
Djokovic, the last member of the ‘Big Three’ still standing following the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, appeared hampered by an injury early in his thrilling win over Alcaraz but hopes to be fighting fit to face Zverev.
“It is definitely going to be challenging from every aspect I mean, I am playing Zverev, who is in a great form, and he is going for his first Grand Slam,” Djokovic said.
“I think he loves the conditions. He’s got big serve. He’s super dangerous opponent on this surface against anyone. The extra day with no match comes at a good time. I will try to do as much as I possibly can with my recovery team…
“But if I manage somehow to … be physically good enough, I think mentally, emotionally I’m as motivated as I can be.”
Sinner Seeks to Maintain Dominance Over Shelton
Sinner easily dispensed with home favourite and eighth seed Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals and looks to have shrugged off the medical issue that left him dizzy and shaking against Holger Rune in the last 16.
While Sinner is into his fifth Grand Slam semi-final, Shelton, who turned pro in 2022, is set to play just his second after reaching the last four at the 2023 U.S. Open.
Sinner holds a 4-1 head-to-head record against Shelton but the 23-year-old Italian remains cautious ahead of their clash.
“One of the biggest serves we have on tour,” Sinner said. “He’s a very aggressive player, an all-around player. He can go to the net. He can stay back.
“It’s a difficult match for both of us. We know each other a little bit better now. We had some tough matches in the last year, so let’s see what’s coming.”

Title: India’s digital economy set to drive one-fifth of GDP by 2030: MeitY report
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 06:57:16 +0000
Content: India’s digital economy is projected to grow nearly twice as fast as the overall economy, contributing close to one-fifth of the country’s national income by 2030, according to a report from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
The report, titled Estimation and Measurement of India’s Digital Economy, reveals that the digital sector accounted for 11.74% of national income, amounting to ₹31.64 lakh crore (approximately USD 402 billion) in GDP, in 2022-23.
The report highlights the pivotal role of digital technologies in transforming India’s economic landscape. It employs frameworks from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to measure the digital economy, placing India among a select group of nations globally—and the first among developing countries—to undertake such an extensive evaluation.
In addition to covering core digital industries like ICT services, telecommunications, and electronics manufacturing, the study also factors in traditional sectors such as banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI), trade, and education—areas not typically included in conventional estimates.
According to the findings, the digital-enabling industry contributed the largest share of the Gross Value Added (GVA), accounting for 7.83%. Emerging digital industries, including tech giants and online platforms, added 2%, while the digitalisation of traditional sectors such as BFSI and education also contributed 2%. This indicates a broader diffusion of digital technologies across India’s economy, extending beyond the confines of the ICT sector.
The report also sheds light on the employment potential of the digital economy, which supported 14.67 million workers in 2022-23, equivalent to 2.55% of the country’s workforce.
Projections indicate that India’s digital economy will grow almost twice as fast as the overall economy, with significant gains expected from digital platforms, intermediaries, and the increasing digitalisation of traditional industries.
However, the report acknowledges that its estimates remain conservative due to data gaps, particularly in smaller digital platforms, the informal sector, and industries like health and logistics.

Title: Rohit departs for 3 in Ranji Trophy comeback, Jaiswal also falls for a low score
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 06:35:50 +0000
Content: Rohit Sharma’s much-anticipated return to the Ranji Trophy was short-lived, lasting just 19 balls for three runs in Mumbai’s Group A clash against Jammu and Kashmir at the Sharad Pawar Academy, where on Thursday.
The Indian Test and ODI captain, under scrutiny for his poor form, was in the spotlight after confirming his participation during the Champions Trophy squad announcement last week.
Rohit, opening alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal after Mumbai’s captain Ajinkya Rahane chose to bat, looked focused despite a relaxed pre-match demeanour. However, his stay was brief. J&amp;K’s Umar Nazir Mir, with a disciplined line and subtle movement, troubled Rohit with consecutive maidens. Rohit managed just a single through the on side and a couple of runs from a drive but fell to Mir’s 17th ball. A length delivery outside off with slight movement away drew a leading edge and Paras Dogra completed a straightforward catch at extra cover.
This dismissal extended Rohit’s lean patch in red-ball cricket. He finished the 2024-25 Test season averaging 10.93, with only one half-century in 15 innings. His first-class average of 10.43 in 16 innings this season is the second-lowest since 2006 for batters with at least 15 innings in the top six.
Jaiswal’s innings was also brief. Auqib Nabi exploited the morning conditions, testing the left-hander with movement and eventually trapping him lbw for four. A sharp delivery jagged back to beat Jaiswal’s inside edge, striking him deep in the crease. The umpire raised the finger without hesitation.
Mumbai made adjustments to accommodate Rohit and Jaiswal, leaving out debut season star Ayush Mhatre, who has scored 408 runs at an average of 45.33. On a cool Mumbai morning, J&amp;K’s disciplined bowling took full advantage of the conditions, leaving Mumbai’s openers struggling to make an impact.

Title: Jaishankar in US: EAM addresses India-US ties, Quad, consulate attack and migration issues
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 06:28:49 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday highlighted the growing importance of the India-US partnership in addressing global challenges.
Speaking to the media in Washington DC, he emphasized the strategic role of the Quad in maintaining regional stability and praised the evolving bilateral relationship with the United States, with India emerging as a key player in tackling global issues like climate change and security.
Strengthening Bilateral Ties with the Trump Administration
Jaishankar acknowledged the Trump administration’s strong commitment to deepening ties with India, describing it as a relationship built on a robust foundation. He highlighted how the administration was keen to have India’s presence at the inaugural event and expressed strong interest in advancing the bilateral relationship.
“If I were to share my overall impressions, I would say one, it was very keen. It was very clear that the Trump administration was keen to have India present at the inaugural itself. They’re clearly prioritising the bilateral relationship,” Jaishankar said.
“Secondly, in the meetings, it was also evident that they would like to build on the foundation of the relationship, a foundation which the first Trump administration also contributed a lot to building. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi, at that time, took a number of initiatives, and we have seen that mature in many ways,” he added.
Jaishankar also discussed the Trump administration’s commitment to furthering the Quad alliance, which includes the US, India, Japan, and Australia, noting a shared desire to “intensify its activities.”
Advancing the Quad’s Indo-Pacific Vision
Reaffirming India’s optimism about the Quad’s growing significance, Jaishankar reiterated that the partnership is crucial for fostering regional security and economic resilience in the Indo-Pacific.
A joint statement issued by the Quad Foreign Ministers on Tuesday emphasized their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, upholding democratic values, sovereignty, and international law.
“Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity, peace, stability, and security in all domains, including the maritime domain, underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific”, the statement said.
Call for Accountability in San Francisco Consulate Attack
Jaishankar condemned the 2023 arson attack on the Indian Consulate in San Francisco, describing it as a “very serious matter” and called for those responsible to be held accountable. The attack, believed to be orchestrated by pro-Khalistani protestors, involved criminal trespass, arson, and property damage. US authorities strongly condemned the incident and initiated an investigation.
“We would like to see that people who did it are held responsible,” he said,” Jaishankar said.
India’s Position on Migration: Legitimate Return and Legal Mobility
Jaishankar addressed India’s position on migration, expressing openness to the “legitimate return” of Indian nationals living abroad illegally. He made it clear that while India is against illegal migration, it supports legal mobility, promoting the movement of Indian talent and skills globally.
“If there are any of our citizens who are not here legally, and if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been open to their legitimate return to India,” he said.
He stressed that India firmly opposes illegal migration, citing its negative impact on the nation’s reputation and its potential to fuel other illegal activities.
He also emphasized the need for smoother legal migration channels between India and the US.
“As a government, we are very much supportive of legal mobility because we believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have ma…

Title: US sanctions on Russia to have minimal impact on India’s energy supply: IOC Chairman
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 06:22:17 +0000
Content: The recent sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia, coupled with warnings of further punitive measures by the new Trump administration, are expected to have limited impact on India’s energy security, according to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney. Speaking from Davos, Sahney emphasized that India has diversified its energy sources and is well-prepared to navigate any disruptions.
“It is not a very difficult thing to handle because it has a very limited effect. Whatever sanctions are there, we are abiding by them,” Sahney said. He highlighted India’s extensive network of energy suppliers, including OPEC nations, OPEC+, and other non-OPEC sources like the Gulf, Guyana, Brazil, and even the United States.
The comments come days after President Donald Trump took office and called for a resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Trump warned of additional economic measures, including taxes, tariffs, and sanctions, against Russia. These add to the extensive sanctions already imposed by the Biden administration since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.
Despite the geopolitical tensions, Sahney reassured that India’s crude oil supply would remain stable, noting the government’s willingness to increase exposure to US crude.
On international crude prices, Sahney projected they would remain range-bound between USD 75 to USD 80 per barrel, with a bias toward USD 75. “Although I have an interest in seeing them on the lower side, our detailed assessments suggest that prices will stay around USD 75,” he said. As of now, crude prices hover at approximately USD 75.5 per barrel.
City Gas Expansion and Green Energy Initiatives
Discussing IOC’s plans for city gas distribution, Sahney stated that the company already operates in 47 geographical areas and is focused on expanding infrastructure and providing more connections. “We have our hands full with the CGD business and are doing our best to develop infrastructure,” he said.
On green hydrogen development, Sahney revealed that IOC’s Panipat plant, with a production capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum, would be commissioned within two years. “We have received excellent bids, and the tenders are under evaluation. The project will be awarded within a month,” he noted.
India’s push for green hydrogen aligns with its broader National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in January 2023, with an investment of Rs 19,744 crores. The initiative aims to achieve a production capacity of 5 million tonnes by 2030, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and addressing climate change challenges.
Sahney also confirmed that IOC currently has no active acquisition plans but remains committed to its ongoing projects.

Title: Netaji epitomised courage and grit: PM Modi pays tribute on Subhas Chandra Bose’s 127th birth anniversary
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:51:41 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 127th birth anniversary, praising him as a symbol of courage and perseverance whose life continues to inspire India’s youth.
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “Today, on Parakram Diwas, I pay homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. His contribution to India’s freedom movement is unparalleled. He epitomised courage and grit. His vision continues to motivate us as we work towards building the India he envisioned.”
In addition to his post, the Prime Minister shared a video message lauding Bose’s unwavering dedication to the nation. He highlighted Bose’s selfless sacrifice, stating, “Netaji’s life was marked by hard work and valour. He gave up his personal dreams and interests for India’s independence. If he had wished, he could have lived a comfortable life, but instead, he chose the path of sacrifice for a free India.”
Modi also emphasized Bose’s role in affirming India’s cultural heritage, noting, “Netaji not only opposed foreign rule but also countered those who questioned India’s rich legacy. He was instrumental in presenting India as the ‘Mother of Democracy’ to the world. His life and contributions continue to inspire Indian youth.”
President Droupadi Murmu also paid tribute to Bose, acknowledging his monumental role in India’s freedom struggle. In a social media post, she said, “On the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, observed as Parakram Diwas, I pay my humble tribute to one of the greatest sons of Bharat Mata.” She further highlighted Bose’s leadership of the Azad Hind Fauj and his unyielding determination, which will continue to inspire generations.
Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose remains a towering symbol of patriotism and courage. In recognition of his invaluable contribution to India’s freedom struggle, the Government of India declared his birthday as ‘Parakram Diwas’ in 2021. This day serves to honour his legacy and encourage citizens, particularly the youth, to emulate his bravery and national pride.
The first Parakram Diwas was celebrated in 2021 at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata, followed by the inauguration of a holographic statue of Netaji at India Gate in 2022. Plans are also underway to construct a National Memorial dedicated to Bose on the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep.
Bose’s life was defined by sacrifice and an unwavering commitment to justice. Born into a prominent Bengali family, he initially pursued his studies at Presidency College in Kolkata but was expelled in 1916 due to his nationalist activities.
After completing his degree at Scottish Church College in 1919, he went to the University of Cambridge to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. Despite passing the examination in 1920, Bose withdrew from the civil service the following year to dedicate himself fully to India’s freedom movement.
Renowned for his indomitable spirit, visionary leadership, and dedication to equality, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose continues to inspire generations of Indians.

Title: PSG stun Manchester City with 4-2 comeback
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:44:14 +0000
Content: Paris St Germain clawed back from two goals down to stun Manchester City 4-2 in the Champions League on Wednesday and leave the English club outside the playoff places and in danger of elimination.
Goals from PSG’s Ousmane Dembele, Bradley Barcola, Joao Neves and Goncalo Ramos turned the match on its head after City had taken a 2-0 lead early in the six-goal second half.
“The team’s faith is unshakeable,” PSG manager Luis Enrique told reporters. “My team never gives up until the last second and we’ve often shown that.”
Substitute Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland struck in the 50th and 53rd minutes for City, but home fans braving torrential rain at Parc des Princes were treated to a brilliant comeback.
Dembele latched on to a cross from Barcola to sweep home a goal in the 56th minute. Then Barcola levelled four minutes later when he tucked in the rebound after Desire Doue’s blistering shot came back off the crossbar.
PSG parked themselves in City’s half and took the lead in the 78th minute when the visitors’ back line struggled to clear Vitinha’s free kick, leaving Neves to head in at the back post.
Ramos put the icing on the cake with a fine strike from just inside the 18-yard box, given after a lengthy VAR check for offside.
“To defend the result you have to keep the ball. We didn’t have it,” a deflated City manager Pep Guardiola told TNT Sports.
PSG climbed to 22nd in the table, while City, who hoisted the Champions League trophy in 2023 but have won just two of their seven group games, dropped to 25th, one spot below the playoff qualification spots.
CITY’S MUST-WIN FINALE
“We accept the defeat because the best team won and we have a last chance (to qualify) at home against Club Brugge,” Guardiola said.
City’s loss sets up a nerve-jangling finale when they host Belgian side Brugge on Jan. 29. The top eight teams qualify automatically for the last 16, while sides finishing ninth to 24th compete in two-legged knockout playoffs to secure their spot in the last 16.
“It could happen. We will see,” Guardiola said on City’s chances of going out before the knockouts. “If we don’t win (v Brugge) we don’t deserve it.”
PSG were the better side for most of Wednesday’s game and briefly celebrated a goal by Achraf Hakimi seconds before halftime that was ruled out for offside.
City seemed to be continuing their revival from weeks of poor results when Grealish rifled in the rebound from Bernardo Silva’s shot. Haaland doubled the lead when Grealish’s cross took a deflection to fall to the Norwegian who hammered home from close range.
But PSG then blitzed the English champions, who had squandered a three-goal lead against Feyenoord to draw 3-3 in November. The French side travel to VfB Stuttgart for their final game of the league phase.
Grealish had no answer for City’s letdown.
“I don’t know, usually in these moments, we’re so good,” the midfielder told TNT. “Obviously, it’s happened too many times this season … we’ve not been able to control the game and see it out. Like I said, it’s weird, because in every other season, we’ve been so good in these moments managing the game.”

Title: New wildfire near Los Angeles explodes to 9,400 acres, forces evacuations
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:23:57 +0000
Content: A new wildfire that broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday rapidly spread to more than 9,400 acres (38 square km), fueled by strong winds and dry brush, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for more than 31,000 people.
The Hughes fire about 50 miles (80 km) north of Los Angeles further taxed firefighters in the region who have managed to bring two major fires in the metropolitan area largely under control.
In just a few hours on Wednesday the new fire grew to two-thirds the size of the Eaton Fire, one of the two monster conflagrations that have ravaged the Los Angeles area.
Officials warned people in the Castaic Lake area of Los Angeles County that they faced “immediate threat to life,” while much of Southern California remained under a red-flag warning for extreme fire risk due to strong, dry winds.
Some 31,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders and another 23,000 face evacuation warnings, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told a press conference.
The Angeles National Forest said its entire 700,000-acre (2,800-sq-km) park in the San Gabriel Mountains was closed to visitors.
As a result of the red-flag warning, some 1,100 firefighters were deployed around Southern California in anticipation of fast-moving fires, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. More than 4,000 firefighters were working on the Hughes Fire, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said.
Southern California has gone without significant rain for nine months, contributing to hazardous conditions, but some rain was forecast from Saturday through Monday, possibly giving firefighters much-needed relief.
Helicopters scooped water out of a lake to drop on the fire while fixed-wing aircraft dropped fire retardant on the hills, video on KTLA television showed. Flames spread to the water’s edge.
Interstate 5, the major north-south highway in the western United States, was temporarily closed in the mountain pass areas known as the Grapevine due to poor visibility from the smoke, the California Highway Patrol said. But firefighters were able to suppress enough of the fire to reopen the highway, Marrone said.
While the new fire raged, the two deadly fires that have ravaged Los Angeles since Jan. 7 came under greater control, Cal Fire said.
The Eaton Fire that scorched 14,021 acres (57 square km) east of Los Angeles was 91% contained, while the larger Palisades Fire, which has consumed 23,448 acres (95 square km) on the west side of Los Angeles, stood at 68% contained.
Containment measures the percentage of a fire’s perimeter that firefighters have under control.
Since the two fires broke out on Jan. 7, they have burned an area nearly the size of Washington, D.C., killed 28 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures, Cal Fire said. At one point, 180,000 people were under evacuation orders, according to Los Angeles County officials.
Private forecaster AccuWeather projects damage and economic losses at more than $250 billion.
A series of smaller wildfires has been extinguished or brought largely under control in Southern California the past two weeks.

The Ayush facilities, in partnership with the National Ayush Mission, are offering complimentary consultations, medicines, and yoga sessions to both domestic and international visitors. According to the Ministry, over 80 doctors are providing round-the-clock services across 20 OPDs, addressing a range of common and chronic health conditions.
Therapeutic yoga sessions are being held daily from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM at designated camps in the Sangam area and Sector-8. These sessions are conducted by trainers from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY).
Foreign visitors are also availing themselves of Ayush services, including consultations and medicines. Additionally, efforts are underway to educate participants about advancements in Ayush systems, the use of medicinal plants, and their potential financial benefits. Free saplings are being distributed to encourage the cultivation of these plants.
The National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) has set up a display featuring medicinal plants, with experts on-site to provide information on their uses. The Ayush team has also distributed medicines such as immunity boosters and calcium tablets, with approximately 45 percent of beneficiaries being elderly individuals.
While sharing his experience, Raghunandan Prasad, a devotee from Sultanpur suffering from a skin ailment, stated, “After taking medicines from the Ayush camp, my condition has gradually improved. I am thankful to the government and Ayush for their efforts.”

Title: Centre notifies rules for verified radar equipment to boost traffic enforcement
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:34:55 +0000
Content: In an effort to help traffic personnel measure speed limits effectively, the government on Thursday notified rules for radar equipment for the measurement of speed of vehicles, under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011.
To help concerning industries comply with the provisions of rules, these guidelines will come into force from July 1, said the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in a statement.
Verified and stamped radar equipment are crucial for applications like traffic enforcement to prevent accidents and wear and tear on roads.
The verified radar equipment would significantly enhance the effectiveness and credibility of law enforcement officers in traffic enforcement.
A committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Director, Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Ranchi, which submitted the initial draft rules.
The draft rules’ presentation was made for State Legal Metrology Departments, RRSL officers, manufacturers and VCOs to explain its requirements.
According to the rules, such equipment shall be verified and stamped to ensure their correctness for the protection of human beings.
“The rules will also ensure precise measurement of speed, distance, and other relevant parameters. The public would benefit as there would be improved enforcement as verified radar speed guns will accurately measure vehicle speeds, identify violations and enforce traffic laws effectively,” said the ministry.
Speed measurement devices work by detecting the time it takes for a vehicle to travel between two points or by measuring changes in position over time using radar, laser, or other technologies.
Radar devices emit radio waves that bounce off moving vehicles, calculating speed based on the Doppler Effect.
All these methods rely on precise calibration to ensure their measurements are accurate and reliable.
Modern radar systems are highly accurate and can measure the speed of multiple vehicles simultaneously and often include features like automatic target tracking.
According to the government, proper calibration ensures the device provides reliable and precise speed readings.

Content: On the occasion of Parakram Diwas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 128th birth anniversary and interacted with students in the Central Hall of Parliament in New Delhi.
During the session, the prime minister asked the students about the nation’s vision for 2047. A student responded, “The goal is to transform India into a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed nation).” When asked why the target year was set for 2047, another student explained that the current generation would be ready to serve the nation when India celebrates the centenary of its independence.
Exploring the significance of the day, PM Modi prompted the students to share their thoughts on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary. One student replied that it was a day to commemorate the birth of Netaji, who was born in Cuttack, Odisha. The Prime Minister noted that a grand event was taking place in Cuttack to celebrate the occasion.”
The prime minister further discussed the legacy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. When asked which of Netaji’s sayings was the most motivating, a student quoted, “Give me blood and I promise you freedom.” She explained that this dedication continues to inspire her, particularly in the pursuit of reducing the nation’s carbon footprint, aligning her actions with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
PM Modi delved deeper into this topic, asking about the initiatives India has undertaken to reduce its carbon footprint. The student cited the introduction of electric vehicles and buses as part of the solution. PM added that over 1,200 electric buses had already been deployed in Delhi by the central government, with more planned to enhance the nation’s green transportation infrastructure.
The PM also discussed the PM Suryagarh Yojana, a government initiative aimed at combating climate change. Under this scheme, solar panels are installed on household rooftops, enabling the generation of electricity from solar energy, which helps reduce reliance on conventional electricity and eliminates electricity bills. 
The prime minister highlighted that the solar energy produced could be used to charge electric vehicles, cutting fuel expenses and reducing pollution. Furthermore, any surplus energy generated can be sold back to the government for monetary compensation, providing a financial incentive for households to contribute to sustainable energy practices.

Title: CCPA issues notices to Ola, Uber over differential pricing; Apple also under scrutiny
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 11:29:42 +0000
Content: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has issued notices to cab aggregators Ola and Uber over alleged discrepancies in pricing based on the type of smartphone used by consumers, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, said on Tuesday.
In a post on X, Joshi explained that the CCPA’s action follows observations of “apparent differential pricing” linked to whether consumers use iPhones or Android devices.
“The Department of Consumer Affairs, through the CCPA, has issued notices to major cab aggregators Ola and Uber, seeking their responses,” Joshi said. 
The issue surfaced after multiple consumer complaints pointed to fare discrepancies for identical routes depending on the smartphone model. Reports indicated that higher fares were displayed on certain devices, raising concerns about fairness and transparency in pricing practices.
The CCPA has demanded clarifications from Ola and Uber regarding their pricing algorithms and the factors influencing fare variations. The investigation aims to safeguard consumer rights and enforce fair practices among digital platforms.
This is not the first instance of the CCPA intervening in matters involving technology companies. Recently, the authority issued a notice to Apple after complaints were registered on the National Consumer Helpline. Consumers reported performance issues with iPhones following updates to iOS 18 and later versions. The CCPA sought Apple’s explanation to address these grievances.
“The department, after examining complaints regarding performance issues in #iPhones following the iOS 18+ software update, has issued a notice to #Apple through the CCPA, seeking a response,” Joshi shared in another post.

Title: Sabalenka grinds down Badosa to reach Australian Open final
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 11:00:02 +0000
Content: Double defending champion Aryna Sabalenka overwhelmed Paula Badosa 6-4 6-2 with an impressive display of raw power to reach her third successive Australian Open final on Thursday.
Top seed Sabalenka will meet the winner of second seed Iga Swiatek versus American Madison Keys, who face off in the second semi-final at Rod Laver Arena.
Sabalenka will be bidding for her fourth Grand Slam title in the women’s decider on Saturday.
It was not the perfect game from the formidable Belarusian, however, as she trailed 2-0 in the first set with a slew of unforced errors.
But she soon found her mark and put her dependable forehand to work to end Badosa’s run in her first Grand Slam semi-final.
“I have goosebumps. I’m so proud of myself and my team to put ourselves in this situation,” said Sabalenka.
“If I put my name in history it will mean the world for me, I couldn’t even dream of it … I will go out and give everything in the final.”
After taking the surprise early lead, 11th seed Badosa was constantly under siege on serve.
She hung tough to save a slew of break points but it felt like only a matter of time before Sabalenka crashed through her defences, which she duly did, breaking Badosa in the third and fifth games before holding firm to take the first set.
Badosa tried to conjure the fighting spirit that saw her eliminate Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals, in one of the shocks of the tournament.
But Sabalenka’s pressure wore her down and she ended up double-faulting to drop serve in the third game of the second set.
World number one Sabalenka rode the momentum to a 5-1 lead before sealing the match in style with a cracking forehand down the line.
The two are good friends away from the court but it may be a while before the Spaniard can get over the defeat to hang out again with her Belarusian buddy.
“She’ll probably hate me for a day or two and then we can be friends again and go out shopping. I promise we’ll do that and I’ll pay for whatever she wants,” said Sabalenka.
Sabalenka is bidding to become the first woman to win three Australian Open titles in succession since Martina Hingis (1997-99).

Title: Subhas Chandra Bose’s grand nephew recalls PM Modi’s efforts in honouring Netaji’s legacy
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:35:58 +0000
Content: India marked ‘Parakram Diwas’ to commemorate the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading tributes.
Netaji’s grandnephew, Chittapriyo Bose, shared his perspective on PM Modi’s efforts to honor Bose’s legacy. In a video message, he spoke about multiple interactions with the Prime Minister and steps taken, including the declassification of files related to Netaji’s life and disappearance.
Bose detailed various initiatives implemented during PM Modi’s tenure. These included renaming Ross Island as ‘Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep,’ installing a statue at India Gate, and establishing the INA Museum at the Red Fort. The declaration of Netaji’s birth anniversary as ‘Parakram Diwas’ was also acknowledged as a significant decision.
Chittapriyo Bose credited PM Modi for expediting the declassification of documents related to Netaji’s disappearance, a matter unresolved for decades. He recounted a meeting in 2014 at Kolkata’s Raj Bhavan with PM Modi, where the family requested an inquiry into Netaji’s disappearance post-August 18, 1945. Following this meeting, a larger delegation of 50 members, including family and eminent citizens, presented their views in Delhi.
He said that PM Modi instructed then-External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to initiate the declassification process, which included a request to Russia for relevant files.
Chittapriyo Bose highlighted other milestones, including the establishment of a dedicated wing in the National Archives showcasing declassified files and a grand celebration of Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary at Kolkata’s Victoria Memorial. Commemorative coins and stamps were released during the event.

Content: Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is scheduled to visit India for four days starting Thursday. During his visit, President Prabowo will hold discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attend the Republic Day Parade as the Chief Guest.
The visit aims to review bilateral ties and address regional and global issues of mutual interest. Sources indicate that multiple Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed, covering areas such as food security, energy security, and healthcare. Discussions may also include Indonesia’s need for medical professionals and potential collaborations in digital mapping for agriculture and renewable energy.
Further topics of discussion are expected to focus on enhancing cultural exchanges, including collaborative efforts in movie productions, educational initiatives, student exchanges, and research partnerships. There will also be talks on improving trade and flight connectivity, particularly the Delhi-Jakarta route, and fostering people-to-people connections.
This marks President Prabowo’s first visit to India as Head of State. The Republic Day celebrations will feature a 352-member marching and band contingent from Indonesia, the first such participation by an Indonesian contingent in a national day parade abroad.
On Friday, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will meet President Prabowo. The ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan is scheduled for Saturday, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at Rajghat and talks with Prime Minister Modi at Hyderabad House.
India and Indonesia maintain close maritime ties with cultural and trade linkages spanning centuries. The annual Bali Yatra festival commemorates the historic voyages of Indian seafarers to Bali. Indonesia is among India’s key trading partners in the ASEAN region, with bilateral trade reaching USD 29.40 billion in 2023-24. Indian investments in Indonesia amount to USD 1.56 billion, covering sectors such as infrastructure, power, textiles, steel, automotive, mining, banking, and consumer goods.

Defence cooperation between the two countries includes the Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in 2018. While Indonesia is exploring ways to strengthen its defence systems and seeking technology transfer, sources have indicated that a defence deal is unlikely to be concluded during this visit.
Indonesia has expressed appreciation for India’s support towards its BRICS membership and is interested in learning from India’s experiences in various sectors. President Prabowo and Prime Minister Modi met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November 2024.
President Prabowo will be the fourth Indonesian leader to attend India’s Republic Day celebrations. The visit underscores the longstanding partnership between the two nations and their commitment to strengthening ties across various domains.

Title: Centre notifies rules for verified radar equipment to boost traffic enforcement
Publication Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:34:55 +0000
Content: In an effort to help traffic personnel measure speed limits effectively, the government on Thursday notified rules for radar equipment for the measurement of speed of vehicles, under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011.
To help concerning industries comply with the provisions of rules, these guidelines will come into force from July 1, said the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in a statement.
Verified and stamped radar equipment are crucial for applications like traffic enforcement to prevent accidents and wear and tear on roads.
The verified radar equipment would significantly enhance the effectiveness and credibility of law enforcement officers in traffic enforcement.
A committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Director, Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Ranchi, which submitted the initial draft rules.
The draft rules’ presentation was made for State Legal Metrology Departments, RRSL officers, manufacturers and VCOs to explain its requirements.
According to the rules, such equipment shall be verified and stamped to ensure their correctness for the protection of human beings.
“The rules will also ensure precise measurement of speed, distance, and other relevant parameters. The public would benefit as there would be improved enforcement as verified radar speed guns will accurately measure vehicle speeds, identify violations and enforce traffic laws effectively,” said the ministry.
Speed measurement devices work by detecting the time it takes for a vehicle to travel between two points or by measuring changes in position over time using radar, laser, or other technologies.
Radar devices emit radio waves that bounce off moving vehicles, calculating speed based on the Doppler Effect.
All these methods rely on precise calibration to ensure their measurements are accurate and reliable.
Modern radar systems are highly accurate and can measure the speed of multiple vehicles simultaneously and often include features like automatic target tracking.
According to the government, proper calibration ensures the device provides reliable and precise speed readings.
