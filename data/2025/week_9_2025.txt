Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:44:10 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has highlighted the rapid pace of innovation in India and the country’s leadership position in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).
In her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam, she pointed out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s comment that India is the ‘use case capital of AI,’ is a “very big statement” as it means that “we are not just talking about AI or doing research in AI. We are implementing it on a large scale.”
Underscoring the awareness about AI in the country, she added that India recorded 3 billion AI-related app downloads in 2024 which was far ahead of the US’ number of 1.5 billion and China’s 1.3 billion.
“We are not just leading in Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption but we are also shaping how AI is governed,” the Finance Minister said in her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam in Kerala.
“At the recent AI Action Summit in Paris, which India co-chaired with France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about how AI is not just a national issue but a global responsibility. It is very important to have an AI which is ethical, inclusive and trustworthy,” FM Sitharaman observed.
She pointed out that the fear that some sections of society may have, about AI leading to a lot of undetected unethical practices will not be addressed “unless we, from the beginning, understand it with responsibility.”
The Finance Minister said that the country is not just experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI), but the government at the centre has taken a lot of inputs from stakeholders and is continuously coming up with policies to make sure that AI gets due attention
She also highlighted that India’s rank in the Global Innovation Index has improved to 39th in 2024 among 133 economies from the 81st position in 2015.
FM Sitharaman pointed out that India’s patent-to-GDP ratio, a measure of the economic impact of patent activity, has grown significantly from 144 in 2013 to 381 in 2023. The country now holds the seventh position in intangible asset intensity, surpassing the growth rates of many high-income economies.
She also highlighted that India secured the sixth spot in global intellectual property filings as per WIPO in 2023 and the country has improved its Network Readiness Index ranking from 79th in 2019 to 49th in 2024, reflecting the advance towards greater innovation and self-reliance.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation stone of cancer hospital in MP’s Bageshwar Dham
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:41:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the Bageshwar Dham Medical and Science Research Institute in Madhya Pradesh’s Garha village at the invitation of Bageshwar Dham chief Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri.
The hospital, aimed at providing free medical treatment to cancer patients from underprivileged backgrounds, will be equipped with state-of-the-art chemotherapy and cancer treatment facilities.
Specialist doctors will oversee patient care, ensuring advanced medical support. The project, estimated to cost around Rs 200 crore, is expected to be completed within two to three years.
Addressing a massive gathering, PM Modi expressed his gratitude for visiting Bundelkhand twice in a short span. “This time, I came at the invitation of Balaji. It is truly Hanuman Ji’s blessing that this centre of faith is now transforming into a centre of health as well,” he said.
He highlighted that the Bageshwar Dham Medical Science and Research Institute will be built on a 10-acre plot, with its first phase featuring a 100-bed facility.
Taking aim at those who, he claimed, “hate the Hindu religion,” the Prime Minister stated, “There have always been people who mock our faith, ridicule religion, and seek to divide society. Many times, foreign powers also try to weaken our country and religion by supporting such elements. These forces have been present in different phases for centuries.”
He further accused these groups of attacking Hindu beliefs, saints, temples, and cultural traditions.
“Their agenda is to break the unity of our society. But in such an environment, my younger brother Dhirendra Shastri has been working tirelessly to spread the mantra of unity across the country,” he added.
Praising Pandit Dhirendra Shastri’s efforts, PM Modi lauded his initiative to establish the cancer institute, stating, “Now, at Bageshwar Dham, devotees will not only receive the blessings of bhajan and food but also the gift of a healthy life.”
The Prime Minister also commended the mass wedding ceremonies organised by Bageshwar Dham for economically weaker sections.
“I have been informed that on the occasion of Maha Shivratri, a mass wedding for 251 daughters will be held here. I deeply appreciate this noble initiative and extend my heartfelt blessings to the newlywed couples, wishing them a happy married life,” he added.
Speaking on the ongoing Maha Kumbh, PM Modi highlighted its spiritual and cultural significance.
“The Maha Kumbh is now reaching its culmination. Millions have arrived, taken the sacred dip, and sought the blessings of saints. Witnessing this grand event, one is naturally awestruck — this is truly a Maha Kumbh of unity,” he said.
“Held once every 144 years, this Maha Kumbh will continue to inspire future generations as a symbol of national togetherness,” the Prime Minister added.

Title: India vs Pakistan: High-stakes clash in ICC Champions Trophy 2025 as both teams fight for semi-final spot
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:50:53 +0000
Content: Dubai is electric with anticipation as India takes on Pakistan in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy 2025 match at the Dubai International Stadium. With both teams vying for crucial points, this encounter is set to be a thrilling contest between two fierce rivals.
India, having secured a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their previous match, enters this game with momentum and confidence. The team is aiming to solidify their spot in the semi-finals, with vice-captain Shubman Gill expressing the need for an aggressive approach, particularly in the middle overs. He believes a target of 300-325 runs would be formidable, despite the potential challenges posed by dew.
On the other hand, Pakistan, under pressure following a loss to New Zealand, faces a must-win situation to stay alive in the tournament. Pakistan’s bowling coach, Aqib Javed, acknowledged the team’s struggles and called on senior players like Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam to lead the charge. Despite the setbacks, Javed remains confident in Pakistan’s fast bowlers but stressed the need for improvement across all departments.
The match is further intensified by key individual battles. The contest between India’s Rohit Sharma and Pakistan’s Shaheen Afridi will play a pivotal role in setting the early tone for the game. Additionally, all eyes will be on Virat Kohli and his ability to counter Pakistan’s spin attack, led by Abrar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah.
The pitch at Dubai International Stadium is expected to be slow and low, which may provide an advantage to spin bowlers as the match progresses. Both teams have prepared accordingly, with India bolstering their lineup with a strong spin contingent alongside their pace attack.
As the atmosphere in Dubai continues to buzz with excitement, fans from both nations have gathered in large numbers, creating a vibrant and electrifying environment. The weather conditions are perfect for cricket, with clear skies and warm temperatures anticipated throughout the day.
India’s solid form and confident mindset make them a formidable opponent in this crucial match, while Pakistan is under pressure to bounce back and keep their semi-final hopes alive. With both teams fighting for vital points, this encounter promises to be an unforgettable showdown.

Title: PM Modi highlights ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’, advises ‘Exam Warriors’ to stay stress-free
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:31:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday encouraged students appearing for board exams to stay positive and stress-free while highlighting how his flagship event, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha,’ is helping young minds prepare for their exams with confidence.
Addressing the 119th episode of his monthly radio program, ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ PM Modi extended his best wishes to students, calling them “Exam Warriors.”
He urged them to approach their exams with a positive spirit and without unnecessary stress.
“This is the season of Board Exams. I wish my young friends, the Exam Warriors, the best of luck. Appear for your papers without any stress and with a completely positive spirit,” he said.
The Prime Minister underscored the growing impact of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ (PPC), an initiative that has evolved into a movement aimed at reducing exam-related stress among students.
Reflecting on its increasing popularity, he noted that the program is now becoming institutionalised, with more experts joining the discussions every year.
The eighth edition of PPC 2025, held on February 10 at Sunder Nursery in New Delhi, saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents. The event, broadcast live across multiple platforms, offered valuable insights into exam preparation, stress management, and personal development.
“This year, we tried to conduct ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ in a new format. Along with experts, eight different episodes were also included, covering topics ranging from overall exam strategies to healthcare, mental health, food, and nutrition,” PM Modi said.
He added that past toppers also shared their experiences, making the discussions even more enriching. Many students, parents, and teachers wrote to him, expressing their appreciation for the new format, which allowed in-depth discussions on each topic.
“Our young friends watched these episodes in large numbers on Instagram as well. Many of you also liked the fact that this program was organized at Sunder Nursery in Delhi. Those who have not yet watched these episodes should definitely do so. They are available on NaMo App,” he urged.
PPC 2025 featured insightful conversations with renowned personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sadhguru, Mary Kom, Vikrant Massey, and Rujuta Diwekar. Their discussions focused on holistic development, managing academic pressure, and fostering a positive mindset during exams.
Over the years, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ has transformed into a mass movement, inspiring students and educators across the country. The 2025 edition continues this tradition, setting new benchmarks in empowering students to tackle exams with confidence and enthusiasm.
Once again, PM Modi reassured students: “Be happy and stress-free.”

Title: Countries warn against delaying global climate assessment after US exit
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:26:30 +0000
Content: The European Union, Britain and climate-vulnerable developing countries have raised concerns about delays to the next global assessment of climate change, by the U.N.’s climate science panel, after the U.S. administration withdrew from the process.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N. body which brings together climate scientists from nearly 200 countries to assess the planet’s health, will meet in Hangzhou, China, next week to plan its next global report.
“It will be vital that all working group contributions to the Seventh Assessment Report are prepared in time,” the EU’s climate chief, Wopke Hoekstra, and ministers from 17 countries including Britain, Germany, France, Spain, the Marshall Islands and Guatemala said in a joint statement, seen by Reuters on Friday.
“We owe it to everyone suffering the impacts of the climate crisis now, and to future generations, to make decisions about our planet’s future on the basis of the best evidence and knowledge available to us,” the statement said.
The Trump administration has halted the participation of U.S. scientists in the IPCC and will not attend its meeting in Hangzhou next week, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Officials familiar with the talks said the countries behind the statement were concerned the report would now not be completed in time to inform the next Paris Agreement “stocktake” in 2028, when nearly 200 countries will assess their progress towards curbing climate change and agree tougher measures to avoid escalating warming.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month also ordered the U.S. to withdraw again from the Paris climate agreement and has moved to reverse the Biden administration’s sweeping climate policies.
Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk is leading the administration’s attempt to rid the federal government of what he calls wasteful spending and slash the federal workforce, indiscriminately cutting funding for climate-related work and removing employees working on climate science, climate justice and clean energy.
A second statement, published on Friday by the Least Developed Countries, a group of 45 of the world’s most vulnerable nations, said there is no excuse for any delays in the process.
“Any backtracking on this process issue will be seen for what it is, politicization of science at the expense of vulnerable countries,” they said in a statement. “People in the developing world have nothing to gain from restricting access to freely available IPCC science.”
The last Paris Agreement “stocktake”, at the COP28 climate summit in 2023, saw nearly 200 countries agree to transition away from fossil fuels.
That deal was informed by the IPCC’s previous report, which set out the drastic changes humanity had caused to the planet’s climate and the sharp cuts to emissions needed to avoid further disasters.

Title: PM Modi says ‘Naari Shakti’ will handle his social media accounts on March 8
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:33:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that as a special initiative dedicated to women’s empowerment, he will hand over his social media accounts to a few inspiring women, ‘Naari Shakti’, from across the country on International Women’s Day.
He said that this would provide the women with a platform to share their stories and achievements. He also urged the women to participate in this initiative.
PM Modi also said that International Women’s Day is a special occasion to honour India’s Naari Shakti (women power), highlighting their contributions to shaping the nation’s past, present, and future.
Quoting a shloka from Devi Mahatmya — a Hindu philosophical text — PM Modi explained that it signifies how “all forms of knowledge are manifestations of the Goddess and that she is reflected in all women power in the world.”
“Respect for daughters has been given top priority in our culture. Women’s power has also played an important role in the Independence movement and the making of our Constitution,” he said.
The Prime Minister shared an audio clip of Hansa Mehta, a key figure in India’s freedom struggle and constitutional drafting, presenting the national flag in the Constituent Assembly.
In the clip, Mehta is heard saying: “It is in the fitness of things that this first flag, that is flying over this August House, should be a gift from the women of India. We have donned the saffron colour, we have fought, suffered, and sacrificed for the cause of our country’s freedom. We have today attained our goal.”
Reflecting on this, PM Modi emphasised that Hansa Mehta’s words underscored the deep sacrifices made by Indian women for the nation’s independence and symbolised their unwavering spirit.
“She believed that the saffron colour in the tricolour also reflects this sentiment. She expressed confidence that our women’s power will make India strong and prosperous. Today, her words are proving true. In every field, women’s contributions are immense and inspiring,” he added.

Title: Macron, Starmer to meet Trump as Europeans flesh out ideas for Ukraine guarantees
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:39:37 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance towards Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.
The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be travelling separately, are expected to try to convince Trump not to rush to a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.
Macron, who is trying to capitalise on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.
“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,” he said in an hour-long answer and question session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.
The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom Trump described as a “dictator”, that has alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics.
Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans.
“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,” he told Reuters.
He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.
Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a “temporary pause before Putin attacks again”, will be in Washington on Thursday.
Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and Starmer as “a very nice guy”.
MILITARY GUARANTEES
However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security.
Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to convince Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said.
Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said.
They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said.
While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, centre around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.
Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said.
Part of the British and French talks centre around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.
The options being discussed would centre not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-km (1,243-mile) border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said.
Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine.
A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved.
“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to mobilise and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,” the French official said.
A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high side”.

Title: NDRF intensifies rescue operation to save 8 trapped in Telangana tunnel
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 04:56:58 +0000
Content: National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams on Sunday intensified rescue efforts to save eight persons trapped in an under-construction tunnel after a portion of its roof collapsed in Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district on February 22.
Four teams comprising 150 personnel were engaged in the rescue operation, which continued throughout the night.
The rescue teams have reached closer to the point where the tunnel roof collapsed during the digging work on Saturday.
At least two workers were injured and eight others were trapped when a portion of the tunnel being dug as part of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed near Domalapenta.
A total of 50 persons were working on the left-side tunnel when the roof collapsed for three meters. The accident occurred at the 14th km point.
While 42 workers came out of the tunnel, the remaining eight were trapped. Those trapped include two engineers and two machine operators.
The NDRF team, which reached up to 11th km in a loco train, found water and mud beyond this point. About three feet of water was accumulated in the tunnel. The NDRF personnel moved ahead on foot and reached closer to the point where the roof of the tunnel had caved in.
The tunnel boring machine was badly damaged in the accident. The water which gushed out from the tunnel roof and the soil pushed back the machine up to 80 meters.
Water and mud accumulated on both sides of the machine hampering the rescue effort. According to officials, water has to be pumped out and mud has to be cleared for the rescue work to progress further.
Earlier, three teams of NDRF reached the accident site from Vijayawada while four teams arrived from Hyderabad. Teams from the Indian Army and Singareni Collieries Company Limited and personnel of the State Disasters Response Force (SDRF) were participating in the rescue operation.
The trapped men are from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
State Ministers Uttam Kumar Reddy and Jupally Krishna Reddy were monitoring the rescue operations along with the district Collector, Superintendent of Police and other top officials.
Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy expressed shock over the incident and assured that the government would extend all possible help to the families of the victims.
The state government had recently resumed the construction work on the tunnel to complete the long-pending project. The construction firm had started work four days ago and on Saturday morning 50 workers entered the tunnel for the work.
Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy said the work was started on the tunnel after a survey by the Geological Survey of India. He told the media that the company that was hired for the work has a good record in digging tunnels.
He said soon after the work began on Saturday morning, water started entering the tunnel and soil caved in. “The workers who came out said they heard an explosion, which could be a geological disturbance,” he said, adding that those who were in front of the boring machine were trapped in the tunnel.
“The government is making all possible efforts to rescue the trapped persons. We are getting the best tunnel experts in the country to oversee the rescue effort,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Revanth Reddy over the phone and enquired about the incident.
The Prime Minister informed him that the NDRF team would be deployed immediately for rescue operations and assured all support from the Central government.

The initiative has become a cornerstone of PM Modi’s outreach efforts, encouraging citizens to engage in social causes and work toward progress.
The programme highlights the works and efforts of those who otherwise would never have got such a wide audience. It recognises the real talent and encourages more to come forward.
In the 118th episode of his popular radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi conveyed a special message to the nation ahead of India’s Republic Day celebrations. The episode not only celebrated India’s rich heritage and accomplishments but also highlighted the nation’s progress in various sectors, including democracy, conservation, youth participation, and selfless service.
Mann Ki Baat since its inception in October 2014 has reached millions, fostering discussions on a range of national issues.
In the previous episode, PM Modi invited citizens to contribute to the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Indian Constitution by uploading videos of themselves reading the Preamble in various languages on Constitution75.com.
In 2025’s first Mann Ki Baat episode, PM Modi called Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity. “… An Unforgettable sea of humanity, incredible visuals, and an extraordinary confluence of equality and harmony. This time, many a divine alignment is also converging at the Kumbh. This festival of Kumbh celebrates the festival of unity in diversity,” he said.
He highlighted how Indian traditions bind the whole country together. “The Kumbh event also tells us how our traditions bind the whole of India together. The ways of adhering to the beliefs are the same from north to south. On the one hand, the Kumbh is organised at Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nasik, and Haridwar; on the other, in the southern part, Pushkaram is organised on the banks of Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Kaveri rivers,” he said.
PM Modi also said, “It is true that when the young generation proudly joins its civilization, then its roots become stronger and its golden future is assured.”

Title: Israel sends tanks into West Bank, tells troops to ready for ‘extended’ stay
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 07:01:44 +0000
Content: Israel sent tanks into the occupied West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years on Sunday as it ordered the military to prepare for an “extended stay” to fight Palestinian militant groups in the area’s refugee camps.
The move came as a fragile ceasefire in Gaza hit new hurdles after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a stop to the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees due to be freed under the truce, in retaliation for public displays of Israeli hostages handed over in exchange in Gaza.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have already been displaced from their homes in the West Bank over the past month as the military has moved into the crowded refugee camps of flashpoint cities like Jenin and Tulkarm, cracking down on Iranian-backed groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
The camps, housing descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in the 1948 war around the birth of the state of Israel, have been strongholds of the militant groups for decades.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said around 40,000 Palestinians had been moved from the camps which he said were now empty.
Netanyahu ordered the military to pick up the intensity of operations after a series of explosions on buses in transport depots close to Tel Aviv on Thursday. The blasts caused no casualties but revived memories of the suicide bombings on public transport that killed hundreds of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising, or Intifada, two decades ago.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the decision to deploy tanks in the northern West Bank.
“This is a dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm,” he said.
The military said it had arrested 26 militants and confiscated three guns and additional weapons as it continued operations in the Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams refugee camps and extended them into Nablus, Qabatiya and Deir Qaddis in the south.
Troops have demolished houses and vital infrastructure, including digging up roads and disrupting power and water supplies and on Sunday, Israeli battle tanks could be seen moving into the West Bank from Israel towards Jenin.
Hamas, which has fought Israeli troops for more than a year in its Gaza stronghold since attacking communities in southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, said sending tanks showed the threats faced by Israeli troops from militant fighters in the camps.
TANKS IN JENIN
With fighting in Gaza paused during the 42-day ceasefire and a related war against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon also halted, Israeli attention has switched increasingly to the West Bank.
While Israeli troops have been constantly active in the West Bank, the use of heavy tanks in addition to armoured personnel carriers underscores how intensely the military is trying to pressure the militant groups, which have long received weapons and financial support from Iran.
“For the first time in decades in Judea and Samaria, we sent in tanks,” Katz said on Sunday, using the Biblical names employed in Israel for the West Bank. “This means one thing, we are fighting terrorism by all means and anywhere”.
Hundreds of Palestinian fighters and civilians have been killed by the Israeli military in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war while dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians. But the violence has not yet reached the levels seen in the Second Intifada, when Palestinian Authority forces joined fighting against the Israeli military.
The West Bank, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, is seen by Palestinians as the core of a future Palestinian state, along with Gaza, but there have been increasingly open calls by Israeli hardliners for its annexation.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who stunned the region with a call for Palestinians to be moved out of Gaza to make way for a U.S. development project, has not yet said whether he would support full annexation.
However his call in Gaza has already awakened fears among Palestinians of a second “Nakba” or catastrophe, the name given to the loss of many of their lands in the 1948 war.
Israel has already taken steps to undermine the refugee camps by forcing the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to close its headquarters in east Jerusalem. On Sunday, Katz said the agency, which Israel accuses of supporting militant groups, had been told to halt activity in the camps.

Title: Bangladeshi students, who ousted former PM Hasina, set to launch political party
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 06:44:42 +0000
Content: Bangladeshi students, who were at the forefront of last year’s protests that ousted then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, are set to launch a political party this week, two sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
The Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group spearheaded the protests that began as a student-led movement against public sector job quotas but quickly morphed into a broader, nationwide uprising that forced Hasina to flee to India as the unrest peaked in early August.
The student group is finalising plans to launch the new party during an event likely on Wednesday, said the sources who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Nahid Islam, a student leader and adviser to the interim government that took charge of Bangladesh after Hasina’s exit, is expected to lead the party as convener, the sources said.
Islam has been a key figure in advocating for student interests within the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has been at the helm of Bangladesh since August 2024. He is expected to resign from his current role to focus on leading the new political party.
Yunus has said that elections could be held by the end of 2025, and many political analysts believe that a youth-led party could significantly reshape the country’s political landscape. Yunus has said he was not interested in running.
The South Asian nation has been grappling with political unrest since Hasina left following weeks of protests during which more than 1,000 people were killed.
Officials from Hasina’s former government and security apparatus systematically committed serious human rights violations against the protesters during the uprising, the U.N. human rights commission said this month.
Hasina and her party deny any wrongdoing.

Title: ₹3.5 lakh crore transferred to farmers under PM-KISAN: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 06:10:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed pride in the nation’s farmers and congratulated them on the successful completion of six years of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. Launched in 2019, the scheme aims to provide direct financial support to farmers, ensuring stability and boosting agricultural productivity.
The announcement comes ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to Bihar’s Bhagalpur district, where he will release the 19th installment of the PM-KISAN scheme.
PM Modi reiterated the government’s commitment to supporting farmers. The financial aid, transferred through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, eliminates middlemen and ensures timely payments directly into farmers’ bank accounts.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “We are proud of our Annadatas,” and highlighted various government initiatives aimed at improving farmers’ livelihoods. He noted that over the last decade, rapid advancements in the agricultural sector have increased farmers’ market access, reduced production costs, and boosted their income.
“Many congratulations to our farmer brothers and sisters across the country on the completion of six years of PM-KISAN. It is a matter of immense satisfaction and pride for me that so far about three and a half lakh crore rupees have reached their accounts. This effort of ours is giving respect, prosperity, and new strength to the food providers,” PM Modi added.
Over the years, the PM-KISAN scheme has played a vital role in easing financial burdens on farmers, supporting crop production, and improving their economic conditions.
During his visit to Bihar, PM Modi is also expected to announce several initiatives aimed at strengthening the state’s agricultural, dairy, and rural economy. Among these measures is an increase in the loan limit under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh, ensuring greater financial accessibility and empowering farmers to invest in modern farming practices.

Title: Venus Williams will not play Indian Wells, despite wild card invite
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:52:32 +0000
Content: Former world number one Venus Williams will not compete at next month’s Indian Wells tournament despite the WTA 1000 event giving the 44-year-old American a wild card.
Williams, who played only two tournaments last season, said at a speaking event in Denmark that she had not been told of the wildcard before the tournament announced it on Wednesday and added that she was unable to compete due to prior commitments.
“I found the announcement super amusing because, I don’t know, people seem to be happy, so I was like, ‘Maybe I’ll just go with it, I don’t know’,” Williams said at the event in the city of Naestved.
“I’m actually not going. I’m going to be overseas.”
Tournament director Tommy Haas later released a statement confirming that Williams would not be playing at the March 2-16 event in Southern California.
“Our team has been informed that Venus is not accepting the wild card this year,” it read. “We wish Venus all the best and hope to see her back in Indian Wells in the future.”
Williams boycotted the event for 15 years after fans booed and heckled her younger sister Serena during her 2001 final victory over Kim Clijsters, apparently in response to Venus withdrawing injured from their semi-final.
“I love Indian Wells, I would love to be there and if I could have accepted it, I would have been like, ‘Yes’, but I already made commitments,” Williams added.

Title: Fight against obesity: PM Modi invites 10 prominent personalities to spread awareness
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:37:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited ten prominent personalities from various fields to join a national movement aimed at raising awareness about obesity and promoting healthier lifestyles. This initiative aligns with the Fit India Movement, launched to encourage citizens to adopt fitness as a key part of daily life.
The individuals nominated include Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, businessman Anand Mahindra, actor-turned-politician Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua), Olympic medalists Manu Bhaker and Mirabai Chanu, actors Mohanlal and R. Madhavan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, philanthropist and Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murthy, and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. Each nominee has been encouraged to further nominate ten individuals, amplifying the campaign’s reach across diverse communities.
In a post on X, Prime Minister Modi said, “As mentioned in yesterday’s Mann Ki Baat, I would like to nominate the following people to help strengthen the fight against obesity and spread awareness on reducing edible oil consumption in food. I also request them to nominate ten people each so that our movement gets bigger! Collectively, let us make India fitter and healthier.”
The Prime Minister stressed that obesity is linked to several health complications, including heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, he assured that small lifestyle changes, such as reducing excessive oil consumption, can significantly mitigate these risks.
“Using less oil in food and dealing with obesity is not just a personal choice but also our responsibility towards the family. Excessive use of oil in food can cause many diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension,” PM Modi said, urging citizens to embrace healthier eating habits.
To further strengthen the initiative, the Prime Minister invited Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, boxer Nikhat Zareen, and renowned cardiologist Dr. Devi Shetty to share their insights on combating obesity in future episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
The campaign aims to inspire individuals and communities to adopt healthier food habits, reinforcing the message that small dietary adjustments can lead to a fitter and disease-free future. With the involvement of influential figures and the power of collective action, the initiative aspires to create a lasting impact on the nation’s health.

Title: Musk’s Starlink races with Chinese rivals to dominate satellite internet
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:34:38 +0000
Content: Space is about to get more crowded for Elon Musk. The billionaire’s Starlink communications network is facing increasingly stiff challenges to its dominance of high-speed satellite internet, including from a Chinese state-backed rival and another service financed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.
Shanghai-based SpaceSail in November signed an agreement to enter Brazil and announced it was in talks with over 30 countries. Two months later, it began work in Kazakhstan, according to the Kazakh embassy in Beijing.
Separately, Brasília is in talks with Bezos’s Project Kuiper internet service and Canada’s Telesat, according to a Brazilian official involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss ongoing talks. News of those discussions is being reported for the first time.
Starlink has since 2020 launched more satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) – an altitude of less than 2,000 km – than all its competitors combined. Satellites operating at such low altitudes transmit data extremely efficiently, providing high-speed internet for remote communities, seafaring vessels and militaries at war.
Musk’s primacy in space is seen as a threat by Beijing, which is both investing heavily in rivals and funding military research into tools that track satellite constellations, according to Chinese corporate filings and academic papers whose details have not been previously reported.
China launched a record 263 LEO satellites last year, according to data from astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell analyzed by tech consultancy Analysys Mason.

The emergence of competition to Starlink has been welcomed by Brazil’s government, which wants high-speed internet for communities in far-flung areas but has previously faced off with Musk over commerce and politics.
SpaceSail declined to comment when presented with Reuters’ questions about its expansion plans. A newspaper controlled by China’s telecoms regulator last year praised it as “capable of transcending national boundaries, penetrating sovereignty and unconditionally covering the whole world … a strategic capability that our country must master.”
Kuiper, Telesat, Starlink and Brazil’s communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Few of Musk’s international rivals have the same ambition as SpaceSail, which is controlled by the Shanghai municipal government. It has announced plans to deploy 648 LEO satellites this year and as many as 15,000 by 2030; Starlink currently has about 7,000 satellites, according to McDowell, and has set itself a target of operating 42,000 by the end of the decade.
SpaceSail’s launches will eventually comprise the Qianfan, or “Thousand Sails,” constellation that marks China’s first international push into satellite broadband. Three other Chinese constellations are also in development, with Beijing planning to launch 43,000 LEO satellites in the coming decades and investing in rockets that can carry multiple satellites.
“The endgame is to occupy as many orbital slots as possible,” said Chaitanya Giri, a space technology expert at India’s Observer Research Foundation.
China’s rush to occupy more of lower-Earth orbit has raised concerns among Western policymakers, who worry that it could extend the reach of Beijing’s internet censorship regime. Researchers at the American Foreign Policy Council think-tank said in a February paper that Washington should increase cooperation with Global South nations if it wanted to “seriously contest China’s growing foray into digital dominance.”
The researchers also described Qianfan as a crucial part of the space component of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The $1 trillion global infrastructure development plan is a signature policy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but has been accused by critics of being primarily a tool to expand Beijing’s geopolitical influence.
China’s commerce ministry and telecoms regulator did not respond to requests for comment. China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that while it was not aware of the specifics surrounding SpaceSail and Chinese LEO satellites expanding overseas, Beijing pursues space cooperation with other countries for the benefit of their peoples.
SpaceSail has said it aims to supply reliable internet to more users, particularly those in remote areas and during recovery from emergencies and natural disasters.
WILD WEST
Starlink’s rapid expansion and its use in the war in Ukraine has caught the attention of military researchers like those at China’s National University of Defense Technology, prompting significant state funding for rival satellite networks.
Hongqing Technology, which was founded in 2017 and is developing a 10,000-satellite constellation, this month raised 340 million yuan from mostly state-affiliated investors.
Last year, SpaceSail secured 6.7 billion yuan ($930 million) in a financing round led by a state-owned investment fund focused on upgrading China’s manufacturing capabilities.
Chinese researchers, including many affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army, have also turned their attention to the field. China published a record 2,449 patents related to LEO satellite technology in 2023, up from 162 in 2019, according to Anaqua’s AcclaimIP database.
Many focus on cost-efficient satellite networks and low-latency communication systems, according to a Reuters review, underscoring China’s push to close the technology gap.
“The space world is moving fast and busy experimenting,” said Antoine Grenier, global head of space at the Analysys Mason consultancy. “Pioneers are enjoying this relative freedom and are shaping it to their advantage to claim key positions before rules become more stringent – like the wild west.”
Some of the Chinese research appears to be targeted at Starlink, with one PLA-linked patent application describing the U.S. system as critical to reconnaissance and military communications while posing “threats to network, data, and military security.”
Beijing is also developing tools to track and monitor Starlink’s constellation. Researchers from two PLA-affiliated institutes said in a January study published in a Chinese engineering journal that they had designed a system and algorithm for tracking megaconstellations like Starlink’s, which was inspired by how humpback whales trap their prey by circling them and creating spiralling bubbles.
“With the growing trend of space militarization, developing tools to monitor and track these megaconstellations is critically important,” the researchers wrote.

Title: ‘Conclave,’ Chalamet win at SAG Awards, setting up Oscars battle
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:26:32 +0000
Content: Papal thriller “Conclave” claimed the top prize on Sunday at Hollywood’s Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Timothee Chalamet’s portrayal of Bob Dylan made him the surprise best actor winner, at the last major honors ahead of next weekend’s Oscars.
The “Conclave” cast of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini won best movie ensemble at the SAG Awards, a red-carpet ceremony that streamed live on Netflix. The film tells the story of the secret maneuvering at the Vatican during the selection of a fictional pope.
Fiennes spoke on behalf of the cast about the need for supportive communities, in filmmaking and in life, as he accepted the SAG trophy on stage in downtown Los Angeles.
“We do recognize the supreme importance of (community) in our work and in the world,” Fiennes said. “That’s what we’re celebrating tonight.”
“Conclave” was feted as the real-life pope, 88-year-old Pope Francis, remained in critical condition with double pneumonia. Italian actress Rossellini wished him well during and after the ceremony.
“We are very, very worried for our pope,” she told reporters after the SAG event. “We love this pope.”
The “Conclave” win signaled the movie could take the prestigious best picture trophy at the Academy Awards on March 2. Members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union pick the SAG winners, and actors form the largest voting body for the Oscars.
But the race for best picture at the Oscars is unusually murky this year.
While “Conclave” also captured the top prize at the Britain’s BAFTA awards, the big trophies from Hollywood producers and directors went to “Anora,” a drama about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch.
Chalamet scored the SAG award for best movie actor for playing a young Dylan as he arrives in New York to try to make it in music in “A Complete Unknown.”
The outcome was an upset over Adrien Brody, who landed several acting trophies earlier in the season for playing an immigrant and architect in “The Brutalist.”
The 29-year-old Chalamet said he “poured everything I had” into his portrayal of Dylan.
“The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” Chalamet said. “I want to be one of the greats.”
Demi Moore was honored as best movie actress for her role as a fading celebrity seeking a fountain of youth in “The Substance.” The actress recalled getting her SAG union card in 1978 at age 15.
“It changed my life because it gave me meaning, it gave me purpose and it gave me direction,” she said. “I was a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life.”
The supporting movie actor and actress trophies went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldana for “Emilia Perez.”
In television honors, the cast of FX’s “Shogun,” a tale of political machinations in imperial Japan, was named best ensemble in a drama. “Only Murders in the Building” won best ensemble in a comedy series for stars including Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin.
“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” a surprised Gomez said. “Marty and Steve aren’t here because, you know, they don’t really care,” she added, drawing laughter from the crowd.
Actor and activist Jane Fonda was honored with a life achievement award and talked about the empathy that actors draw upon in their performances.
“Empathy is not weak or woke,” she said, “and by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people.”

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday remembered former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on her birth anniversary, honoring her legacy as a compassionate leader and an outstanding administrator.
Posting a picture of her on X, PM Modi described Jayalalithaa as someone who was deeply committed to Tamil Nadu’s development and always supportive of pro-people initiatives.
“Remembering Jayalalithaa Ji on her birth anniversary. She is widely admired as a compassionate leader and outstanding administrator who devoted her life to Tamil Nadu’s development,” the Prime Minister wrote. “It is my privilege that I had the opportunity to interact with her on innumerable occasions. She was always very warm and supportive of pro-people initiatives.”
In Chennai, veteran actor Rajinikanth paid tribute to the late leader at her Poes Garden residence, laying floral offerings before her portrait. The ceremony was attended by Jayalalithaa’s niece, Deepa Madhavan, and former AIADMK leader Phugalendhi, marking a moment of remembrance for the beloved leader, fondly referred to as “Amma” by her supporters.
Jayalalithaa, who served as Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister for three terms (1991-96, 2002-06, and 2011-14), is remembered as a charismatic and powerful leader who shaped the state’s political landscape.
Before entering politics, she was a celebrated actress, starring in over 130 films before joining the AIADMK in 1982. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the party’s propaganda secretary in 1983, later serving as a Rajya Sabha member and state legislator.
Her political career was marked by both triumphs and controversies, including legal battles and a brief imprisonment in 1996 following a raid at her residence. She also played a key role on the national stage, aligning with the BJP-led NDA in 1998 before later parting ways.
In 2014, she was convicted in a corruption case, leading to her temporary removal from office. However, she made a comeback before her tragic demise on December 5, 2016.

Title: England’s Carse out of Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan, say reports
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:56:47 +0000
Content: Brydon Carse is set to miss England’s Champions Trophy clash against Afghanistan, British media reported on Monday, casting doubt on the fast bowler’s participation in the rest of the tournament.
Carse, who missed a training session with England on Monday as he continues to recover from a blister on a toe on his left foot, is likely to be replaced by Jamie Overton for the Group B match against Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old played in England’s five-wicket loss to Australia in their opening game on Saturday, taking one wicket and conceding 69 runs in his seven overs.
“We will have to wait and see,” England batter Joe Root told the BBC in Lahore when asked about Carse’s fitness.
“There is still a good way to go until the game, to find exactly what is up with Carsey. We will see how things pan out over the next few days.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
England, who have the option to call in a replacement for Carse if he is ruled out of the tournament, are winless and sit third in the Group B standings behind South Africa and Australia.

Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:48:12 +0000
Content: India’s annual wind power capacity addition is projected to more than double to an average of 7.1 gigawatts (GW) over the next two financial years, compared with 3.4 GW in fiscal year 2023-25. This growth, driven by government measures to accelerate the sector, is expected to increase the country’s total installed wind capacity to approximately 63 GW by 2026-27, according to a report released on Monday.
Capacity additions in financial years 2023-24 and 2024-25 remained tepid, ranging between 6-7 GW, due to fewer successful auctions of wind capacities—5.9 GW in FY21-23 and 5.2 GW in FY23-25—according to a Crisil report.
The slow progress was largely attributed to weak developer interest caused by low tariffs that dampened returns, as well as challenges related to land availability and transmission infrastructure in high wind potential areas, the report noted.
However, emerging tailwinds are expected to double the pace of capacity additions over the next two years.
The government’s push for hybrid renewable projects—combining solar, wind, and/or storage—along with a more favorable cost structure for wind projects, is expected to drive capacity growth, the report stated.
In addition to steady standalone wind project auctions, hybrid renewable energy project auctions—requiring developers to supply electricity during high-demand hours (evening and early morning)—have gained momentum.
Wind power is expected to account for 30–50% of these hybrid projects, as it generates electricity during peak demand periods, unlike solar power, which is mostly active during daytime hours.
Moreover, since hybrid projects help distribution companies (discoms) address scheduling challenges during critical times, they are expected to gain traction in offtake and grow rapidly, the report added.
According to Ankit Hakhu, Director at Crisil Ratings, India has over 30 GW of hybrid projects in the pipeline, expected to be commissioned within the next 2-4 years, contributing significantly to the projected increase in wind capacity additions.
“Traction in signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) is also visible, with more than 60% of such projects auctioned by March 2024 having their PPAs signed by January 2025,” he said.

Title: PM-KISAN completes 19 successful instalments
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:19:33 +0000
Content: PM Modi disburses over Rs 22,000 crore to 9.8 crore farmers under 19th PM-KISAN instalment
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released the 19th instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme in Bhagalpur, Bihar.
The tranche, amounting to more than Rs.22,000 crore, will provide direct financial assistance to over 9.8 crore farmers nationwide, including 2.41 crore women farmers.
Launched in February 2019, the PM-KISAN scheme aims to support the financial needs of small and marginal farmers (SMFs) by providing Rs.6,000 annually in three installments.
The funds are transferred directly to beneficiaries’ Aadhaar-linked bank accounts through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), ensuring transparency and eliminating middlemen.
This assistance enables farmers to purchase essential farming inputs and reduces their dependence on moneylenders. Since its inception, the government has disbursed over Rs.3.46 lakh crore across 18 instalments as of February 2025.
Previously, on October 5, 2024, PM Modi had released the 18th instalment of the scheme in Washim, Maharashtra, disbursing over Rs.20,000 crore to benefit more than 9.4 crore farmers.
The scheme’s farmer-centric digital infrastructure has been continuously improved to ensure that benefits reach all farmers efficiently. The PM-KISAN mobile app, launched on 24th February 2020, further streamlined the process by offering self-registration, e-KYC through face authentication, and benefit status tracking. An AI chatbot, Kisan-eMitra, introduced in 2023, provides instant assistance in local languages, enhancing the accessibility of the scheme.
Also, over 5 lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) have been set up across the country to assist farmers with registrations and e-KYC. A robust grievance redressal system, along with efforts to extend e-KYC completion through India Post Payment Bank and state government officials, has ensured the scheme’s reach to every eligible farmer.
With continuous technological advancements and improved governance, the PM-KISAN scheme stands as a testament to the government’s commitment to supporting India’s farmers. It has not only helped with agricultural needs but has also contributed to broader expenses such as education and healthcare, solidifying its role in empowering rural communities across the country.

Title: India’s tech sector poised to reach valuation of $350 billion in five years: Rajnath Singh
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:53 +0000
Content: India’s technology sector is projected to reach a valuation of $300-350 billion over the next five years, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.
Speaking at the 16th Foundation Day of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, Singh urged students to seize opportunities to drive technological progress both domestically and globally.
“With more than 1.25 lakh start-ups and 110 unicorns, our country is emerging as the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world,” Singh said.
The Defence Minister stressed the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship, urging the country’s youth to contribute to areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digital technologies. He praised IIT Mandi for its contributions to India’s scientific and technological progress, particularly its role in fostering research and development in these emerging fields.

Title: The digital transformation and efficiency of India’s direct benefit transfer model
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:27 +0000
Content: India’s welfare system has undergone a profound transformation in recent years as technology has been channeled to manage long-standing challenges such as bureaucratic inefficiencies, administrative leakages, and corruption. For decades, social assistance programs—whether in the form of cash or in-kind transfers—suffered from complex processes and significant fund losses, with studies revealing that out of every 1 rupee allocated, only about 15 paisa reached the intended beneficiary.
This inefficiency was particularly striking given that India dedicates nearly 3%-4% of its GDP to subsidies (Economic Survey, 2017-18) and social support programs aimed at uplifting its citizens. However, systemic challenges in effectively identifying the true beneficiaries, coupled with delays in delivery, result in a significant loss of resources—equivalent to nearly half (Policy Paper, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy) of these allocated funds each year.
In response, the government introduced the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system in 2013, a transformative initiative aimed at delivering benefits directly to citizens’ bank accounts while minimizing human intervention (Table 1: An estimated gain of about ₹3,48,564.66 crore as per the data available on https://dbtbharat.gov.in/; as accessed on 08-02-2025). The DBT framework is built on the robust ‘JAM’ trinity of Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and mobile connectivity.
This integrated system has enabled the direct crediting of subsidies and benefits into beneficiaries’ bank accounts, dramatically reducing the scope for corruption and administrative mismanagement. With the digitalization of beneficiary databases, the government has effectively weeded out ghost accounts and reduced duplications, ensuring proper resource allocation (Table 1).
Financial inclusion received a significant boost with the launch of the Jan Dhan Yojana in 2014, which, coupled with the exponential increase in mobile connectivity, laid the groundwork for the rapid expansion of the DBT system. Central to this digital revolution is the Aadhaar system, launched in 2009 and now recognized as the largest biometric identity program in the world. By streamlining the verification process and eliminating duplicate records, Aadhaar has been instrumental in ensuring that social assistance reaches the correct beneficiaries.
Previously, complex documentation requirements and multiple forms of identification for various schemes created obstacles for efficient service delivery. With Aadhaar now linked to programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), ration cards, and other social welfare initiatives, the process has become far more coherent and targeted. As of 14th August 2024, over 53 crore Jan Dhan accounts had been opened (https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2049231), addressing the critical issue of an unbanked population.
The surge in mobile phone usage, evidenced by an increase in teledensity from 68.64% in 2013 to approximately 85.4% on 31st August 2024 (https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2068372), further highlights the effectiveness of the ‘JAM’ approach. By linking Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile phones, the government has created a seamless infrastructure that underpins the DBT mechanism.
The technical process of DBT involves Aadhaar-based authentication—using demographic data, one-time passwords, or biometric verification—to map beneficiaries’ details to their bank accounts via the Aadhaar Payment Bridge of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Since its initial rollout covering 28 schemes in 2013-14, the DBT mission has expanded dramatically, now encompassing over 320 schemes (Table 2).
The total funds transferred have surged from approximately ₹7,300 crore to ₹6,91,300 crore in 2023-24, and the number of beneficiaries has grown from 11 crore to nearly 176 crore over the same period (Table 2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the system’s scalability was particularly evident, as beneficiary coverage increased from 145 crore in FY2019-20 to 180 crore in FY2020-21, emphasizing the infrastructure’s capacity to adapt rapidly to emergent needs.
The evolution of DBT has been marked by its expanding scope, beginning with student scholarships and support for women, children, and workers, and gradually incorporating a diverse array of welfare schemes. MGNREGS, which guarantees at least 100 days of manual labor at notified wages, generally suffered from significant wage payment delays due to cumbersome processes.
The introduction of the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) under DBT has dramatically improved payment timelines, with timely payment disbursements rising from 50.09% in 2012-13 to over 98% by 2024-25 (https://nreganarep.nic.in/netnrega/MISreport4.aspx).
Beyond direct cash transfers, Aadhaar has enabled access to a range of critical services. In the healthcare sector, for instance, the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY) employs Aadhaar-based eKYC to facilitate a paperless process for cashless hospitalization benefits, while the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ initiative has leveraged electronic point-of-sale devices and biometric scanners to ensure that subsidized food grains are accessible nationwide.
Moreover, Aadhaar serves as a universal identifier that integrates various government databases, such as those for unorganized workers—via the e-Shram portal—and for senior citizens, who can now generate a digital life certificate through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using applications like Jeevan Praman.
The far-reaching impact of these technological advancements is evident in the diverse range of beneficiaries served. Women have gained enhanced support through schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and LPG gas subsidies, while educational initiatives have provided scholarships worth ₹8,584 crore to around 50 lakh students in FY2023.
Similarly, social assistance programs like the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) have extended benefits amounting to ₹3,546 crore to over 3.81 crore citizens, including the elderly, widowed, and persons with disabilities. The creation of more than 30 crore e-Shram cards as on date has enriched the understanding of the unorganized workforce (https://eshram.gov.in/indexmain), and initiatives like the Digital Health ID under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission empower every citizen to build a comprehensive digital health footprint through secure Aadhaar-based authentication.
Conclusion
Since 2014, India’s welfare system has seen notable changes, a true testament to the government’s committed efforts to improve governance and ensure financial inclusion. By integrating technology, including the mass adoption of Aadhaar, an expansion in mobile services, and the community-driven Jan Dhan Yojana, the government has redesigned how social benefits are distributed.
Central to this transformation is the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, supported by the powerful JAM trinity. This approach has drastically minimized the loss of funds due to leakage and mismanagement, guaranteeing that more resources reach the people they are meant to benefit.
The move towards a digital-first welfare system demonstrates a forward-thinking strategy where technology and evidence-based policies work together to enhance transparency, inclusivity, and timeliness in public services.
