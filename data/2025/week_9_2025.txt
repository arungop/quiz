Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:44:10 +0000
Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has highlighted the rapid pace of innovation in India and the country’s leadership position in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).
In her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam, she pointed out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s comment that India is the ‘use case capital of AI,’ is a “very big statement” as it means that “we are not just talking about AI or doing research in AI. We are implementing it on a large scale.”
Underscoring the awareness about AI in the country, she added that India recorded 3 billion AI-related app downloads in 2024 which was far ahead of the US’ number of 1.5 billion and China’s 1.3 billion.
“We are not just leading in Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption but we are also shaping how AI is governed,” the Finance Minister said in her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam in Kerala.
“At the recent AI Action Summit in Paris, which India co-chaired with France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about how AI is not just a national issue but a global responsibility. It is very important to have an AI which is ethical, inclusive and trustworthy,” FM Sitharaman observed.
She pointed out that the fear that some sections of society may have, about AI leading to a lot of undetected unethical practices will not be addressed “unless we, from the beginning, understand it with responsibility.”
The Finance Minister said that the country is not just experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI), but the government at the centre has taken a lot of inputs from stakeholders and is continuously coming up with policies to make sure that AI gets due attention
She also highlighted that India’s rank in the Global Innovation Index has improved to 39th in 2024 among 133 economies from the 81st position in 2015.
FM Sitharaman pointed out that India’s patent-to-GDP ratio, a measure of the economic impact of patent activity, has grown significantly from 144 in 2013 to 381 in 2023. The country now holds the seventh position in intangible asset intensity, surpassing the growth rates of many high-income economies.
She also highlighted that India secured the sixth spot in global intellectual property filings as per WIPO in 2023 and the country has improved its Network Readiness Index ranking from 79th in 2019 to 49th in 2024, reflecting the advance towards greater innovation and self-reliance.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation stone of cancer hospital in MP’s Bageshwar Dham
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:41:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the Bageshwar Dham Medical and Science Research Institute in Madhya Pradesh’s Garha village at the invitation of Bageshwar Dham chief Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri.
The hospital, aimed at providing free medical treatment to cancer patients from underprivileged backgrounds, will be equipped with state-of-the-art chemotherapy and cancer treatment facilities.
Specialist doctors will oversee patient care, ensuring advanced medical support. The project, estimated to cost around Rs 200 crore, is expected to be completed within two to three years.
Addressing a massive gathering, PM Modi expressed his gratitude for visiting Bundelkhand twice in a short span. “This time, I came at the invitation of Balaji. It is truly Hanuman Ji’s blessing that this centre of faith is now transforming into a centre of health as well,” he said.
He highlighted that the Bageshwar Dham Medical Science and Research Institute will be built on a 10-acre plot, with its first phase featuring a 100-bed facility.
Taking aim at those who, he claimed, “hate the Hindu religion,” the Prime Minister stated, “There have always been people who mock our faith, ridicule religion, and seek to divide society. Many times, foreign powers also try to weaken our country and religion by supporting such elements. These forces have been present in different phases for centuries.”
He further accused these groups of attacking Hindu beliefs, saints, temples, and cultural traditions.
“Their agenda is to break the unity of our society. But in such an environment, my younger brother Dhirendra Shastri has been working tirelessly to spread the mantra of unity across the country,” he added.
Praising Pandit Dhirendra Shastri’s efforts, PM Modi lauded his initiative to establish the cancer institute, stating, “Now, at Bageshwar Dham, devotees will not only receive the blessings of bhajan and food but also the gift of a healthy life.”
The Prime Minister also commended the mass wedding ceremonies organised by Bageshwar Dham for economically weaker sections.
“I have been informed that on the occasion of Maha Shivratri, a mass wedding for 251 daughters will be held here. I deeply appreciate this noble initiative and extend my heartfelt blessings to the newlywed couples, wishing them a happy married life,” he added.
Speaking on the ongoing Maha Kumbh, PM Modi highlighted its spiritual and cultural significance.
“The Maha Kumbh is now reaching its culmination. Millions have arrived, taken the sacred dip, and sought the blessings of saints. Witnessing this grand event, one is naturally awestruck — this is truly a Maha Kumbh of unity,” he said.
“Held once every 144 years, this Maha Kumbh will continue to inspire future generations as a symbol of national togetherness,” the Prime Minister added.

Title: India vs Pakistan: High-stakes clash in ICC Champions Trophy 2025 as both teams fight for semi-final spot
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:50:53 +0000
Content: Dubai is electric with anticipation as India takes on Pakistan in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy 2025 match at the Dubai International Stadium. With both teams vying for crucial points, this encounter is set to be a thrilling contest between two fierce rivals.
India, having secured a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their previous match, enters this game with momentum and confidence. The team is aiming to solidify their spot in the semi-finals, with vice-captain Shubman Gill expressing the need for an aggressive approach, particularly in the middle overs. He believes a target of 300-325 runs would be formidable, despite the potential challenges posed by dew.
On the other hand, Pakistan, under pressure following a loss to New Zealand, faces a must-win situation to stay alive in the tournament. Pakistan’s bowling coach, Aqib Javed, acknowledged the team’s struggles and called on senior players like Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam to lead the charge. Despite the setbacks, Javed remains confident in Pakistan’s fast bowlers but stressed the need for improvement across all departments.
The match is further intensified by key individual battles. The contest between India’s Rohit Sharma and Pakistan’s Shaheen Afridi will play a pivotal role in setting the early tone for the game. Additionally, all eyes will be on Virat Kohli and his ability to counter Pakistan’s spin attack, led by Abrar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah.
The pitch at Dubai International Stadium is expected to be slow and low, which may provide an advantage to spin bowlers as the match progresses. Both teams have prepared accordingly, with India bolstering their lineup with a strong spin contingent alongside their pace attack.
As the atmosphere in Dubai continues to buzz with excitement, fans from both nations have gathered in large numbers, creating a vibrant and electrifying environment. The weather conditions are perfect for cricket, with clear skies and warm temperatures anticipated throughout the day.
India’s solid form and confident mindset make them a formidable opponent in this crucial match, while Pakistan is under pressure to bounce back and keep their semi-final hopes alive. With both teams fighting for vital points, this encounter promises to be an unforgettable showdown.

Title: PM Modi highlights ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’, advises ‘Exam Warriors’ to stay stress-free
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:31:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday encouraged students appearing for board exams to stay positive and stress-free while highlighting how his flagship event, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha,’ is helping young minds prepare for their exams with confidence.
Addressing the 119th episode of his monthly radio program, ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ PM Modi extended his best wishes to students, calling them “Exam Warriors.”
He urged them to approach their exams with a positive spirit and without unnecessary stress.
“This is the season of Board Exams. I wish my young friends, the Exam Warriors, the best of luck. Appear for your papers without any stress and with a completely positive spirit,” he said.
The Prime Minister underscored the growing impact of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ (PPC), an initiative that has evolved into a movement aimed at reducing exam-related stress among students.
Reflecting on its increasing popularity, he noted that the program is now becoming institutionalised, with more experts joining the discussions every year.
The eighth edition of PPC 2025, held on February 10 at Sunder Nursery in New Delhi, saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents. The event, broadcast live across multiple platforms, offered valuable insights into exam preparation, stress management, and personal development.
“This year, we tried to conduct ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ in a new format. Along with experts, eight different episodes were also included, covering topics ranging from overall exam strategies to healthcare, mental health, food, and nutrition,” PM Modi said.
He added that past toppers also shared their experiences, making the discussions even more enriching. Many students, parents, and teachers wrote to him, expressing their appreciation for the new format, which allowed in-depth discussions on each topic.
“Our young friends watched these episodes in large numbers on Instagram as well. Many of you also liked the fact that this program was organized at Sunder Nursery in Delhi. Those who have not yet watched these episodes should definitely do so. They are available on NaMo App,” he urged.
PPC 2025 featured insightful conversations with renowned personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sadhguru, Mary Kom, Vikrant Massey, and Rujuta Diwekar. Their discussions focused on holistic development, managing academic pressure, and fostering a positive mindset during exams.
Over the years, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ has transformed into a mass movement, inspiring students and educators across the country. The 2025 edition continues this tradition, setting new benchmarks in empowering students to tackle exams with confidence and enthusiasm.
Once again, PM Modi reassured students: “Be happy and stress-free.”

Title: Countries warn against delaying global climate assessment after US exit
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:26:30 +0000
Content: The European Union, Britain and climate-vulnerable developing countries have raised concerns about delays to the next global assessment of climate change, by the U.N.’s climate science panel, after the U.S. administration withdrew from the process.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N. body which brings together climate scientists from nearly 200 countries to assess the planet’s health, will meet in Hangzhou, China, next week to plan its next global report.
“It will be vital that all working group contributions to the Seventh Assessment Report are prepared in time,” the EU’s climate chief, Wopke Hoekstra, and ministers from 17 countries including Britain, Germany, France, Spain, the Marshall Islands and Guatemala said in a joint statement, seen by Reuters on Friday.
“We owe it to everyone suffering the impacts of the climate crisis now, and to future generations, to make decisions about our planet’s future on the basis of the best evidence and knowledge available to us,” the statement said.
The Trump administration has halted the participation of U.S. scientists in the IPCC and will not attend its meeting in Hangzhou next week, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Officials familiar with the talks said the countries behind the statement were concerned the report would now not be completed in time to inform the next Paris Agreement “stocktake” in 2028, when nearly 200 countries will assess their progress towards curbing climate change and agree tougher measures to avoid escalating warming.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month also ordered the U.S. to withdraw again from the Paris climate agreement and has moved to reverse the Biden administration’s sweeping climate policies.
Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk is leading the administration’s attempt to rid the federal government of what he calls wasteful spending and slash the federal workforce, indiscriminately cutting funding for climate-related work and removing employees working on climate science, climate justice and clean energy.
A second statement, published on Friday by the Least Developed Countries, a group of 45 of the world’s most vulnerable nations, said there is no excuse for any delays in the process.
“Any backtracking on this process issue will be seen for what it is, politicization of science at the expense of vulnerable countries,” they said in a statement. “People in the developing world have nothing to gain from restricting access to freely available IPCC science.”
The last Paris Agreement “stocktake”, at the COP28 climate summit in 2023, saw nearly 200 countries agree to transition away from fossil fuels.
That deal was informed by the IPCC’s previous report, which set out the drastic changes humanity had caused to the planet’s climate and the sharp cuts to emissions needed to avoid further disasters.

Title: PM Modi says ‘Naari Shakti’ will handle his social media accounts on March 8
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:33:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that as a special initiative dedicated to women’s empowerment, he will hand over his social media accounts to a few inspiring women, ‘Naari Shakti’, from across the country on International Women’s Day.
He said that this would provide the women with a platform to share their stories and achievements. He also urged the women to participate in this initiative.
PM Modi also said that International Women’s Day is a special occasion to honour India’s Naari Shakti (women power), highlighting their contributions to shaping the nation’s past, present, and future.
Quoting a shloka from Devi Mahatmya — a Hindu philosophical text — PM Modi explained that it signifies how “all forms of knowledge are manifestations of the Goddess and that she is reflected in all women power in the world.”
“Respect for daughters has been given top priority in our culture. Women’s power has also played an important role in the Independence movement and the making of our Constitution,” he said.
The Prime Minister shared an audio clip of Hansa Mehta, a key figure in India’s freedom struggle and constitutional drafting, presenting the national flag in the Constituent Assembly.
In the clip, Mehta is heard saying: “It is in the fitness of things that this first flag, that is flying over this August House, should be a gift from the women of India. We have donned the saffron colour, we have fought, suffered, and sacrificed for the cause of our country’s freedom. We have today attained our goal.”
Reflecting on this, PM Modi emphasised that Hansa Mehta’s words underscored the deep sacrifices made by Indian women for the nation’s independence and symbolised their unwavering spirit.
“She believed that the saffron colour in the tricolour also reflects this sentiment. She expressed confidence that our women’s power will make India strong and prosperous. Today, her words are proving true. In every field, women’s contributions are immense and inspiring,” he added.

Title: Macron, Starmer to meet Trump as Europeans flesh out ideas for Ukraine guarantees
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:39:37 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance towards Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.
The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be travelling separately, are expected to try to convince Trump not to rush to a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.
Macron, who is trying to capitalise on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.
“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,” he said in an hour-long answer and question session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.
The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom Trump described as a “dictator”, that has alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics.
Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans.
“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,” he told Reuters.
He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.
Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a “temporary pause before Putin attacks again”, will be in Washington on Thursday.
Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and Starmer as “a very nice guy”.
MILITARY GUARANTEES
However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security.
Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to convince Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said.
Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said.
They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said.
While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, centre around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.
Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said.
Part of the British and French talks centre around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.
The options being discussed would centre not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-km (1,243-mile) border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said.
Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine.
A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved.
“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to mobilise and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,” the French official said.
A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high side”.

Title: NDRF intensifies rescue operation to save 8 trapped in Telangana tunnel
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 04:56:58 +0000
Content: National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams on Sunday intensified rescue efforts to save eight persons trapped in an under-construction tunnel after a portion of its roof collapsed in Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district on February 22.
Four teams comprising 150 personnel were engaged in the rescue operation, which continued throughout the night.
The rescue teams have reached closer to the point where the tunnel roof collapsed during the digging work on Saturday.
At least two workers were injured and eight others were trapped when a portion of the tunnel being dug as part of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed near Domalapenta.
A total of 50 persons were working on the left-side tunnel when the roof collapsed for three meters. The accident occurred at the 14th km point.
While 42 workers came out of the tunnel, the remaining eight were trapped. Those trapped include two engineers and two machine operators.
The NDRF team, which reached up to 11th km in a loco train, found water and mud beyond this point. About three feet of water was accumulated in the tunnel. The NDRF personnel moved ahead on foot and reached closer to the point where the roof of the tunnel had caved in.
The tunnel boring machine was badly damaged in the accident. The water which gushed out from the tunnel roof and the soil pushed back the machine up to 80 meters.
Water and mud accumulated on both sides of the machine hampering the rescue effort. According to officials, water has to be pumped out and mud has to be cleared for the rescue work to progress further.
Earlier, three teams of NDRF reached the accident site from Vijayawada while four teams arrived from Hyderabad. Teams from the Indian Army and Singareni Collieries Company Limited and personnel of the State Disasters Response Force (SDRF) were participating in the rescue operation.
The trapped men are from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
State Ministers Uttam Kumar Reddy and Jupally Krishna Reddy were monitoring the rescue operations along with the district Collector, Superintendent of Police and other top officials.
Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy expressed shock over the incident and assured that the government would extend all possible help to the families of the victims.
The state government had recently resumed the construction work on the tunnel to complete the long-pending project. The construction firm had started work four days ago and on Saturday morning 50 workers entered the tunnel for the work.
Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy said the work was started on the tunnel after a survey by the Geological Survey of India. He told the media that the company that was hired for the work has a good record in digging tunnels.
He said soon after the work began on Saturday morning, water started entering the tunnel and soil caved in. “The workers who came out said they heard an explosion, which could be a geological disturbance,” he said, adding that those who were in front of the boring machine were trapped in the tunnel.
“The government is making all possible efforts to rescue the trapped persons. We are getting the best tunnel experts in the country to oversee the rescue effort,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Revanth Reddy over the phone and enquired about the incident.
The Prime Minister informed him that the NDRF team would be deployed immediately for rescue operations and assured all support from the Central government.

The initiative has become a cornerstone of PM Modi’s outreach efforts, encouraging citizens to engage in social causes and work toward progress.
The programme highlights the works and efforts of those who otherwise would never have got such a wide audience. It recognises the real talent and encourages more to come forward.
In the 118th episode of his popular radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi conveyed a special message to the nation ahead of India’s Republic Day celebrations. The episode not only celebrated India’s rich heritage and accomplishments but also highlighted the nation’s progress in various sectors, including democracy, conservation, youth participation, and selfless service.
Mann Ki Baat since its inception in October 2014 has reached millions, fostering discussions on a range of national issues.
In the previous episode, PM Modi invited citizens to contribute to the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Indian Constitution by uploading videos of themselves reading the Preamble in various languages on Constitution75.com.
In 2025’s first Mann Ki Baat episode, PM Modi called Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity. “… An Unforgettable sea of humanity, incredible visuals, and an extraordinary confluence of equality and harmony. This time, many a divine alignment is also converging at the Kumbh. This festival of Kumbh celebrates the festival of unity in diversity,” he said.
He highlighted how Indian traditions bind the whole country together. “The Kumbh event also tells us how our traditions bind the whole of India together. The ways of adhering to the beliefs are the same from north to south. On the one hand, the Kumbh is organised at Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nasik, and Haridwar; on the other, in the southern part, Pushkaram is organised on the banks of Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Kaveri rivers,” he said.
PM Modi also said, “It is true that when the young generation proudly joins its civilization, then its roots become stronger and its golden future is assured.”

Title: Israel sends tanks into West Bank, tells troops to ready for ‘extended’ stay
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 07:01:44 +0000
Content: Israel sent tanks into the occupied West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years on Sunday as it ordered the military to prepare for an “extended stay” to fight Palestinian militant groups in the area’s refugee camps.
The move came as a fragile ceasefire in Gaza hit new hurdles after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a stop to the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees due to be freed under the truce, in retaliation for public displays of Israeli hostages handed over in exchange in Gaza.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have already been displaced from their homes in the West Bank over the past month as the military has moved into the crowded refugee camps of flashpoint cities like Jenin and Tulkarm, cracking down on Iranian-backed groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
The camps, housing descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in the 1948 war around the birth of the state of Israel, have been strongholds of the militant groups for decades.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said around 40,000 Palestinians had been moved from the camps which he said were now empty.
Netanyahu ordered the military to pick up the intensity of operations after a series of explosions on buses in transport depots close to Tel Aviv on Thursday. The blasts caused no casualties but revived memories of the suicide bombings on public transport that killed hundreds of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising, or Intifada, two decades ago.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the decision to deploy tanks in the northern West Bank.
“This is a dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm,” he said.
The military said it had arrested 26 militants and confiscated three guns and additional weapons as it continued operations in the Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams refugee camps and extended them into Nablus, Qabatiya and Deir Qaddis in the south.
Troops have demolished houses and vital infrastructure, including digging up roads and disrupting power and water supplies and on Sunday, Israeli battle tanks could be seen moving into the West Bank from Israel towards Jenin.
Hamas, which has fought Israeli troops for more than a year in its Gaza stronghold since attacking communities in southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, said sending tanks showed the threats faced by Israeli troops from militant fighters in the camps.
TANKS IN JENIN
With fighting in Gaza paused during the 42-day ceasefire and a related war against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon also halted, Israeli attention has switched increasingly to the West Bank.
While Israeli troops have been constantly active in the West Bank, the use of heavy tanks in addition to armoured personnel carriers underscores how intensely the military is trying to pressure the militant groups, which have long received weapons and financial support from Iran.
“For the first time in decades in Judea and Samaria, we sent in tanks,” Katz said on Sunday, using the Biblical names employed in Israel for the West Bank. “This means one thing, we are fighting terrorism by all means and anywhere”.
Hundreds of Palestinian fighters and civilians have been killed by the Israeli military in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war while dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians. But the violence has not yet reached the levels seen in the Second Intifada, when Palestinian Authority forces joined fighting against the Israeli military.
The West Bank, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, is seen by Palestinians as the core of a future Palestinian state, along with Gaza, but there have been increasingly open calls by Israeli hardliners for its annexation.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who stunned the region with a call for Palestinians to be moved out of Gaza to make way for a U.S. development project, has not yet said whether he would support full annexation.
However his call in Gaza has already awakened fears among Palestinians of a second “Nakba” or catastrophe, the name given to the loss of many of their lands in the 1948 war.
Israel has already taken steps to undermine the refugee camps by forcing the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to close its headquarters in east Jerusalem. On Sunday, Katz said the agency, which Israel accuses of supporting militant groups, had been told to halt activity in the camps.

Title: Bangladeshi students, who ousted former PM Hasina, set to launch political party
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 06:44:42 +0000
Content: Bangladeshi students, who were at the forefront of last year’s protests that ousted then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, are set to launch a political party this week, two sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
The Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group spearheaded the protests that began as a student-led movement against public sector job quotas but quickly morphed into a broader, nationwide uprising that forced Hasina to flee to India as the unrest peaked in early August.
The student group is finalising plans to launch the new party during an event likely on Wednesday, said the sources who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Nahid Islam, a student leader and adviser to the interim government that took charge of Bangladesh after Hasina’s exit, is expected to lead the party as convener, the sources said.
Islam has been a key figure in advocating for student interests within the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has been at the helm of Bangladesh since August 2024. He is expected to resign from his current role to focus on leading the new political party.
Yunus has said that elections could be held by the end of 2025, and many political analysts believe that a youth-led party could significantly reshape the country’s political landscape. Yunus has said he was not interested in running.
The South Asian nation has been grappling with political unrest since Hasina left following weeks of protests during which more than 1,000 people were killed.
Officials from Hasina’s former government and security apparatus systematically committed serious human rights violations against the protesters during the uprising, the U.N. human rights commission said this month.
Hasina and her party deny any wrongdoing.

Title: ₹3.5 lakh crore transferred to farmers under PM-KISAN: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 06:10:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed pride in the nation’s farmers and congratulated them on the successful completion of six years of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme. Launched in 2019, the scheme aims to provide direct financial support to farmers, ensuring stability and boosting agricultural productivity.
The announcement comes ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to Bihar’s Bhagalpur district, where he will release the 19th installment of the PM-KISAN scheme.
PM Modi reiterated the government’s commitment to supporting farmers. The financial aid, transferred through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, eliminates middlemen and ensures timely payments directly into farmers’ bank accounts.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “We are proud of our Annadatas,” and highlighted various government initiatives aimed at improving farmers’ livelihoods. He noted that over the last decade, rapid advancements in the agricultural sector have increased farmers’ market access, reduced production costs, and boosted their income.
“Many congratulations to our farmer brothers and sisters across the country on the completion of six years of PM-KISAN. It is a matter of immense satisfaction and pride for me that so far about three and a half lakh crore rupees have reached their accounts. This effort of ours is giving respect, prosperity, and new strength to the food providers,” PM Modi added.
Over the years, the PM-KISAN scheme has played a vital role in easing financial burdens on farmers, supporting crop production, and improving their economic conditions.
During his visit to Bihar, PM Modi is also expected to announce several initiatives aimed at strengthening the state’s agricultural, dairy, and rural economy. Among these measures is an increase in the loan limit under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh, ensuring greater financial accessibility and empowering farmers to invest in modern farming practices.

Title: Venus Williams will not play Indian Wells, despite wild card invite
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:52:32 +0000
Content: Former world number one Venus Williams will not compete at next month’s Indian Wells tournament despite the WTA 1000 event giving the 44-year-old American a wild card.
Williams, who played only two tournaments last season, said at a speaking event in Denmark that she had not been told of the wildcard before the tournament announced it on Wednesday and added that she was unable to compete due to prior commitments.
“I found the announcement super amusing because, I don’t know, people seem to be happy, so I was like, ‘Maybe I’ll just go with it, I don’t know’,” Williams said at the event in the city of Naestved.
“I’m actually not going. I’m going to be overseas.”
Tournament director Tommy Haas later released a statement confirming that Williams would not be playing at the March 2-16 event in Southern California.
“Our team has been informed that Venus is not accepting the wild card this year,” it read. “We wish Venus all the best and hope to see her back in Indian Wells in the future.”
Williams boycotted the event for 15 years after fans booed and heckled her younger sister Serena during her 2001 final victory over Kim Clijsters, apparently in response to Venus withdrawing injured from their semi-final.
“I love Indian Wells, I would love to be there and if I could have accepted it, I would have been like, ‘Yes’, but I already made commitments,” Williams added.

Title: Fight against obesity: PM Modi invites 10 prominent personalities to spread awareness
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:37:40 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited ten prominent personalities from various fields to join a national movement aimed at raising awareness about obesity and promoting healthier lifestyles. This initiative aligns with the Fit India Movement, launched to encourage citizens to adopt fitness as a key part of daily life.
The individuals nominated include Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, businessman Anand Mahindra, actor-turned-politician Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua), Olympic medalists Manu Bhaker and Mirabai Chanu, actors Mohanlal and R. Madhavan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, philanthropist and Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murthy, and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. Each nominee has been encouraged to further nominate ten individuals, amplifying the campaign’s reach across diverse communities.
In a post on X, Prime Minister Modi said, “As mentioned in yesterday’s Mann Ki Baat, I would like to nominate the following people to help strengthen the fight against obesity and spread awareness on reducing edible oil consumption in food. I also request them to nominate ten people each so that our movement gets bigger! Collectively, let us make India fitter and healthier.”
The Prime Minister stressed that obesity is linked to several health complications, including heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, he assured that small lifestyle changes, such as reducing excessive oil consumption, can significantly mitigate these risks.
“Using less oil in food and dealing with obesity is not just a personal choice but also our responsibility towards the family. Excessive use of oil in food can cause many diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension,” PM Modi said, urging citizens to embrace healthier eating habits.
To further strengthen the initiative, the Prime Minister invited Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, boxer Nikhat Zareen, and renowned cardiologist Dr. Devi Shetty to share their insights on combating obesity in future episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
The campaign aims to inspire individuals and communities to adopt healthier food habits, reinforcing the message that small dietary adjustments can lead to a fitter and disease-free future. With the involvement of influential figures and the power of collective action, the initiative aspires to create a lasting impact on the nation’s health.

Title: Musk’s Starlink races with Chinese rivals to dominate satellite internet
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:34:38 +0000
Content: Space is about to get more crowded for Elon Musk. The billionaire’s Starlink communications network is facing increasingly stiff challenges to its dominance of high-speed satellite internet, including from a Chinese state-backed rival and another service financed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.
Shanghai-based SpaceSail in November signed an agreement to enter Brazil and announced it was in talks with over 30 countries. Two months later, it began work in Kazakhstan, according to the Kazakh embassy in Beijing.
Separately, Brasília is in talks with Bezos’s Project Kuiper internet service and Canada’s Telesat, according to a Brazilian official involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss ongoing talks. News of those discussions is being reported for the first time.
Starlink has since 2020 launched more satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) – an altitude of less than 2,000 km – than all its competitors combined. Satellites operating at such low altitudes transmit data extremely efficiently, providing high-speed internet for remote communities, seafaring vessels and militaries at war.
Musk’s primacy in space is seen as a threat by Beijing, which is both investing heavily in rivals and funding military research into tools that track satellite constellations, according to Chinese corporate filings and academic papers whose details have not been previously reported.
China launched a record 263 LEO satellites last year, according to data from astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell analyzed by tech consultancy Analysys Mason.

The emergence of competition to Starlink has been welcomed by Brazil’s government, which wants high-speed internet for communities in far-flung areas but has previously faced off with Musk over commerce and politics.
SpaceSail declined to comment when presented with Reuters’ questions about its expansion plans. A newspaper controlled by China’s telecoms regulator last year praised it as “capable of transcending national boundaries, penetrating sovereignty and unconditionally covering the whole world … a strategic capability that our country must master.”
Kuiper, Telesat, Starlink and Brazil’s communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Few of Musk’s international rivals have the same ambition as SpaceSail, which is controlled by the Shanghai municipal government. It has announced plans to deploy 648 LEO satellites this year and as many as 15,000 by 2030; Starlink currently has about 7,000 satellites, according to McDowell, and has set itself a target of operating 42,000 by the end of the decade.
SpaceSail’s launches will eventually comprise the Qianfan, or “Thousand Sails,” constellation that marks China’s first international push into satellite broadband. Three other Chinese constellations are also in development, with Beijing planning to launch 43,000 LEO satellites in the coming decades and investing in rockets that can carry multiple satellites.
“The endgame is to occupy as many orbital slots as possible,” said Chaitanya Giri, a space technology expert at India’s Observer Research Foundation.
China’s rush to occupy more of lower-Earth orbit has raised concerns among Western policymakers, who worry that it could extend the reach of Beijing’s internet censorship regime. Researchers at the American Foreign Policy Council think-tank said in a February paper that Washington should increase cooperation with Global South nations if it wanted to “seriously contest China’s growing foray into digital dominance.”
The researchers also described Qianfan as a crucial part of the space component of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The $1 trillion global infrastructure development plan is a signature policy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but has been accused by critics of being primarily a tool to expand Beijing’s geopolitical influence.
China’s commerce ministry and telecoms regulator did not respond to requests for comment. China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that while it was not aware of the specifics surrounding SpaceSail and Chinese LEO satellites expanding overseas, Beijing pursues space cooperation with other countries for the benefit of their peoples.
SpaceSail has said it aims to supply reliable internet to more users, particularly those in remote areas and during recovery from emergencies and natural disasters.
WILD WEST
Starlink’s rapid expansion and its use in the war in Ukraine has caught the attention of military researchers like those at China’s National University of Defense Technology, prompting significant state funding for rival satellite networks.
Hongqing Technology, which was founded in 2017 and is developing a 10,000-satellite constellation, this month raised 340 million yuan from mostly state-affiliated investors.
Last year, SpaceSail secured 6.7 billion yuan ($930 million) in a financing round led by a state-owned investment fund focused on upgrading China’s manufacturing capabilities.
Chinese researchers, including many affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army, have also turned their attention to the field. China published a record 2,449 patents related to LEO satellite technology in 2023, up from 162 in 2019, according to Anaqua’s AcclaimIP database.
Many focus on cost-efficient satellite networks and low-latency communication systems, according to a Reuters review, underscoring China’s push to close the technology gap.
“The space world is moving fast and busy experimenting,” said Antoine Grenier, global head of space at the Analysys Mason consultancy. “Pioneers are enjoying this relative freedom and are shaping it to their advantage to claim key positions before rules become more stringent – like the wild west.”
Some of the Chinese research appears to be targeted at Starlink, with one PLA-linked patent application describing the U.S. system as critical to reconnaissance and military communications while posing “threats to network, data, and military security.”
Beijing is also developing tools to track and monitor Starlink’s constellation. Researchers from two PLA-affiliated institutes said in a January study published in a Chinese engineering journal that they had designed a system and algorithm for tracking megaconstellations like Starlink’s, which was inspired by how humpback whales trap their prey by circling them and creating spiralling bubbles.
“With the growing trend of space militarization, developing tools to monitor and track these megaconstellations is critically important,” the researchers wrote.

Title: ‘Conclave,’ Chalamet win at SAG Awards, setting up Oscars battle
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:26:32 +0000
Content: Papal thriller “Conclave” claimed the top prize on Sunday at Hollywood’s Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Timothee Chalamet’s portrayal of Bob Dylan made him the surprise best actor winner, at the last major honors ahead of next weekend’s Oscars.
The “Conclave” cast of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini won best movie ensemble at the SAG Awards, a red-carpet ceremony that streamed live on Netflix. The film tells the story of the secret maneuvering at the Vatican during the selection of a fictional pope.
Fiennes spoke on behalf of the cast about the need for supportive communities, in filmmaking and in life, as he accepted the SAG trophy on stage in downtown Los Angeles.
“We do recognize the supreme importance of (community) in our work and in the world,” Fiennes said. “That’s what we’re celebrating tonight.”
“Conclave” was feted as the real-life pope, 88-year-old Pope Francis, remained in critical condition with double pneumonia. Italian actress Rossellini wished him well during and after the ceremony.
“We are very, very worried for our pope,” she told reporters after the SAG event. “We love this pope.”
The “Conclave” win signaled the movie could take the prestigious best picture trophy at the Academy Awards on March 2. Members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union pick the SAG winners, and actors form the largest voting body for the Oscars.
But the race for best picture at the Oscars is unusually murky this year.
While “Conclave” also captured the top prize at the Britain’s BAFTA awards, the big trophies from Hollywood producers and directors went to “Anora,” a drama about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch.
Chalamet scored the SAG award for best movie actor for playing a young Dylan as he arrives in New York to try to make it in music in “A Complete Unknown.”
The outcome was an upset over Adrien Brody, who landed several acting trophies earlier in the season for playing an immigrant and architect in “The Brutalist.”
The 29-year-old Chalamet said he “poured everything I had” into his portrayal of Dylan.
“The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” Chalamet said. “I want to be one of the greats.”
Demi Moore was honored as best movie actress for her role as a fading celebrity seeking a fountain of youth in “The Substance.” The actress recalled getting her SAG union card in 1978 at age 15.
“It changed my life because it gave me meaning, it gave me purpose and it gave me direction,” she said. “I was a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life.”
The supporting movie actor and actress trophies went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldana for “Emilia Perez.”
In television honors, the cast of FX’s “Shogun,” a tale of political machinations in imperial Japan, was named best ensemble in a drama. “Only Murders in the Building” won best ensemble in a comedy series for stars including Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin.
“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” a surprised Gomez said. “Marty and Steve aren’t here because, you know, they don’t really care,” she added, drawing laughter from the crowd.
Actor and activist Jane Fonda was honored with a life achievement award and talked about the empathy that actors draw upon in their performances.
“Empathy is not weak or woke,” she said, “and by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people.”

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday remembered former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on her birth anniversary, honoring her legacy as a compassionate leader and an outstanding administrator.
Posting a picture of her on X, PM Modi described Jayalalithaa as someone who was deeply committed to Tamil Nadu’s development and always supportive of pro-people initiatives.
“Remembering Jayalalithaa Ji on her birth anniversary. She is widely admired as a compassionate leader and outstanding administrator who devoted her life to Tamil Nadu’s development,” the Prime Minister wrote. “It is my privilege that I had the opportunity to interact with her on innumerable occasions. She was always very warm and supportive of pro-people initiatives.”
In Chennai, veteran actor Rajinikanth paid tribute to the late leader at her Poes Garden residence, laying floral offerings before her portrait. The ceremony was attended by Jayalalithaa’s niece, Deepa Madhavan, and former AIADMK leader Phugalendhi, marking a moment of remembrance for the beloved leader, fondly referred to as “Amma” by her supporters.
Jayalalithaa, who served as Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister for three terms (1991-96, 2002-06, and 2011-14), is remembered as a charismatic and powerful leader who shaped the state’s political landscape.
Before entering politics, she was a celebrated actress, starring in over 130 films before joining the AIADMK in 1982. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the party’s propaganda secretary in 1983, later serving as a Rajya Sabha member and state legislator.
Her political career was marked by both triumphs and controversies, including legal battles and a brief imprisonment in 1996 following a raid at her residence. She also played a key role on the national stage, aligning with the BJP-led NDA in 1998 before later parting ways.
In 2014, she was convicted in a corruption case, leading to her temporary removal from office. However, she made a comeback before her tragic demise on December 5, 2016.

Title: England’s Carse out of Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan, say reports
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:56:47 +0000
Content: Brydon Carse is set to miss England’s Champions Trophy clash against Afghanistan, British media reported on Monday, casting doubt on the fast bowler’s participation in the rest of the tournament.
Carse, who missed a training session with England on Monday as he continues to recover from a blister on a toe on his left foot, is likely to be replaced by Jamie Overton for the Group B match against Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old played in England’s five-wicket loss to Australia in their opening game on Saturday, taking one wicket and conceding 69 runs in his seven overs.
“We will have to wait and see,” England batter Joe Root told the BBC in Lahore when asked about Carse’s fitness.
“There is still a good way to go until the game, to find exactly what is up with Carsey. We will see how things pan out over the next few days.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
England, who have the option to call in a replacement for Carse if he is ruled out of the tournament, are winless and sit third in the Group B standings behind South Africa and Australia.

Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:48:12 +0000
Content: India’s annual wind power capacity addition is projected to more than double to an average of 7.1 gigawatts (GW) over the next two financial years, compared with 3.4 GW in fiscal year 2023-25. This growth, driven by government measures to accelerate the sector, is expected to increase the country’s total installed wind capacity to approximately 63 GW by 2026-27, according to a report released on Monday.
Capacity additions in financial years 2023-24 and 2024-25 remained tepid, ranging between 6-7 GW, due to fewer successful auctions of wind capacities—5.9 GW in FY21-23 and 5.2 GW in FY23-25—according to a Crisil report.
The slow progress was largely attributed to weak developer interest caused by low tariffs that dampened returns, as well as challenges related to land availability and transmission infrastructure in high wind potential areas, the report noted.
However, emerging tailwinds are expected to double the pace of capacity additions over the next two years.
The government’s push for hybrid renewable projects—combining solar, wind, and/or storage—along with a more favorable cost structure for wind projects, is expected to drive capacity growth, the report stated.
In addition to steady standalone wind project auctions, hybrid renewable energy project auctions—requiring developers to supply electricity during high-demand hours (evening and early morning)—have gained momentum.
Wind power is expected to account for 30–50% of these hybrid projects, as it generates electricity during peak demand periods, unlike solar power, which is mostly active during daytime hours.
Moreover, since hybrid projects help distribution companies (discoms) address scheduling challenges during critical times, they are expected to gain traction in offtake and grow rapidly, the report added.
According to Ankit Hakhu, Director at Crisil Ratings, India has over 30 GW of hybrid projects in the pipeline, expected to be commissioned within the next 2-4 years, contributing significantly to the projected increase in wind capacity additions.
“Traction in signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) is also visible, with more than 60% of such projects auctioned by March 2024 having their PPAs signed by January 2025,” he said.

Title: PM-KISAN completes 19 successful instalments
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:19:33 +0000
Content: PM Modi disburses over Rs 22,000 crore to 9.8 crore farmers under 19th PM-KISAN instalment
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released the 19th instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme in Bhagalpur, Bihar.
The tranche, amounting to more than Rs.22,000 crore, will provide direct financial assistance to over 9.8 crore farmers nationwide, including 2.41 crore women farmers.
Launched in February 2019, the PM-KISAN scheme aims to support the financial needs of small and marginal farmers (SMFs) by providing Rs.6,000 annually in three installments.
The funds are transferred directly to beneficiaries’ Aadhaar-linked bank accounts through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), ensuring transparency and eliminating middlemen.
This assistance enables farmers to purchase essential farming inputs and reduces their dependence on moneylenders. Since its inception, the government has disbursed over Rs.3.46 lakh crore across 18 instalments as of February 2025.
Previously, on October 5, 2024, PM Modi had released the 18th instalment of the scheme in Washim, Maharashtra, disbursing over Rs.20,000 crore to benefit more than 9.4 crore farmers.
The scheme’s farmer-centric digital infrastructure has been continuously improved to ensure that benefits reach all farmers efficiently. The PM-KISAN mobile app, launched on 24th February 2020, further streamlined the process by offering self-registration, e-KYC through face authentication, and benefit status tracking. An AI chatbot, Kisan-eMitra, introduced in 2023, provides instant assistance in local languages, enhancing the accessibility of the scheme.
Also, over 5 lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) have been set up across the country to assist farmers with registrations and e-KYC. A robust grievance redressal system, along with efforts to extend e-KYC completion through India Post Payment Bank and state government officials, has ensured the scheme’s reach to every eligible farmer.
With continuous technological advancements and improved governance, the PM-KISAN scheme stands as a testament to the government’s commitment to supporting India’s farmers. It has not only helped with agricultural needs but has also contributed to broader expenses such as education and healthcare, solidifying its role in empowering rural communities across the country.

Title: India’s tech sector poised to reach valuation of $350 billion in five years: Rajnath Singh
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:53 +0000
Content: India’s technology sector is projected to reach a valuation of $300-350 billion over the next five years, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.
Speaking at the 16th Foundation Day of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, Singh urged students to seize opportunities to drive technological progress both domestically and globally.
“With more than 1.25 lakh start-ups and 110 unicorns, our country is emerging as the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world,” Singh said.
The Defence Minister stressed the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship, urging the country’s youth to contribute to areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digital technologies. He praised IIT Mandi for its contributions to India’s scientific and technological progress, particularly its role in fostering research and development in these emerging fields.

Title: The digital transformation and efficiency of India’s direct benefit transfer model
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:00:27 +0000
Content: India’s welfare system has undergone a profound transformation in recent years as technology has been channeled to manage long-standing challenges such as bureaucratic inefficiencies, administrative leakages, and corruption. For decades, social assistance programs—whether in the form of cash or in-kind transfers—suffered from complex processes and significant fund losses, with studies revealing that out of every 1 rupee allocated, only about 15 paisa reached the intended beneficiary.
This inefficiency was particularly striking given that India dedicates nearly 3%-4% of its GDP to subsidies (Economic Survey, 2017-18) and social support programs aimed at uplifting its citizens. However, systemic challenges in effectively identifying the true beneficiaries, coupled with delays in delivery, result in a significant loss of resources—equivalent to nearly half (Policy Paper, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy) of these allocated funds each year.
In response, the government introduced the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system in 2013, a transformative initiative aimed at delivering benefits directly to citizens’ bank accounts while minimizing human intervention (Table 1: An estimated gain of about ₹3,48,564.66 crore as per the data available on https://dbtbharat.gov.in/; as accessed on 08-02-2025). The DBT framework is built on the robust ‘JAM’ trinity of Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and mobile connectivity.
This integrated system has enabled the direct crediting of subsidies and benefits into beneficiaries’ bank accounts, dramatically reducing the scope for corruption and administrative mismanagement. With the digitalization of beneficiary databases, the government has effectively weeded out ghost accounts and reduced duplications, ensuring proper resource allocation (Table 1).
Financial inclusion received a significant boost with the launch of the Jan Dhan Yojana in 2014, which, coupled with the exponential increase in mobile connectivity, laid the groundwork for the rapid expansion of the DBT system. Central to this digital revolution is the Aadhaar system, launched in 2009 and now recognized as the largest biometric identity program in the world. By streamlining the verification process and eliminating duplicate records, Aadhaar has been instrumental in ensuring that social assistance reaches the correct beneficiaries.
Previously, complex documentation requirements and multiple forms of identification for various schemes created obstacles for efficient service delivery. With Aadhaar now linked to programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), ration cards, and other social welfare initiatives, the process has become far more coherent and targeted. As of 14th August 2024, over 53 crore Jan Dhan accounts had been opened (https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2049231), addressing the critical issue of an unbanked population.
The surge in mobile phone usage, evidenced by an increase in teledensity from 68.64% in 2013 to approximately 85.4% on 31st August 2024 (https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2068372), further highlights the effectiveness of the ‘JAM’ approach. By linking Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile phones, the government has created a seamless infrastructure that underpins the DBT mechanism.
The technical process of DBT involves Aadhaar-based authentication—using demographic data, one-time passwords, or biometric verification—to map beneficiaries’ details to their bank accounts via the Aadhaar Payment Bridge of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Since its initial rollout covering 28 schemes in 2013-14, the DBT mission has expanded dramatically, now encompassing over 320 schemes (Table 2).
The total funds transferred have surged from approximately ₹7,300 crore to ₹6,91,300 crore in 2023-24, and the number of beneficiaries has grown from 11 crore to nearly 176 crore over the same period (Table 2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the system’s scalability was particularly evident, as beneficiary coverage increased from 145 crore in FY2019-20 to 180 crore in FY2020-21, emphasizing the infrastructure’s capacity to adapt rapidly to emergent needs.
The evolution of DBT has been marked by its expanding scope, beginning with student scholarships and support for women, children, and workers, and gradually incorporating a diverse array of welfare schemes. MGNREGS, which guarantees at least 100 days of manual labor at notified wages, generally suffered from significant wage payment delays due to cumbersome processes.
The introduction of the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) under DBT has dramatically improved payment timelines, with timely payment disbursements rising from 50.09% in 2012-13 to over 98% by 2024-25 (https://nreganarep.nic.in/netnrega/MISreport4.aspx).
Beyond direct cash transfers, Aadhaar has enabled access to a range of critical services. In the healthcare sector, for instance, the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY) employs Aadhaar-based eKYC to facilitate a paperless process for cashless hospitalization benefits, while the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ initiative has leveraged electronic point-of-sale devices and biometric scanners to ensure that subsidized food grains are accessible nationwide.
Moreover, Aadhaar serves as a universal identifier that integrates various government databases, such as those for unorganized workers—via the e-Shram portal—and for senior citizens, who can now generate a digital life certificate through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using applications like Jeevan Praman.
The far-reaching impact of these technological advancements is evident in the diverse range of beneficiaries served. Women have gained enhanced support through schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and LPG gas subsidies, while educational initiatives have provided scholarships worth ₹8,584 crore to around 50 lakh students in FY2023.
Similarly, social assistance programs like the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) have extended benefits amounting to ₹3,546 crore to over 3.81 crore citizens, including the elderly, widowed, and persons with disabilities. The creation of more than 30 crore e-Shram cards as on date has enriched the understanding of the unorganized workforce (https://eshram.gov.in/indexmain), and initiatives like the Digital Health ID under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission empower every citizen to build a comprehensive digital health footprint through secure Aadhaar-based authentication.
Conclusion
Since 2014, India’s welfare system has seen notable changes, a true testament to the government’s committed efforts to improve governance and ensure financial inclusion. By integrating technology, including the mass adoption of Aadhaar, an expansion in mobile services, and the community-driven Jan Dhan Yojana, the government has redesigned how social benefits are distributed.
Central to this transformation is the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, supported by the powerful JAM trinity. This approach has drastically minimized the loss of funds due to leakage and mismanagement, guaranteeing that more resources reach the people they are meant to benefit.
The move towards a digital-first welfare system demonstrates a forward-thinking strategy where technology and evidence-based policies work together to enhance transparency, inclusivity, and timeliness in public services.

Title: Defence Ministry panel explores greater private sector role in India’s indigenous AMCA fighter jet project
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 17:26:21 +0000
Content: The Defence Ministry has intensified focus on strengthening domestic aerospace capabilities by involving the private sector in the development of the indigenous fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).
To facilitate this, the Ministry of Defence has set up a high-level committee under Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh to explore avenues for increased private sector participation in the AMCA project, defence officials said. The committee includes representatives from the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the state-owned aerospace manufacturer.
The government is considering multiple models to enhance private sector involvement. One proposal is a joint venture between HAL and a private firm, while another approach focuses on engaging private companies for design and development, leveraging HAL’s extensive experience in aerospace manufacturing.
At present, the Tata Group is the only private Indian firm with experience in aircraft integration, working alongside Airbus to assemble C-295 transport aircraft in India. However, HAL has already outsourced significant components of jet manufacturing to private companies such as L&T, Godrej, and Azad Engineering.
The AMCA, designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) for the IAF, was showcased at Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru earlier this month. The 25-ton aircraft will feature advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-powered capabilities, including multi-sensor data fusion for enhanced situational awareness, an automatic target identification system, and a combined vision system for navigation in low-visibility conditions.
According to the ADA, integrating AI in the AMCA will significantly enhance operational efficiency, positioning the aircraft as one of the most advanced fifth-generation fighters in the world.

Celebrating a major milestone, he revealed that the government had achieved its target of creating 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) across the country. The 10,000th FPO, focusing on maize, bananas, and paddy, has been registered in Bihar’s Khagaria district, marking a significant step in strengthening agricultural practices and supporting farmers.
The PM-KISAN scheme, launched on February 24, 2019, provides an annual financial assistance of ₹6,000 to eligible farmer families. So far, more than ₹3.46 lakh crore has been disbursed to over 11 crore farmer families in the country through 18 installments.
The Bihar Legislative Assembly elections for all 243 constituencies are scheduled to take place in October or November this year, with the last elections held in 2020.

Title: PM Modi pays tribute to former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa on her birth anniversary
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:27:22 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday remembered former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on her birth anniversary, honoring her legacy as a compassionate leader and an outstanding administrator.
Posting a picture of her on X, PM Modi described Jayalalithaa as someone who was deeply committed to Tamil Nadu’s development and always supportive of pro-people initiatives.
“Remembering Jayalalithaa Ji on her birth anniversary. She is widely admired as a compassionate leader and outstanding administrator who devoted her life to Tamil Nadu’s development,” the Prime Minister wrote. “It is my privilege that I had the opportunity to interact with her on innumerable occasions. She was always very warm and supportive of pro-people initiatives.”
In Chennai, veteran actor Rajinikanth paid tribute to the late leader at her Poes Garden residence, laying floral offerings before her portrait. The ceremony was attended by Jayalalithaa’s niece, Deepa Madhavan, and former AIADMK leader Phugalendhi, marking a moment of remembrance for the beloved leader, fondly referred to as “Amma” by her supporters.
Jayalalithaa, who served as Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister for three terms (1991-96, 2002-06, and 2011-14), is remembered as a charismatic and powerful leader who shaped the state’s political landscape.
Before entering politics, she was a celebrated actress, starring in over 130 films before joining the AIADMK in 1982. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the party’s propaganda secretary in 1983, later serving as a Rajya Sabha member and state legislator.
Her political career was marked by both triumphs and controversies, including legal battles and a brief imprisonment in 1996 following a raid at her residence. She also played a key role on the national stage, aligning with the BJP-led NDA in 1998 before later parting ways.
In 2014, she was convicted in a corruption case, leading to her temporary removal from office. However, she made a comeback before her tragic demise on December 5, 2016.

Title: Global Indian Leaders Unite at Indiaspora Forum in Abu Dhabi, Strengthening India’s Global Cultural Bridge
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:10:38 +0000
Content: The Indiaspora Forum for Good 2025 opened today in Abu Dhabi, bringing together prominent global leaders of Indian origin from over 30 countries to discuss international cooperation and development. The event, running until February 26 and concluding in Dubai, highlights the growing influence of the Indian diaspora in shaping global policy and business.
Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahyan, UAE Minister of Tolerance, emphasized the “eternal friendship and special relationship” between the UAE and India in his opening address. “This summit is an important platform for generating ideas and exchanging knowledge on major global challenges. Your participation reflects a strong conviction that our shared values and ideas can bind us together and help us address these challenges effectively,” he said.
A key highlight of the forum was the release of a comprehensive impact report showcasing the extraordinary growth and influence of the Indian diaspora in the UAE. The report traces the community’s rise from a modest 5,000 people in 1975 to 3.9 million today, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the UAE’s economic and social landscape. It also details how the diaspora has become a key stakeholder in strengthening UAE-GCC international relations while gaining increased global visibility and influence.

Title: England’s Carse out of Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan, say reports
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:56:47 +0000
Content: Brydon Carse is set to miss England’s Champions Trophy clash against Afghanistan, British media reported on Monday, casting doubt on the fast bowler’s participation in the rest of the tournament.
Carse, who missed a training session with England on Monday as he continues to recover from a blister on a toe on his left foot, is likely to be replaced by Jamie Overton for the Group B match against Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old played in England’s five-wicket loss to Australia in their opening game on Saturday, taking one wicket and conceding 69 runs in his seven overs.
“We will have to wait and see,” England batter Joe Root told the BBC in Lahore when asked about Carse’s fitness.
“There is still a good way to go until the game, to find exactly what is up with Carsey. We will see how things pan out over the next few days.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
England, who have the option to call in a replacement for Carse if he is ruled out of the tournament, are winless and sit third in the Group B standings behind South Africa and Australia.

Title: India’s wind power capacity poised to surge to 63 GW by 2026-27
Publication Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:48:12 +0000
Content: India’s annual wind power capacity addition is projected to more than double to an average of 7.1 gigawatts (GW) over the next two financial years, compared with 3.4 GW in fiscal year 2023-25. This growth, driven by government measures to accelerate the sector, is expected to increase the country’s total installed wind capacity to approximately 63 GW by 2026-27, according to a report released on Monday.
Capacity additions in financial years 2023-24 and 2024-25 remained tepid, ranging between 6-7 GW, due to fewer successful auctions of wind capacities—5.9 GW in FY21-23 and 5.2 GW in FY23-25—according to a Crisil report.
The slow progress was largely attributed to weak developer interest caused by low tariffs that dampened returns, as well as challenges related to land availability and transmission infrastructure in high wind potential areas, the report noted.
However, emerging tailwinds are expected to double the pace of capacity additions over the next two years.
The government’s push for hybrid renewable projects—combining solar, wind, and/or storage—along with a more favorable cost structure for wind projects, is expected to drive capacity growth, the report stated.
In addition to steady standalone wind project auctions, hybrid renewable energy project auctions—requiring developers to supply electricity during high-demand hours (evening and early morning)—have gained momentum.
Wind power is expected to account for 30–50% of these hybrid projects, as it generates electricity during peak demand periods, unlike solar power, which is mostly active during daytime hours.
Moreover, since hybrid projects help distribution companies (discoms) address scheduling challenges during critical times, they are expected to gain traction in offtake and grow rapidly, the report added.
According to Ankit Hakhu, Director at Crisil Ratings, India has over 30 GW of hybrid projects in the pipeline, expected to be commissioned within the next 2-4 years, contributing significantly to the projected increase in wind capacity additions.
“Traction in signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) is also visible, with more than 60% of such projects auctioned by March 2024 having their PPAs signed by January 2025,” he said.

Title: Advantage Assam 2.0: PM Modi highlights Northeast’s role in India’s growth
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:24:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Advantage Assam 2.0 investors’ summit in Guwahati on Tuesday, underscoring the role of Eastern India in shaping the country’s economic progress.
The two-day summit features an inaugural session, seven ministerial sessions, and 14 thematic sessions, along with an exhibition showcasing Assam’s industrial growth and investment potential. Over 240 exhibitors are participating, highlighting the state’s evolving industries, global trade partnerships, and MSME sector.
PM Modi arrived in Guwahati on February 24 and attended the Jhumoir Binandini (Mega Jhumoir) 2025 programme before inaugurating the summit. The event has drawn global investors, policymakers, industry leaders, startups, and students.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said, “History is witness that Eastern India has played a significant role in India’s prosperity. Today, as India moves towards rapid development, once again, the Northeast is poised to showcase its immense potential. Advantage Assam is a reflection of this resurgence.”
Recalling his visit to Assam in 2013 during the election campaign, he noted, “I had then said that the day is not far when people will start learning alphabets with ‘A for Assam’—today, that vision is turning into reality.”
PM Modi highlighted India’s economic resilience, stating, “Despite global uncertainties, experts are confident about India’s rapid growth. The reason behind this is our long-term vision for the 21st century. The world today trusts India’s young, skilled, and innovative population. It trusts our emerging middle class, moving forward with new aspirations. And most importantly, it trusts 140 crore Indians, who ensure political stability and policy continuity.”
The second edition of Advantage Assam, which was first held in 2018, aims to boost infrastructure development and attract investments to position Assam as a key investment destination in India. The event is expected to draw investors from across the country and the world.

Title: Pope Francis still critical but shows ‘slight improvement’, Vatican says
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:16:41 +0000
Content: Pope Francis is still critically ill as he battles double pneumonia, but his condition has shown a “slight improvement”, the Vatican said on Monday.
The 88-year-old pontiff is spending his 11th night in Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, making it the longest hospital stay of his nearly 12-year papacy.
“The clinical conditions of the Holy Father, in their critical nature, show a slight improvement,” the health update read.
The pope, it said, was still receiving oxygen, “although with slightly reduced flow and oxygen percentage”.
It added that the “mild kidney insufficiency,” which was first reported on Sunday, was “not a cause for concern”.
A Vatican official, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to speak about the pope’s condition, earlier said that Francis was eating normally and was able to get up and move about his hospital room.
Monday’s statement said the pope had resumed work in the afternoon and in the evening made a call to the Catholic parish in Gaza, which the pope has done frequently during the Israel-Hamas war.
On Sunday, the Vatican described the pope’s condition as critical for a second day in a row. On Saturday, it said the pope had needed a blood transfusion after experiencing a “prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis”.
Monday’s update said the pope had not had further respiratory crises and that some of his laboratory tests “have improved”.
Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has described the pope’s infection as “complex,” and said it was caused by two or more microorganisms.
Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.
CARDINALS SPECULATE
The pope’s prolonged illness has provoked an unusual amount of public speculation among cardinals, the highest officials in the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church after the pontiff.
New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who is not known as close to Francis and did not cite information beyond the Vatican’s medical updates, said in a homily during Mass at his cathedral on Sunday that the pope was “probably close to death”.
German Cardinal Gerhard Muller, a former Vatican official known to have disagreed with Francis on doctrinal issues, admonished prelates who were publicly speculating about the pope’s condition or planning for a conclave, the secret gathering of cardinals to elect a new pope.
He told Italy’s Corriere della Sera that cardinals were not receiving any more information than the public about the pope’s condition.
“The pope is still alive and this is a moment for prayer,” he said. “If there is anyone who is looking to the future while Francis is in the hospital, that’s good for nothing.”
Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s number-two official, led a prayer service for Francis in St Peter’s Square on Monday evening attended by pilgrims and senior Church figures. The service is set to be repeated daily.
Parolin prayed that the Virgin Mary would “sustain (Francis) in this moment of sickness and trial, and help him recover his health soon”.
Outside Gemelli Hospital, groups also gathered to pray for Francis near a statue of the late Pope John Paul II, who was treated at the facility many times over his 1978-2005 papacy.
Maria Vozlv, a Ukrainian who has lived in Rome for 18 years, said many in her home country were concerned.
The pontiff has often decried the three-year-old war in Ukraine and called for peace.
“We Ukrainians are really praying for him,” Vozlv said. “He needs to get well and come home.”

Title: Ukraine marks Russia invasion anniversary amid talk US minerals deal is close
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:02:32 +0000
Content: Ukraine hosted European leaders on Monday to mark three years of all-out war with Russia since Moscow’s invasion, while top U.S. officials stayed away in a clear illustration of President Donald Trump’s lurch towards Moscow since returning to power.
Still reeling from Trump falsely calling President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a “dictator”, Kyiv said it was in the final stages of reaching a deal with Washington to provide U.S. access to its mineral wealth.
After meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said Zelenskiy could travel to Washington this week or next to seal the minerals agreement, which he called “very close,” and suggested the war in Ukraine could end within weeks. But he did not elaborate.
“Our focus is on achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible, and ultimately a permanent peace,” Trump said during a joint press conference with Macron.
Macron, in a later interview with Fox News, said he believes a truce in Ukraine is feasible in the next few weeks. A U.S. minerals deal with Kyiv would be one of the best ways to ensure a commitment from Washington, he said.
Trump stopped short of saying, however, that the minerals agreement would contain the explicit U.S. security guarantees that Ukraine has sought and put the onus on Europe for the “central role” in assuring the country’s long-term security.
A Ukrainian government source said the U.S. did not like the idea of including wording about providing security guarantees.
The minerals deal is at the heart of Kyiv’s bid to win U.S. support, but officials have negotiated in the shadow of an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Zelenskiy, who said the U.S. leader was living in a “disinformation bubble”.
Trump’s rush to impose an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine – and his seeming embrace of part of the Kremlin narrative – have stoked fears of far-reaching U.S. concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin that could undermine security in Ukraine and Europe and alter the geopolitical landscape.
Zelenskiy refused to sign an earlier draft of a minerals agreement as Washington sought rights to $500 billion in Ukraine’s natural wealth. Kyiv protested it had received far less than that in U.S. aid and the deal lacked the security guarantees Ukraine needs.
Macron said Europe was prepared to send peacekeepers to monitor a truce in Ukraine and increase defence spending. Trump said Putin had said he was willing to accept European peacekeepers.
‘WORRIED’ EUROPEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS
In Kyiv on Monday, Zelenskiy welcomed a slew of European and other leaders to a summit to commemorate Moscow’s 2022 invasion, the start of the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.
“Putin will not gift us this peace, nor will he give it to us in exchange for anything. We have to win peace with strength, wisdom and unity – with our cooperation,” Zelenskiy said.
The visitors included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and the leaders of Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden.
There was no sign of U.S. representation.
The European leaders rallied around Zelenskiy in speeches, calling for countries on the continent to step up support for Kyiv, while some spoke of the urgent need to increase defence spending.
European officials have been left flat-footed by Trump’s decisions to hold talks on ending the war in Ukraine with Russia, spurning both Kyiv and Europe, and by his administration’s warning that the United States was no longer primarily focused on Europe’s security.
Asked earlier whether Ukraine should be willing to cede territory as part of an end to the war, Trump, who last week falsely accused Kyiv of starting the conflict, said: “We’ll see.”
Even as Trump pressed for a quick deal with Putin, Macron urged a more deliberate approach, saying: “We don’t want an agreement that is weak.”
Putin said on Monday that Russia is not opposed to Europe’s involvement in Russia-U.S. peace talks on the Ukraine crisis that began in Riyadh last week, but he noted that Brussels had previously declined to engage in dialogue with Moscow.
He said Trump was approaching the Russia-Ukraine conflict with rationality rather than emotion.
TRUMP WILLING TO GO TO MOSCOW
At the United Nations on Monday, Kyiv and Europe scored a diplomatic victory with resolutions in the General Assembly that backed Ukraine’s sovereignty.
But the U.S. and Russia succeeded in the Security Council with a U.S.-drafted resolution that took a neutral position on the conflict.
The Group of Seven nations were still trying to negotiate a joint statement on the war, Canada said. Washington has objected to language about “Russian aggression” in such a statement, Reuters reported last week.
In a post on Truth Social after a call with Group of Seven leaders, Trump said he was in “serious discussions” with Putin about ending the war and “major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia.”
A few hours later, Putin announced an offer for the U.S. government and companies to explore Russia’s rare earth deposits and for Russia to supply aluminium to the U.S.
In the three-year-old conflict, thousands of Ukrainian citizens have died and more than 6 million are refugees abroad.
Western estimates based on intelligence reports vary widely, but most say hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded on each side.

Title: IOA forms ad hoc committee to oversee boxing affairs; BFI calls decision “illegal”
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 06:48:24 +0000
Content: The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has strongly opposed the Indian Olympic Association’s (IOA) decision to form an ad hoc committee to manage boxing affairs, calling it “illegal.” The IOA cited “administrative instability” within the federation as the reason for its intervention.
The BFI elections were scheduled for February 2, but they have not been held. On Monday, the IOA announced the formation of an ad hoc committee to oversee the “affairs of the Indian Boxing Federation and ensure the smooth functioning of its activities until the conduct of free and fair elections.”
“The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has been closely monitoring the administrative affairs of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI). As per governing norms, elections for the BFI were to be conducted on or before February 2, 2025. However, despite the prescribed timeline, the elections have not been held, resulting in administrative instability within the federation,” IOA President PT Usha said in a letter.
“Furthermore, this office has received numerous complaints from stakeholders, including athletes, coaches, and concerned authorities, regarding the non-participation of Indian boxers in various important national and international events in recent months. This situation is detrimental to the growth and performance of Indian boxing on the global stage and necessitates immediate corrective measures,” she added.
The ad hoc committee is headed by Madhukant Pathak, with Rajesh Bhandari, DP Bhatt, Virendra Singh Thakur, and Shiva Thapa as its other members.
In response to the IOA’s decision, the BFI issued a statement condemning the creation of the ad hoc committee, calling it illegal.
“The BFI strongly condemns the creation of an ad hoc panel to manage its affairs, calling it illegal and a blatant attempt to violate the autonomy of a National Sports Federation (NSF). This has also been communicated in a letter from the BFI President to the President of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA),” the statement said.
“BFI will also be filing a petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court to quash this illegal order immediately. It is also pertinent to mention today’s verdict, in which the Hon’ble Delhi High Court annulled the IOA’s decision to form an ad hoc panel for the Bihar Olympic Association,” the statement added.

Title: Mobilising finance crucial for achieving India’s 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030: Union Minister Pralhad Joshi
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 06:42:07 +0000
Content: Union Minister for New & Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, on Monday emphasised the critical importance of mobilising finance to achieve India’s ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030.
Addressing the National Workshop on Mobilising Finance for Renewable Energy in Mumbai, Joshi called for concerted efforts from financial institutions and policymakers to ensure accessible funding for the renewable energy (RE) sector.
Joshi highlighted the role of decentralisation, with initiatives like PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar empowering farmers to become “Urjadata” (energy providers) and reducing transmission losses.
He urged banks to simplify financing, particularly for rooftop solar projects, and called for a Renewable Energy Financing Obligation, akin to Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) for discoms, to secure dedicated funding for RE projects.
The Minister pointed out India’s leadership in green hydrogen, noting the country’s successful export orders and its competitive edge over developed nations.
He also cited the recent global renewable energy summit in Gandhinagar, where India secured commitments worth Rs.34.5 lakh crore, showcasing its strong position as a clean energy investment destination.
Stressing that the transition to renewable energy is non-negotiable, Joshi called for a national movement in renewable energy financing and urged financial institutions to streamline lending processes and reduce compliance burdens.
Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shripad Naik, stated that achieving the target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 will require an estimated investment of Rs.30 lakh crore covering infrastructure development, transmission networks, and energy storage systems.
He encouraged stakeholders to embrace innovative financing models, offer flexible lending terms, and prioritises green investments to expedite the nation’s transition to renewable energy.

Title: Delhi Assembly: 12 AAP MLAs suspended for the day
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 06:41:58 +0000
Content: Twelve Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs were suspended from the Delhi Assembly on Tuesday for causing disruptions during the customary address by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Vinai Kumar Saxena.
The MLAs raised slogans of “Jai Bhim” and protested against the alleged removal of portraits of Bhagat Singh and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar from the Delhi Chief Minister’s office. Despite repeated warnings from Assembly Speaker Vijender Gupta to maintain order, the protests continued, leading to the suspension of the MLAs. Following the announcement, the House was adjourned until noon.
Among the suspended legislators was Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Atishi. The other suspended MLAs include Gopal Rai, Anil Jha, Jarnail Singh, Vishesh Ravi, Som Dutt, Surender Singh, Veer Singh Dhingan, Mukesh Ahlawat, Virender Singh Kadian, Kuldeep Kumar, and Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad.
The protests stemmed from allegations made by AAP leaders that the BJP-led government had removed portraits of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh from the Chief Minister’s office. On Monday, former Chief Minister Atishi shared an image of herself seated in the CM’s office with the portraits of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh visible in the background. She compared this to a photo of the current Chief Minister, Rekha Gupta, which showed portraits of Mahatma Gandhi, President Droupadi Murmu, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi behind the CM’s chair.
In response, the BJP released an image showing that portraits of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh were placed on an adjoining wall in the office. A video later surfaced confirming the presence of these portraits alongside those of Gandhi, Murmu, and Modi.
The three-day Assembly session began on Monday with the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected MLAs and the nomination of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. During Tuesday’s session, the government is set to present reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). The report noted that the implementation of certain policies did not meet the intended objectives.

Title: Telangana tunnel collapse: Rescue efforts enter third day
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 06:02:06 +0000
Content: Rescue operations continued for the third consecutive day in Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district, where eight workers remain trapped after an under-construction tunnel collapsed on Saturday.
Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Army, and other agencies have been working relentlessly since the collapse of a section of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel.
Rescue workers are making extensive efforts to dewater and clear debris from the tunnel to reach the collapsed section. However, despite the deployment of advanced equipment, including endoscopic and robotic cameras provided by L&T teams, no breakthrough has been achieved. The tunnel remains filled with muck, making access to the front portion of the tunnel boring machine particularly difficult.
The same equipment was previously used during the Silkyara Bend-Barkot tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand in 2023, where 41 workers were successfully rescued after 17 days. Rat miners who assisted in that operation are now aiding the NDRF and the Army in the ongoing efforts.
According to officials, waterlogging and debris continue to hinder progress, with the final 40-meter stretch posing a significant challenge. The NDRF, the Army, Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), and the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) are intensifying efforts to clear the tunnel.
Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka is expected to visit the site later today to review the rescue operation, while Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy and Roads and Buildings Minister Komatireddy Venkat Reddy will oversee the ongoing efforts.
The tunnel near Domalapenta collapsed during excavation for the SLBC project, leaving eight of the 50 workers trapped.
The trapped workers include project manager Manoj Kumar (Uttar Pradesh), machine engineer Srinivas (Uttar Pradesh), and machine operators Sunny Singh (Jammu & Kashmir) and Gurpreet Singh (Punjab). The other four—Sandeep Sahu, Santosh Sahu, Anju Sahu, and Jagta Khes—are from Jharkhand.

Title: India to host 12th regional 3R and circular economy forum in Jaipur
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 05:59:30 +0000
Content: India is set to host the 12th Regional 3R and Circular Economy Forum in Asia and the Pacific at the Rajasthan International Centre in Jaipur from March 3 to 5, 2025. The event will focus on the theme “Realizing Circular Societies Towards Achieving SDGs and Carbon Neutrality in Asia-Pacific.”
Established by the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) in 2009, the Regional 3R and Circular Economy Forum serves as a platform to help governments in the Asia-Pacific region integrate 3R and circularity into their policies. The last Forum was hosted by Cambodia in 2023, while India previously hosted the eighth edition in Indore in 2018.
Announced by Union Minister Manohar Lal during a curtain-raiser event at the National Media Centre in New Delhi, the 12th forum is expected to welcome over 500 international and domestic participants. The three-day event will feature plenary sessions, country-specific discussions, theme-based roundtables, and networking opportunities. 
A dedicated ‘India Pavilion’ will highlight the country’s progress in the 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) and circular economy sectors. Exhibits from key government ministries and national missions will showcase sustainable development initiatives. Interactive sessions such as the ‘Ministers & Ambassadors Roundtable Dialogue,’ ‘Mayors’ Dialogue,’ and ‘Policy Dialogue’ will foster collaboration, alongside the signing of agreements under the CITIIS 2.0 program. The National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) will launch a compendium featuring over 100 best practices during the event.
The Forum will also host an international ‘3R trade and technology exhibition’ with participation from over 40 Indian and Japanese businesses and start-ups. This platform will promote innovative solutions supporting circularity and 3R principles. Additionally, waste-to-wealth initiatives led by NGOs and self-help groups across India will be showcased, promoting sustainability-driven entrepreneurship and community engagement.
The event will conclude with the adoption of the ‘Jaipur Declaration’ (2025-34), aimed at guiding Asia-Pacific countries in transitioning from a linear economy to a circular economy. Building on the ‘Hanoi Declaration’ (2013-23), this framework will assist countries in developing policies that promote resource efficiency. The Declaration is voluntary and non-binding.
The 2025 Forum is led by the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban, under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, in collaboration with Japan’s Ministry of the Environment, UN ESCAP, UNCRD, UNDSDG, and UNDESA, with support from the Government of Rajasthan.

Title: UP Warriorz stun defending champions RCB in WPL’s first-ever super over thriller
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 05:30:19 +0000
Content: The thrilling Women’s Premier League (WPL) clash between UP Warriorz and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Monday night silenced critics who doubt the excitement of women’s cricket. The match had everything — new records, a historic first-ever super over finish in the WPL, and an upset victory.
UP Warriorz, who were considered underdogs under new captain Deepti Sharma, triumphed over defending champions and crowd favorites, Smriti Mandhana-led RCB, in a nerve-wracking super over.
Put in to bat by UP Warriorz, RCB got off to a rocky start with their captain Smriti Mandhana dismissed for a mere 6 runs. However, Danielle Wyatt and Ellyse Perry stitched together a remarkable second-wicket partnership, taking RCB to a solid total of 180/5. Wyatt’s classy 57 and Perry’s outstanding 90 not only steadied the innings but also saw Perry surpass her former Australian captain to become the highest run-scorer in WPL history. For UP Warriorz, Tahlia McGrath, C. Henry, and skipper Deepti Sharma took one wicket each.
In response, UP Warriorz had a steady start and managed to equal RCB’s score, taking the game to the first-ever super over in WPL history. Sophie Ecclestone (33), Shweta Sehrawat (31), and Deepti Sharma (25) contributed crucial runs in the chase.
In the super over, UP Warriorz batted first and posted 8/1, with C. Henry scoring 4(3) while Grace Harris and Ecclestone chipped in with a run each. When it was RCB’s turn to bat, Mandhana and hard-hitter Richa Ghosh stepped in. However, it was Deepti Sharma’s smart decision to hand the ball to Ecclestone that proved decisive. Ecclestone bowled a brilliant over, conceding just 4 runs and effectively crushing RCB’s hopes. For her all-around performance, Ecclestone was named Player of the Match.
This marked RCB’s second defeat, though they remain tied at 4 points with Mumbai Indians, UP Warriorz, and Delhi Capitals, holding onto the top spot thanks to a superior Net Run Rate.
Next up, Delhi Capitals will face Gujarat Giants, who are currently at the bottom of the table with just 2 points, on Tuesday.

Title: DeepSeek rushes to launch new AI model as China goes all in
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:03:00 +0000
Content: DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.
The Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.
Now, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January’s R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.
Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.
The company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2’s release have not been previously reported.
DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Rivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.
“The launch of DeepSeek’s R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,” said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek’s success at creating cost-effective AI models “would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts … breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,” he said.
R2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.
Little is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as “low-key and introverted,” has not spoken to any media since July 2024.
Reuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.
They told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China’s high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.
DIFFERENT PATH
Liang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.
One of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a “flat management style.”
At DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and “996” – working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
Liang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China’s two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.
“Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,” said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. “DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.”
Liang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.
While Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model’s quality.
Both DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.
The largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China’s most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.
COMPUTING POWER
DeepSeek’s success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer’s decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.
The quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going “all in” on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.
High-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.
DeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials’ thinking.
“Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?” the person said. “How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?”
Authorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek’s fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.
Beijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.
Authorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.
China’s cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China’s securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.
As one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China’s best research talent, two former employees said.
“The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,” said Liu, the former employee.
Some Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters’ requests to provide proof.
DeepSeek has not responded to Wang’s claims. Two former employees attributed the company’s success to Liang’s focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.
The startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.
The MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.
MLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.
While competitors like France’s Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.
DeepSeek’s pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.
For now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek’s success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.
OpenAI cut prices this month, while Google’s Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1’s launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.
Adnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI’s scaled-down model.
STATE EMBRACE
Even before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing’s favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.
The subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing’s belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.
At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo 0992.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent 0700.HK – owner of China’s largest social media app WeChat – have integrated DeepSeek’s models into their products.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Li “have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,” said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “Now everyone just endorses it.”
The Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.
“If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,” said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.
Further limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.
“Our problem has never been funding,” he told Waves in July. “It’s the embargo on high-end chips.”

Title: Delhi’s 2021-22 excise policy led to Rs 2,000 crore revenue loss: CAG report
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:27:49 +0000
Content: The Delhi government’s excise policy for 2021-22 caused a revenue loss of over Rs 2,000 crore, according to a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in the Delhi Assembly on Tuesday.
The report, titled “Performance Audit on Regulation and Supply of Liquor in Delhi,” examines the functioning of the Delhi Excise Department over four years, from 2017-18 to 2020-21, with a specific focus on the 2021-22 excise policy.
The policy was later withdrawn by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government following allegations of corruption. Senior party leaders, including then-Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the case.
The CAG audit highlighted multiple discrepancies in the monitoring and regulation of liquor supply in Delhi, stating that these shortcomings contributed to significant revenue losses. The total financial impact of these discrepancies is estimated at Rs. 2,026.91 crore.
One of the key findings of the report was the failure to enforce Rule 35 of the Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, which prohibits related parties from holding multiple licenses. The audit found that common directorships existed among entities holding different categories of licenses, leading to potential conflicts of interest and monopolistic practices.
The CAG report also flagged issues in the pricing and sale of liquor, particularly regarding the Ex-Distillery Price (EDP). The Excise Department allowed manufacturers and wholesalers (L1 licensees) to declare their EDP without adequate oversight, leading to manipulation of prices and a decline in sales, which ultimately resulted in a loss of excise revenue.
The Audit observed varying EDP in various States for liquor supplied by same manufacturer unit. Further, this discretion allowed L1 licensee to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage, through increase in EDP. Analysis of pricing and sale of a few brands revealed that discretionary EDP led to decline in sales and consequent loss in excise revenue.
The audit further criticized the department’s inadequate quality control measures, citing numerous instances where test reports for liquor brands did not comply with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) requirements. In some cases, licenses were issued despite major shortcomings in the test reports.
Also, the report identified flaws in the Excise Department’s enforcement mechanisms, with raids and inspections being described as discretionary and poorly executed. The department’s data management practices were also deemed fragmented, hindering the ability to track inventory and prevent the circulation of non-duty-paid liquor.
The audit found gaps in End to End Tracking of Inventory. The Department’s inability to ensure sale of all the liquor through scanning led to the adoption of stock reconciliation post-sale (Monthly Stock Reconciliation- MSR Gap) which was outside the scope of contract agreement. This reconciliation procedure introduced various anomalies in the sales data and undermined inventory tracking, data accuracy, regulatory effectiveness and also increased the risk of Non-Duty Paid Liquor being circulated through use of duplicate barcodes.
The CAG report also highlighted issues in the design and award of licenses under the new excise policy. It noted that the policy’s objectives of preventing monopolies and cartels were undermined by design flaws, such as the creation of retail zones that limited the number of licensees and increased the risk of monopolistic practices.
The report concluded that the implementation of the excise policy resulted in a cumulative revenue loss of approximately Rs. 2,002 crore. It called for more stringent regulation and better enforcement to prevent future losses and ensure that the policy’s objectives of curbing bootlegging and spurious liquor sales are met.
This CAG report is one of 14 pending audits that scrutinise the previous Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s performance, with the excise policy being a key area of concern. The findings have raised questions about the functioning of the Delhi Excise Department and the effectiveness of the policy framework in regulating the liquor industry.

Title: Arctic doomsday seed vault gets more than 14,000 new samples
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:47:18 +0000
Content: A “doomsday” vault storing food crop seeds from around the world in man-made caves on a remote Norwegian Arctic island will receive more than 14,000 new samples on Tuesday, a custodian of the facility said.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, set deep inside a mountain to withstand disasters from nuclear war to global warming, was launched in 2008 as a backup for the world’s gene banks that store the genetic code for thousands of plant species.
Protected by permafrost, the vault has received samples from across the world, and played a leading role between 2015 and 2019 in rebuilding seed collections damaged during the war in Syria.
“The seeds deposited this week represent not just biodiversity, but also the knowledge, culture and resilience of the communities that steward them,” Executive Director Stefan Schmitz of the Crop Trust said in a statement.
The new contributions include a sample of 15 species from Sudan, consisting of several varieties of sorghum – a plant that is significant both for the country’s food security and its cultural heritage, the Crop Trust said.
The war between the Rapid Support Forces and the army which broke out in April 2023 has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 12 million, while plunging half of Sudan into hunger and several locations into famine.
“In Sudan…these seeds represent hope,” the director of Sudan’s Agricultural Plant Genetic Resources Conservation and Research Centre said in a statement.
The total of 14,022 new samples will be deposited at 1430 GMT, including seeds of Nordic tree species from Sweden and rice from Thailand, the Crop Trust said.

Title: NASA’s SPHEREx space telescope to explore what happened right after the Big Bang
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:19:01 +0000
Content: NASA is preparing to launch a megaphone-shaped observatory on a mission to better understand what happened immediately after the Big Bang that initiated the universe and to search the Milky Way for reservoirs of water, a crucial ingredient for life.
The U.S. space agency’s SPHEREx space telescope is tentatively scheduled to be launched on Friday aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
SPHEREx – short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer – is looking to answer questions about the origin of the universe while mapping the distribution of galaxies.
Closer to home – relatively speaking – SPHEREx will look within our galaxy for reservoirs of water frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in large clouds of gas and dust that give rise to stars and planets.
The observatory during its planned two-year mission will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way, as it explores the origins of the universe and the galaxies within it. It will create a three-dimensional map of the cosmos in 102 colors -individual wavelengths of light.
The mission is intended to gain insight into a phenomenon called cosmic inflation, the rapid and exponential expansion of the universe from a single point in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago. By way of comparison, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.
“We have pretty good evidence that inflation occurred, but the physics driving that event is really uncertain,” said cosmologist Olivier Dore of Caltech and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a SPHEREx project scientist.
“By mapping the distribution of galaxies over the whole sky, we can directly constrain unique properties of inflation. This is why we want to map the whole sky and why we need spectroscopy (studying objects based on color) to make the map 3D. The fact that we can connect these two things – the distribution of galaxies on large scales all the way to the physics of inflation – is very powerful and very mind-boggling and almost magical,” Dore added.
Jim Fanson, SPHEREx project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called cosmic inflation “the consensus framework for explaining aspects of the universe that we observe on large scales.”
“It postulates that the universe expanded by a trillion-trillion-fold in a small fraction of a second after the Big Bang,” Fanson said.
SPHEREx is set to take pictures in every direction around Earth, splitting the light from billions of cosmic sources such as stars and galaxies into their component wavelengths to determine their composition and distance. Researchers also will measure the collective glow of light from the space between galaxies.
In addition, SPHEREx will look for water and molecules including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide frozen on the surface of dust grains in molecular clouds, which are dense regions of gas and dust in interstellar space. Scientists believe that reservoirs of ice bound to dust grains in these clouds are where most of the universe’s water forms and dwells.
Being launched along with SPHEREx is a constellation of satellites for NASA’s PUNCH mission to observe the sun’s corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere. The aim is to better understand the solar wind, the continuous flow of charged particles from the sun.
“I think the beauty of astronomy is that every time we look at the sky in a new way or from a different angle, we discover new phenomena,” Dore said. “And the fact is SPHEREx will look at the sky in totally new ways.”
“It will be an unprecedented dataset to mine,” Dore added, “and there is no doubt in my mind we will discover new cosmic phenomena.”

Title: Less oil, more physical activity, and a balanced meal key to fighting obesity
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:18:41 +0000
Content: Reducing oil intake, increasing physical activity, and eating a balanced meal are crucial in combating the rising menace of obesity in the country, experts said on Tuesday.
This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Mann Ki Baat programme on Sunday, nominated 10 personalities to lead the campaign against obesity as part of his Fit India initiative.
Dr. Naval Vikram, Professor of Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, said that it is high time obesity is taken seriously, as its prevalence is increasing rapidly across age groups and socio-economic strata in the country.
“Obesity is no longer just a cosmetic problem. It is now a chronic, persistent disease that leads to several other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and even various cancers. It is a lifestyle disease, but it is 100 percent preventable,” he said.
He also lauded PM Modi for highlighting the problem of obesity and the importance of preventive measures.
While lifestyle plays a crucial role in preventing and managing obesity, diet is equally critical. Individuals must avoid foods high in fat, sugar, and salt—ingredients commonly found in processed foods, Vikram advised.
“Eat a well-balanced diet, preferably home-cooked meals,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister also urged people to cut their oil consumption by 10 percent.
“It is an important step in preventing as well as managing obesity,” Vikram said.
Dr. Anoop Misra, Chairman and Director of Diabetes and Endocrinology at Fortis C-DOC Hospital, New Delhi, said that oils contain twice the calories of carbohydrates and proteins.
“With rising obesity rates, it is important to limit oil intake to 15-20 ml per day,” he added.
“Oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) help lower bad cholesterol and support heart health. Mustard oil remains the best choice considering both cost and health benefits,” he said, while cautioning against excessive consumption of saturated fats, which increase the risk of liver disease, heart attacks, and strokes.
Experts said that reducing oil intake helps create a calorie deficit, a key factor in losing or maintaining body weight.
Other measures to combat obesity include opting for home-cooked meals with regionally and seasonally available ingredients, avoiding junk food, ultra-processed foods, sugary beverages, high-fat, and fried foods.
“Reducing portion sizes, eating mindfully, cutting down screen time, and increasing physical activity are also essential,” experts added.
“A well-balanced, diverse diet and at least 30 minutes of regular physical activity should be followed by all individuals to combat obesity,” said Dr. Parmeet Kaur, Chief Dietician at the Department of Dietetics, AIIMS, New Delhi.
“Stay active in your daily life. Try to incorporate movement into your routine, even if you have a desk job. Take a short break every hour or so, walk around for 10 to 15 minutes, and dedicate at least 30 to 45 minutes—or ideally an hour—for exercise,” Vikram advised.

Title: Australian captain Pat Cummins hits out at sports website for misquoting his remarks on India
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:39:49 +0000
Content: Australia Test captain Pat Cummins has strongly criticised an Australian sports website for misquoting him regarding India’s venue in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy.
Code Cricket, in a deleted post on X, alleged that Cummins had called out the ICC for giving India an unfair advantage in the Champions Trophy and termed the tournament a “farce,” saying that teams should not be allowed to pick and choose where they play their matches.
The fast bowler, who is not participating in the tournament due to an ankle injury, took to social media on Tuesday to slam the Australian digital sports platform for fabricating his words. “I have definitely never said this @codecricketau,” Cummins said in a post on X.
The controversy began after Code Cricket published a post on Tuesday claiming that Cummins had criticised the ICC for allowing India to play all their matches at a single venue while other teams had to travel between Pakistan and Dubai. The publication alleged that Cummins was unhappy with India being allowed to “pick and choose” where they played.
However, in an actual interview with Yahoo Australia, Cummins said, “I think it’s good in that the tournament can go on, but obviously, it does give them (India) a huge advantage playing on the same ground. They already look very strong, and they’ve got that obvious benefit of playing all their games there.”
India’s participation in the Champions Trophy has been a point of contention, with the team refusing to travel to Pakistan due to political tensions. As a result, all of India’s matches, including a potential final, are being played at the Dubai International Stadium, while other teams must travel between Pakistan and Dubai for their fixtures.

Title: Sensex, Nifty end flat amid mixed market sentiment
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:39:32 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed flat on Tuesday as investors remained cautious due to mixed market sentiment.
The Sensex gained 147.71 points, or 0.20 percent, to close at 74,602.12. During the session, the index moved between 74,785.08 and 74,400.37. Meanwhile, the Nifty closed marginally lower, slipping 5.80 points, or 0.03 percent, to settle at 22,547.55. It touched an intra-day high of 22,625.30 and a low of 22,516.45.
Market performance was mixed, with 31 of the 50 Nifty stocks ending lower. According to Rupak De from LKP Securities, the index remained mostly muted except for a small correction toward the close. A rise toward resistance levels could attract selling pressure, he said.
Hindalco, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Trent, Hero MotoCorp, and Sun Pharma were among the top losers, falling by up to 3.10 percent. On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, Nestle India, and Titan gained up to 2.32 percent.
Broader market indices also faced pressure. The Nifty Midcap100 index declined by 0.62 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index slipped by 0.44 percent.
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Auto, FMCG, Select Financial Services, Media, and Consumer Durables rose by up to 0.84 percent. Other sectors saw declines, reflecting cautious market sentiment.
Technically, Nifty formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern on the daily chart, indicating buying interest around the 23,500 level, according to Hrishikesh Yedve from Asit C. Mehta Investment Limited. As long as the index holds above this level, a pullback rally toward 22,700-22,800 could be possible. However, this zone will act as a resistance level, while a drop below 22,500 could trigger fresh selling pressure. Traders are advised to monitor these levels for potential opportunities.
India VIX, the volatility index, dropped by 5.03 percent to 13.72, indicating a decline in market volatility.
The domestic benchmark indices will remain closed on Wednesday, February 26, due to the Maha Shivaratri holiday.
In the currency market, the Indian rupee weakened by 50 paise, closing at 87.20 per dollar compared to 86.70 in the previous session.

Title: Congress leader Sajjan Kumar gets life imprisonment in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:38:13 +0000
Content: A Delhi court on Tuesday sentenced former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment for his involvement in the killing of two men during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in the Saraswati Vihar area.
Kumar was convicted on February 12 by Special Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court for the murder of Jaswant Singh and his son, Tarundeep Singh.
The court had reserved its verdict on January 31 after hearing additional submissions from Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat.
Advocate Anil Sharma, representing Kumar, argued that his client’s name had not surfaced initially and there was a 16-year delay in identifying him as an accused. Additionally, a separate case in which Kumar was convicted by the Delhi High Court is currently pending appeal before the Supreme Court.
Senior advocate H.S. Phoolka, representing the victims, argued that police investigations into the Sikh riot cases were manipulated to protect the accused. Phoolka said that the 1984 riots were extraordinary circumstances requiring a broader context in legal proceedings. He also referenced the Delhi High Court’s earlier judgement, which labeled the riots a “crime against humanity” and noted that over 2,700 Sikhs were killed in Delhi alone.
Initially, the case was registered at Punjabi Bagh police station but was later handed over to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) established on the recommendation of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee, which had called for reopening 114 cases, including this one.

Title: EPFO records 16.05 lakh net member additions in December 2024
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:45:24 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) registered a net addition of 16.05 lakh members in December 2024, reflecting a steady rise in formal employment and growing awareness of employee benefits, according to the latest provisional payroll data released by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.
The data highlights a 9.69 per cent increase in net payroll additions compared to November 2024. Year-on-year, the net payroll additions have grown by 2.74 per cent from December 2023, underscoring a positive trend in employment generation.
EPFO enrolled 8.47 lakh new subscribers in December 2024, marking a 0.73 per cent increase from the same month in the previous year. The surge in new subscribers is attributed to expanding job opportunities and the organisation’s outreach initiatives.
A key highlight of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, which accounted for 4.85 lakh new subscribers, constituting 57.29 per cent of the total new additions. This group’s numbers increased by 0.91 per cent from November 2024 and by 0.92 per cent from December 2023. The net payroll addition for this age group reached 6.85 lakh, reflecting a 16.91 per cent rise from the previous month, reaffirming the trend that most individuals joining the organised workforce are first-time job seekers.
The payroll data also indicates that 15.12 lakh members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO, a 5.10 per cent rise compared to November 2024 and a 25.76 per cent jump from December 2023. These members switched jobs but opted to transfer their provident fund balances instead of withdrawing them, ensuring continued social security coverage.
In terms of gender distribution, EPFO added 2.22 lakh new female subscribers in December 2024, marking a 6.34 per cent year-on-year increase. The net female payroll addition for the month stood at 3.03 lakh, a 4.77 per cent rise compared to December 2023, indicating a more inclusive workforce.
A state-wise analysis shows that the top five states and Union Territories—Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, and Delhi—contributed 59.84 per cent of the total net payroll additions, collectively adding 9.60 lakh members. Maharashtra led with 21.71 per cent of net payroll additions. Other major contributors included Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana, each accounting for over 5 per cent of the total.
Industry-wise, expert services, building, and construction were the top sectors witnessing payroll growth. Expert services, which include manpower suppliers, security services, and contractors, accounted for 41.23 per cent of the total net additions.

Title: Indian markets to stabilise by Q4 2025 end, FPI flows expected to turn positive: report
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:30:29 +0000
Content: The Indian stock markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term but are expected to stabilise towards the end of Q4 of the calendar year 2025, as domestic consumption is on the cusp of revival and normal monsoons could provide a significant boost, a report said on Tuesday.
The impact of various government initiatives and favourable monsoons is expected to start reflecting in improved consumer demand by Q2 2026, according to the ‘India Strategy Report’ by PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher.
“The biggest concern of the market—FPI flows—may turn positive on the back of higher capex, tax cuts, and consumer demand revival. Lastly, the Nifty’s 12-month target is seen at 25,689,” the report mentioned.
Food inflation has eased, declining from 10.9 per cent in October 2024 to 6 per cent currently. A 25 bps cut in the repo rate by the RBI, along with open market operations (OMO), is expected to ease liquidity over the next 3-6 months.
Other positive factors include a Rs 1 lakh crore income tax cut for middle-income and lower-income consumers, an increase in religious tourism, and a 17 per cent higher government capex allocation (including PSU spending and allocations to states).
In its model portfolio, PL Capital is turning overweight on consumers due to an expected uptick in demand following tax cuts, declining food inflation, and a repo rate cut. It has also increased its weightage in banks and healthcare.
Although uncertainty regarding global markets remains, PL Capital believes India’s growth outlook for FY26 appears far better than in FY25.
“As the impact of the budget starts reflecting in higher capex on a low base, alongside tax cuts and monsoons reviving consumer demand, we should see FPI flows turning positive,” the report stated.
India is also unlikely to face any significant negative effects from US policies. Soft crude oil prices, geopolitical stability (if the Russia-Ukraine war ends), and increased technology transfers to India are expected to neutralise the costs of potential US tariffs.
“India’s ability to navigate tariff negotiations, leverage its geopolitical positioning, and realign supply chains ensures that this phase is a temporary recalibration, not a retreat,” the report added.

Title: Ailing Pope Francis holds Vatican work meeting in hospital
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:48:36 +0000
Content: Pope Francis has met senior colleagues in hospital to discuss work issues, the Vatican said on Tuesday, and an official said he was eating normally and moving around, even though he remains in critical condition with double pneumonia.
The 88-year-old pope was spending his 12th day at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, the longest hospital stay of his nearly 12-year-old papacy.
“The pope rested well all night,” the Vatican said in a one-sentence statement that did not provide further details.
A Vatican official, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to discuss the pope’s condition, said Francis was eating normally, moving about his hospital room, and continuing his treatment.
The Vatican said Francis had met his second-in-line, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Parolin’s deputy on Monday.
It said they had discussed several pending cases for sainthood. The Vatican also announced new appointments that would have needed the pope’s approval.
Francis has been working occasionally from the hospital as Vatican business continues apace during his illness.
The pope’s only other known VIP visitor was Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who visited him on February 19.
On Monday, the Vatican said the pontiff’s condition remained critical but had shown a “slight improvement”, adding that a “mild kidney insufficiency”, first reported at the weekend, was not a cause for concern.
POPE FRANCIS PRONE TO RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
Double pneumonia is a serious infection of both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has said the pope’s infection is “complex”, and caused by two or more microorganisms.
Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered several bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.
Thousands of people gathered in St. Peter’s Square on Monday evening to pray for his recovery.
His friend, the Honduran cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, told Italy’s la Repubblica newspaper: “I think … it’s not time for him to go to heaven yet.”
The pope signalled in early February that he had a bad cold, which meant he could not read out his speeches. Despite this, he continued to have meetings every day and even take part in open-air Masses, despite the chill.
Some well-wishers have said he should have taken better care of himself, but Maradiaga defended Francis’ work ethic.
“He is aware that he has a mission he must carry out, and nothing stops him. The pope explained that he did not accept his election (as pontiff) in order to rest,” he said.
The Vatican is expected to send another medical bulletin at around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT).

Title: Summit will go long way in highlighting growth opportunities in Assam: PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:21:44 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday highlighted Assam’s growing investment potential, stating that the Advantage Assam 2.0 Summit will play a crucial role in showcasing the state’s development and economic opportunities.
“Attended the Advantage Assam Summit. Over the last decade, Assam has witnessed significant development, making it an attractive investment destination. This summit will go a long way in highlighting growth opportunities across various sectors,” PM Modi posted on X.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi inaugurated the two-day summit in Guwahati, alongside Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, several Union and state ministers, foreign envoys, and top industry leaders. The event, held at Khanapara Veterinary College field, aims to attract investments and accelerate economic growth in Assam.
Describing Advantage Assam 2.0 as a “grand campaign” to connect global investors with Assam’s potential, PM Modi underscored the region’s historical role in India’s prosperity. “As India moves towards development, the Northeast is ready to showcase its strength,” he added.
Recalling the launch of Advantage Assam in 2018, the Prime Minister said that at the time, Assam’s economy stood at ₹2.75 lakh crore, emphasizing its expansion since then. He also highlighted the state’s tea industry as a key contributor to Assam’s economic potential.
The Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment and Infrastructure Summit 2025 serves as a major platform for businesses and investors to explore opportunities in Assam’s rapidly expanding industrial and infrastructure sectors.

Title: JPC members show unity on ‘One Nation, One Election’ proposal, says Chairman PP Chaudhary
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:40:16 +0000
Content: The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on ‘One Nation, One Election’ held a crucial meeting on Tuesday, where members displayed a “positive attitude” and worked as a team, according to Committee Chairman PP Chaudhary.
Speaking after the meeting at Parliament House Annexe, Chaudhary said the session was productive, with members engaging constructively. “It was a good meeting. All members had a positive attitude. Justice Awasthi gave a presentation, followed by former Chief Justice of India UU Lalit. Their presentations were well-received, and members’ queries were addressed,” he said.
Expressing appreciation for the committee’s cooperative approach, Chaudhary added, “I thank all members for their positive attitude and for asking questions in the national interest. Doubts were cleared… We are working as a team.”
The Constitution Amendment Bill on ‘One Nation, One Election’, under review by the JPC, seeks to synchronise the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, streamlining the electoral process. The government argues that aligning election cycles will reduce logistical challenges, cut costs, and prevent governance disruptions caused by frequent polls.
However, several opposition parties, including the Congress, Trinamool Congress, and DMK, have strongly opposed the proposal, citing concerns over federalism and democratic representation.
The initiative gained momentum after the Union Cabinet accepted the recommendations of the High-Level Committee Report on Simultaneous Elections on September 18, 2024. The JPC held its first meeting on January 8 to examine the proposed legislation.

Title: After Trump comments, Kremlin reaffirms opposition to European peacekeepers in Ukraine
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:32:55 +0000
Content: The Kremlin, asked about an assertion by U.S. President Donald Trump that Russia was open to European peacekeepers being deployed in Ukraine, referred reporters to an earlier statement that such a move would be unacceptable to Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly said it opposes having NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying last week that Moscow would view that as a “direct threat” to Russia’s sovereignty, even if the troops operated there under a different flag.
Asked about Trump’s comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refrained from publicly contradicting the U.S. president, but effectively reaffirmed Russia’s opposition to the idea.
“There is a position on this matter that was expressed by the Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov. I have nothing to add to this and nothing to comment on. I leave this without comment,” said Peskov.
Trump said on Monday that both he and Putin accepted the idea of European peacekeepers in Ukraine if a settlement was reached to end the war.
“Yeah, he will accept that,” Trump said. “I specifically asked him that question. He has no problem with it.”
Brian Hughes, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, did not respond directly to the Kremlin’s latest comment, saying the Trump administration would continue to work with Moscow and Kyiv to end the war.
“President Trump’s commitment to achieving an end to this brutal, bloody war and then establishing the framework for a lasting peace will not be negotiated through the media,” Hughes said.
“The Trump administration knows that sustaining peace requires Europe to do more, and we have heard leaders like (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron and British Prime Minister (Keir) Starmer – as well as others – offer to do just that. We continue to work with Russia and Ukraine for peace because you can’t end a war without talking to both sides.”

Title: Madhya Pradesh secures record Rs 30 lakh crore investments in two days: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:21:24 +0000
Content: Touting the grand achievement of Rs 30 lakh crore in investment commitments secured during the two-day Global Investors Summit (GIS-2025) held in Bhopal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah proclaimed that the Indian economy, which has already ascended from the 10th to the 5th position globally, will soon become the third largest in the world by 2027.
Madhya Pradesh, he asserted, will play a significant role in this ascent. He made this pronouncement while addressing the valedictory session of the summit on Tuesday.
Raving about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to elevate the nation to a fully developed state, HM Shah reiterated that India has already made substantial progress on multiple fronts. He emphasized that the Investors Summit in Madhya Pradesh has set a brisk pace for the nation’s development, with the state ready to lead this transformative journey.
The Global Investors Summit 2025, held in Madhya Pradesh, witnessed participation from over 200 companies and representatives from 50 countries, securing investment commitments exceeding Rs 30 lakh crore.
He said that Madhya Pradesh is the pioneer state to host sector-specific summits, an innovative approach anticipated to accelerate further development.
The automation and skill development initiatives, coupled with the recent policies launched by the state government, are set to contribute to the country’s growth. Madhya Pradesh’s demand-driven economy is thriving, making it an ideal investment destination.
During the two-day event, the state unveiled its industrial, sectoral, and global potential to investors, a move lauded by the Minister, who expected the prolonged discussions in the sessions to bear substantial outcomes in the forthcoming days.
Madhya Pradesh epitomizes a harmonious blend of development and heritage, striving unceasingly toward progress.
The Home Minister said this aligns with PM Modi’s efforts to transform India into a developed nation and elevate it to the third-largest economy in the world by 2027.
The state of Madhya Pradesh is poised to play a pivotal role in this mission, HM Shah said, adding that the concept of “Team India,” which includes both the central and state governments, has been significantly bolstered through this summit.
Highlighting the achievements of the past decade under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union Home Minister further asserted that India’s forex reserves and per capita income have doubled over the past ten years, establishing a robust foundation for future growth.
For instance, 54 crore Indians now have access to banking services, a privilege that remained out of reach for the past 75 years.
India now boasts 157 airports, 8 lakh km of rural roads, and a railway network where cargo handling has doubled.
The nation has pioneered advancements in sectors such as artificial intelligence and hydrogen fuel, HM Shah said. He added that the Investors Summit in Madhya Pradesh has set a brisk pace for the nation’s progress, with the state ready to lead this transformative journey.
The Home Minister pointed out that Madhya Pradesh, once plagued by deficits in water, roads, and power and labeled as “Bimaru,” has undergone a remarkable transformation.
Today, it has a robust energy capacity of 31 GW, with 30 percent derived from clean energy sources. Prestigious educational institutions like IIM and IIET empower the state’s youth to realize their potential.
Madhya Pradesh is rich in minerals and has become the cotton capital of India, producing 25 percent of the country’s organic cotton. It is also an ideal destination for food processing industries, he said.
The state has declared 2025 as the “Year of Industry and Employment” and is the first to pass the “Jan Vishwas Vidheyak,” reinforcing its commitment to ease of doing business. Investors are set to explore opportunities across various sectors in the near future, the Union Minister said.
Addressing the assembly of investors on the occasion, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav assured that his government has set a deadline to provide all possible support within a stipulated timeframe to transform all proposals from the drawing board to reality.

Title: Over 1.77 lakh women-owned firms gain GeM advantage
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:49:20 +0000
Content: Women entrepreneurs comprise 8 percent of the total seller base on the Government e-marketplace (GeM) with a cumulative 1,77,786 Udyam-verified women micro, and small enterprises (MSEs) registered on the portal, having fulfilled a cumulative order value of Rs. 46,615 crore, according to an official statement issued on Tuesday.
“At the time of launch of SWAYATT, only about 6,300 women-led enterprises and almost 3400 startups were onboarded on GeM. Since then, the platform has grown manifold,” said L. Satya Srivinas, the CEO of GeM.
“Addressing the challenges of ‘access to market’, ‘access to finance’ and ‘access to value-addition’ through proper e-market linkages in public procurement, the GeM has also enabled startups to fulfil orders worth Rs. 35,950 crore,” he added.
GeM has completed six years of its Startups, Women, and Youth Advantage through the eTransactions (SWAYATT) initiative.
Launched in February 2019, SWAYATT was conceptualised with a clear objective of invigorating the participation of women-led enterprises and youth in public procurement.
Rooted in GeM’s foundational pillar of social inclusion, SWAYATT is the portal’s commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business and establishing direct market linkages to annual public procurement for startups, women entrepreneurs, MSEs, Self Help Groups (SHGs) and youth, especially those from backward sections of the society.
Since its inception, the initiative has been focused on facilitating the training and onboarding of last-mile sellers, developing women’s entrepreneurship, and encouraging participation and small-scale businesses in government procurement.
GeM has now also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) Ladies Organisation (FICCI-FLO) – an all-India forum representing over 9,500 women entrepreneurs.
Using this partnership, GeM intends to provide direct access for women entrepreneurs with government buyers, sans intermediaries, thereby ensuring better product prices, spurring hyper-local job creation and igniting inclusive growth.
By extending adequate means of training, onboarding and linkages, this collaboration is set to empower local businesses, create inclusive economic growth, enhance competition and boost value addition in public spending.
Joyashree Das Verma, president, FICCI – FLO, said digital platforms like GeM have democratised access to opportunities for women entrepreneurs. Reiterating the importance of this collaboration towards value chain development and enhanced opportunities for women-led MSEs through advocacy, outreach and mobilisation, she stressed on training as an imperative in expanding the reach of the GeM portal among affiliated members of the association.
According to the official statement, conceptualised as a foundational initiative, SWAYATT today comprises ‘Startup Runway’ and ‘Womaniya’ storefronts for dedicated listings, ensuring wider visibility of startups, women entrepreneurs, and youth among lakhs of pan-India government buyers. By dismantling entry barriers, GeM is empowering more than 29,000 startups with business opportunities on the GeM platform.
With an ambitious goal of onboarding 1 lakh Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade registered startups onto the portal, GeM is headed to become a vibrant startup ecosystem in public procurement.
Through meaningful collaborations and capacity-building efforts with last-mile women micro and small enterprises (MSEs), FPOs, SHGs, Startups, and Cooperatives, GeM envisions doubling the number of women entrepreneurs on the portal and increasing their share percentage in overall procurement of the country, the statement added.

Title: DeepSeek rushes to launch new AI model as China goes all in
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:03:00 +0000
Content: DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.
The Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.
Now, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January’s R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.
Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.
The company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2’s release have not been previously reported.
DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Rivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.
“The launch of DeepSeek’s R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,” said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek’s success at creating cost-effective AI models “would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts … breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,” he said.
R2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.
Little is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as “low-key and introverted,” has not spoken to any media since July 2024.
Reuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.
They told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China’s high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.
DIFFERENT PATH
Liang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.
One of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a “flat management style.”
At DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and “996” – working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
Liang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China’s two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.
“Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,” said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. “DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.”
Liang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.
While Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model’s quality.
Both DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.
The largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China’s most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.
COMPUTING POWER
DeepSeek’s success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer’s decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.
The quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going “all in” on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.
High-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.
DeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials’ thinking.
“Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?” the person said. “How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?”
Authorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek’s fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.
Beijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.
Authorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.
China’s cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China’s securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.
As one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China’s best research talent, two former employees said.
“The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,” said Liu, the former employee.
Some Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters’ requests to provide proof.
DeepSeek has not responded to Wang’s claims. Two former employees attributed the company’s success to Liang’s focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.
The startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.
The MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.
MLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.
While competitors like France’s Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.
DeepSeek’s pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.
For now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek’s success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.
OpenAI cut prices this month, while Google’s Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1’s launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.
Adnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI’s scaled-down model.
STATE EMBRACE
Even before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing’s favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.
The subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing’s belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.
At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo 0992.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent 0700.HK – owner of China’s largest social media app WeChat – have integrated DeepSeek’s models into their products.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Li “have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,” said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “Now everyone just endorses it.”
The Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.
“If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,” said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.
Further limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.
“Our problem has never been funding,” he told Waves in July. “It’s the embargo on high-end chips.”

Title: Delhi’s 2021-22 excise policy led to Rs 2,000 crore revenue loss: CAG report
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:27:49 +0000
Content: The Delhi government’s excise policy for 2021-22 caused a revenue loss of over Rs 2,000 crore, according to a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in the Delhi Assembly on Tuesday.
The report, titled “Performance Audit on Regulation and Supply of Liquor in Delhi,” examines the functioning of the Delhi Excise Department over four years, from 2017-18 to 2020-21, with a specific focus on the 2021-22 excise policy.
The policy was later withdrawn by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government following allegations of corruption. Senior party leaders, including then-Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the case.
The CAG audit highlighted multiple discrepancies in the monitoring and regulation of liquor supply in Delhi, stating that these shortcomings contributed to significant revenue losses. The total financial impact of these discrepancies is estimated at Rs. 2,026.91 crore.
One of the key findings of the report was the failure to enforce Rule 35 of the Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, which prohibits related parties from holding multiple licenses. The audit found that common directorships existed among entities holding different categories of licenses, leading to potential conflicts of interest and monopolistic practices.
The CAG report also flagged issues in the pricing and sale of liquor, particularly regarding the Ex-Distillery Price (EDP). The Excise Department allowed manufacturers and wholesalers (L1 licensees) to declare their EDP without adequate oversight, leading to manipulation of prices and a decline in sales, which ultimately resulted in a loss of excise revenue.
The Audit observed varying EDP in various States for liquor supplied by same manufacturer unit. Further, this discretion allowed L1 licensee to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage, through increase in EDP. Analysis of pricing and sale of a few brands revealed that discretionary EDP led to decline in sales and consequent loss in excise revenue.
The audit further criticized the department’s inadequate quality control measures, citing numerous instances where test reports for liquor brands did not comply with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) requirements. In some cases, licenses were issued despite major shortcomings in the test reports.
Also, the report identified flaws in the Excise Department’s enforcement mechanisms, with raids and inspections being described as discretionary and poorly executed. The department’s data management practices were also deemed fragmented, hindering the ability to track inventory and prevent the circulation of non-duty-paid liquor.
The audit found gaps in End to End Tracking of Inventory. The Department’s inability to ensure sale of all the liquor through scanning led to the adoption of stock reconciliation post-sale (Monthly Stock Reconciliation- MSR Gap) which was outside the scope of contract agreement. This reconciliation procedure introduced various anomalies in the sales data and undermined inventory tracking, data accuracy, regulatory effectiveness and also increased the risk of Non-Duty Paid Liquor being circulated through use of duplicate barcodes.
The CAG report also highlighted issues in the design and award of licenses under the new excise policy. It noted that the policy’s objectives of preventing monopolies and cartels were undermined by design flaws, such as the creation of retail zones that limited the number of licensees and increased the risk of monopolistic practices.
The report concluded that the implementation of the excise policy resulted in a cumulative revenue loss of approximately Rs. 2,002 crore. It called for more stringent regulation and better enforcement to prevent future losses and ensure that the policy’s objectives of curbing bootlegging and spurious liquor sales are met.
This CAG report is one of 14 pending audits that scrutinise the previous Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s performance, with the excise policy being a key area of concern. The findings have raised questions about the functioning of the Delhi Excise Department and the effectiveness of the policy framework in regulating the liquor industry.

Title: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid share eight goals in Copa del Rey thriller
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 04:56:03 +0000
Content: FC Barcelona and Atletico Madrid played out a thrilling 4-4 draw in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal at Montjuïc, featuring a dramatic back-and-forth scoring spree that kept fans on the edge of their seats. 
Atletico took the lead just 50 seconds into the match when Antoine Griezmann’s corner was flicked on for Julián Álvarez, who calmly slotted the ball home at the far post. Álvarez then turned provider in the eighth minute, slipping the ball to Griezmann, who capitalized on Barcelona’s high defensive line to turn inside and score with his right foot. 
The only fans making noise at Montjuïc were wearing Atletico shirts, but Barca should have been back in the game soon after, only for Ferran Torres to fail to beat Juan Musso in Atletico’s goal, reports Xinhua. 
However, Barcelona soon found their rhythm as Pedri gave them a lifeline in the 19th minute, neatly finishing after brilliant work from Lamine Yamal and Jules Koundé. Just a minute later, Pau Cubarsí outjumped Pablo Barrios to nod in from a corner and level the match. 
Ferran missed another opportunity, but Íñigo Martínez then put Barcelona ahead by sneaking in unmarked to finish off another inswinging corner that Atletico failed to clear. 
Atletico responded in the second half, looking to regain momentum, but in the 74th minute, Robert Lewandowski tapped in after a superb setup from Yamal, seemingly putting Barca in control. 
Ángel Correa gave Atletico more spark in attack, and with seven minutes left, he pulled the ball back for Marcos Llorente, who ran onto it and fired a powerful shot that took a slight deflection. 
With two minutes remaining, the game was briefly halted as two children invaded the pitch. Soon afterward, Alexander Sørloth made it 4-4 following excellent work from Samuel Lino. Atletico’s substitutions proved effective, though Barcelona will be frustrated at losing concentration so late in the game.

Title: Trump announces ‘Gold Card’ programme for wealthy foreigners, offering US residency for USD 5 million
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 04:46:24 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States will introduce a “Gold Card” programme for wealthy foreigners, granting them the right to live and work in the country, with a pathway to citizenship, in exchange for a USD 5 million fee, CNN reported.
The CNN report, citing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, stated that the Gold Card will replace the existing EB-5 immigrant investor visa program.
“They’ll have to go through vetting, of course,” the CNN report quoted Lutnick as saying. “To make sure they’re wonderful, world-class global citizens,” he added.
Trump made the announcement during a media availability in the Oval Office, where he also signed an executive action investigating the copper industry and answered questions on various topics.
He said that sales of the Gold Cards would begin in about two weeks and suggested that millions could be sold. “From a legal standpoint, it’s totally legal to do,” he said.
When asked if Russian oligarchs would be eligible to buy the cards, Trump responded, “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs who are very nice people.”
During the event, Trump also admired a map of the newly renamed ‘Gulf of America’ and said, “I’m just admiring it as I look at it. I’m getting teary-eyed — but I don’t want you to say, ‘Trump broke down and started crying.’”
Continuing his remarks, Trump criticized the Associated Press, calling it “radical left.”
“I think they’re radical left. I think they’re third-rate reporters… They don’t treat us fairly,” he said.
Earlier, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration’s stance on the Associated Press, asserting that questioning the US President is a privilege, not a legal right.
During the briefing, Trump was seen distributing pamphlets that read, “Trump was right about everything.”
“Look. You see that? Trump was right about everything… Would anybody like one?” he said.

Title: Maha Kumbh: Sea of Devotees Arrive at Triveni Sangam for Final ‘Snan’ on Maha Shivaratri
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 04:04:17 +0000
Content: Devotees from across the country gathered in large numbers at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj in the early hours of Wednesday for the final ‘Snan’ of the Maha Kumbh, coinciding with the auspicious occasion of Maha Shivaratri.  
Drone visuals captured a massive crowd at the Triveni Sangam, where devotees took a holy dip on the last day of Maha Kumbh.  
One devotee shared her excitement with ANI, saying, “I cannot express my emotions in words… We came here with great enthusiasm because it is the last day of the Maha Kumbh. We feel blessed to receive the grace of Maa Ganga.”  
The first Amrit Snan of Paush Purnima took place on January 13, followed by Snans on Makar Sankranti (January 14), Mauni Amavasya (January 29), Basant Panchami (February 3), Maghi Purnima (February 12), and the final Snan on February 26, coinciding with Maha Shivaratri.  
Several Akhadas participated in the Maha Kumbh, including Niranjani Akhada, Ahwan Akhada, and Juna Akhada, the largest Akhada in the Sanyasi tradition. Akharas play a vital role in the Shahi Snan and are religious orders of monks belonging to various sects such as Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Udasi. Each Akhada is led by a head known as the Mahamandaleshwar.  
Security and Crowd Management  
In anticipation of the massive influx of devotees, the Prayagraj District Administration deployed additional security forces and coordinated efforts with railway and airport authorities for better crowd management.  
Prayagraj District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Mandar emphasized the importance of managing traffic and parking efficiently to ensure a hassle-free experience for devotees.  
“Tomorrow is the last ‘Snan’ on Maha Shivaratri. We are fully prepared. Extra forces have been deployed for major Snan days. We have coordinated with railway and airport authorities and issued clear instructions for parking management to keep traffic under control. Senior officials are stationed at all key points to oversee operations. A traffic advisory was issued this morning,” he said on Tuesday.  
Maha Shivaratri, also known as the great night of Shiva, is considered highly auspicious for spiritual growth and signifies victory over darkness and ignorance. It marks the divine marriage of Lord Shiva, the lord of destruction, with Goddess Parvati, the goddess of fertility, love, and beauty, also known as Shakti.  
According to Hindu mythology, on the night of their wedding, Lord Shiva was escorted to Goddess Parvati’s house by a diverse group of Hindu gods, goddesses, animals, and demons. The union of Shiva and Shakti symbolizes love, power, and togetherness. Maha Shivaratri is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm across India.  
On Monday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath posted on X, “More than 1.30 crore devotees today and over 63.36 crore devotees so far have taken a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam at Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, a living symbol of India’s faith and Sanatan’s harmony. The festival of humanity. Hearty congratulations to all revered saints and devotees who received the holy benefit of the sacred bath today in this ‘Mahayagna’ of unity! Hail Mother Ganga!”  
Sanitation and Cleanliness Initiatives  
In response to the large number of devotees on the last day of Maha Kumbh, large-scale sanitation and cleanliness efforts have been implemented. A new Guinness World Record was set, with 15,000 sanitation workers participating in a cleanliness drive across multiple venues. However, the final results of this record attempt are expected to be announced on February 27.  
Transportation Arrangements  
The Indian Railways has made special arrangements for Maha Shivaratri, planning to run more than 350 additional trains from Prayagraj to facilitate the return of pilgrims following the final Amrit Snan of Maha Kumbh 2025 on February 26, according to an official statement.  
A large number of devotees from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and West Bengal have gathered at the Sangam, leading to an unprecedented demand for transportation.  
In light of the anticipated rush, North Central Railway, North Eastern Railway, and Northern Railway have been placed on high alert. Previously, on Mauni Amavasya, over 360 special trains were deployed to transport more than 20 lakh passengers safely. A similar plan has been implemented for Maha Shivaratri, with extra rakes positioned near Prayagraj for emergency use.  
Railway officials have implemented an internal movement plan at Prayagraj Junction, ensuring that pilgrims are directed to specific shelters based on their destinations before being guided to their respective trains. In cases of overcrowding, emergency plans were activated, directing passengers to holding areas such as Khusro Bagh before they were escorted safely to boarding platforms.  
Meanwhile, in Jharkhand’s Deoghar district, devotees arrived in huge numbers at Shri Baba Baidyanath Jyotirlinga Mandir on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. Large crowds also gathered at Mahipalpur’s Shiv Murti Temple to offer prayers.

EPFO enrolled 8.47 lakh new subscribers in December 2024, marking a 0.73 per cent increase from the same month in the previous year. The surge in new subscribers is attributed to expanding job opportunities and the organisation’s outreach initiatives.
A key highlight of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, which accounted for 4.85 lakh new subscribers, constituting 57.29 per cent of the total new additions. This group’s numbers increased by 0.91 per cent from November 2024 and by 0.92 per cent from December 2023. The net payroll addition for this age group reached 6.85 lakh, reflecting a 16.91 per cent rise from the previous month, reaffirming the trend that most individuals joining the organised workforce are first-time job seekers.
The payroll data also indicates that 15.12 lakh members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO, a 5.10 per cent rise compared to November 2024 and a 25.76 per cent jump from December 2023. These members switched jobs but opted to transfer their provident fund balances instead of withdrawing them, ensuring continued social security coverage.
In terms of gender distribution, EPFO added 2.22 lakh new female subscribers in December 2024, marking a 6.34 per cent year-on-year increase. The net female payroll addition for the month stood at 3.03 lakh, a 4.77 per cent rise compared to December 2023, indicating a more inclusive workforce.
A state-wise analysis shows that the top five states and Union Territories—Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, and Delhi—contributed 59.84 per cent of the total net payroll additions, collectively adding 9.60 lakh members. Maharashtra led with 21.71 per cent of net payroll additions. Other major contributors included Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana, each accounting for over 5 per cent of the total.
Industry-wise, expert services, building, and construction were the top sectors witnessing payroll growth. Expert services, which include manpower suppliers, security services, and contractors, accounted for 41.23 per cent of the total net additions.

Title: Indian markets to stabilise by Q4 2025 end, FPI flows expected to turn positive: report
Publication Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:30:29 +0000
Content: The Indian stock markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term but are expected to stabilise towards the end of Q4 of the calendar year 2025, as domestic consumption is on the cusp of revival and normal monsoons could provide a significant boost, a report said on Tuesday.
The impact of various government initiatives and favourable monsoons is expected to start reflecting in improved consumer demand by Q2 2026, according to the ‘India Strategy Report’ by PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher.
“The biggest concern of the market—FPI flows—may turn positive on the back of higher capex, tax cuts, and consumer demand revival. Lastly, the Nifty’s 12-month target is seen at 25,689,” the report mentioned.
Food inflation has eased, declining from 10.9 per cent in October 2024 to 6 per cent currently. A 25 bps cut in the repo rate by the RBI, along with open market operations (OMO), is expected to ease liquidity over the next 3-6 months.
Other positive factors include a Rs 1 lakh crore income tax cut for middle-income and lower-income consumers, an increase in religious tourism, and a 17 per cent higher government capex allocation (including PSU spending and allocations to states).
In its model portfolio, PL Capital is turning overweight on consumers due to an expected uptick in demand following tax cuts, declining food inflation, and a repo rate cut. It has also increased its weightage in banks and healthcare.
Although uncertainty regarding global markets remains, PL Capital believes India’s growth outlook for FY26 appears far better than in FY25.
“As the impact of the budget starts reflecting in higher capex on a low base, alongside tax cuts and monsoons reviving consumer demand, we should see FPI flows turning positive,” the report stated.
India is also unlikely to face any significant negative effects from US policies. Soft crude oil prices, geopolitical stability (if the Russia-Ukraine war ends), and increased technology transfers to India are expected to neutralise the costs of potential US tariffs.
“India’s ability to navigate tariff negotiations, leverage its geopolitical positioning, and realign supply chains ensures that this phase is a temporary recalibration, not a retreat,” the report added.

Title: Thailand bus overturns in ditch killing at least 18 passengers
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 12:14:03 +0000
Content: At least 18 people were killed and 23 injured in eastern Thailand on Wednesday after the brakes failed on a tour bus and it rolled upside down into a ditch, police said.
“It was a downhill road and the brakes failed, and the driver lost control of the vehicle before it overturned,” said Colonel Sophon Phramaneehe, adding that those who died were adults on a study trip.
There were 49 people on the bus, all Thai, including the driver, the police official told Reuters.
Social media posts showed rescue and medical workers at the scene in Prachinburi province, 155 km (96 miles) east of the capital Bangkok, helping victims near the bus with its undercarriage exposed.
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims’ families and said an investigation was taking place.
“If it is found that there is a violation of the use of vehicles that do not meet the standards or are involved in reckless use of vehicles, legal action will be taken,” she said in a post on X.
“Inspection of vehicles must be safe and pass the specified standards before they are put into use to prevent accidents and reduce losses like this again,” she said.
Road accidents and fatalities are common in Thailand due to weak enforcement of vehicle safety standards and poorly maintained roads. The Southeast Asian nation ranked ninth out of 175 World Health Organization member countries for road traffic deaths, according to its 2023 report.
Last year, a school bus caught fire due to a gas cylinder leak, killing 23 people, including 16 students.

Title: Trump shares AI-generated video of Gaza transformation, featuring golden statue and ‘Will Set You Free’ song
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:50:36 +0000
Content: Amid controversy over his remarks about “taking over” the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday shared an AI-generated video portraying a transformed Gaza, reimagined as a lavish tourist destination.  
The video, titled ‘Trump’s Gaza’, showcases skyscrapers, children gazing at the sky as dollar bills rain down, and Elon Musk enjoying hummus on a Gaza beach. A boy holds a golden balloon resembling Trump’s face, while an enormous golden statue of Trump towers over the city, with people looking up at it. Trump is also depicted dancing in a nightclub, and a building prominently displays the name “Trump Gaza.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears seated on a deck chair beside Trump, sipping a beverage near a swimming pool with “Trump Gaza” in the background.  
A song playing in the video features lyrics that declare, “Donald Trump will set you free, bringing the life for all to see. No more tunnels, no more fear, Trump’s Gaza is finally here. Trump’s Gaza is shining bright, golden future, a brand new life. Feast and dance; the deed is done. Trump Gaza number one.”  
The video follows Trump’s earlier comments about the US taking control of Gaza and transforming it, remarks that have drawn widespread criticism.  
During a joint press conference with Netanyahu in the US, Trump stated that the ongoing ceasefire-hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas could mark the beginning of a broader and lasting peace. However, his vision faced strong opposition from international leaders, who condemned any notion of taking over Palestinian land.  
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed Trump’s idea as “ridiculous and absurd,” calling it a “recipe for chaos and tension in the region.” Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh reiterated the PLO’s firm opposition to any displacement of Palestinians, emphasizing that a two-state solution, in accordance with international law, remains the only path to peace.  
Palestinian UN representative Riyad Mansour stated that people in Gaza should be allowed to return to their original homes in Israel. Saudi Arabia reaffirmed its support for an independent Palestinian state and reiterated that it would not establish diplomatic ties with Israel until such a state is created, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Title: Mediators agree swap of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages’ bodies, source says
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:09:02 +0000
Content: Mediators have reached a deal to release Palestinian prisoners who were originally set to be freed by Israeli authorities last Saturday, along with the handover of Israeli hostages’ bodies by Hamas, an Egyptian source said on Wednesday.
The source, who was briefed on the matter, said the handovers would take place under Egyptian supervision but did not specify the release date.
Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, a Gaza-based militant group allied to Hamas, said it will release the body of Israeli hostage Ohad Yahalomi on Thursday.
Ohad’s is one of four bodies set to be released by Hamas in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.
The three-stage ceasefire which came into effect on January 19 is now nearing the end of its first phase. It has largely held despite accusations of violations by both sides.

Title: Meta must face lawsuit claiming it prefers cheaper foreign workers
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 10:43:39 +0000
Content: A federal judge on Tuesday said Meta Platforms must face a lawsuit claiming that the Facebook and Instagram parent prefers to hire foreign workers because it can pay them less than American workers.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said three U.S. citizens who accused Meta of refusing to hire them though they were qualified may pursue a proposed class action.
The plaintiffs – information technology worker Purushothaman Rajaram and software engineer Ekta Bhatia, both naturalized U.S. citizens, and data scientist Qun Wang – said they each applied for several Meta jobs between 2020 and 2024, but were turned down because of Meta’s “systematic preference” for visa holders.
Meta, in a statement, said the allegations were baseless and it would continue to vigorously defend itself against them.
In seeking a dismissal, the Menlo Park, California-based company said there was no proof it intended to discriminate, or would have hired the plaintiffs if they were not U.S. citizens.
But the judge cited statistics that 15% of Meta’s U.S. workforce holds H-1B visas, which typically go to foreign professionals, compared with 0.5% of the overall workforce.
She also cited Meta’s October 2021 agreement to pay up to $14.25 million, including a civil fine, to settle federal government claims it routinely refused to consider American workers for jobs it reserved for temporary visa holders.
“These allegations support the plaintiffs’ overall complaint that they were not hired because Meta favors H-1B visa holders,” Beeler wrote.
The government had sued Meta in December 2020, seven weeks before President Donald Trump ended his first White House term.
“We are hopeful that the lawsuit will help remedy the favoritism towards visa workers that is common in the tech industry,” Daniel Low, a lawyer for the three plaintiffs, said in an email. “Fully addressing the issue will require additional enforcement or legislative reform.”
Beeler had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit, which named only Rajaram as a plaintiff, in November 2022.
A divided federal appeals court revived the case last June, saying a Civil War-era law barring discrimination in contracts based on “alienage” protected U.S. citizens from bias.
Many conservative groups have cited that law, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, in challenging diversity initiatives in the workplace, which Trump also opposes.

Title: Pope Francis had a peaceful night, is resting, says Vatican
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 10:29:55 +0000
Content: Pope Francis, who has been in the hospital since February 14 for treatment of double pneumonia, had a tranquil night and is now resting, the Vatican press office announced on Wednesday.  
The brief statement did not provide further details, with a health update expected in the evening.  
On Tuesday evening, the Vatican’s update on Pope Francis’ condition said: “The Holy Father’s clinical condition remains critical but stable. There have been no acute respiratory episodes, and his hemodynamic parameters continue to be stable.”  
“In the evening, he underwent a scheduled CT scan to monitor the progression of bilateral pneumonia. The prognosis remains cautious.”  
“In the morning, after receiving the Eucharist, he resumed his work activities.”  
According to Vatican News, the 88-year-old Pope met with Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, the Substitute for General Affairs, on Tuesday. He also authorized the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints to promulgate various decrees concerning individuals on the path to sainthood.  
Pope Francis recognized the “offering of life” of Servants of God Fr. Emil Joseph Kapaun, a United States Army chaplain who served during World War II and the Korean War, and Italian layman Salvo D’Acquisto.  
The “offering of life” is a category introduced by Pope Francis in 2017 for beatification and canonization. It recognizes Christians who, by closely following the teachings of Jesus Christ, voluntarily and freely offered their lives for others and remained steadfast in this commitment until death.  
Additionally, the Pope acknowledged the heroic virtues of two diocesan priests and a layperson. He also made several appointments within the Vatican administration.  
Pope Francis was admitted to Agostino Gemelli Hospital in Rome on February 14 after suffering from bronchitis. He is currently being treated for double pneumonia. A health update last week also noted signs of mild renal insufficiency, which appears to be under control.  
A statement on Monday evening indicated that, despite the severity of his condition, the Pope had shown slight improvement.  
“No episodes of asthma-like respiratory distress occurred on Monday, and some laboratory tests have shown improvement. The monitoring of his mild kidney insufficiency has not raised any concerns. Oxygen therapy continues, although with a slightly reduced flow and oxygen levels.”  
Doctors remain “cautious” in their prognosis, given the complexity of the Pope’s clinical condition.

Title: India looking at increasing ethanol blending with petrol to over 20%: Hardeep Singh Puri
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:54:38 +0000
Content: Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday said that India is considering increasing its ethanol blending target to more than 20%.  
Speaking at the Advantage Assam 2.0 investment summit in Guwahati, he noted that the country has already achieved a 19.6% ethanol blending rate.  
“We are considering blending more than 20% biofuel. A group under NITI Aayog has already been established to explore this possibility,” he said.  
Despite developmental challenges, all fossil fuel production companies in India are expected to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, Puri added.  
Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted the Centre’s commitment to strengthening the state’s energy infrastructure. “At the last Advantage Assam Summit, the Ministry of Petroleum announced plans to extend a 1,600 km gas grid from Barauni to Numaligarh,” he said.  
“Although Assam accounts for 14% of India’s total gas production, our domestic output meets only 7-8% of the country’s demand due to rapid industrialization and the expansion of city gas services. The completion of the 1,600 km pipeline and the Northeast gas grid in record time has dispelled the misconception that Assam’s gas is being diverted elsewhere. Instead, we are now importing gas from other parts of the country and the global market for Assam’s development,” he added.  
The session was organized as a strategic forum to strengthen Assam’s role in India’s Act East Policy. It focused on enhancing regional connectivity, boosting trade, and fostering cross-border collaboration, reinforcing Assam’s position as the gateway to the policy.

Title: AIIMS doctors perform rare surgery to remove extra limbs of teen
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:19:27 +0000
Content: Doctors at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi successfully performed a rare surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove two extra lower limbs hanging from his abdomen.
The condition, known as an incomplete parasitic twin, is a rare phenomenon in which an underdeveloped twin, failing to fully form, attaches to the host twin and survives by drawing nutrients from the host’s body.
Dr. Asuri Krishna, Chief Surgeon at AIIMS Delhi, explained, “This condition is what we call an incomplete parasitic twin. It is a twin that has not fully developed but continues to feed on the host. This surgery is particularly challenging because the parasitic twin derives its blood supply, nerve connections, and other essentials from the host. The key challenge is to identify these connections, carefully ligate them, and then separate the twin. We also need to assess whether it has attachments to abdominal organs such as the liver, intestines, or colon. Fortunately, in this case, there were no major attachments.”
The surgery was particularly complex due to the shared blood supply and nerve connections between the parasitic limbs and the host’s body.
Dr. Maneesh Singhal, from the Burn & Plastic Surgery department at AIIMS Delhi, highlighted the surgical challenges: “The biggest challenge was its size. It was quite large, and imaging through CT scans and ultrasounds showed that it was internally spread. There was also a significant amount of blood—more than 1.5 liters—within the parasitic twin, leading to a sudden loss of blood during the procedure. Fortunately, we encountered no major complications, and the surgery was successful.”
Dr. V.K. Bansal, Professor in the Surgery Department at AIIMS Delhi, recalled the initial concerns upon examining the patient. “Our primary concern was whether the parasitic limb had any connection to vital organs such as the heart, liver, or intestines, as this would have made the surgery much more risky and complicated.”
Despite the challenges, the surgery was a success, and the patient is now recovering well. Dr. Krishna stated, “The patient, who is 16-17 years old, is doing very well post-surgery. He was extremely happy with the outcome.”
The medical team also reflected on the emotional impact of the case, with Dr. Bansal expressing sympathy for the boy’s long struggle. He added, “It is heartbreaking that the child had to live with this condition for so many years… Our society still struggles to provide adequate support for such cases.”

Title: India’s approach to Africa focuses on building, not extracting: Jaishankar at Japan-India-Africa forum
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:09:24 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized India’s commitment to building long-term, sustainable partnerships with Africa through capacity-building, skill development, and technology transfer, rather than extractive models.
Addressing the Japan-India-Africa Business forum virtually on Wednesday, Jaishankar highlighted India’s deepening economic ties with Africa, noting that bilateral trade has reached nearly USD 100 billion, alongside infrastructure and connectivity projects worth over USD 12 billion.
“India’s engagement with Africa has always been guided by a deep-rooted commitment to mutually beneficial partnerships. Unlike extractive models, India prioritizes capacity-building, skill development, and technology transfer, ensuring that African nations not only benefit from investments but also develop self-sustaining growth ecosystems,” Jaishankar said.
He further underscored India’s expanding economic presence in Africa, stating, “India is Africa’s fourth-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching nearly USD 100 billion and growing steadily. Additionally, India has invested over USD 12 billion in concessional credit, completing more than 200 infrastructure projects across Africa in sectors such as railways, power generation, agriculture, and water supply. Our development projects—including drinking water schemes, irrigation, rural solar electrification, power plants, transmission lines, cement, sugar, and textile factories, technology parks, and railway infrastructure—have created local employment and significantly improved lives in Africa.”
Jaishankar also emphasized the shared vision of India and Japan in strengthening engagement with Africa and beyond, reaffirming their commitment to democratic values, freedom, and the rule of law. “Our bilateral relationship has evolved into a special strategic and global partnership. Together, we have built strong foundations in areas such as infrastructure, technology, healthcare, and education. Our collaboration within the QUAD further complements and reinforces our engagement across various sectors.”
Speaking on the role of the Global South, he stressed the need for emerging economies to have a greater voice in global decision-making. “As the Global South emerges as the future driver of economic growth, it is essential that its aspirations and interests are fully represented on the global stage,” he said.
Jaishankar cited India’s leadership in this effort, particularly through the Voice of the Global South Summits and its G20 presidency, during which it successfully facilitated the African Union’s permanent membership in the G20.
He also highlighted key avenues for cooperation, including the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) and the India-Africa Forum Summit, as crucial mechanisms for enhancing engagement.
Reiterating India’s focus on fostering sustainable growth, Jaishankar pointed to various initiatives supporting Africa’s development, such as the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program, the Pan-African e-Network project, and high-impact community development projects that have strengthened capacities in healthcare, education, and digital infrastructure.
Discussing India’s e-learning and telemedicine initiatives, he said, “The e-VidyaBharti and e-ArogyaBharti network was launched in 2019 to support tele-education and telemedicine. Under this initiative, youth from 19 African countries have enrolled in undergraduate, postgraduate, and diploma courses.”
Jaishankar expressed optimism about India-Japan-Africa collaboration. “Japanese investments, India’s strong industrial base and digital capabilities, and Africa’s talent and growing consumer market can come together to create mutually beneficial outcomes. Africa’s growth and prosperity will not only uplift its people but also contribute to global stability and economic progress. India and Japan, with their complementary strengths, are well-positioned to support Africa’s development in a sustainable and inclusive manner.”

Content: Lakhs of devotees, saints and visitors coming from different parts of Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and others have queued in Pashupatinath Temple to pay obeisance to Pashupatinath on the occasion of Mahashivaratri festival. Mahashivratri holds immense religious significance in Hinduism, symbolising the divine union of lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.
Pashupatinath temple’s doors were open at 2 am on Wednesday to make arrangements for offering worship and obeisance to Pashupatinath systematically. Devotees fast and offer water, flowers, garland, incense, fruits and sweets in the temple. Saints and Nagas from Himachal, Haridwar, Kamakhya, Ujjain and different parts of India gather at Pashupati on the occasion of Mahashivratri as it is considered a powerful day for spiritual awakening.
There is an increased number of vehicles entering Nepal with Mahakumbh flags raised on them. As Mahakumbh in Prayagraj in India ends today, devotees returning from Prayagraj are taking a detour to Vishwanath in Varanasi and Pashupatinath in Kathmandu. There is a huge crowd of Indian devotees seen in Pashupatinath.
Teams of the Nepali Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and National Investigation Department are mobilised for security.

Title: Taiwan condemns China’s ‘shooting’ drills off southwest coast
Publication Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2025 07:45:20 +0000
Content: China’s military has set up a drill zone for “shooting training” about 40 nautical miles (74 km) off Taiwan’s southwest coast without prior notification, the island’s defence ministry said on Wednesday, condemning the move as a provocative and dangerous.
Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, has repeatedly complained of Chinese military activities, including several rounds of full-scale war games over the past three years.
Taiwan’s defence ministry said that starting shortly before 9am (0100GMT) it had detected 32 Chinese military aircraft carrying out a “joint combat readiness drill” with Chinese warships in the Taiwan Strait area.
“During this period it even blatantly violated international practice by setting up a drills area in the waters about 40 nautical miles off the coast of Kaohsiung and Pingtung without prior warning, claiming that it would carry out ‘shooting training’,” the ministry said.
The training endangers the safety of international flights and shipping and is a “blatant provocation” to regional peace and stability, the ministry said in a statement, adding that it had dispatched its own forces to keep watch.
There was no immediate confirmation from China that it was carrying out any new drills around Taiwan.
