Content: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has highlighted the rapid pace of innovation in India and the country’s leadership position in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).
In her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam, she pointed out Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s comment that India is the ‘use case capital of AI,’ is a “very big statement” as it means that “we are not just talking about AI or doing research in AI. We are implementing it on a large scale.”
Underscoring the awareness about AI in the country, she added that India recorded 3 billion AI-related app downloads in 2024 which was far ahead of the US’ number of 1.5 billion and China’s 1.3 billion.
“We are not just leading in Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption but we are also shaping how AI is governed,” the Finance Minister said in her address at the convocation ceremony of IIIT Kottayam in Kerala.
“At the recent AI Action Summit in Paris, which India co-chaired with France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about how AI is not just a national issue but a global responsibility. It is very important to have an AI which is ethical, inclusive and trustworthy,” FM Sitharaman observed.
She pointed out that the fear that some sections of society may have, about AI leading to a lot of undetected unethical practices will not be addressed “unless we, from the beginning, understand it with responsibility.”
The Finance Minister said that the country is not just experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI), but the government at the centre has taken a lot of inputs from stakeholders and is continuously coming up with policies to make sure that AI gets due attention
She also highlighted that India’s rank in the Global Innovation Index has improved to 39th in 2024 among 133 economies from the 81st position in 2015.
FM Sitharaman pointed out that India’s patent-to-GDP ratio, a measure of the economic impact of patent activity, has grown significantly from 144 in 2013 to 381 in 2023. The country now holds the seventh position in intangible asset intensity, surpassing the growth rates of many high-income economies.
She also highlighted that India secured the sixth spot in global intellectual property filings as per WIPO in 2023 and the country has improved its Network Readiness Index ranking from 79th in 2019 to 49th in 2024, reflecting the advance towards greater innovation and self-reliance.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation stone of cancer hospital in MP’s Bageshwar Dham
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:41:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the Bageshwar Dham Medical and Science Research Institute in Madhya Pradesh’s Garha village at the invitation of Bageshwar Dham chief Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri.
The hospital, aimed at providing free medical treatment to cancer patients from underprivileged backgrounds, will be equipped with state-of-the-art chemotherapy and cancer treatment facilities.
Specialist doctors will oversee patient care, ensuring advanced medical support. The project, estimated to cost around Rs 200 crore, is expected to be completed within two to three years.
Addressing a massive gathering, PM Modi expressed his gratitude for visiting Bundelkhand twice in a short span. “This time, I came at the invitation of Balaji. It is truly Hanuman Ji’s blessing that this centre of faith is now transforming into a centre of health as well,” he said.
He highlighted that the Bageshwar Dham Medical Science and Research Institute will be built on a 10-acre plot, with its first phase featuring a 100-bed facility.
Taking aim at those who, he claimed, “hate the Hindu religion,” the Prime Minister stated, “There have always been people who mock our faith, ridicule religion, and seek to divide society. Many times, foreign powers also try to weaken our country and religion by supporting such elements. These forces have been present in different phases for centuries.”
He further accused these groups of attacking Hindu beliefs, saints, temples, and cultural traditions.
“Their agenda is to break the unity of our society. But in such an environment, my younger brother Dhirendra Shastri has been working tirelessly to spread the mantra of unity across the country,” he added.
Praising Pandit Dhirendra Shastri’s efforts, PM Modi lauded his initiative to establish the cancer institute, stating, “Now, at Bageshwar Dham, devotees will not only receive the blessings of bhajan and food but also the gift of a healthy life.”
The Prime Minister also commended the mass wedding ceremonies organised by Bageshwar Dham for economically weaker sections.
“I have been informed that on the occasion of Maha Shivratri, a mass wedding for 251 daughters will be held here. I deeply appreciate this noble initiative and extend my heartfelt blessings to the newlywed couples, wishing them a happy married life,” he added.
Speaking on the ongoing Maha Kumbh, PM Modi highlighted its spiritual and cultural significance.
“The Maha Kumbh is now reaching its culmination. Millions have arrived, taken the sacred dip, and sought the blessings of saints. Witnessing this grand event, one is naturally awestruck — this is truly a Maha Kumbh of unity,” he said.
“Held once every 144 years, this Maha Kumbh will continue to inspire future generations as a symbol of national togetherness,” the Prime Minister added.

Title: India vs Pakistan: High-stakes clash in ICC Champions Trophy 2025 as both teams fight for semi-final spot
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:50:53 +0000
Content: Dubai is electric with anticipation as India takes on Pakistan in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy 2025 match at the Dubai International Stadium. With both teams vying for crucial points, this encounter is set to be a thrilling contest between two fierce rivals.
India, having secured a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their previous match, enters this game with momentum and confidence. The team is aiming to solidify their spot in the semi-finals, with vice-captain Shubman Gill expressing the need for an aggressive approach, particularly in the middle overs. He believes a target of 300-325 runs would be formidable, despite the potential challenges posed by dew.
On the other hand, Pakistan, under pressure following a loss to New Zealand, faces a must-win situation to stay alive in the tournament. Pakistan’s bowling coach, Aqib Javed, acknowledged the team’s struggles and called on senior players like Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam to lead the charge. Despite the setbacks, Javed remains confident in Pakistan’s fast bowlers but stressed the need for improvement across all departments.
The match is further intensified by key individual battles. The contest between India’s Rohit Sharma and Pakistan’s Shaheen Afridi will play a pivotal role in setting the early tone for the game. Additionally, all eyes will be on Virat Kohli and his ability to counter Pakistan’s spin attack, led by Abrar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah.
The pitch at Dubai International Stadium is expected to be slow and low, which may provide an advantage to spin bowlers as the match progresses. Both teams have prepared accordingly, with India bolstering their lineup with a strong spin contingent alongside their pace attack.
As the atmosphere in Dubai continues to buzz with excitement, fans from both nations have gathered in large numbers, creating a vibrant and electrifying environment. The weather conditions are perfect for cricket, with clear skies and warm temperatures anticipated throughout the day.
India’s solid form and confident mindset make them a formidable opponent in this crucial match, while Pakistan is under pressure to bounce back and keep their semi-final hopes alive. With both teams fighting for vital points, this encounter promises to be an unforgettable showdown.

Title: PM Modi highlights ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’, advises ‘Exam Warriors’ to stay stress-free
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:31:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday encouraged students appearing for board exams to stay positive and stress-free while highlighting how his flagship event, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha,’ is helping young minds prepare for their exams with confidence.
Addressing the 119th episode of his monthly radio program, ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ PM Modi extended his best wishes to students, calling them “Exam Warriors.”
He urged them to approach their exams with a positive spirit and without unnecessary stress.
“This is the season of Board Exams. I wish my young friends, the Exam Warriors, the best of luck. Appear for your papers without any stress and with a completely positive spirit,” he said.
The Prime Minister underscored the growing impact of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ (PPC), an initiative that has evolved into a movement aimed at reducing exam-related stress among students.
Reflecting on its increasing popularity, he noted that the program is now becoming institutionalised, with more experts joining the discussions every year.
The eighth edition of PPC 2025, held on February 10 at Sunder Nursery in New Delhi, saw enthusiastic participation from students, teachers, and parents. The event, broadcast live across multiple platforms, offered valuable insights into exam preparation, stress management, and personal development.
“This year, we tried to conduct ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ in a new format. Along with experts, eight different episodes were also included, covering topics ranging from overall exam strategies to healthcare, mental health, food, and nutrition,” PM Modi said.
He added that past toppers also shared their experiences, making the discussions even more enriching. Many students, parents, and teachers wrote to him, expressing their appreciation for the new format, which allowed in-depth discussions on each topic.
“Our young friends watched these episodes in large numbers on Instagram as well. Many of you also liked the fact that this program was organized at Sunder Nursery in Delhi. Those who have not yet watched these episodes should definitely do so. They are available on NaMo App,” he urged.
PPC 2025 featured insightful conversations with renowned personalities, including Deepika Padukone, Sadhguru, Mary Kom, Vikrant Massey, and Rujuta Diwekar. Their discussions focused on holistic development, managing academic pressure, and fostering a positive mindset during exams.
Over the years, ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ has transformed into a mass movement, inspiring students and educators across the country. The 2025 edition continues this tradition, setting new benchmarks in empowering students to tackle exams with confidence and enthusiasm.
Once again, PM Modi reassured students: “Be happy and stress-free.”

Title: Countries warn against delaying global climate assessment after US exit
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 07:26:30 +0000
Content: The European Union, Britain and climate-vulnerable developing countries have raised concerns about delays to the next global assessment of climate change, by the U.N.’s climate science panel, after the U.S. administration withdrew from the process.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N. body which brings together climate scientists from nearly 200 countries to assess the planet’s health, will meet in Hangzhou, China, next week to plan its next global report.
“It will be vital that all working group contributions to the Seventh Assessment Report are prepared in time,” the EU’s climate chief, Wopke Hoekstra, and ministers from 17 countries including Britain, Germany, France, Spain, the Marshall Islands and Guatemala said in a joint statement, seen by Reuters on Friday.
“We owe it to everyone suffering the impacts of the climate crisis now, and to future generations, to make decisions about our planet’s future on the basis of the best evidence and knowledge available to us,” the statement said.
The Trump administration has halted the participation of U.S. scientists in the IPCC and will not attend its meeting in Hangzhou next week, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Officials familiar with the talks said the countries behind the statement were concerned the report would now not be completed in time to inform the next Paris Agreement “stocktake” in 2028, when nearly 200 countries will assess their progress towards curbing climate change and agree tougher measures to avoid escalating warming.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month also ordered the U.S. to withdraw again from the Paris climate agreement and has moved to reverse the Biden administration’s sweeping climate policies.
Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk is leading the administration’s attempt to rid the federal government of what he calls wasteful spending and slash the federal workforce, indiscriminately cutting funding for climate-related work and removing employees working on climate science, climate justice and clean energy.
A second statement, published on Friday by the Least Developed Countries, a group of 45 of the world’s most vulnerable nations, said there is no excuse for any delays in the process.
“Any backtracking on this process issue will be seen for what it is, politicization of science at the expense of vulnerable countries,” they said in a statement. “People in the developing world have nothing to gain from restricting access to freely available IPCC science.”
The last Paris Agreement “stocktake”, at the COP28 climate summit in 2023, saw nearly 200 countries agree to transition away from fossil fuels.
That deal was informed by the IPCC’s previous report, which set out the drastic changes humanity had caused to the planet’s climate and the sharp cuts to emissions needed to avoid further disasters.

Title: PM Modi says ‘Naari Shakti’ will handle his social media accounts on March 8
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:33:46 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that as a special initiative dedicated to women’s empowerment, he will hand over his social media accounts to a few inspiring women, ‘Naari Shakti’, from across the country on International Women’s Day.
He said that this would provide the women with a platform to share their stories and achievements. He also urged the women to participate in this initiative.
PM Modi also said that International Women’s Day is a special occasion to honour India’s Naari Shakti (women power), highlighting their contributions to shaping the nation’s past, present, and future.
Quoting a shloka from Devi Mahatmya — a Hindu philosophical text — PM Modi explained that it signifies how “all forms of knowledge are manifestations of the Goddess and that she is reflected in all women power in the world.”
“Respect for daughters has been given top priority in our culture. Women’s power has also played an important role in the Independence movement and the making of our Constitution,” he said.
The Prime Minister shared an audio clip of Hansa Mehta, a key figure in India’s freedom struggle and constitutional drafting, presenting the national flag in the Constituent Assembly.
In the clip, Mehta is heard saying: “It is in the fitness of things that this first flag, that is flying over this August House, should be a gift from the women of India. We have donned the saffron colour, we have fought, suffered, and sacrificed for the cause of our country’s freedom. We have today attained our goal.”
Reflecting on this, PM Modi emphasised that Hansa Mehta’s words underscored the deep sacrifices made by Indian women for the nation’s independence and symbolised their unwavering spirit.
“She believed that the saffron colour in the tricolour also reflects this sentiment. She expressed confidence that our women’s power will make India strong and prosperous. Today, her words are proving true. In every field, women’s contributions are immense and inspiring,” he added.

Title: Macron, Starmer to meet Trump as Europeans flesh out ideas for Ukraine guarantees
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:39:37 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance towards Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.
The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be travelling separately, are expected to try to convince Trump not to rush to a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.
Macron, who is trying to capitalise on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.
“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,” he said in an hour-long answer and question session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.
The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom Trump described as a “dictator”, that has alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics.
Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans.
“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,” he told Reuters.
He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.
Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a “temporary pause before Putin attacks again”, will be in Washington on Thursday.
Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and Starmer as “a very nice guy”.
MILITARY GUARANTEES
However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security.
Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to convince Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said.
Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said.
They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said.
While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, centre around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.
Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said.
Part of the British and French talks centre around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.
The options being discussed would centre not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-km (1,243-mile) border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said.
Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine.
A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved.
“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to mobilise and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,” the French official said.
A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high side”.

Title: NDRF intensifies rescue operation to save 8 trapped in Telangana tunnel
Publication Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 04:56:58 +0000
Content: National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams on Sunday intensified rescue efforts to save eight persons trapped in an under-construction tunnel after a portion of its roof collapsed in Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district on February 22.
Four teams comprising 150 personnel were engaged in the rescue operation, which continued throughout the night.
The rescue teams have reached closer to the point where the tunnel roof collapsed during the digging work on Saturday.
At least two workers were injured and eight others were trapped when a portion of the tunnel being dug as part of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed near Domalapenta.
A total of 50 persons were working on the left-side tunnel when the roof collapsed for three meters. The accident occurred at the 14th km point.
While 42 workers came out of the tunnel, the remaining eight were trapped. Those trapped include two engineers and two machine operators.
The NDRF team, which reached up to 11th km in a loco train, found water and mud beyond this point. About three feet of water was accumulated in the tunnel. The NDRF personnel moved ahead on foot and reached closer to the point where the roof of the tunnel had caved in.
The tunnel boring machine was badly damaged in the accident. The water which gushed out from the tunnel roof and the soil pushed back the machine up to 80 meters.
Water and mud accumulated on both sides of the machine hampering the rescue effort. According to officials, water has to be pumped out and mud has to be cleared for the rescue work to progress further.
Earlier, three teams of NDRF reached the accident site from Vijayawada while four teams arrived from Hyderabad. Teams from the Indian Army and Singareni Collieries Company Limited and personnel of the State Disasters Response Force (SDRF) were participating in the rescue operation.
The trapped men are from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
State Ministers Uttam Kumar Reddy and Jupally Krishna Reddy were monitoring the rescue operations along with the district Collector, Superintendent of Police and other top officials.
Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy expressed shock over the incident and assured that the government would extend all possible help to the families of the victims.
The state government had recently resumed the construction work on the tunnel to complete the long-pending project. The construction firm had started work four days ago and on Saturday morning 50 workers entered the tunnel for the work.
Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy said the work was started on the tunnel after a survey by the Geological Survey of India. He told the media that the company that was hired for the work has a good record in digging tunnels.
He said soon after the work began on Saturday morning, water started entering the tunnel and soil caved in. “The workers who came out said they heard an explosion, which could be a geological disturbance,” he said, adding that those who were in front of the boring machine were trapped in the tunnel.
“The government is making all possible efforts to rescue the trapped persons. We are getting the best tunnel experts in the country to oversee the rescue effort,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Revanth Reddy over the phone and enquired about the incident.
The Prime Minister informed him that the NDRF team would be deployed immediately for rescue operations and assured all support from the Central government.

The initiative has become a cornerstone of PM Modi’s outreach efforts, encouraging citizens to engage in social causes and work toward progress.
The programme highlights the works and efforts of those who otherwise would never have got such a wide audience. It recognises the real talent and encourages more to come forward.
In the 118th episode of his popular radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi conveyed a special message to the nation ahead of India’s Republic Day celebrations. The episode not only celebrated India’s rich heritage and accomplishments but also highlighted the nation’s progress in various sectors, including democracy, conservation, youth participation, and selfless service.
Mann Ki Baat since its inception in October 2014 has reached millions, fostering discussions on a range of national issues.
In the previous episode, PM Modi invited citizens to contribute to the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Indian Constitution by uploading videos of themselves reading the Preamble in various languages on Constitution75.com.
In 2025’s first Mann Ki Baat episode, PM Modi called Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity. “… An Unforgettable sea of humanity, incredible visuals, and an extraordinary confluence of equality and harmony. This time, many a divine alignment is also converging at the Kumbh. This festival of Kumbh celebrates the festival of unity in diversity,” he said.
He highlighted how Indian traditions bind the whole country together. “The Kumbh event also tells us how our traditions bind the whole of India together. The ways of adhering to the beliefs are the same from north to south. On the one hand, the Kumbh is organised at Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nasik, and Haridwar; on the other, in the southern part, Pushkaram is organised on the banks of Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Kaveri rivers,” he said.
PM Modi also said, “It is true that when the young generation proudly joins its civilization, then its roots become stronger and its golden future is assured.”
