It is a day of pride, reflection, and reaffirmation of our commitment to democracy, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Let us honour our freedom fighters and martyrs who made the supreme sacrifice to protect and preserve our motherland. I extend my deepest tribute to the valiant soldiers of the Indian Army, Paramilitary Forces, and Jammu and Kashmir Police, whose relentless dedication and sacrifices ensure the unity, integrity, and security of our nation. Beyond safeguarding our borders, they stand as pillars of peace and stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Their extraordinary valour and service inspire us to work towards a united, secure, and prosperous India.”
“On this momentous occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to every individual contributing to the progress of our Union Territory, farmers, artisans, teachers, healthcare workers, security forces, sportspersons and government officials.

These soldiers on horseback have been a prominent feature of the Republic Day parades. Raised in 1953, the 61 Cavalry is the only serving active horsed cavalry regiment in the world, formed through the amalgamation of all the ‘State Horsed Cavalry Units.’
The regiment has the unique distinction of leading the last recorded cavalry charge in history. As part of the 15th Imperial Cavalry Brigade, it defeated the Turkish Eighth Army, leading to the capture of the strategic port of Haifa on September 23, 1918. This victory is celebrated as Haifa Day in both India and Israel. The Teen Murti Haifa Chowk in New Delhi stands as a testament to the valor and courage of the men and horses of this prestigious unit, which has earned 39 battle honors.
The parade was followed by nine mechanized columns and nine marching contingents.
The contingent of the Brigade of the Guards, attired in the resplendent colors of ‘Old Gold and Blood Red,’ proudly marched forward, commanded by Capt. Bharat Ravindra Bhardwaj of 19 Guards. The Brigade of the Guards is the senior-most infantry regiment and one of the most decorated. It holds the distinction of being the first All India, All Class Regiment of the Indian Army and was raised in 1949 as a visionary step for national integration by then Commander-in-Chief, late Field Marshal KM Cariappa, OBE.
Following them was the Jat Regiment, known for its tradition of sacrifice and its well-built contingent. Led by Captain Ajay Singh Garsa, the Jat Regiment traces its origins to 1795, when the Calcutta Militia was raised and later converted into a regular infantry battalion in 1859. Over its more than two-century-long history, the Jat Regiment has actively participated in both World War I and World War II. The regiment’s motto is ‘Sangathan Va Veerta,’ and its war cry is ‘Jat Balwan – Jai Bhagwan.’
The smart, well-turned-out, and synchronized contingent of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), led by Deputy Commandant Navita Thakran, marched down Kartavya Path. The Sentinels of Our Seas, Bharatiya Tatrakshak, stand as steadfast guardians of India’s maritime borders, embodying the very essence of discipline, resilience, and unwavering resolve.
Following this, a tableau from the ICG, focusing on coastal security and maritime search and rescue, rolled down the path. The theme was ‘Swarnim Bharat: Heritage and Progress.’

CPWD tableau commemorated the 75th anniversary of India’s Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949. The front features the Ashoka Chakra and a Wheel of Time, symbolising the eternal flow of life. Behind it, the Constitution is displayed as the supreme legal document declaring India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assuring justice, equality, and liberty to its citizens.
The sides of the tableau are adorned with depictions of Dr B R Ambedkar, who chaired the drafting committee for the Constitution. Live floral decorations in vibrant colours enhance the tableau’s appeal, symbolising the richness of India’s heritage and Constitutional values.
Ahead of this, President Droupadi Murmu unfurled the national flag at Kartavya Path, followed by the national anthem with a thunderous 21-gun salute using 105-mm Light Field Guns, an indigenous weapon system.

Title: West Indies beat Pakistan in second test to secure 1-1 series draw
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 07:14:24 +0000
Content: West Indies secured their first test win in Pakistan since 1990 after beating the hosts by 120 runs in the second match in Multan on Monday to ensure the series ended in a 1-1 draw.
Pakistan needed 178 to win and sweep the two-match series after being reduced to 76-4 at stumps on the second day but lost two quick wickets when Saud Shakeel (13) and Kashif Ali (1) were removed cheaply by Kevin Sinclair and Jomel Warrican.
Mohammad Rizwan gave the hosts a fighting chance, scoring 25 runs off 62 deliveries, before the wicketkeeper-batter was sent packing in the 42nd over by Warrican, who did the bulk of the damage with the ball with five wickets in the second innings.
Reduced to 122-8, Pakistan’s chase fizzled out when Gudakesh Motie removed Noman Ali and Warrican struck again to take out Sajid Khan.
“Just the variation of pace and hitting the same length over and over,” said Warrican, who was named Player of the Match and the Player of the Series. “Consistency is the key to everything I do.”
The hosts won the first test, also in Multan, by 127 runs.
“We haven’t played in Pakistan for a number of years, but we haven’t won here in a while, so to come here and do it as a young group is incredible,” West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said.
“On this pitch, there’s a ball with your name on it around the corner. We did that with the bat in the second innings, and it was good to see. It was a good experience.
“When you get on better pitches, you can have a similar mindset and it will help you in the long run.”

Title: Uttarakhand becomes first state to implement Uniform Civil Code
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 07:14:01 +0000
Content: In a historic move, Uttarakhand has become the first state in India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), effective from Monday.
Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced that the implementation of the UCC aims to bring uniformity in personal civil matters that have, in the past, discriminated based on caste, religion, gender, and other factors. He assured that all necessary preparations have been completed, including the approval of the Act’s rules and the training of relevant officials.
In a post on X, CM Dhami said, “Dear residents of the state, The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will be implemented in the state from January 27, 2025, making Uttarakhand the first state in independent India where this law will come into effect. All the necessary preparations have been completed to implement UCC, which includes approval of the rules of the Act and training of the concerned officials. UCC will bring uniformity in society and ensure equal rights and responsibilities for all citizens. The Uniform Civil Code is a significant offering from our state, contributing to the broader vision of Prime Minister Modi for a developed, organized, harmonious, and self-reliant nation. Under the UCC, we are attempting to bring uniformity in all laws relating to personal civil matters that discriminate on the basis of caste, religion, sex, etc.”
In an interview, CM Dhami said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fulfilled its promise made during the 2022 assembly elections. He pointed to Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, which calls for a uniform civil code to be adopted throughout the country. This article is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which provides guidelines for the Indian government to promote socioeconomic justice and establish India as a welfare state.
“During the 2022 assembly election under the leadership of PM Modi, we promised the people of Uttarakhand that we would work towards implementing the UCC once we formed the government. We have fulfilled all the formalities, and the UCC is now ready to be implemented. Uttarakhand is the first state to bring the UCC, where there will be no discrimination based on gender, caste, or religion. The UCC will be enforced from January 27, as mandated under Article 44 of the Constitution,” CM Dhami added.
The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code Act, 2024, will streamline various personal laws, including those related to marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. Under the UCC, marriages can only be solemnized between individuals who meet specific legal criteria, such as both parties being mentally competent, and having reached the legal age—21 years for men and 18 years for women. Additionally, marriage registration will be mandatory for all marriages taking place after the implementation of the Act, with a 60-day deadline for registration.
The UCC also provides provisions for recognizing marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or outside of Uttarakhand, under certain conditions, allowing them to be registered within six months of the Act’s implementation.
The Act applies to all residents of Uttarakhand, including those residing outside the state, but excludes Scheduled Tribes and certain protected communities.

Title: Asia-Pacific healthcare market to reach $5 trillion by 2030, Indian CDMOs poised for global growth: report
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:56:18 +0000
Content: The Asia-Pacific healthcare market is on track to hit $5 trillion by 2030, driving 40 per cent of global sector growth, according to a report on Monday.
The report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) noted that the unprecedented expansion is fuelled by rapid demographic shifts, investment influxes, and ground-breaking technology applications.
The expansion also includes advancements in new therapies and modalities by Indian contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMOs).
“Innovation is emerging as a key driver of growth in Asia’s healthcare landscape. Indian CDMOs are scaling globally, leveraging their cost efficiencies but also starting to make early strides into complex and cutting-edge modalities such as ADCs and oligonucleotides, enhancing their global competitiveness,” said Smruthi Suryaprakash, Partner, BCG.
“At the same time, decades of investment in biotech across the region are starting to pay off, with advancements in India and Singapore driving localised breakthroughs in new therapies and modalities. These complementary trends, as highlighted in our report, showcase Asia’s potential to lead both global and regional healthcare innovation,” Suryaprakash added.
Further, the report comprehensively explores the Asian healthcare market from multiple perspectives and identifies key factors driving transformation.
It noted that Asia accounts for only 22 percent of global healthcare spending, despite being home to 60 percent of the global population.
With chronic conditions such as diabetes and cancer affecting Asia disproportionately, the report suggested finding its own healthcare models to manage the disease burden. Of the top five prevalent cancers in Asia, liver and stomach cancer have a lower prevalence in the West, which means that Asia will need to invent its own solutions.
Moreover, the market is ripe for disruption because of the rapid ageing of populations, along with significant gaps in infrastructure and capabilities, according to the report. It also noted significant opportunities across all sub-sectors — innovative hospital and specialty care, contract manufacturing, and research, as well as innovation-driven biotech, and models of digital health involved omni-channel patient journeys.
“We are at a unique point in time where Asian healthcare is at the confluence of many tailwinds — rapidly shifting demographics, trade-flows and FDIs favouring Asia as a destination, and demand factors like growing chronic disease burden and a new more active and demanding patient — that creates opportunities to reimagine how healthcare will be delivered in Asia,” said Priyanka Aggarwal, Managing Director, Healthcare Practice, BCG.
The report serves as a guide for investors and healthcare companies to reflect on the recent changes in the sector and implores into addressing key imperatives and immediate priorities. It also attempts to guide the reader to re-imagine healthcare by innovating to challenge existing inefficiencies.

Title: Jaishankar to embark on UAE visit from Jan 27-29 to strengthen bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:42:29 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar is set to embark on an official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from January 27-29, to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries, with a focus on advancing their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
According to an official press release by the Ministry of External Affairs, Jaishankar’s visit aims to deepen ties and bring new momentum to the India-UAE relationship. During his visit, he will meet with senior UAE leaders to discuss the growth of the strategic partnership and explore avenues for enhanced collaboration across various sectors.
During his visit, EAM Jaishankar will meet with UAE leaders to discuss the growth of their comprehensive strategic partnership and explore new ways to enhance collaboration across various sectors.
Additionally, he will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of Raisina Middle East in Abu Dhabi, a key forum for political dialogue in the region.
India and the UAE have long enjoyed robust relations, with diplomatic ties established in 1972. This visit follows a series of high-level exchanges between the two countries, the most notable being Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the UAE in 2015, marking the first Indian prime ministerial visit in 34 years.
This visit paved the way for a stronger partnership, which has been further solidified by subsequent visits, including Prime Minister Modi’s attendance at the COP28 World Climate Action Summit in Dubai in November-December 2023.
The bilateral relationship is significantly bolstered by the large Indian diaspora in the UAE, which constitutes around 35 per cent of the country’s population. The Indian community in the UAE, approximately 3.5 million strong, is the largest ethnic group, contributing to the UAE’s economic and social fabric.
Over the years, the role of Indian expatriates has evolved from being primarily blue-collared workers to professionals, entrepreneurs, and skilled laborers, playing a key role in the UAE’s economic growth.
Indian nationals are also recognized for their cultural contributions, with many being honored with prestigious awards such as the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award and Padma awards.

Title: Dhaka University suspends exams, classes following student clashes; BGB deployed
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:35:26 +0000
Content: Dhaka University (DU), a hub of political activity in Bangladesh, suspended all classes and examinations on Monday following clashes between its students and those of Dhaka College and six other colleges on Sunday night. Several students were injured during the clashes, and police used batons to disperse them.
Four platoons of the Border Guard of Bangladesh (BGB), supported by police, were deployed as students from both sides engaged in sporadic clashes involving chases and counter-chases for several hours, BGB PRO Shariful Islam confirmed.
Due to unavoidable circumstances, the authorities decided to suspend all examinations and classes scheduled for Monday, DU PRO Mohammad Rafiqul Islam said.
At around 10 p.m., students from Dhaka College attempted to enter the DU campus with a protest march, intending to surround the office of DU Pro-Vice Chancellor (Academic), Professor Mamun Ahmed. When news of this spread, students from several DU dormitories came out to resist them, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
The clashes continued for hours, with students throwing bricks and stones at each other in the Nilkhet and New Market areas of Dhaka. To control the situation, police used 12 rounds of sound grenades and stood between the two sides with water cannons and tear gas, according to UNB.
The conflict originated on Sunday afternoon when students from the seven colleges approached Prof. Mamun Ahmed with a five-point demand. Their demands included abolishing the quota system in admission tests, limiting admissions to classroom capacity, and considering the teacher-student ratio during admissions. Dissatisfied with his response, the students’ discontent escalated, culminating in late-night clashes.

Content: With Delhi’s Assembly elections just a week away on February 5, the Election Commission of India (ECI) will convene a high-level meeting today to assess the city’s poll readiness.
The meeting, chaired by the Deputy Election Commissioner, will include top officials such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi, senior officers from the ECI, and key representatives from Delhi Police, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), and the Cantonment Board. Observers and returning officers deployed for the elections, as well as nodal officers handling critical areas like social media, cybercrime, and postal ballots, will also participate.
Senior police officials, including the Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) and Joint and Additional Commissioners of Police, will be present to ensure law and order during the election period. District Election Officers and representatives from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi will join the review to finalize preparations across the capital.
The elections are shaping up to be a fierce triangular contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the Congress. As campaigning intensifies, parties are trading accusations over development failures in the city.
The Delhi Assembly elections will be conducted in a single phase on February 5, with vote counting scheduled for February 8. A total of 699 candidates are contesting across 70 assembly seats.
Historically, the Congress, once dominant with a 15-year rule, has struggled in recent elections, failing to secure any seats. In contrast, the AAP has maintained its stronghold, winning 67 and 62 seats in 2015 and 2020, respectively. The BJP, while improving marginally, secured just eight seats in the last assembly election.

Title: US puts Colombia tariff, sanctions threat on hold after deportations deal
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:10:26 +0000
Content: The U.S. and Colombia pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants.
U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened tariffs and sanctions on Colombia to punish it for earlier refusing to accept military flights carrying deportees as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.
But in a statement late on Sunday, the White House said Colombia had agreed to accept the migrants after all and Washington would not impose its threatened penalties.
“The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay,” it said.
Draft orders imposing tariffs and sanctions on Colombia would be “held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement”, it added.
In a statement late on Sunday, Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said: “We have overcome the impasse with the U.S. government”.
“The government of Colombia… has the presidential plane ready to facilitate the return of Colombians who were going to arrive in the country this morning on deportation flights.”
The draft measures included imposing 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the U.S., which would go up to 50% in one week; a travel ban and visa revocations on Colombian government officials; and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions.
Trump also said he would also direct enhanced border inspections of Colombian nationals and cargo.
A State Department spokesperson said the United States had suspended visa processing at the U.S. embassy in Bogota.
Colombia is the third largest U.S. trading partner in Latin America, while the U.S. is Colombia’s largest trading partner.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro earlier condemned the military deportation flights and said he would never carry out a raid to return handcuffed Americans to the U.S.
“We are the opposite of the Nazis,” he wrote in a post on social media platform X.
But he also said Colombia would welcome home deported migrants on civilian planes, and offered his presidential plane to facilitate their “dignified return”.
Trump declared illegal immigration a national emergency and imposed a sweeping crackdown since taking office last Monday. He directed the U.S. military to help with border security, issued a broad ban on asylum and took steps to restrict citizenship for children born on U.S. soil.
Mexico also refused a request last week to let a U.S. military aircraft land with migrants.
Trump has said he is thinking about imposing 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 to force further action against illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing into the U.S.

Additionally, capital work in progress stood at Rs 13.63 lakh crore in March 2024, indicating strong ongoing project development, said the SBI report.
India’s investment ecosystem and external commercial borrowings (ECBs) have witnessed significant developments over the past few years, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The recent report by the State Bank of India (SBI) has highlighted trends in investment announcements, private sector’s contribution, and role of ECBs in corporate financing.
Investment activity in India continues to grow at a rapid pace, with significant contributions from the private sector.
Household Net Financial Savings (HNFS) in India improved to 5.3 per cent of GDP in FY24 from 5 per cent in FY23.
Additionally, savings in physical assets increased from 12.9 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 13.5 per cent in FY24.
Investment as a share of GDP has improved in recent years, led by both government and private sector contributions.
In FY23, government investment reached 4.1 per cent of GDP, the highest since FY12. Private corporate investment rose to 11.9 per cent of GDP in FY23, its highest level since FY16.
The share of private investment is projected to further increase to around 12.5 per cent in FY24, reflecting improved business sentiment. The total outstanding ECBs stood at $190.4 billion as of September 2024, according to the report.
By November 2024, total ECB registrations stood at $33.8 billion. Nearly half of the registration, in FY24, are for the import of capital goods, modernisation, local capital expenditure, and new projects.

Shah also encouraged the youth of Gujarat to experience the Maha Kumbh, sharing that he has visited Kumbh nine times in his life and has also witnessed the Ardh Kumbh.
Simultaneously, the Virat Sanatan Dharma Sansad will take place at the Shanti Seva Camp in Sector 17, led by spiritual guru Devkinandan Thakur.

Title: India sends humanitarian aid to Kurdistan region of Iraq

Content: India has sent a shipment of medical supplies, including bronchodilators, inhalers, and ventilators, to support the residents of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. The assistance reflects India’s approach to foreign policy focused on global cooperation and humanitarian efforts.
The humanitarian assistance to the semi-autonomous region once again spotlights India’s people-centric foreign policy and New Delhi’s commitment to the making of a ‘Vishwabandhu Bharat’, or a global friend.
In the past decade, India has contributed to relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, both independently and in collaboration with international initiatives under the United Nations framework.
India established a consulate in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region, in August 2016 to enhance economic and commercial ties with Iraq. Several Indian businesses have participated in trade fairs and exhibitions in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in recent years.
The Kurdistan region, comprising Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk, has seen a steady increase in Indian workers employed in sectors such as steel mills, oil companies, and construction projects. Workers from India are appreciated for their roles in these industries.
Nechirvan Barzani, President of Kurdistan region, has in recent years voiced his willingness to develop relations with India while also highlighting the capacities of the Indian labour force in the region which he says remains a “committed and professional working community”.
In February 2022, India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with Barzani during the Munich Security Conference. Discussions included potential initiatives for capacity building in the Kurdistan region, such as training programs in health, banking, and academic sectors.
“Topics of discussion also included the religious and ethnic diversity and the richness of the culture of peaceful coexistence and tolerance in India, the medical trips from the Kurdistan region to India and other topics of mutual interest,” read a statement issued by the President’s office after the meeting.

Title: Smriti Mandhana named ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for stellar 2024 performances
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 12:02:02 +0000
Content: India’s star batter Smriti Mandhana has been crowned the ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for her outstanding performances in 2024. The elegant left-handed opener dominated the 50-over format, amassing runs with remarkable consistency and flair, solidifying her reputation as one of the best in the game.
According to the official website of the International Cricket Council (ICC), one of the factors that set the experienced India star apart during the year was how she managed to produce her best against high-calibre opposition, scoring big runs in difficult series.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) congratulated Mandhana,
“Congratulations to @mandhana_smriti, who has been adjudged ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year. She scored 4 centuries and 3 half-centuries in 13 matches at an average of 57.46. Keep soaring high, Smriti.”
https://x.com/BCCIWomen/status/1883797183570587971
Mandhana set an early standard with back-to-back hundreds to inspire a 3-0 series win against South Africa in June 2024. An outstanding century proved the match-defining contribution in a series decider against New Zealand in October. And Mandhana again showcased her ability to dominate the very best with a defiant century in Perth against Australia in a losing cause in December.
Mandhana set new career standards in One Day Internationals, scoring more runs than she ever has before in a calendar year, racking up 747 runs in 13 innings across 2024.
That tally made the classy left-hander the leading run-scorer in WODI’s in the year, ahead of Laura Wolvaardt (697), Tammy Beaumont (554) and Hayley Matthews (469).
Mandhana’s runs came at an impressive average of 57.86 and she scored at an impressive strike rate of 95.15, helping set an attacking tone for India’s top order.
She also scored four ODI centuries in the year – a new record in the women’s game – and found the boundary more than a hundred times in the year, hitting 95 fours and six maximums across 2024.
Unsurprisingly, her phenomenal year cemented her place at the top of the run scorers charts in the ICC Women’s Championship – the ODI table that will cement the qualifiers for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025.
Mandhana is one of just five batters to have reached four figures in the competition, accumulating an eye-watering 1358 runs in her 24 matches in the Championship, more than 100 runs clear of the next highest scorer (Laura Wolvaardt).
Mandhana’s standout innings of the year came away from home in December as she hit an excellent 105 against the world’s top ranked team, Australia.
While the opener’s century ended up being in a losing cause, with India falling short of their target, it was Mandhana’s efforts that pushed the defending World Champions close at the WACA in Perth.
Coming up against one of the most daunting bowling attacks in the history of the game, Mandhana was one of just four India batters to reach double figures in the game, with the next highest scorer being just 39. Mandhana showed remarkable quality, taking the attack to Australia despite runs drying up and wickets tumbling at the other end.
She scored 14 fours and one six in her impressive century, with her 105 runs coming off 109 balls. In contrast, the rest of the Indian side managed to score just seven boundaries combined in the entirety of the innings.

Title: SC dismisses application on Hindenburg-Adani group matter
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:57:39 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an application filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari, challenging the apex court Registrar’s August 5, 2024, order, which had declined to register his previous application related to the Hindenburg-Adani Group controversy.
A bench led by Justice JB Pardiwala dismissed Tiwari’s plea, which sought to challenge the Registrar’s decision not to entertain his request to direct the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to submit its conclusive investigation report on allegations raised by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
The Supreme Court Registrar had earlier declined the lawyer’s miscellaneous application, citing the absence of a “reasonable cause” for registration. In his plea, Tiwari urged the top court to direct the Registry to accept and register his application for listing before the court.
The petitioner contended that SEBI must complete and disclose the results of its investigation into the allegations, which stemmed from the controversy ignited by Hindenburg’s report. He argued that the Registrar’s decision to reject his application under Order XV Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, had effectively barred him from pursuing legal remedies, infringing on his fundamental rights.
Tiwari also referenced the Supreme Court’s January 3, 2024, order, which had set a timeline of three months for SEBI to complete its investigation. He emphasized that the court’s use of the term “preferably” did not negate the fixed timeline mentioned in the order.
The petitioner expressed concerns that the delay in SEBI’s investigation, coupled with allegations of inaction, had created uncertainty among the public and investors. He highlighted a blog post by Hindenburg Research, which alleged that 18 months after its initial report on Adani, SEBI had shown a “surprising lack of interest” in probing claims of undisclosed offshore entities linked to the Adani Group. Hindenburg also alleged that whistleblower documents implicated SEBI Chairperson and her husband in funds tied to offshore entities controlled by Vinod Adani, the elder brother of Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani.
Hindenburg’s claims included allegations of fund round-tripping and stock price inflation, further fueling public suspicion. The petitioner argued that the onus lies on SEBI to conclude its investigation and provide clarity to address these concerns.
Despite these arguments, the Supreme Court upheld the Registrar’s decision, effectively dismissing the application.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah named ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:52:41 +0000
Content: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been named the ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024, following an exceptional year in Test cricket, as announced by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
Bumrah, who returned to Test cricket in late 2023 after recovering from a back injury, emerged as the leading wicket-taker in the format for 2024. He claimed 71 wickets, significantly ahead of England’s Gus Atkinson, who took 52 wickets. Bumrah bowled 357 overs at an average of 14.92 and a strike rate of 30.1, setting a record for the lowest average among bowlers with over 70 wickets in a calendar year.
The pacer played a crucial role in India’s victories both at home and abroad. In home series against England and Bangladesh, Bumrah was a vital contributor as India secured wins. He also delivered consistent performances in away tours of South Africa and Australia.
In 2024, Bumrah became the fourth Indian bowler to take more than 70 Test wickets in a year, joining Ravichandran Ashwin, Anil Kumble, and Kapil Dev. During this period, he also achieved the milestone of 200 Test wickets, becoming the 12th Indian to reach the mark.
Bumrah’s standout moments included India’s Test win in Cape Town, South Africa, where he took eight wickets across two innings. In the five-Test series against England, he picked up 19 wickets as India secured a 4-1 series victory.
The Border-Gavaskar Series in Australia saw Bumrah claim 32 wickets in five matches, earning him the Player of the Series award. He played a key role in helping India achieve their objectives in the series and set new records.
In Perth, during the series opener against Australia, Bumrah led the Indian team in the absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. In a match where India was dismissed for 150 on the opening day, Bumrah’s five-wicket haul helped India take control. His performance with the ball was instrumental as India secured a victory by 295 runs.

Title: Hariman Sharma, ‘The Apple Man of India,’ honoured with Padma Shri for Transforming Apple Cultivation in India
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:47:46 +0000
Content: Hariman Sharma, a visionary farmer from Himachal Pradesh, has been honoured with the prestigious Padma Shri for his ground-breaking contribution to Indian agriculture. Sharma developed a self-pollinating, low-chilling apple variety called HRMN-99, which has revolutionised apple cultivation by enabling it to thrive in tropical and sub-tropical regions—where traditional apple farming was once considered impossible.
According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Science & Technology on Monday, Sharma’s innovation has expanded the geographical reach of apple cultivation, making the fruit more accessible and affordable. Unlike conventional varieties that require temperate climates, HRMN-99 flourishes in areas with summer temperatures reaching 40-45°C, including plains and regions across 29 Indian states and Union Territories.
Sharma’s inspiring journey began in 1998 when he planted discarded apple seeds in his backyard. By 2001, one of the plants bore fruit despite the warm climate of his village, Paniala in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh. Over the next decade, he refined the variety through careful grafting, eventually developing the HRMN-99 apple, which produces up to 75 kg of fruit per plant annually.
Despite initial indifference from the farming and scientific communities, Sharma’s breakthrough was eventually recognized by the National Innovation Foundation (NIF) in 2012. NIF validated the variety through molecular studies and multi-location trials, collaborating with institutions like ICAR and Krishi Vigyan Kendras. The variety has since been adopted across India, providing additional income to farmers, particularly in the North-Eastern states, where over 100,000 saplings have been planted.
In addition to the Padma Shri, Sharma’s contributions have earned him numerous accolades, including the National Award for Grassroots Innovation (2017) and the National Innovative Farmer Award (2016). He represented India at the 4th ASEAN India Grassroots Innovation Forum in Malaysia in 2023.
Sharma’s HRMN-99 apple variety is not just an agricultural breakthrough—it’s a symbol of the power of grassroots innovation in creating sustainable livelihoods and achieving national food security goals. His work has transformed apple cultivation in India, making the once-luxury fruit more accessible to common people and empowering farmers across the country.

Title: Saudi Arabia allows foreigners to invest in firms with property in Mecca, Medina
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:18:52 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia’s market regulator said on Monday it would allow foreign investment in listed companies that own real estate within Islam’s two holiest sites of Mecca and Medina, as the Gulf country looks to attract more investment.
The move will allow foreigners to invest in firms whose revenues rely on the Islamic pilgrimage, one of the top revenue sources for the oil-rich kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s market watchdog, the Capital Market Authority (CMA), said in a statement the move aimed to attract foreign capital and provide liquidity for present and future projects in the two cities.
Saudi Arabia has said it aims to welcome 30 million pilgrims for Haj and the year-round pilgrimage umrah annually by 2030. In 2019, it earned about $12 billion from the two pilgrimages, according to official data.
The annual pilgrimage plays a vital role in the country’s economy and upping the number of pilgrims is an integral part of its Vision 2030 economic reform agenda that aims to wean the economy off oil revenues.
Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index was up 0.2%, led by 10% increases in both Jabal Omar Development Company and Makkah Construction and Development Company, which have real estate in Mecca.
The bourse, the Gulf Arab region’s largest with a market capitalization of 10.2 trillion riyals ($2.72 trillion), opened up to foreign investors in 2015 in a bid to attract more funds and has seen a flurry of new listings in recent years.
The CMA said that under Monday’s move foreign investment would be limited to shares, convertible debt instruments, or both, and would exclude “strategic foreign investors”.
The watchdog added that people without Saudi nationality would not be allowed to own more than 49% of shares of the firms involved.
In 2021, it allowed non-Saudis to subscribe to real estate funds investing within the boundaries of Mecca and Medina.
