It is a day of pride, reflection, and reaffirmation of our commitment to democracy, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Let us honour our freedom fighters and martyrs who made the supreme sacrifice to protect and preserve our motherland. I extend my deepest tribute to the valiant soldiers of the Indian Army, Paramilitary Forces, and Jammu and Kashmir Police, whose relentless dedication and sacrifices ensure the unity, integrity, and security of our nation. Beyond safeguarding our borders, they stand as pillars of peace and stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Their extraordinary valour and service inspire us to work towards a united, secure, and prosperous India.”
“On this momentous occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to every individual contributing to the progress of our Union Territory, farmers, artisans, teachers, healthcare workers, security forces, sportspersons and government officials.

These soldiers on horseback have been a prominent feature of the Republic Day parades. Raised in 1953, the 61 Cavalry is the only serving active horsed cavalry regiment in the world, formed through the amalgamation of all the ‘State Horsed Cavalry Units.’
The regiment has the unique distinction of leading the last recorded cavalry charge in history. As part of the 15th Imperial Cavalry Brigade, it defeated the Turkish Eighth Army, leading to the capture of the strategic port of Haifa on September 23, 1918. This victory is celebrated as Haifa Day in both India and Israel. The Teen Murti Haifa Chowk in New Delhi stands as a testament to the valor and courage of the men and horses of this prestigious unit, which has earned 39 battle honors.
The parade was followed by nine mechanized columns and nine marching contingents.
The contingent of the Brigade of the Guards, attired in the resplendent colors of ‘Old Gold and Blood Red,’ proudly marched forward, commanded by Capt. Bharat Ravindra Bhardwaj of 19 Guards. The Brigade of the Guards is the senior-most infantry regiment and one of the most decorated. It holds the distinction of being the first All India, All Class Regiment of the Indian Army and was raised in 1949 as a visionary step for national integration by then Commander-in-Chief, late Field Marshal KM Cariappa, OBE.
Following them was the Jat Regiment, known for its tradition of sacrifice and its well-built contingent. Led by Captain Ajay Singh Garsa, the Jat Regiment traces its origins to 1795, when the Calcutta Militia was raised and later converted into a regular infantry battalion in 1859. Over its more than two-century-long history, the Jat Regiment has actively participated in both World War I and World War II. The regiment’s motto is ‘Sangathan Va Veerta,’ and its war cry is ‘Jat Balwan – Jai Bhagwan.’
The smart, well-turned-out, and synchronized contingent of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), led by Deputy Commandant Navita Thakran, marched down Kartavya Path. The Sentinels of Our Seas, Bharatiya Tatrakshak, stand as steadfast guardians of India’s maritime borders, embodying the very essence of discipline, resilience, and unwavering resolve.
Following this, a tableau from the ICG, focusing on coastal security and maritime search and rescue, rolled down the path. The theme was ‘Swarnim Bharat: Heritage and Progress.’

CPWD tableau commemorated the 75th anniversary of India’s Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949. The front features the Ashoka Chakra and a Wheel of Time, symbolising the eternal flow of life. Behind it, the Constitution is displayed as the supreme legal document declaring India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assuring justice, equality, and liberty to its citizens.
The sides of the tableau are adorned with depictions of Dr B R Ambedkar, who chaired the drafting committee for the Constitution. Live floral decorations in vibrant colours enhance the tableau’s appeal, symbolising the richness of India’s heritage and Constitutional values.
Ahead of this, President Droupadi Murmu unfurled the national flag at Kartavya Path, followed by the national anthem with a thunderous 21-gun salute using 105-mm Light Field Guns, an indigenous weapon system.

Title: West Indies beat Pakistan in second test to secure 1-1 series draw
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 07:14:24 +0000
Content: West Indies secured their first test win in Pakistan since 1990 after beating the hosts by 120 runs in the second match in Multan on Monday to ensure the series ended in a 1-1 draw.
Pakistan needed 178 to win and sweep the two-match series after being reduced to 76-4 at stumps on the second day but lost two quick wickets when Saud Shakeel (13) and Kashif Ali (1) were removed cheaply by Kevin Sinclair and Jomel Warrican.
Mohammad Rizwan gave the hosts a fighting chance, scoring 25 runs off 62 deliveries, before the wicketkeeper-batter was sent packing in the 42nd over by Warrican, who did the bulk of the damage with the ball with five wickets in the second innings.
Reduced to 122-8, Pakistan’s chase fizzled out when Gudakesh Motie removed Noman Ali and Warrican struck again to take out Sajid Khan.
“Just the variation of pace and hitting the same length over and over,” said Warrican, who was named Player of the Match and the Player of the Series. “Consistency is the key to everything I do.”
The hosts won the first test, also in Multan, by 127 runs.
“We haven’t played in Pakistan for a number of years, but we haven’t won here in a while, so to come here and do it as a young group is incredible,” West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said.
“On this pitch, there’s a ball with your name on it around the corner. We did that with the bat in the second innings, and it was good to see. It was a good experience.
“When you get on better pitches, you can have a similar mindset and it will help you in the long run.”

Title: Uttarakhand becomes first state to implement Uniform Civil Code
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 07:14:01 +0000
Content: In a historic move, Uttarakhand has become the first state in India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), effective from Monday.
Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced that the implementation of the UCC aims to bring uniformity in personal civil matters that have, in the past, discriminated based on caste, religion, gender, and other factors. He assured that all necessary preparations have been completed, including the approval of the Act’s rules and the training of relevant officials.
In a post on X, CM Dhami said, “Dear residents of the state, The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will be implemented in the state from January 27, 2025, making Uttarakhand the first state in independent India where this law will come into effect. All the necessary preparations have been completed to implement UCC, which includes approval of the rules of the Act and training of the concerned officials. UCC will bring uniformity in society and ensure equal rights and responsibilities for all citizens. The Uniform Civil Code is a significant offering from our state, contributing to the broader vision of Prime Minister Modi for a developed, organized, harmonious, and self-reliant nation. Under the UCC, we are attempting to bring uniformity in all laws relating to personal civil matters that discriminate on the basis of caste, religion, sex, etc.”
In an interview, CM Dhami said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fulfilled its promise made during the 2022 assembly elections. He pointed to Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, which calls for a uniform civil code to be adopted throughout the country. This article is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which provides guidelines for the Indian government to promote socioeconomic justice and establish India as a welfare state.
“During the 2022 assembly election under the leadership of PM Modi, we promised the people of Uttarakhand that we would work towards implementing the UCC once we formed the government. We have fulfilled all the formalities, and the UCC is now ready to be implemented. Uttarakhand is the first state to bring the UCC, where there will be no discrimination based on gender, caste, or religion. The UCC will be enforced from January 27, as mandated under Article 44 of the Constitution,” CM Dhami added.
The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code Act, 2024, will streamline various personal laws, including those related to marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. Under the UCC, marriages can only be solemnized between individuals who meet specific legal criteria, such as both parties being mentally competent, and having reached the legal age—21 years for men and 18 years for women. Additionally, marriage registration will be mandatory for all marriages taking place after the implementation of the Act, with a 60-day deadline for registration.
The UCC also provides provisions for recognizing marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or outside of Uttarakhand, under certain conditions, allowing them to be registered within six months of the Act’s implementation.
The Act applies to all residents of Uttarakhand, including those residing outside the state, but excludes Scheduled Tribes and certain protected communities.

Title: Asia-Pacific healthcare market to reach $5 trillion by 2030, Indian CDMOs poised for global growth: report
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:56:18 +0000
Content: The Asia-Pacific healthcare market is on track to hit $5 trillion by 2030, driving 40 per cent of global sector growth, according to a report on Monday.
The report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) noted that the unprecedented expansion is fuelled by rapid demographic shifts, investment influxes, and ground-breaking technology applications.
The expansion also includes advancements in new therapies and modalities by Indian contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMOs).
“Innovation is emerging as a key driver of growth in Asia’s healthcare landscape. Indian CDMOs are scaling globally, leveraging their cost efficiencies but also starting to make early strides into complex and cutting-edge modalities such as ADCs and oligonucleotides, enhancing their global competitiveness,” said Smruthi Suryaprakash, Partner, BCG.
“At the same time, decades of investment in biotech across the region are starting to pay off, with advancements in India and Singapore driving localised breakthroughs in new therapies and modalities. These complementary trends, as highlighted in our report, showcase Asia’s potential to lead both global and regional healthcare innovation,” Suryaprakash added.
Further, the report comprehensively explores the Asian healthcare market from multiple perspectives and identifies key factors driving transformation.
It noted that Asia accounts for only 22 percent of global healthcare spending, despite being home to 60 percent of the global population.
With chronic conditions such as diabetes and cancer affecting Asia disproportionately, the report suggested finding its own healthcare models to manage the disease burden. Of the top five prevalent cancers in Asia, liver and stomach cancer have a lower prevalence in the West, which means that Asia will need to invent its own solutions.
Moreover, the market is ripe for disruption because of the rapid ageing of populations, along with significant gaps in infrastructure and capabilities, according to the report. It also noted significant opportunities across all sub-sectors — innovative hospital and specialty care, contract manufacturing, and research, as well as innovation-driven biotech, and models of digital health involved omni-channel patient journeys.
“We are at a unique point in time where Asian healthcare is at the confluence of many tailwinds — rapidly shifting demographics, trade-flows and FDIs favouring Asia as a destination, and demand factors like growing chronic disease burden and a new more active and demanding patient — that creates opportunities to reimagine how healthcare will be delivered in Asia,” said Priyanka Aggarwal, Managing Director, Healthcare Practice, BCG.
The report serves as a guide for investors and healthcare companies to reflect on the recent changes in the sector and implores into addressing key imperatives and immediate priorities. It also attempts to guide the reader to re-imagine healthcare by innovating to challenge existing inefficiencies.

Title: Jaishankar to embark on UAE visit from Jan 27-29 to strengthen bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:42:29 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar is set to embark on an official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from January 27-29, to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries, with a focus on advancing their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
According to an official press release by the Ministry of External Affairs, Jaishankar’s visit aims to deepen ties and bring new momentum to the India-UAE relationship. During his visit, he will meet with senior UAE leaders to discuss the growth of the strategic partnership and explore avenues for enhanced collaboration across various sectors.
During his visit, EAM Jaishankar will meet with UAE leaders to discuss the growth of their comprehensive strategic partnership and explore new ways to enhance collaboration across various sectors.
Additionally, he will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of Raisina Middle East in Abu Dhabi, a key forum for political dialogue in the region.
India and the UAE have long enjoyed robust relations, with diplomatic ties established in 1972. This visit follows a series of high-level exchanges between the two countries, the most notable being Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the UAE in 2015, marking the first Indian prime ministerial visit in 34 years.
This visit paved the way for a stronger partnership, which has been further solidified by subsequent visits, including Prime Minister Modi’s attendance at the COP28 World Climate Action Summit in Dubai in November-December 2023.
The bilateral relationship is significantly bolstered by the large Indian diaspora in the UAE, which constitutes around 35 per cent of the country’s population. The Indian community in the UAE, approximately 3.5 million strong, is the largest ethnic group, contributing to the UAE’s economic and social fabric.
Over the years, the role of Indian expatriates has evolved from being primarily blue-collared workers to professionals, entrepreneurs, and skilled laborers, playing a key role in the UAE’s economic growth.
Indian nationals are also recognized for their cultural contributions, with many being honored with prestigious awards such as the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award and Padma awards.

Title: Dhaka University suspends exams, classes following student clashes; BGB deployed
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:35:26 +0000
Content: Dhaka University (DU), a hub of political activity in Bangladesh, suspended all classes and examinations on Monday following clashes between its students and those of Dhaka College and six other colleges on Sunday night. Several students were injured during the clashes, and police used batons to disperse them.
Four platoons of the Border Guard of Bangladesh (BGB), supported by police, were deployed as students from both sides engaged in sporadic clashes involving chases and counter-chases for several hours, BGB PRO Shariful Islam confirmed.
Due to unavoidable circumstances, the authorities decided to suspend all examinations and classes scheduled for Monday, DU PRO Mohammad Rafiqul Islam said.
At around 10 p.m., students from Dhaka College attempted to enter the DU campus with a protest march, intending to surround the office of DU Pro-Vice Chancellor (Academic), Professor Mamun Ahmed. When news of this spread, students from several DU dormitories came out to resist them, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
The clashes continued for hours, with students throwing bricks and stones at each other in the Nilkhet and New Market areas of Dhaka. To control the situation, police used 12 rounds of sound grenades and stood between the two sides with water cannons and tear gas, according to UNB.
The conflict originated on Sunday afternoon when students from the seven colleges approached Prof. Mamun Ahmed with a five-point demand. Their demands included abolishing the quota system in admission tests, limiting admissions to classroom capacity, and considering the teacher-student ratio during admissions. Dissatisfied with his response, the students’ discontent escalated, culminating in late-night clashes.

Content: With Delhi’s Assembly elections just a week away on February 5, the Election Commission of India (ECI) will convene a high-level meeting today to assess the city’s poll readiness.
The meeting, chaired by the Deputy Election Commissioner, will include top officials such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi, senior officers from the ECI, and key representatives from Delhi Police, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), and the Cantonment Board. Observers and returning officers deployed for the elections, as well as nodal officers handling critical areas like social media, cybercrime, and postal ballots, will also participate.
Senior police officials, including the Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) and Joint and Additional Commissioners of Police, will be present to ensure law and order during the election period. District Election Officers and representatives from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi will join the review to finalize preparations across the capital.
The elections are shaping up to be a fierce triangular contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the Congress. As campaigning intensifies, parties are trading accusations over development failures in the city.
The Delhi Assembly elections will be conducted in a single phase on February 5, with vote counting scheduled for February 8. A total of 699 candidates are contesting across 70 assembly seats.
Historically, the Congress, once dominant with a 15-year rule, has struggled in recent elections, failing to secure any seats. In contrast, the AAP has maintained its stronghold, winning 67 and 62 seats in 2015 and 2020, respectively. The BJP, while improving marginally, secured just eight seats in the last assembly election.

Title: US puts Colombia tariff, sanctions threat on hold after deportations deal
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 06:10:26 +0000
Content: The U.S. and Colombia pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants.
U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened tariffs and sanctions on Colombia to punish it for earlier refusing to accept military flights carrying deportees as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.
But in a statement late on Sunday, the White House said Colombia had agreed to accept the migrants after all and Washington would not impose its threatened penalties.
“The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay,” it said.
Draft orders imposing tariffs and sanctions on Colombia would be “held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement”, it added.
In a statement late on Sunday, Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said: “We have overcome the impasse with the U.S. government”.
“The government of Colombia… has the presidential plane ready to facilitate the return of Colombians who were going to arrive in the country this morning on deportation flights.”
The draft measures included imposing 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the U.S., which would go up to 50% in one week; a travel ban and visa revocations on Colombian government officials; and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions.
Trump also said he would also direct enhanced border inspections of Colombian nationals and cargo.
A State Department spokesperson said the United States had suspended visa processing at the U.S. embassy in Bogota.
Colombia is the third largest U.S. trading partner in Latin America, while the U.S. is Colombia’s largest trading partner.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro earlier condemned the military deportation flights and said he would never carry out a raid to return handcuffed Americans to the U.S.
“We are the opposite of the Nazis,” he wrote in a post on social media platform X.
But he also said Colombia would welcome home deported migrants on civilian planes, and offered his presidential plane to facilitate their “dignified return”.
Trump declared illegal immigration a national emergency and imposed a sweeping crackdown since taking office last Monday. He directed the U.S. military to help with border security, issued a broad ban on asylum and took steps to restrict citizenship for children born on U.S. soil.
Mexico also refused a request last week to let a U.S. military aircraft land with migrants.
Trump has said he is thinking about imposing 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 to force further action against illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing into the U.S.

Additionally, capital work in progress stood at Rs 13.63 lakh crore in March 2024, indicating strong ongoing project development, said the SBI report.
India’s investment ecosystem and external commercial borrowings (ECBs) have witnessed significant developments over the past few years, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The recent report by the State Bank of India (SBI) has highlighted trends in investment announcements, private sector’s contribution, and role of ECBs in corporate financing.
Investment activity in India continues to grow at a rapid pace, with significant contributions from the private sector.
Household Net Financial Savings (HNFS) in India improved to 5.3 per cent of GDP in FY24 from 5 per cent in FY23.
Additionally, savings in physical assets increased from 12.9 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 13.5 per cent in FY24.
Investment as a share of GDP has improved in recent years, led by both government and private sector contributions.
In FY23, government investment reached 4.1 per cent of GDP, the highest since FY12. Private corporate investment rose to 11.9 per cent of GDP in FY23, its highest level since FY16.
The share of private investment is projected to further increase to around 12.5 per cent in FY24, reflecting improved business sentiment. The total outstanding ECBs stood at $190.4 billion as of September 2024, according to the report.
By November 2024, total ECB registrations stood at $33.8 billion. Nearly half of the registration, in FY24, are for the import of capital goods, modernisation, local capital expenditure, and new projects.

Shah also encouraged the youth of Gujarat to experience the Maha Kumbh, sharing that he has visited Kumbh nine times in his life and has also witnessed the Ardh Kumbh.
Simultaneously, the Virat Sanatan Dharma Sansad will take place at the Shanti Seva Camp in Sector 17, led by spiritual guru Devkinandan Thakur.

Title: India sends humanitarian aid to Kurdistan region of Iraq

Content: India has sent a shipment of medical supplies, including bronchodilators, inhalers, and ventilators, to support the residents of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. The assistance reflects India’s approach to foreign policy focused on global cooperation and humanitarian efforts.
The humanitarian assistance to the semi-autonomous region once again spotlights India’s people-centric foreign policy and New Delhi’s commitment to the making of a ‘Vishwabandhu Bharat’, or a global friend.
In the past decade, India has contributed to relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, both independently and in collaboration with international initiatives under the United Nations framework.
India established a consulate in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region, in August 2016 to enhance economic and commercial ties with Iraq. Several Indian businesses have participated in trade fairs and exhibitions in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in recent years.
The Kurdistan region, comprising Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk, has seen a steady increase in Indian workers employed in sectors such as steel mills, oil companies, and construction projects. Workers from India are appreciated for their roles in these industries.
Nechirvan Barzani, President of Kurdistan region, has in recent years voiced his willingness to develop relations with India while also highlighting the capacities of the Indian labour force in the region which he says remains a “committed and professional working community”.
In February 2022, India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with Barzani during the Munich Security Conference. Discussions included potential initiatives for capacity building in the Kurdistan region, such as training programs in health, banking, and academic sectors.
“Topics of discussion also included the religious and ethnic diversity and the richness of the culture of peaceful coexistence and tolerance in India, the medical trips from the Kurdistan region to India and other topics of mutual interest,” read a statement issued by the President’s office after the meeting.

Title: Smriti Mandhana named ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for stellar 2024 performances
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 12:02:02 +0000
Content: India’s star batter Smriti Mandhana has been crowned the ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for her outstanding performances in 2024. The elegant left-handed opener dominated the 50-over format, amassing runs with remarkable consistency and flair, solidifying her reputation as one of the best in the game.
According to the official website of the International Cricket Council (ICC), one of the factors that set the experienced India star apart during the year was how she managed to produce her best against high-calibre opposition, scoring big runs in difficult series.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) congratulated Mandhana,
“Congratulations to @mandhana_smriti, who has been adjudged ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year. She scored 4 centuries and 3 half-centuries in 13 matches at an average of 57.46. Keep soaring high, Smriti.”
https://x.com/BCCIWomen/status/1883797183570587971
Mandhana set an early standard with back-to-back hundreds to inspire a 3-0 series win against South Africa in June 2024. An outstanding century proved the match-defining contribution in a series decider against New Zealand in October. And Mandhana again showcased her ability to dominate the very best with a defiant century in Perth against Australia in a losing cause in December.
Mandhana set new career standards in One Day Internationals, scoring more runs than she ever has before in a calendar year, racking up 747 runs in 13 innings across 2024.
That tally made the classy left-hander the leading run-scorer in WODI’s in the year, ahead of Laura Wolvaardt (697), Tammy Beaumont (554) and Hayley Matthews (469).
Mandhana’s runs came at an impressive average of 57.86 and she scored at an impressive strike rate of 95.15, helping set an attacking tone for India’s top order.
She also scored four ODI centuries in the year – a new record in the women’s game – and found the boundary more than a hundred times in the year, hitting 95 fours and six maximums across 2024.
Unsurprisingly, her phenomenal year cemented her place at the top of the run scorers charts in the ICC Women’s Championship – the ODI table that will cement the qualifiers for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025.
Mandhana is one of just five batters to have reached four figures in the competition, accumulating an eye-watering 1358 runs in her 24 matches in the Championship, more than 100 runs clear of the next highest scorer (Laura Wolvaardt).
Mandhana’s standout innings of the year came away from home in December as she hit an excellent 105 against the world’s top ranked team, Australia.
While the opener’s century ended up being in a losing cause, with India falling short of their target, it was Mandhana’s efforts that pushed the defending World Champions close at the WACA in Perth.
Coming up against one of the most daunting bowling attacks in the history of the game, Mandhana was one of just four India batters to reach double figures in the game, with the next highest scorer being just 39. Mandhana showed remarkable quality, taking the attack to Australia despite runs drying up and wickets tumbling at the other end.
She scored 14 fours and one six in her impressive century, with her 105 runs coming off 109 balls. In contrast, the rest of the Indian side managed to score just seven boundaries combined in the entirety of the innings.

Title: SC dismisses application on Hindenburg-Adani group matter
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:57:39 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an application filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari, challenging the apex court Registrar’s August 5, 2024, order, which had declined to register his previous application related to the Hindenburg-Adani Group controversy.
A bench led by Justice JB Pardiwala dismissed Tiwari’s plea, which sought to challenge the Registrar’s decision not to entertain his request to direct the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to submit its conclusive investigation report on allegations raised by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
The Supreme Court Registrar had earlier declined the lawyer’s miscellaneous application, citing the absence of a “reasonable cause” for registration. In his plea, Tiwari urged the top court to direct the Registry to accept and register his application for listing before the court.
The petitioner contended that SEBI must complete and disclose the results of its investigation into the allegations, which stemmed from the controversy ignited by Hindenburg’s report. He argued that the Registrar’s decision to reject his application under Order XV Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, had effectively barred him from pursuing legal remedies, infringing on his fundamental rights.
Tiwari also referenced the Supreme Court’s January 3, 2024, order, which had set a timeline of three months for SEBI to complete its investigation. He emphasized that the court’s use of the term “preferably” did not negate the fixed timeline mentioned in the order.
The petitioner expressed concerns that the delay in SEBI’s investigation, coupled with allegations of inaction, had created uncertainty among the public and investors. He highlighted a blog post by Hindenburg Research, which alleged that 18 months after its initial report on Adani, SEBI had shown a “surprising lack of interest” in probing claims of undisclosed offshore entities linked to the Adani Group. Hindenburg also alleged that whistleblower documents implicated SEBI Chairperson and her husband in funds tied to offshore entities controlled by Vinod Adani, the elder brother of Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani.
Hindenburg’s claims included allegations of fund round-tripping and stock price inflation, further fueling public suspicion. The petitioner argued that the onus lies on SEBI to conclude its investigation and provide clarity to address these concerns.
Despite these arguments, the Supreme Court upheld the Registrar’s decision, effectively dismissing the application.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah named ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:52:41 +0000
Content: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been named the ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024, following an exceptional year in Test cricket, as announced by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
Bumrah, who returned to Test cricket in late 2023 after recovering from a back injury, emerged as the leading wicket-taker in the format for 2024. He claimed 71 wickets, significantly ahead of England’s Gus Atkinson, who took 52 wickets. Bumrah bowled 357 overs at an average of 14.92 and a strike rate of 30.1, setting a record for the lowest average among bowlers with over 70 wickets in a calendar year.
The pacer played a crucial role in India’s victories both at home and abroad. In home series against England and Bangladesh, Bumrah was a vital contributor as India secured wins. He also delivered consistent performances in away tours of South Africa and Australia.
In 2024, Bumrah became the fourth Indian bowler to take more than 70 Test wickets in a year, joining Ravichandran Ashwin, Anil Kumble, and Kapil Dev. During this period, he also achieved the milestone of 200 Test wickets, becoming the 12th Indian to reach the mark.
Bumrah’s standout moments included India’s Test win in Cape Town, South Africa, where he took eight wickets across two innings. In the five-Test series against England, he picked up 19 wickets as India secured a 4-1 series victory.
The Border-Gavaskar Series in Australia saw Bumrah claim 32 wickets in five matches, earning him the Player of the Series award. He played a key role in helping India achieve their objectives in the series and set new records.
In Perth, during the series opener against Australia, Bumrah led the Indian team in the absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. In a match where India was dismissed for 150 on the opening day, Bumrah’s five-wicket haul helped India take control. His performance with the ball was instrumental as India secured a victory by 295 runs.

Title: Hariman Sharma, ‘The Apple Man of India,’ honoured with Padma Shri for Transforming Apple Cultivation in India
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:47:46 +0000
Content: Hariman Sharma, a visionary farmer from Himachal Pradesh, has been honoured with the prestigious Padma Shri for his ground-breaking contribution to Indian agriculture. Sharma developed a self-pollinating, low-chilling apple variety called HRMN-99, which has revolutionised apple cultivation by enabling it to thrive in tropical and sub-tropical regions—where traditional apple farming was once considered impossible.
According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Science & Technology on Monday, Sharma’s innovation has expanded the geographical reach of apple cultivation, making the fruit more accessible and affordable. Unlike conventional varieties that require temperate climates, HRMN-99 flourishes in areas with summer temperatures reaching 40-45°C, including plains and regions across 29 Indian states and Union Territories.
Sharma’s inspiring journey began in 1998 when he planted discarded apple seeds in his backyard. By 2001, one of the plants bore fruit despite the warm climate of his village, Paniala in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh. Over the next decade, he refined the variety through careful grafting, eventually developing the HRMN-99 apple, which produces up to 75 kg of fruit per plant annually.
Despite initial indifference from the farming and scientific communities, Sharma’s breakthrough was eventually recognized by the National Innovation Foundation (NIF) in 2012. NIF validated the variety through molecular studies and multi-location trials, collaborating with institutions like ICAR and Krishi Vigyan Kendras. The variety has since been adopted across India, providing additional income to farmers, particularly in the North-Eastern states, where over 100,000 saplings have been planted.
In addition to the Padma Shri, Sharma’s contributions have earned him numerous accolades, including the National Award for Grassroots Innovation (2017) and the National Innovative Farmer Award (2016). He represented India at the 4th ASEAN India Grassroots Innovation Forum in Malaysia in 2023.
Sharma’s HRMN-99 apple variety is not just an agricultural breakthrough—it’s a symbol of the power of grassroots innovation in creating sustainable livelihoods and achieving national food security goals. His work has transformed apple cultivation in India, making the once-luxury fruit more accessible to common people and empowering farmers across the country.

Title: Saudi Arabia allows foreigners to invest in firms with property in Mecca, Medina
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 11:18:52 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia’s market regulator said on Monday it would allow foreign investment in listed companies that own real estate within Islam’s two holiest sites of Mecca and Medina, as the Gulf country looks to attract more investment.
The move will allow foreigners to invest in firms whose revenues rely on the Islamic pilgrimage, one of the top revenue sources for the oil-rich kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s market watchdog, the Capital Market Authority (CMA), said in a statement the move aimed to attract foreign capital and provide liquidity for present and future projects in the two cities.
Saudi Arabia has said it aims to welcome 30 million pilgrims for Haj and the year-round pilgrimage umrah annually by 2030. In 2019, it earned about $12 billion from the two pilgrimages, according to official data.
The annual pilgrimage plays a vital role in the country’s economy and upping the number of pilgrims is an integral part of its Vision 2030 economic reform agenda that aims to wean the economy off oil revenues.
Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index was up 0.2%, led by 10% increases in both Jabal Omar Development Company and Makkah Construction and Development Company, which have real estate in Mecca.
The bourse, the Gulf Arab region’s largest with a market capitalization of 10.2 trillion riyals ($2.72 trillion), opened up to foreign investors in 2015 in a bid to attract more funds and has seen a flurry of new listings in recent years.
The CMA said that under Monday’s move foreign investment would be limited to shares, convertible debt instruments, or both, and would exclude “strategic foreign investors”.
The watchdog added that people without Saudi nationality would not be allowed to own more than 49% of shares of the firms involved.
In 2021, it allowed non-Saudis to subscribe to real estate funds investing within the boundaries of Mecca and Medina.

According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, the index slipped from its recent consolidation on the daily chart, heightening pessimism across the Indian equity market. “Sentiment is likely to favour bearish trades in the short term, particularly as long as the index remains below 23,000. On the lower side, the prevailing weakness could potentially lead to a decline toward 22,500,” he said.

Title: Kailash Mansarovar Yatra to resume this summer: MEA
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:12:50 +0000
Content: The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is set to resume this summer following discussions between India and China, as part of initiatives marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.

Title: RBI plans Rs 1.1 lakh crore liquidity infusion in banking system
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 14:43:38 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced a plan on Monday to inject an additional Rs 1.1 lakh crore into the banking system through various measures, including open market purchase auctions of Government securities and a variable rate repo auction. Additionally, a $5 billion dollar-rupee swap auction will be conducted to enhance liquidity.
This decision follows a review of current liquidity and financial conditions. The open market operations will involve the purchase of Government of India securities worth Rs 60,000 crore in three tranches of Rs 20,000 crore each. These tranches are scheduled for January 30, February 13, and February 20, 2025.
A 56-day Variable Rate Repo auction for Rs 50,000 crore will take place on February 7, while the dollar-rupee swap auction of USD 5 billion for a tenor of six months will be held on January 31, according to the RBI statement.
Detailed instructions for each operation will be issued separately, the statement added.
The RBI stated that it will monitor liquidity and market conditions and undertake measures as needed to ensure orderly liquidity management. The move comes as liquidity in the banking system remains tight, with a deficit of over Rs 3 lakh crore reported last week despite daily variable repo rate auctions.
Last week, the RBI engaged with banks to assess the impact of its new liquidity coverage norms. Banks expressed concerns about potential challenges posed by the norms, including their impact on credit flow, and requested a deferment or alternative mechanisms to manage these effects.
The new liquidity coverage norms were outlined in a draft circular issued on July 25. These norms require banks to set aside additional funds to manage risks, with implementation scheduled for April 1. The guidelines include assigning additional run-off factors to retail deposits enabled with internet and mobile banking facilities, mandating banks to increase high-quality liquid assets to address sudden fund withdrawals.
According to the norms, retail deposits with internet and mobile banking (IMB) will have a run-off factor of 5 percent. Stable retail deposits enabled with IMB will have a run-off factor of 10 percent, and less stable deposits will have a run-off factor of 15 percent. Banks cannot use cash reserve ratios to estimate high-quality liquid assets under the new guidelines.
The RBI said banking has undergone rapid transformation in recent years. While increased usage of technology has facilitated the ability to make instantaneous bank transfers and withdrawals, it has also led to a concomitant increase in risks, requiring proactive management. It has reviewed the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) framework to increase the resilience of banks.
LCR requires banks to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs), comprising mainly government securities, to manage a potential liquidity crunch due to any sudden withdrawal of funds. RBI has rejected the request of banks to include their existing cash reserve ratios to estimate HQLAs.
Treasury officials estimate that banks will need to allocate over Rs 4 lakh crore to purchase government bonds instead of extending credit to meet the liquidity coverage requirements. Banks have approached the finance ministry, seeking a relaxation of the guidelines, which they believe could adversely impact credit growth in the economy.
This initiative coincides with the tenure of the new RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who succeeded Shaktikanta Das in December.

Title: Israeli air strike kills two militants in West Bank, Hamas says
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 14:31:32 +0000
Content: An Israeli air strike killed two Palestinian militants in the city of Tulkarm on Monday, Hamas said, underscoring Israel’s renewed focus on armed groups in the occupied West Bank since the start of the ceasefire in Gaza.
Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, said the two killed on Monday were members of its armed wing. Witnesses in the city said a raid was underway but there was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed that two people had been killed, without identifying them.
In Jenin, further north, a major operation with hundreds of Israeli troops backed by armoured vehicles, drones and helicopters, looked set to go into a second week, with smoke rising above the refugee camp adjacent to the city, a longtime centre of armed militant groups.
Armoured bulldozers and diggers have destroyed buildings and roads in the camp, a crowded township built for descendants of Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the 1948 war around the creation of the state of Israel, and thousands of people have left their homes.
At least 16 Palestinians have been killed in Jenin and surrounding areas since the start of the operation a week ago, including four claimed as fighters by Hamas and the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad.
Late on Saturday, Israeli forces also shot a two-year old girl during a raid on the village of Ash-Shuhada, just to the south of Jenin, Palestinian officials said.
“They started to shoot at us through the windows without any warning,” said Ghada Asous, grandmother of two year-old Laila Muhammad Al-Khatib. “All of a sudden, the special forces raided us and were shooting through the windows.”
The Israeli military (IDF) said troops on a counterterrorism operation had fired at a structure where suspected militants had barricaded themselves.
“The IDF is aware of the claim that uninvolved civilians were injured as a result of the fire. The incident is under review,” it said in a statement.

Title: Rabi crop coverage expands to 655.88 lakh hectares
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 13:48:10 +0000
Content: The area under rabi crops in India has seen a notable increase, with a total of 655.88 lakh hectares being sown this season, compared to 643.72 lakh hectares during the same period last year, as per the latest data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.
Wheat acreage has risen to 324.38 lakh hectares, up from 315.63 lakh hectares in the previous year. This increase is expected to boost wheat production, with experts predicting that winter rains will further benefit the crop. Additionally, the area sown with pulses has expanded to 142.49 lakh hectares, from 139.29 lakh hectares last year. This rise in pulse cultivation will likely contribute to greater output, helping alleviate price pressures that have been contributing to inflation.
Shri Anna and coarse cereals have been planted over 55.67 lakh hectares, while oilseeds coverage stands at 98.18 lakh hectares, showing positive growth across these crops as well.
This increase in sown area comes as a welcome relief, offering the potential for higher yields of essential food commodities. The higher production is anticipated to play a significant role in reducing food inflation and supporting the broader economy. According to the Ministry of Finance’s latest economic review, food inflation is expected to ease, with cautious optimism surrounding the growth outlook for the economy. Factors contributing to this outlook include favorable monsoon conditions, increased minimum support prices, and a steady supply of agricultural inputs.
In December, India’s retail inflation rate based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to a four-month low of 5.22%, driven by a decline in prices of vegetables, pulses, and sugar. This easing trend provides relief to household budgets. CPI inflation had previously peaked at a 14-month high of 6.21% in October but gradually fell to 5.48% in November.

The Akshayvat tree, described in Hindu scriptures like the Puranas and Mahabharata, is regarded as immortal. According to legend, Lord Rama, during his exile, meditated under this tree.
Earlier in the day, Shah took a holy dip at the Sangam along with Hindu saints and seers. He prayed for his family and the well-being of citizens.
This event follows a similar visit by the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet, led by CM Yogi Adityanath, to the Sangam for a holy bath.
The Mahakumbh, a two-month-long festival, has witnessed a large number of devotees. On Makar Sankranti, over 3.5 crore pilgrims, including saints and seers, took a dip in the Ganga.
For the first time, the Shankaracharyas of all four Peethas attended the Mahakumbh, and CM Yogi met them during the event.

Title: India sends humanitarian aid to Kurdistan region of Iraq
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 12:26:15 +0000
Content: India has sent a shipment of medical supplies, including bronchodilators, inhalers, and ventilators, to support the residents of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. The assistance reflects India’s approach to foreign policy focused on global cooperation and humanitarian efforts.
The humanitarian assistance to the semi-autonomous region once again spotlights India’s people-centric foreign policy and New Delhi’s commitment to the making of a ‘Vishwabandhu Bharat’, or a global friend.
In the past decade, India has contributed to relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, both independently and in collaboration with international initiatives under the United Nations framework.
India established a consulate in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region, in August 2016 to enhance economic and commercial ties with Iraq. Several Indian businesses have participated in trade fairs and exhibitions in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in recent years.
The Kurdistan region, comprising Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk, has seen a steady increase in Indian workers employed in sectors such as steel mills, oil companies, and construction projects. Workers from India are appreciated for their roles in these industries.
Nechirvan Barzani, President of Kurdistan region, has in recent years voiced his willingness to develop relations with India while also highlighting the capacities of the Indian labour force in the region which he says remains a “committed and professional working community”.
In February 2022, India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with Barzani during the Munich Security Conference. Discussions included potential initiatives for capacity building in the Kurdistan region, such as training programs in health, banking, and academic sectors.
“Topics of discussion also included the religious and ethnic diversity and the richness of the culture of peaceful coexistence and tolerance in India, the medical trips from the Kurdistan region to India and other topics of mutual interest,” read a statement issued by the President’s office after the meeting.

Title: Smriti Mandhana named ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for stellar 2024 performances
Publication Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2025 12:02:02 +0000
Content: India’s star batter Smriti Mandhana has been crowned the ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year for her outstanding performances in 2024. The elegant left-handed opener dominated the 50-over format, amassing runs with remarkable consistency and flair, solidifying her reputation as one of the best in the game.
According to the official website of the International Cricket Council (ICC), one of the factors that set the experienced India star apart during the year was how she managed to produce her best against high-calibre opposition, scoring big runs in difficult series.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) congratulated Mandhana,
“Congratulations to @mandhana_smriti, who has been adjudged ICC Women’s ODI Cricketer of the Year. She scored 4 centuries and 3 half-centuries in 13 matches at an average of 57.46. Keep soaring high, Smriti.”
https://x.com/BCCIWomen/status/1883797183570587971
Mandhana set an early standard with back-to-back hundreds to inspire a 3-0 series win against South Africa in June 2024. An outstanding century proved the match-defining contribution in a series decider against New Zealand in October. And Mandhana again showcased her ability to dominate the very best with a defiant century in Perth against Australia in a losing cause in December.
Mandhana set new career standards in One Day Internationals, scoring more runs than she ever has before in a calendar year, racking up 747 runs in 13 innings across 2024.
That tally made the classy left-hander the leading run-scorer in WODI’s in the year, ahead of Laura Wolvaardt (697), Tammy Beaumont (554) and Hayley Matthews (469).
Mandhana’s runs came at an impressive average of 57.86 and she scored at an impressive strike rate of 95.15, helping set an attacking tone for India’s top order.
She also scored four ODI centuries in the year – a new record in the women’s game – and found the boundary more than a hundred times in the year, hitting 95 fours and six maximums across 2024.
Unsurprisingly, her phenomenal year cemented her place at the top of the run scorers charts in the ICC Women’s Championship – the ODI table that will cement the qualifiers for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025.
Mandhana is one of just five batters to have reached four figures in the competition, accumulating an eye-watering 1358 runs in her 24 matches in the Championship, more than 100 runs clear of the next highest scorer (Laura Wolvaardt).
Mandhana’s standout innings of the year came away from home in December as she hit an excellent 105 against the world’s top ranked team, Australia.
While the opener’s century ended up being in a losing cause, with India falling short of their target, it was Mandhana’s efforts that pushed the defending World Champions close at the WACA in Perth.
Coming up against one of the most daunting bowling attacks in the history of the game, Mandhana was one of just four India batters to reach double figures in the game, with the next highest scorer being just 39. Mandhana showed remarkable quality, taking the attack to Australia despite runs drying up and wickets tumbling at the other end.
She scored 14 fours and one six in her impressive century, with her 105 runs coming off 109 balls. In contrast, the rest of the Indian side managed to score just seven boundaries combined in the entirety of the innings.

Title: Why DeepSeek’s Rise Is a Black Swan Moment for the AI Industry?
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:29:06 +0000
Content: DeepSeek, a groundbreaking AI startup based in Hangzhou, China, has captured global attention with the launch of its revolutionary language model, DeepSeek-R1. Released on January 20, this cutting-edge model competes with industry leaders like OpenAI’s o1 while costing a fraction of the price. With exceptional capabilities in solving complex problems across chemistry, mathematics, and coding, DeepSeek-R1 is heralding a new era in artificial intelligence (AI). Its unmatched combination of affordability and performance is transforming the AI landscape, inspiring excitement among scientists, researchers, and investors alike.
Unveiling a Cost-Efficient Innovation Strategy
What sets DeepSeek apart is its innovative, cost-efficient approach. While most state-of-the-art AI models demand vast financial and computational resources, DeepSeek-R1 was developed with just $6 million spent on hardware. In stark contrast, models like Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B required $60 million and eleven times the computational power. This achievement underscores a paradigm shift in AI development, demonstrating that breakthroughs do not necessarily require exorbitant investments. Instead, ingenuity and efficiency can challenge even the most entrenched norms of the industry.
Impact on Global Financial Markets
DeepSeek’s ground-breaking achievement is not confined to the research lab. Its ripple effects have been felt across global financial markets, shaking the foundations of established tech giants. Nvidia, a leader in AI, witnessed a sharp 17% decline in its stock price, wiping out an estimated $593 billion in market value. Similar declines were observed for other industry leaders, including Microsoft and Alphabet. The scale of this market reaction highlights the disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation. By proving that cutting-edge AI can be achieved with modest resources, DeepSeek has upended the belief that only large-scale investments can drive technological progress. For the tech industry, this development serves as a reminder of the unpredictable and transformative power of innovation.
What is a Black Swan Event?
DeepSeek’s rapid rise has been described as a “black swan event.” A black swan event refers to a rare and unpredictable occurrence that significantly disrupts industries or markets. The concept, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is characterized by its unexpected nature, its profound impact, and the tendency to rationalize its occurrence in hindsight. DeepSeek embodies these traits, as its ability to create world-class AI with constrained resources has redefined what is considered possible in the AI industry.
Historically, AI advancements have been associated with large budgets and exclusive access to top-tier infrastructure. DeepSeek’s success challenges this notion, proving that resourcefulness can rival even the most well-funded initiatives. Its emergence at a time of intensifying global competition in AI adds to its significance. This development forces policymakers and industry leaders to question their strategies for maintaining technological leadership and ensuring adaptability in an era of rapid innovation. DeepSeek’s achievements are even more remarkable given the constraints imposed by U.S. export controls. These restrictions were designed to limit Chinese firms’ access to advanced AI chips, aiming to slow technological advancements in the region.  This success has reignited global debates about the efficacy of restrictive policies. By demonstrating that innovation cannot be easily contained, DeepSeek has forced nations to reconsider their strategies for maintaining competitiveness in the global AI race.
How is DeepSeek such a game-changer?
AI is an energy-intensive and expensive technology, to the point where some of America’s top tech leaders are acquiring nuclear power companies to supply the electricity needed for their AI models. Earlier in January this year, Meta announced it would invest over $65 billion this year in AI development. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, mentioned last year that the AI industry would require trillions in investments to support the high-demand chips necessary for powering the energy-heavy data centres that run the sector’s intricate models. The idea that comparable capabilities to those of America’s leading AI models can be achieved at a fraction of the cost, using less powerful chips, marks a significant shift in the industry’s perspective on the level of investment AI requires. Despite its critics, proponents of the technology envision a bright future: AI is expected to propel the global economy into a new era, enhancing efficiency and unlocking new capabilities across various industries, ultimately paving the way for ground breaking research and development.
A Commitment to Transparency and Collaboration
DeepSeek has distinguished itself not only with its technical achievements but also with its commitment to transparency and collaboration. Its R1 model has been released as an “open-weight” system, allowing researchers worldwide to analyse and build upon its algorithms. Licensed under MIT terms, the model has been praised for its accessibility, even though it stops short of being fully open-source due to undisclosed training data. “The openness of DeepSeek is quite remarkable,” noted Mario Krenn, head of the Artificial Scientist Lab at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light. This collaborative approach contrasts with competitors like OpenAI, whose models have been criticised for their lack of transparency. By prioritizing openness, DeepSeek is fostering a culture of global cooperation in AI research and setting a new standard for the industry.
A New Frontier in AI
DeepSeek’s emergence as a disruptive force in AI marks a pivotal moment in technological innovation. By achieving extraordinary performance with limited resources, the startup is redefining the boundaries of what is possible in AI development. Its commitment to transparency and global collaboration sets a new benchmark for the industry, challenging both traditional investment models and the dominance of established tech giants. As DeepSeek continues to reshape the landscape, its success encourages a more inclusive and accessible future for AI, one where efficiency and ingenuity, rather than vast financial resources, drive progress and global transformation.

Title: Google Maps to rename ‘Gulf of Mexico’ to ‘Gulf of America’ for US users
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:20:23 +0000
Content: Google Maps will change the name of “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America” once it is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System, Google said in an X post on Monday.
The change will be visible in the U.S., but the name will remain “Gulf of Mexico” in Mexico. Outside of the two countries, users will see both names on Google Maps.
The Trump administration’s Interior Department said on Friday it had officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and the Alaskan peak Denali, the tallest mountain in North America, to Mount McKinley.
Google Maps, which is owned by Alphabet’s Google, will make a similar change with Mount McKinley.
President Donald Trump ordered the name changes as part of a flurry of executive actions hours after taking office on Jan. 20, making good on a campaign promise.
“As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America and North America’s highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley,” the Interior Department said in a statement last week.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this month jokingly suggested North America, including the United States, be renamed “Mexican America” – a historic name used on an early map of the region.
Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Reuters to the company’s X post.
Google has applied the same locale-based labeling conventions to other locations subject to naming disputes.
Outside of Japan and South Korea, the body of water bordering both nations is listed as the “Sea of Japan (East Sea).”
In 2012, Iran threatened to take legal action against Google over its decision to drop the term “Persian Gulf” from its Google Maps and leaving the waterway between Iran and the Arabian peninsula nameless. The body of water is now labeled “Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf)” in other countries.

Title: UPI’s share in India’s digital payments surged to 83%: RBI report
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:11:29 +0000
Content: The share of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India’s digital payments has surged from 34 per cent in 2019 to an impressive 83 per cent in 2024, with a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 74 per cent over the last five years, according to the RBI’s payment system report.
In contrast, the share of other payment systems like RTGS, NEFT, IMPS, credit cards, debit cards, etc., in digital payments volume declined from 66 per cent to 17 per cent during the same period, the report states.
UPI has been the most significant contributor to the growth of digital payments in India due to its usefulness and ease of use, the report points out.
At a macro level, the volume of UPI transactions increased from 375 crore in 2018 to 17,221 crore in 2024, whereas the total value of transactions surged from ₹5.86 lakh crore in 2018 to ₹246.83 lakh crore in 2024.
This amounts to a five-year CAGR of 89.3 per cent and 86.5 per cent in terms of volume and value, respectively, the report states.
Both P2P (person-to-person) and P2M (person-to-merchant) transactions leverage UPI’s secure and real-time payment capabilities, making it easier for individuals and businesses to execute financial transactions without relying on traditional, time-consuming methods.
The UPI P2M transaction volume has surpassed the UPI P2P transaction volumes since 2023; however, in value terms, the UPI P2P transaction value is still higher than UPI P2M transaction values.
Over the past few years, digital payments in India have witnessed phenomenal growth buoyed by the spectacular progress of UPI and the plethora of digital payment options available. In 2024 alone, India recorded 208.5 billion digital payment transactions.
UPI P2M grew at a CAGR of 99 per cent for transaction values below ₹500 over 2019-24. In contrast, UPI P2P grew at a CAGR of 56 per cent during the same period.
For higher ticket-sized transactions — those exceeding ₹2,000 — UPI P2M grew at a CAGR of 109 per cent during the same five-year period, while UPI P2P recorded a CAGR of 57 per cent.
The National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI) low-value transaction payment method, UPI Lite, recorded 2.04 million transactions daily, valued at ₹20.02 crore in December 2024.
“When Paytm and PhonePe introduced UPI Lite on February 15, 2023, and May 2, 2023, respectively, a sustained increase in UPI Lite payment volumes and values was observed,” the RBI report observes.
“UPI has propelled India to the forefront in the provision of digital payment solutions as ‘public good.’ This public good approach has the potential to be adopted by other economies, whatever stage of development they are at. UPI and its features bear lessons on the democratisation of the payment system to the smallest value and penetration of digital payments to previously unreached segments,” the report added.

Content: The Union Territory of Ladakh finished on top of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2025, the first phase of which concluded at the NDS Stadium on Monday. Leh, the capital of Ladakh, hosted the games for the second time this year.
The grand finale featured a thrilling men’s ice hockey final, where the Indian Army edged past ITBP 2-1 to retain the KIWG crown.
The second and final phase of KIWG 2025 is scheduled to take place in Gulmarg, Jammu & Kashmir, from February 22 to 25.
Ladakh bagged two of the four gold medals decided on Monday. Their mixed relay team, comprising Stanzin Jampal, Skarma Tsultim, Mohammed Saquaf Raza, and Padma Angmo, clinched gold with a time of 3:02.19 seconds. Maharashtra (3:03.78 seconds) and Telangana (3:04.85 seconds) secured silver and bronze, respectively.
There was more joy for local fans as the Ladakh women’s ice hockey team exacted sweet revenge by defeating ITBP 4-0 to top the women’s round-robin league at a packed NDS Stadium complex. This victory was especially significant as Ladakh had lost to ITBP by the same 4-0 margin in last year’s final. Himachal Pradesh took home the bronze medal.
“It feels amazing and it’s a big moment for our team. Last year, we lost to ITBP, but this year, we made a strong comeback. A huge thanks to our coach and the Khelo India administration for bringing this event to Ladakh and making this possible for us,” said Padma Chorol, a senior member of the Ladakh women’s ice hockey team, according to a press release.
Tamil Nadu shines in skating
Tamil Nadu emerged as a growing hub for skating talent. Yashashree secured Tamil Nadu’s third gold medal in the final skating event—the women’s 500m long track—held at Gupuks. She clocked 00:58.00 seconds, narrowly beating Riya Vilas Gayakwad of Maharashtra (1:04.31 seconds) and Srija S. Rao of Karnataka (1:04.93 seconds).
Overall, Ladakh topped the medal tally with seven medals, including four golds. Tamil Nadu followed with five medals, including three golds, while Maharashtra, despite winning the highest number of medals (10), finished third with only two golds. Maharashtra had topped KIWG 2024, securing 20 skating medals, including six golds. Telangana (two golds) and Karnataka (one gold) rounded out the top five.
Army retains ice hockey crown
The Indian Army successfully defended their ice hockey title, prevailing in a nail-biting final against ITBP. Supported by enthusiastic fans from the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre, the Army team played with vigor from the start.
The final saw no goals in the first two periods, with all three goals coming in the last 15 minutes. Rigzin Norboo gave the Army an early lead in the final period, assisted by national player Dorjay Angchok. ITBP equalized in the 13th minute through Rigzin Norboo on an assist from Tashi Namgail. However, Padma Norboo scored the decisive goal in the final minute, again assisted by Angchok, securing a 2-1 victory for the Army.
“Our team has been playing matches back-to-back, starting with the CEC Cup, then the LG Cup, and now Khelo India. We didn’t get much time to practice, but I’m glad the team performed well. We won all three Cups, and I’m happy with their performance. I also want to thank the ITBP team for giving us tough competition in today’s final”, Army coach Rinchen Tundup said.

Title: NIA team set to visit US for extradition of 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind Tahawwur Rana
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:02:08 +0000
Content: A high-level team from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is expected to travel to the United States soon to finalize the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a key figure wanted for his involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, according to sources cited by ANI.
The visit follows a major legal breakthrough after the US Supreme Court recently dismissed a review petition filed by Rana challenging his extradition to India. This development clears the way for Indian authorities to expedite legal proceedings and secure his return.
As per sources, senior officials of the NIA, including those at the ranks of Inspector General and Deputy Inspector General, are likely to travel to the US by the end of this month. The plan has reportedly been shared with the Ministries of Home and External Affairs.
Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin and a former doctor and businessman, is accused of providing logistical support for David Coleman Headley, the mastermind behind the 26/11 attacks. He allegedly allowed Headley to use his immigration business as a cover to conduct reconnaissance of potential targets in India.
Arrested in 2009 by the FBI in Chicago, Rana was convicted in the US for supporting the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) but was acquitted of charges directly linked to the Mumbai attacks.
India has been pressing for Rana’s extradition to ensure accountability for the deadly assault that claimed 166 lives and left hundreds injured. The NIA has emphasized his role in aiding and abetting Headley as pivotal to the terror conspiracy.

Title: India sees 100-fold jump in retail digital payments over 12 years: RBI
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:53:08 +0000
Content: Retail digital payments in India have grown from 162 crore transactions in the financial year 2012-13 to over 16,416 crore transactions in the financial year 2023-24 — an approximately 100-fold increase over 12 years, according to a new RBI report.
The remarkable growth in payment infrastructure and performance is also reflected in the Digital Payment Index published by the RBI, which has seen more than a four-fold rise in the last six years (445.50 for March 2024, with a base of 100 as of March 2018), according to the Central Bank’s Payment Systems Report.
Overall, digital payments in India have grown exponentially over the last decade.
“While in CY-2013, there were 222 crore digital transactions valued at Rs 772 lakh crore, this number has increased 94 times in volume and more than 3.5 times in value, reaching over 20,787 crore transactions valued at Rs 2,758 lakh crore in CY-2024,” the report highlighted .
In the last five years alone, digital payments in India have increased 6.7 times in volume and 1.6 times in value. This translates to a five-year CAGR of 45.9% in digital payment volume and 10.2% in digital payment value.
From a nascent digital payment ecosystem, primarily consisting of traditional card-based digital payments, India has now evolved into an ecosystem offering a variety of digital payment options catering to the diverse needs of consumers. These include instant payment systems (UPI, IMPS), small-value payment systems (PPI, UPI Lite), large-value payments (RTGS), bill payments (BBPS), bulk payments (NACH), offline payments (UPI Lite X), government payments (NACH, APBS), toll payments (NETC), and many more.
The Reserve Bank is also focusing on interlinking fast payment systems (FPS) with those of other countries to provide a seamless and less costly cross-border payment experience.
Last year, the Unified Payments Interface of India (UPI) and PayNow of Singapore were interlinked through extensive collaboration between the RBI and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Recent data shows that the cost of sending remittances has noticeably decreased, the report stated.

Title: American AI firms try to poke holes in disruptive DeepSeek
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:48:27 +0000
Content: Developers at leading U.S. AI firms are praising the DeepSeek AI models that have leapt into prominence while also trying to poke holes in the notion that their multi-billion dollar technology has been bested by a Chinese newcomer’s low-cost alternative.
Chinese startup DeepSeek on Monday sparked a stock selloff and its free AI assistant overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT atop Apple’s App Store in the U.S., harnessing a model it said it trained on Nvidia’s lower-capability H800 processor chips using under $6 million.
As worries about competition reverberated across the U.S. stock market, some AI experts applauded DeepSeek’s strong team and up-to-date research but remained unfazed by the development, said people familiar with the thinking at four of the leading AI labs, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the record.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that R1, one of several models DeepSeek released in recent weeks, “is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Nvidia said in a statement DeepSeek’s achievement proved the need for more of its chips.
Software maker Snowflake SNOW.N decided Monday to add DeepSeek models to its AI model marketplace after receiving a flurry of customer inquiries.
With employees also calling DeepSeek’s models “amazing,” the U.S. software seller weighed the potential risks of hosting AI technology developed in China before ultimately deciding to offer it to clients, said Christian Kleinerman, Snowflake’s executive vice president of product.
“We decided that as long as we are clear to customers, we see no issues supporting it,” he said.
Meanwhile, U.S. AI developers are hurrying to analyze DeepSeek’s V3 model. DeepSeek in December published a research paper accompanying the model, the basis of its popular app, but many questions such as total development costs are not answered in the document.
China has now leapfrogged from 18 months to six months behind state-of-the-art AI models developed in the U.S., one person said. Yet with DeepSeek’s free release strategy drumming up such excitement, the firm may soon find itself without enough chips to meet demand, this person predicted.
DeepSeek’s strides did not flow solely from a $6 million shoestring budget, a tiny sum compared to $250 billion analysts estimate big U.S. cloud companies will spend this year on AI infrastructure. The research paper noted that this cost referred specifically to chip usage on its final training run, not the entire cost of development.
The training run is the tip of the iceberg in terms of total cost, executives at two top labs told Reuters. The cost to determine how to design that training run can cost magnitudes more money, they said.
The paper stated that the training run for V3 was conducted using 2,048 of Nvidia’s H800 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls released in 2022, rules that experts told Reuters would barely slow China’s AI progress.
Sources at two AI labs said they expected earlier stages of development to have relied on a much larger quantity of chips. One of the people said such an investment could have cost north of $1 billion.
Some American AI leaders lauded DeepSeek’s decision to launch its models as open source, which means other companies or individuals are free to use or change them.
“DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen – and as open source, a profound gift to the world,” venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said in a post on X on Sunday.
The acclaim garnered by DeepSeek’s models underscores the viability of open source AI technology as an alternative to costly and tightly controlled technology such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, industry watchers said.
Wall Street’s most valuable companies have surged in recent years on expectations that only they had access to the vast capital and computing power necessary to develop and scale emerging AI technology. Those assumptions will come under further scrutiny this week and the next, when many American tech giants will report quarterly earnings.

In contrast, number of debit cards has remained relatively stable, with a marginal increase from 80.53 crore in December 2019 to slightly more than 99.09 crore in December 2024.
A similar growth trajectory is witnessed in card transactions as well, said the RBI report. During CY2024, there were 447.23 crore and 173.90 crore payment transactions worth of Rs. 20.37 lakh crore and Rs. 5.16 lakh crore through credit and debit cards, respectively.
“While the use of debit cards has declined, credit cards have grown more than 15 percent on a year-on-year basis in recent years,” it mentioned.
As of December 2024, the financial landscape in India is characterised by the widespread adoption of credit and debit cards, with an astounding 109.9 crore cards circulating throughout the country.
The credit card issued by public sector banks (PSBs) increased from 122.6 lakh as at End-December 2019 to 257.61 lakh as at end-December 2024, a more than 110 percent jump.
“Private sector banks (PVBs), who hold a 71 percent market share with 766 lakh cards in December 2024, have leaned into digital solutions and co-branded cards to cater to urban and affluent customers,” the RBI report noted.
Meanwhile, foreign banks have seen a decline both in numbers — from 65.79 lakh cards to 45.94 lakh — and in market share, dropping from 11.9 percent to 4.3 percent between December 2019 and December 2024, possibly due to high fees and conservative lending policies.
Small finance banks (SFBs) have entered the arena with 10.97 lakh cards as at End-December 2024, targeting the underserved and focusing on financial inclusivity.
With effect from January 1, 2019, the RBI has mandated the use of only EMV Chip and PIN-based debit and credit cards.
Also, the scope of UPI was expanded by permitting linkage of RuPay credit card to UPI for making payments. Subsequently, it has been expanded by permitting transfer to/from pre-sanctioned credit lines issued by scheduled commercial banks, in addition to deposit accounts.
“In other words, UPI network will facilitate payments financed by credit from banks. This can reduce the cost of such offerings and help in development of unique products for Indian markets,” said the report.

Title: NIA raids 16 locations in Tamil Nadu in ISIS radicalisation probe
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:30:27 +0000
Content: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted raids at 16 locations across Tamil Nadu on Tuesday as part of an ongoing probe into ISIS-linked radicalisation activities. The searches, which began early in the morning, targeted suspected hideouts linked to individuals accused of promoting ISIS ideology and recruitment efforts, according to sources.
The operation aims to gather evidence against those believed to be involved in spreading extremist views and supporting terror activities. The investigation has been ongoing following inputs about organised attempts to radicalise youth and recruit members for ISIS from the state.
This latest action is tied to a case registered last year after investigations uncovered links to ISIS supporters.
The NIA’s focus on ISIS-linked activities in Tamil Nadu dates back to incidents such as the ISIS-inspired car bomb blast in Coimbatore in October 2022. Following that attack, three individuals were arrested on October 21 for allegedly financing the terror plot. The agency later charged four others in a related radicalisation case.

Title: UN peacekeeping chief thanks India, other troop contributors following deadly Congo operation
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 05:34:04 +0000
Content: UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, has expressed his gratitude to India and other nations contributing troops to the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), following the deaths of three peacekeepers last week.
All 1,114 Indian troops and 160 police personnel deployed in the region were reported safe after two South African and one Uruguayan peacekeepers were killed by the M23 rebel group, which has seized control of parts of the mineral-rich eastern DRC.
 “We really admire the resilience, the fortitude, the determination and commitment of our peacekeepers…. and I want to extend this expression of gratitude to the troop-contributing countries, ” Lacroix said on Monday.
“It’s very challenging for our peacekeepers, and of course, it is very challenging for our troop-contributing countries, and I really thank them for the support,” he added.
Lacroix spoke via video link from Damascus, where he was on another UN mission. He added that he had been in touch with several ambassadors from troop-contributing nations.
Since its establishment, MONUSCO, one of the deadliest UN operations, has resulted in the deaths of 290 peacekeepers, including 21 Indian personnel. The recent killings of two South African and one Uruguayan peacekeeper occurred on Friday and Saturday, respectively, in eastern DRC.
The current surge in violence is blamed on neighboring Rwanda, whose troops have been accused of aiding the M23 rebel group. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on Rwanda to cease its support for M23 and withdraw its forces from the DRC.
The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday, condemning the presence of “external forces” in eastern DRC, a diplomatic reference to Rwanda.
M23 has reportedly captured Goma, a key city in eastern DRC. The region is rich in minerals vital to high-tech industries.
MONUSCO, established in 2010 by the Security Council, aims to protect civilians, support humanitarian efforts, and assist the DRC government in restoring stability amid ongoing rebel violence.

Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 13:11:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the two-day ‘Utkarsh Odisha’ – Make in Odisha Conclave 2025 and the Make in Odisha Exhibition in Bhubaneswar.
While addressing the gathering, PM Modi said that eastern India is a growth engine in the development of the country and Odisha plays a key role in it.
He emphasised that numerous opportunities were opening up in this region, more than ever before since independence.
The Prime Minister called upon all the industry leaders attending the grand conclave to invest in Odisha as now is the right time to invest in the state’s development journey.
He also assured that their investment would lead to new heights of success.
Sharing his personal experience of witnessing the skills, hard work, and honesty of people from Odisha in Gujarat, “with new opportunities emerging in Odisha, the state will soon reach unprecedented heights of development,” the Prime Minister said.
He also noted that Odisha is becoming one of India’s leading states in various industries, including food processing, petrochemicals, port-led development, fisheries, IT, edtech, textiles, tourism, mining, and green energy.
PM Modi mentioned that India is changing the trend of extracting minerals and sending them abroad for product manufacturing and value addition, only to have those products returned to India.
“Our government is working to ensure that industries related to the resources available in Odisha are established within the state. Today’s Utkarsh Odisha Conclave 2025 is a means to realise this vision,” he added.
He asserted that the Utkarsh Odisha conclave is the biggest business summit in Odisha till now which is being attended by around five to six times more investors this time.
Urging everyone to recognise the challenges of the global supply chain in a rapidly changing world, the Prime Minister emphasised that India cannot rely on fragmented and import-based supply chains.
Instead, a robust supply and value chain must be built within India to minimise the impact of global fluctuations, he added.
The Prime Minister also highlighted that this responsibility lies with both the government and the industry.
He called on industries to support MSMEs and young startups, stressing the importance of research and innovation for growth.
He added that the Central government was creating a vibrant research ecosystem in the country, with a special fund and a package for internships and skill development.
Emphasising that a strong research ecosystem and a skilled young workforce will directly benefit the industry, PM Modi urged industry partners and the Odisha government to work together to build a modern ecosystem aligned with Odisha’s aspirations, providing new opportunities for the youth.
He said that the world is focusing on sustainable lifestyles and moving towards a green future showing increasing potential for green jobs in the coming days.
He highlighted that India is also focusing on green technology and a green future, including solar, wind, hydro, and green hydrogen, which will power the energy security of a developed India.
The Prime Minister said that Odisha had immense potential in this regard, and significant policy decisions are being made to promote renewable energy industries in Odisha, and several steps are being taken for hydrogen energy production.
He remarked that alongside green energy, initiatives were being taken to expand the petrochemical sector in Odisha.
He highlighted that dedicated industrial parks and investment regions were being developed in Paradip and Gopalpur, indicating significant investment potential in this sector.
He emphasised the need to explore Odisha’s tourism potential, with its 500-km coastline, more than 33 per cent forest cover, and endless possibilities for eco-tourism and adventure tourism.
The Prime Minister noted that India’s focus was on “Wed in India” and “Heal in India,” and Odisha’s natural beauty and environment were very supportive of these initiatives.
Highlighting that India had significant potential for conference tourism, PM Modi urged states and the private sector to focus on the necessary infrastructure and skills for the concert economy. This includes event management, artist grooming, security, and other arrangements, where new opportunities are emerging.

Title: Ram Temple Trust appeals for delay in local devotees’ visits amid surge in Ayodhya
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:48:34 +0000
Content: The Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra has urged devotees living near Ayodhya to postpone their visits by 15-20 days to prioritize those traveling from distant locations for darshan. The appeal comes in response to an overwhelming influx of devotees during this period, creating challenges for crowd management.
The ongoing preparations for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, beginning January 13, and the upcoming Mauni Amavasya snan on January 29, have resulted in heightened activity in religious hubs like Ayodhya and Varanasi. This has placed immense pressure on the state administration to handle the rising number of pilgrims.
Champat Rai, Chairman of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, addressed the issue on X, stating that the sudden rise in the number of devotees has caused difficulties for those seeking darshan of Ramlala. He acknowledged the limitations posed by Ayodhya’s size and infrastructure in accommodating the growing crowd effectively.
He added that to prevent any untoward incident, it’s necessary to make appropriate changes in the systems.
“It is our request that the devotees from nearby areas should come to Ayodhya for darshan after 15-20 days so that the devotees coming from far away places can easily have darshan of the Lord. This will provide convenience to everyone,” Champat Rai said, appealing to the devotees.
He further urged the ‘nearby’ devotees to plan a visit after Basant Panchami (February 2) as the weather will also be more pleasant.
Meanwhile, the Mauni Amavasya snan on January 29 in Prayagraj is expected to draw approximately 10 crore devotees. Many are likely to proceed to Ayodhya after the ritual, further increasing the pressure on transportation networks and local facilities.
The trust’s request aims to streamline the flow of pilgrims and enhance the overall experience for all visitors during this spiritually significant period.

Title: The dynamics of U.S. foreign assistance: Continuity and change
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:15:31 +0000
Content: U.S. foreign assistance has long been a cornerstone of its international relations, serving as a diplomatic tool that aligns with its global positioning as a major world power. Being one of the dominant world powers and the largest economy with a democratic form of governance, the country’s foreign policy assistance is crucial to its external policy approach to geopolitical developments. It supports its soft and strategic power projections.
The United States is the world’s largest donor, and the country’s foreign assistance reaches around 200 countries and regions worldwide annually. It mainly focuses on humanitarian relief, economic development, peacebuilding, and governance. Around 90% of the foreign aid is for economic development, while 10% is for military-related assistance.
Trends in U.S. Foreign Aid Allocation
Over the years, U.S. foreign assistance has fluctuated in scale and focus, reflecting both domestic debates and international needs. Despite these variations, foreign aid consistently constitutes around 1% of the federal budget, highlighting its significance within a carefully managed fiscal framework. Spending peaked at $76 billion in 2022, driven by urgent global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. In 2023, the total spending was $68 billion, allocated to approximately 15,000 activities across 204 countries and regions. The current graph, taken from the United States Foreign Assistance Agency, and showing data since 2010, reflects this trend historically shown by U.S. aid data.

Areas of Focus
Economic development tops the list, as the 2023 obligations show, with $20 billion for it, followed by $14.43 billion for humanitarian assistance and peace and $10.74 billion for security efforts. Health initiatives accounted for $9.85 billion, while democracy, human rights, and governance programmes received $2.64 billion. Environmental sustainability and education, while receiving smaller portions of the total budget, remain integral to long-term developmental goals. This multifaceted approach ensures that U.S. aid addresses both immediate crises and systemic challenges.
Shifting Policies
Being one of the more elements of any U.S. administration, the complexities of foreign aid, from its allocation to its purpose, reflect shifting domestic priorities, international challenges, and geopolitical strategies from time to time.
Following his inauguration for a second term, President Donald Trump has temporarily suspended foreign aid disbursements for a period of 90 days. This suspension, according to the White House, aims to realign foreign assistance strategies with the administration’s foreign policy objectives. The freeze extends to all new obligations and disbursements of existing development assistance funds. However, exceptions have been made for Israel and Egypt, limited to emergency food aid and military funding.
This move is reminiscent of Trump’s previous tenure, where he proposed significant cuts to foreign aid. Between FY2018 and FY2021, while the Trump administration pushed for reductions, Congress often stepped in to maintain or even increase funding for key sectors such as global health, humanitarian crises, and countering the geopolitical influences of China and Russia.
Foreign assistance during the Biden administration was driven by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, global climate control efforts, and combating the rise of authoritarianism worldwide, says an analysis by the US Congressional Research Service. The Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating tensions in West Asia, with the Israel-Hamas conflict, further expanded the role of U.S. foreign assistance. Under Biden, foreign aid commitments witnessed a resurgence, with renewed focus on addressing pressing global challenges and fostering stability in conflict-ridden regions.
The top recipients of U.S. aid underscore its strategic priorities and global humanitarian approach. In 2023, Ukraine received $17.19 billion. Other significant beneficiaries included Israel ($3.3 billion), Jordan ($1.69 billion), and Egypt ($1.5 billion), highlighting enduring partnerships in regions of strategic importance.

Administrative Oversight
The administration of U.S. foreign aid involves a network of federal agencies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) leads these efforts, managing $42.45 billion of obligations in 2023. The Department of State of the United States government, with its $18.89 billion portfolio, plays a critical role in diplomatic initiatives tied to aid. Other agencies, such as the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services, oversee specialised programmes in areas like public health and economic stabilisation.

Directions of the 1980s prioritised Central America and the Middle East, with aid peaking in 1985 amid deficit reduction efforts. The 1990s marked a transition as the Cold War ended, shifting focus to Eastern Europe’s democratisation and important initiatives like the Wye River Peace Accords and Colombia’s counternarcotics efforts. Post-9/11, the 2000s saw a sharp rise in foreign aid, directed towards Afghanistan, Iraq, and global health programmes.
The 2010s brought a reduction in aid as military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan waned, compounded by fiscal constraints from the Budget Control Act. However, foreign assistance rebounded in the 2020s amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, with aid levels reaching $76 billion in 2022.

Title: Responding to Trump tariff threat, Taiwan says chip business is ‘win-win’
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:05:20 +0000
Content: Semiconductor business between Taiwan and the United States is a “win-win” model for both sides given the high level of complementarity, the government said on Tuesday in response to tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia.
Trump said on Monday he plans to impose tariffs on imported chips, pharmaceuticals and steel in an effort to get the producers to make them in the United States.
“Taiwan and the U.S. semiconductor and other technology industries are highly complementary to each other, especially the U.S.-designed, Taiwan-foundry model, which creates a win-win business model for Taiwan and U.S. industries,” Taiwan’s economy ministry said in a statement in response.
The ministry “will continue to pay attention to U.S. policy going forward, and there will be close contact and cooperation between the two sides to ensure that Taiwan’s and U.S.’ industries and national interests can develop in a mutually beneficial way in the face of global challenges”.
Taiwan’s presidential office, in a separate statement, said the island and the United States have “good mutual trust and a close relationship” when it came to chips and high-tech cooperation, which it also said was a “win-win situation”.
In 2020, under the first Trump administration, TSMC announced that it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in a win for efforts by the U.S. government to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. It later boosted those plans with the total investment now standing at $65 billion.
TSMC declined to comment on Trump’s latest tariff remarks.
Earlier this month, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he only expected a small impact from any tariffs imposed by Trump on semiconductor exports given their technological superiority.
In another potential challenge for Taiwan, Trump last week directed federal agencies to investigate persistent U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries.
Taiwan’s trade surplus with the United States surged 83% last year compared with 2023, with exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

Title: New voice-based approach to enable early detection of Alzheimer’s
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 11:52:22 +0000
Content: Chinese researchers have introduced a groundbreaking voice-based method to address language challenges and enable early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.
The team, led by Prof. Li Hai at the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noted that with the ageing global population, Alzheimer’s is becoming increasingly prevalent, making early detection critical for improving patient outcomes.
“Language decline is often one of the earliest indicators of cognitive decline,” the experts noted in a paper published in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.
Currently, available automated speech analysis offers a non-invasive and cost-effective approach to detecting Alzheimer’s. However, these methods face significant challenges, including complexity, poor interpretability, and limited integration of diverse data types, which hinder accuracy and clinical applicability.
To address these limitations, Hai’s team developed the DEMENTIA framework.
“This innovative approach integrates speech, text, and expert knowledge using a hybrid attention mechanism, significantly enhancing both the accuracy and clinical interpretability of Alzheimer’s disease detection,” the researchers said.
The framework leverages advanced large language model technologies. It captures intricate intra- and inter-modal interactions, improving detection accuracy and enabling the prediction of cognitive function scores.
Additionally, the model scores well in comprehensive interpretability analyses, demonstrating its robust clinical decision-support capabilities and adaptability across diverse datasets.
“The findings underscore the potential of speech-based tools for early Alzheimer’s disease screening and monitoring cognitive decline,” the team said.
Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other critical mental functions. It is the most common form of dementia, constituting around 75 per cent of all dementia cases.
Of the approximately 55 million people worldwide with dementia, 60 to 70 per cent are estimated to have Alzheimer’s.

Title: Why is Trump threatening to take over the Panama Canal?
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 11:17:19 +0000
Content: Newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing to “take back” the Panama Canal, the world’s second busiest interoceanic waterway, spurring concerns that the United States could invade the Central American nation.
Trump argues that Panama has broken a pledge of neutrality made when the United States transferred the canal to Panama in 1999, falsely claiming that China is operating it.
The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
WHY IS THE CANAL KEY FOR THE U.S?
The Panama Canal, an 82-km (51-mile) artificial waterway that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, saves ships thousands of miles and weeks of travel. Before it was built, ships had to make the long journey around the stormy tip of South America in order to travel by sea between the two oceans.
Over two-thirds of all cargo passing through the canal today originates from or is destined for the United States.
The U.S. completed construction of the canal in the early 20th century, a project begun by France that cost over 25,000 workers’ lives.
Following pressure from anti-colonial movements, the U.S. signed treaties in 1977 granting Panama control and full sovereignty over the canal zone and guaranteeing its permanent neutrality. These took effect in 1999.
Between 2023 and 2024, a severe drought aggravated by climate change lowered the level of lakes feeding the canal, forcing its administrator to restrict transits and vessel draft, which increased costs and waiting times.
The passage restrictions were lifted late last year, but the waterway has not yet seen a full return of normal traffic as many shippers, especially bulk carriers and liquefied natural gas tankers, have continued taking alternative routes.
WHAT IS CHINA’S INVOLVEMENT?
In his inaugural address last week, Trump repeated accusations he made following his election victory that Panama has ceded control of the canal to China. He has also said Chinese troops are stationed at the canal, without providing evidence.
Both Panama’s government and the Chinese government have rejected those assertions.
CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company, has for more than two decades operated the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at the canal’s Pacific and Atlantic entrances. The company is publicly listed and not financially tied to the Chinese government, though Hong Kong firms are subject to government oversight.
Private U.S. firm SSA Marine operates the MIT port on the Atlantic coast, Taiwan’s Evergreen Group operates another Atlantic port known as CCT, and Singapore’s PSA International operates the Rodman port on the Pacific coast, according to company and government websites.
China’s economic influence has been growing in Latin America, fueling worries in Washington that the resource-rich region will tilt to Chinese interests rather than those of the United States.
Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino has asserted that the canal is and will continue to be Panamanian.
Panama’s authorities recently announced an audit on CK Hutchison’s operated ports, saying they are investigating the firm’s compliance with concession agreements and whether it is adequately reporting its revenues and state payments.
CK Hutchison’s local arm did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, but said in a statement it has paid the state hundreds of millions of dollars during its concession and that its labor force is 99.9% Panamanian.
DISPUTE OVER TOLLS
Trump has repeatedly complained that the fees charged to ships to use the canal are too high, and has accused Panama of levying unfair tariffs on U.S. goods.
“American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way and that includes the United States Navy,” Trump said in the address.
Between the fiscal years ended in 2020 and 2023, the canal’s toll revenue increased almost 26% to $3.35 billion, according to its annual reports. In the fiscal year ended last September, the canal offset less vessel traffic with a water surcharge, which it combined with slot auctions that rose to as much as $4 million per vessel.
The canal’s fees are not differentiated by a ship’s flag, country of origin, or of destination. The United States does not have a relevant commercial fleet under its flag, and U.S. military ships enjoy priority of passage.
Mulino said the tariffs are carefully and transparently evaluated according to demand.
According to shipping experts and cargo movers, tolling fee increases have been applied in recent years by other key waterways amid demand spikes and geopolitical conflicts.
WHAT’S NEXT
Trump’s threat is already impacting Panama’s debt rating. U.S. investment bank JPMorgan downgraded its recommendation on the country’s bonds over threats to the canal, a key source of national income.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to visit Panama between late January and early February, his first foreign visit in the post.
Immigration will be a focus of the trip.
Mulino, who took office last year, has taken a harder line on migration than his predecessor, agreeing to U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama and installing barbed wire at the Darien Gap, a dangerous jungle route many migrants take crossing on foot out of South America on their way to the U.S. border.

Title: Rising exports and expanding refining capacity boost India’s petroleum industry
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 11:16:47 +0000
Content: India has experienced a surge in petroleum product exports over the past decade, with its refining capacity now exceeding 250 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA), enabling the country to meet global demand, according to a press release from the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.
India ranks among the top five refining nations globally and is the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products, the statement added.
Historical Growth and Industry Expansion
India’s petroleum industry traces its roots back to 1867, with the first oil well drilled in Digboi, Assam. Over the decades, the sector has transformed from small-scale refineries into a massive network meeting both domestic and international demands. Public sector giants like ONGC and Indian Oil Corporation have spearheaded the industry’s expansion, alongside private investments that have boosted refining and export capacities.
India’s Global Standing in Petroleum Industry
India ranks among the top refining and fuel-exporting nations, playing a crucial role in the global energy market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projected in February 2024 that India will become the largest source of global oil demand growth by 2030.
India is also the second-largest economy in biofuel blending, following Brazil. It ranks second in ethanol blending with petrol, third in biofuel production, and fourth in LNG terminal capacity worldwide.
Major Developments in India’s Petroleum Sector
Expansion in Exploration Acreage: India aims to increase its exploration acreage to 1 million sq. km by 2030, with a 16% increase expected in 2025.
Affordable Domestic LPG: The price of a 14.2 kg LPG cylinder is as low as Rs.803, among the cheapest globally. PMUY households receive a Rs.300 subsidy, making the effective price ₹503 per cylinder.
Simplified Approval Process: The number of approvals required for petroleum exploration has been reduced from 37 to 18, with nine approvals now available through self-certification.
Policy Reforms for Stability: The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024, passed by the Rajya Sabha on December 3, 2024, ensures a single license for all hydrocarbons, enhancing investment security.
Foreign Trade and GDP Contribution
India’s petroleum industry has significantly contributed to economic growth, with petroleum product exports surging over the past decade. The refining sector’s expansion has strengthened India’s trade partnerships with South Asian, African, and European nations.
According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the Gross Value Addition (GVA) of Coke and Refined Petroleum Products has grown from Rs.1.56 lakh crore in 2012-13 to ₹2.12 lakh crore in 2022-23, supporting GDP growth from Rs.99.44 lakh crore to Rs.269.49 lakh crore in the same period.
Technology and Sustainability in Petroleum Industry
India is embracing Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques, AI-driven digitalization, and green technologies to optimize refining and reduce environmental impact. The country is investing in bio-refineries and alternative fuels like compressed bio-gas (CBG) to transition towards cleaner energy solutions.
Government Initiatives Strengthening the Sector
Key government programs are accelerating the petroleum industry’s progress:
Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana: Supports bio-ethanol projects for sustainable fuel production.
Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR): India has 5.33 MMT of crude oil reserves in underground storage facilities to ensure energy security.
Ethanol Blending Program (EBP): India targets 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025-26, reducing fossil fuel dependency.
Future Outlook
With rising global demand and domestic capacity expansion, India is poised to become a key energy supplier in the coming decade. The government’s focus on policy reforms, technological advancements, and clean energy solutions will ensure the petroleum sector continues to drive economic growth and global trade.

Title: CJI highlights Supreme Court’s role as it marks 75 years of its first sitting
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:08:20 +0000
Content: The Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday said that the Supreme Court represents the aspirations and diversity of the nation’s 1.4 billion people. Speaking during a ceremonial bench session held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the apex court’s first sitting, CJI Khanna described the institution as a unique people’s court with a global distinction.
“What began in 1950 as a successor to the Federal Court, has evolved into perhaps the world’s most vibrant and dynamic apex court, one that truly embodies the aspirations and diversity of 1.4 billion Indians,” he said.
The Chief Justice said that the top court remains accessible to the common public, and in its diversity of judges in these courtrooms, the multitude of voices find representation at the highest level of the judiciary. Further, he said that each decade of top court’s jurisprudence serves as a mirror to our nation’s challenges.
“Like rings in a mature tree that reflect its journey through different seasons, these judgments reflect not just legal evolution, but our country’s very pulse. What emerges is not an unmoving structure carved from sandstone, but rather a living, breathing institution. It has been responsive to the conscience of our democracy, adapting and evolving to embrace the complexities of each era while remaining rooted in the bedrock of constitutional values,” CJI Khanna said.
Referring to landmark verdicts delivered in the last two decades, he said that “no other apex court worldwide navigates such an expansive domain” — from personal liberty to environmental issues, from Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to privacy to the Right to Information (RTI). In socioeconomic justice, the Supreme Court upheld broadened affirmative action to include economic criteria (EWS-Economically Weaker Section) recognising diverse forms of disadvantage in modern society, added CJI Khanna.
“The public understanding of justice has evolved from a pure legal construct to a living force that touches lives across the nation. 75 years after our constitutional journey began, the Supreme Court stands transformed, yet anchored in its foundational mission. This transformation reflects a deeper recognition – that justice must be both principled and practical,” the CJI said.

Title: Punjab Police Bust ISI-Backed Narco-Terror Module Operated from the US
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 13:46:53 +0000
Content: The Punjab Police have dismantled a narco-terror module reportedly backed by Pakistan’s ISI and operated by Harpreet Singh, also known as Happy Passian, and Sarwan Bhola, both based in the United States. Two individuals linked to the group were arrested in connection with a grenade attack on a police post in Amritsar, Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav announced on Tuesday.
The arrested individuals, identified as Bagga Singh from Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar in Sirsa, Haryana, and Puskaran Singh from Amritsar, were found in possession of a hand grenade, two sophisticated pistols, and ammunition.
The incident occurred on January 9, when miscreants hurled a grenade at the Gumtala Police Post in Amritsar Commissionerate. Following the attack, the banned terrorist organization Babbar Khalsa International claimed responsibility through social media platforms.
Bagga Singh, one of the arrested individuals, is related to Sarwan Bhola, who is the brother of Ranjit Singh, also known as Cheeta, a smuggler currently jailed in Bathinda for his involvement in a 532-kg heroin recovery case. Bhola, who operates a drug smuggling network from the US, is wanted in the same heroin recovery case and carries a reward of ₹2 lakh issued by the National Investigation Agency.
Investigators revealed that Bhola had assigned Bagga Singh and his associate, Pushkaran, to work under Harpreet Singh and Harvinder Rinda to orchestrate terror activities in Punjab.
Assistant Inspector General (Amritsar) Sukhminder Singh Mann stated that after the grenade attack, intelligence operations led to the arrests in Sirsa and Amritsar, which also resulted in the recovery of explosives and weapons.
According to the DGP, investigations are being conducted scientifically to uncover forward and backward linkages in the case and to fully dismantle the terror network.

While addressing the gathering, PM Modi said that eastern India is a growth engine in the development of the country and Odisha plays a key role in it.
He emphasised that numerous opportunities were opening up in this region, more than ever before since independence.
The Prime Minister called upon all the industry leaders attending the grand conclave to invest in Odisha as now is the right time to invest in the state’s development journey.
He also assured that their investment would lead to new heights of success.
Sharing his personal experience of witnessing the skills, hard work, and honesty of people from Odisha in Gujarat, “with new opportunities emerging in Odisha, the state will soon reach unprecedented heights of development,” the Prime Minister said.
He also noted that Odisha is becoming one of India’s leading states in various industries, including food processing, petrochemicals, port-led development, fisheries, IT, edtech, textiles, tourism, mining, and green energy.
PM Modi mentioned that India is changing the trend of extracting minerals and sending them abroad for product manufacturing and value addition, only to have those products returned to India.
“Our government is working to ensure that industries related to the resources available in Odisha are established within the state. Today’s Utkarsh Odisha Conclave 2025 is a means to realise this vision,” he added.
He asserted that the Utkarsh Odisha conclave is the biggest business summit in Odisha till now which is being attended by around five to six times more investors this time.
Urging everyone to recognise the challenges of the global supply chain in a rapidly changing world, the Prime Minister emphasised that India cannot rely on fragmented and import-based supply chains.
Instead, a robust supply and value chain must be built within India to minimise the impact of global fluctuations, he added.
The Prime Minister also highlighted that this responsibility lies with both the government and the industry.
He called on industries to support MSMEs and young startups, stressing the importance of research and innovation for growth.
He added that the Central government was creating a vibrant research ecosystem in the country, with a special fund and a package for internships and skill development.

The Prime Minister said that Odisha had immense potential in this regard, and significant policy decisions are being made to promote renewable energy industries in Odisha, and several steps are being taken for hydrogen energy production.
He remarked that alongside green energy, initiatives were being taken to expand the petrochemical sector in Odisha.
He highlighted that dedicated industrial parks and investment regions were being developed in Paradip and Gopalpur, indicating significant investment potential in this sector.
He emphasised the need to explore Odisha’s tourism potential, with its 500-km coastline, more than 33 per cent forest cover, and endless possibilities for eco-tourism and adventure tourism.
The Prime Minister noted that India’s focus was on “Wed in India” and “Heal in India,” and Odisha’s natural beauty and environment were very supportive of these initiatives.
Highlighting that India had significant potential for conference tourism, PM Modi urged states and the private sector to focus on the necessary infrastructure and skills for the concert economy.

Title: Ram Temple Trust appeals for delay in local devotees’ visits amid surge in Ayodhya
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:48:34 +0000
Content: The Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra has urged devotees living near Ayodhya to postpone their visits by 15-20 days to prioritize those traveling from distant locations for darshan. The appeal comes in response to an overwhelming influx of devotees during this period, creating challenges for crowd management.
The ongoing preparations for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, beginning January 13, and the upcoming Mauni Amavasya snan on January 29, have resulted in heightened activity in religious hubs like Ayodhya and Varanasi. This has placed immense pressure on the state administration to handle the rising number of pilgrims.
Champat Rai, Chairman of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, addressed the issue on X, stating that the sudden rise in the number of devotees has caused difficulties for those seeking darshan of Ramlala. He acknowledged the limitations posed by Ayodhya’s size and infrastructure in accommodating the growing crowd effectively.
He added that to prevent any untoward incident, it’s necessary to make appropriate changes in the systems.
“It is our request that the devotees from nearby areas should come to Ayodhya for darshan after 15-20 days so that the devotees coming from far away places can easily have darshan of the Lord. This will provide convenience to everyone,” Champat Rai said, appealing to the devotees.
He further urged the ‘nearby’ devotees to plan a visit after Basant Panchami (February 2) as the weather will also be more pleasant.
Meanwhile, the Mauni Amavasya snan on January 29 in Prayagraj is expected to draw approximately 10 crore devotees. Many are likely to proceed to Ayodhya after the ritual, further increasing the pressure on transportation networks and local facilities.
The trust’s request aims to streamline the flow of pilgrims and enhance the overall experience for all visitors during this spiritually significant period.

Title: ISRO set for 100th launch of GSLV rocket on January 29
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:16:12 +0000
Content: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to conduct its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on January 29. The milestone launch will feature the GSLV-F15 rocket, which is scheduled to lift off at 6:23 am from the second launch pad. The rocket will carry the NVS-02 navigation satellite.
This event marks the 100th launch from Sriharikota, a site that hosted its first major rocket launch the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) on August 10, 1979.
GSLV-F15 will be the 17th flight of India’s GSLV and the 11th using an indigenous cryogenic stage. It is the eighth operational flight of the GSLV with the indigenous cryogenic stage and will feature a payload fairing with a diameter of 3.4 meters. The rocket is designed to place the NVS-02 satellite into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.
The NVS-02 satellite is part of the second-generation constellation for the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) system. NavIC is India’s navigation system, developed to provide accurate position, velocity, and timing services within India and areas extending up to 1,500 kilometers beyond its borders.
According to ISRO, the NVS-02 satellite introduces support for the L1 frequency band, which will enhance its performance and reliability. It is built on the I-2K bus platform, with a lift-off mass of 2,250 kilograms, a power-handling capacity of about 3 kilowatts, and navigation payloads operating on L1, L5, and S bands. A ranging payload in the C-band is also included, and the satellite will be stationed at 111.75 degrees East, replacing IRNSS-1E.
NavIC offers two services: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS). The SPS delivers a position accuracy of better than 20 meters and timing accuracy within 40 nanoseconds.

Title: The dynamics of U.S. foreign assistance: Continuity and change
Publication Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:15:31 +0000
Content: U.S. foreign assistance has long been a cornerstone of its international relations, serving as a diplomatic tool that aligns with its global positioning as a major world power. Being one of the dominant world powers and the largest economy with a democratic form of governance, the country’s foreign policy assistance is crucial to its external policy approach to geopolitical developments. It supports its soft and strategic power projections.
The United States is the world’s largest donor, and the country’s foreign assistance reaches around 200 countries and regions worldwide annually. It mainly focuses on humanitarian relief, economic development, peacebuilding, and governance. Around 90% of the foreign aid is for economic development, while 10% is for military-related assistance.
Trends in U.S. Foreign Aid Allocation
Over the years, U.S. foreign assistance has fluctuated in scale and focus, reflecting both domestic debates and international needs. Despite these variations, foreign aid consistently constitutes around 1% of the federal budget, highlighting its significance within a carefully managed fiscal framework. Spending peaked at $76 billion in 2022, driven by urgent global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. In 2023, the total spending was $68 billion, allocated to approximately 15,000 activities across 204 countries and regions. The current graph, taken from the United States Foreign Assistance Agency, and showing data since 2010, reflects this trend historically shown by U.S. aid data.

Areas of Focus
Economic development tops the list, as the 2023 obligations show, with $20 billion for it, followed by $14.43 billion for humanitarian assistance and peace and $10.74 billion for security efforts. Health initiatives accounted for $9.85 billion, while democracy, human rights, and governance programmes received $2.64 billion. Environmental sustainability and education, while receiving smaller portions of the total budget, remain integral to long-term developmental goals. This multifaceted approach ensures that U.S. aid addresses both immediate crises and systemic challenges.
Shifting Policies
Being one of the more elements of any U.S. administration, the complexities of foreign aid, from its allocation to its purpose, reflect shifting domestic priorities, international challenges, and geopolitical strategies from time to time.
Following his inauguration for a second term, President Donald Trump has temporarily suspended foreign aid disbursements for a period of 90 days. This suspension, according to the White House, aims to realign foreign assistance strategies with the administration’s foreign policy objectives. The freeze extends to all new obligations and disbursements of existing development assistance funds. However, exceptions have been made for Israel and Egypt, limited to emergency food aid and military funding.
This move is reminiscent of Trump’s previous tenure, where he proposed significant cuts to foreign aid. Between FY2018 and FY2021, while the Trump administration pushed for reductions, Congress often stepped in to maintain or even increase funding for key sectors such as global health, humanitarian crises, and countering the geopolitical influences of China and Russia.
Foreign assistance during the Biden administration was driven by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, global climate control efforts, and combating the rise of authoritarianism worldwide, says an analysis by the US Congressional Research Service. The Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating tensions in West Asia, with the Israel-Hamas conflict, further expanded the role of U.S. foreign assistance. Under Biden, foreign aid commitments witnessed a resurgence, with renewed focus on addressing pressing global challenges and fostering stability in conflict-ridden regions.
The top recipients of U.S. aid underscore its strategic priorities and global humanitarian approach. In 2023, Ukraine received $17.19 billion. Other significant beneficiaries included Israel ($3.3 billion), Jordan ($1.69 billion), and Egypt ($1.5 billion), highlighting enduring partnerships in regions of strategic importance.

Administrative Oversight
The administration of U.S. foreign aid involves a network of federal agencies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) leads these efforts, managing $42.45 billion of obligations in 2023. The Department of State of the United States government, with its $18.89 billion portfolio, plays a critical role in diplomatic initiatives tied to aid. Other agencies, such as the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services, oversee specialised programmes in areas like public health and economic stabilisation.

Directions of the 1980s prioritised Central America and the Middle East, with aid peaking in 1985 amid deficit reduction efforts. The 1990s marked a transition as the Cold War ended, shifting focus to Eastern Europe’s democratisation and important initiatives like the Wye River Peace Accords and Colombia’s counternarcotics efforts. Post-9/11, the 2000s saw a sharp rise in foreign aid, directed towards Afghanistan, Iraq, and global health programmes.
The 2010s brought a reduction in aid as military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan waned, compounded by fiscal constraints from the Budget Control Act. However, foreign assistance rebounded in the 2020s amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, with aid levels reaching $76 billion in 2022.

Title: PM Modi continues to monitor Maha Kumbh situation, CM Yogi holds high-level meeting
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 07:01:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is closely monitoring the situation at the Maha Kumbh following a stampede-like incident on Wednesday. He has been in constant contact with the Uttar Pradesh government and has spoken with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath three times, offering directions to restore normalcy and assist with relief efforts.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath convened a high-level meeting with senior state officials to assess the situation and implement necessary measures for maintaining order and safety.
According to the Chief Minister’s Office, key officials, including the Chief Secretary, Director General of Police (DGP), Principal Secretary (Home), officials from the CM’s Office, and the Additional Director General (Law and Order), were present in the war room set up for Maha Kumbh 2025.
The CM has been receiving continuous updates from officials and has been holding meetings since 4:00 a.m. to ensure swift action and coordination.
Earlier, CM Yogi issued an appeal to devotees attending the Maha Kumbh, urging them to follow guidelines, cooperate with the administration, and avoid falling prey to rumours. He advised pilgrims to bathe at the designated Ganga ghats nearest to them instead of attempting to reach the overcrowded Sangam Nose area.
“There are multiple ghats available for bathing. Please avoid overcrowding and follow the administration’s directions. Your cooperation is essential in maintaining order and safety,” he said.
Urging devotees not to fall for misinformation, CM took to X, saying, “Bathe at the nearest Ganga ghat instead of heading towards Sangam Nose. Please follow the administration’s instructions and cooperate in ensuring smooth arrangements. People are bathing peacefully at all ghats of the Sangam. Do not believe in any rumors.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier spoke with CM Yogi regarding the situation and called for immediate relief measures. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also assured full support from the Centre.
Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda held discussions with the chief minister and pledged complete assistance, including volunteers and healthcare services, to manage the situation effectively.
To control the crowds, a diversion plan was implemented at the Maha Kumbh, temporarily halting the entry of devotees. Pilgrims were stopped on the outskirts of the city to prevent further congestion.
Officials said that an unexpectedly large number of devotees arrived for the holy bath on Mauni Amavasya, resulting in a stampede-like situation that left many injured.
The Uttar Pradesh government had anticipated a turnout of 10 crore pilgrims in a single day and had significantly strengthened security arrangements for the Amrit Snan.
The incident occurred as millions gathered for the sacred dip, prompting Akharas to temporarily postpone the event.
The Amrit Snan on Mauni Amavasya holds immense spiritual significance, particularly this year due to the rare Triveni Yog celestial alignment, which occurs once every 144 years.

Title: Poll: 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the US
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 06:28:31 +0000
Content: An opinion poll indicated on Tuesday that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish their Arctic island – a semi-autonomous Danish territory – to become a part of the United States, Danish daily Berlingske reported.
U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that Greenland was vital to U.S. security and Denmark should give up control of the strategically important island.
The survey by pollster Verian, commissioned by the Danish paper, showed only 6% of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9% undecided, Berlingske said.
Denmark said on Monday it would spend 14.6 billion crowns ($2.04 billion) on boosting its military presence in the Arctic.
Greenland – with a land mass larger than Mexico and a population of 57,000 – was granted broad self-governing autonomy in 2009, including the right to declare independence from Denmark through a referendum.
Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who has stepped up a push for independence, has repeatedly said the island is not for sale and that it is up to its people to decide their future.
The U.S. military has a permanent presence at the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a strategic location for its ballistic missile early-warning system, as the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the island.

Title: After historic 100th mission, ISRO eyes 100 more launches in five years
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 05:55:16 +0000
Content: Celebrating the historic milestone of its 100th mission, ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan on Wednesday outlined ambitious plans for the space agency, aiming to launch another 100 missions in the next five years.
“Today we made a historical achievement,” Narayanan said following the successful launch of the GSLV-F15 rocket, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite into orbit from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.
“The 100th launch of ISRO has been successfully carried out with the hard work and teamwork of team ISRO, ” he added.
While it took 46 years to reach this milestone, Narayanan sounded optimistic about the future. “A lot of missions are lined up for this year,” he said, noting that ISRO has already received approval for three additional satellites.
Narayanan also highlighted the upcoming Kulasekarapattinam spaceport in Tamil Nadu, set to launch micro and nano satellites. “Within two years, all facilities will be completed at the Kulasekarapattinam launch pad, after which we expect to launch all kinds of missions from there,” he added.
Wednesday’s launch marked the 17th mission of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and the 11th successful mission utilizing an indigenous cryogenic stage. This flight also marked the 8th operational flight of GSLV featuring the indigenous cryogenic stage.
The NVS-02 satellite, a crucial addition to India’s Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) system, enhances the regional navigation system designed to provide precise Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) services to users in India and regions extending 1,500 km beyond its borders. The launch updates NavIC from four to five satellites, improving service reliability and performance.
NavIC offers two types of services: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS). The SPS delivers position accuracy of better than 20 meters and timing accuracy of better than 40 nanoseconds across its service area.

Title: Helicopter crash that killed Leicester soccer club owner was accidental, inquest finds
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 05:49:32 +0000
Content: The deaths of five people in a helicopter crash at the King Power Stadium in October 2018, including Leicester City soccer club owner Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, were accidental, an inquest jury concluded on Tuesday.
Vichai, the Thai tycoon who pumped millions of pounds into the club that famously won the Premier League title in 2015-16, was killed along with four others when his helicopter crashed in the club’s car park and exploded after a match on Oct. 27, 2018.
The Leonardo AW169 helicopter had cleared the top of the stadium before starting to spin, and plummeted to the ground before bursting into flames.
The crash also killed pilot Eric Swaffer, his partner Izabela Lechowicz, and Vichai’s staff members Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punparev. The inquest lasted two-and-a-half weeks.
Philip Shepherd, the Vichai family’s legal representative, said Swaffer was a “highly competent and very experienced pilot who did everything in his power” to control the helicopter when the tail rotor failed shortly after takeoff.
Vichai’s family are actively continuing their legal action against Italian defence company Leonardo, the manufacturer of the helicopter. Leonardo said this month that it would defend itself against the High Court claim.
The family is seeking compensation for loss of earnings and other damages, valued at 2.15 billion pounds ($2.67 billion) — the largest fatal accident claim in English legal history.
‘IT WASN’T SAFE’
“My father trusted in the design of this helicopter. It was Leonardo’s responsibility to make sure the helicopter was safe. It wasn’t safe. It was a death trap,” said Khun Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the son of Vichai.
“My family are thankful to Senior Coroner (Catherine) Mason for her inquest which has shone a spotlight on what happened on 27 October 2018.”
According to Forbes magazine, Vichai was the fifth-richest person in Thailand at the time of his death with an estimated net worth of $4.9 billion.
Leonardo said on Tuesday that it agreed with the inquest jury’s conclusion that this crash was a “tragic accident”.
“As the jury recorded, the aircraft had all the relevant airworthiness certificates,” Leonardo told Reuters.
“This is entirely consistent with the evidence provided to the inquest, that the helicopter was designed and produced in accordance with all regulatory requirements, meeting the accepted industry standard for safety.”
It expressed its deepest sympathy for the victims of the crash, saying their deaths were “an unquestionable tragedy”.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) ruled in 2023 that it was not possible for the pilot to recover from the tail rotor failure.
The pilot had managed to land softly enough for four of the five people on board to survive the impact, according to post-mortem examinations, only for them to be killed by fire.
Investigators found that problems with the bearing in the tail rotor of the helicopter began a sequence of failures leading to the crash.

Title: Trump’s freeze on US aid rings alarm bells from Thailand to Ukraine
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:56:54 +0000
Content: Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps, landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering from diseases such as HIV are among the programs facing the chop as President Donald Trump contemplates massive cuts to U.S. foreign aid.
Trump last week paused development assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development for 90 days to assess compatibility with his “America First” policy, setting alarm bells ringing among aid groups around the world that depend on U.S. largesse.
Humanitarian organisations and U.N. agencies say they could face drastic curbs on their ability to distribute food, shelter and healthcare if the freeze becomes permanent.
The U.S. is by far the biggest contributor to global humanitarian aid, supplying an estimated $13.9 billion in 2024, accounting for 42% of all aid tracked by the United Nations.
Clinics at camps in Thailand providing shelter for about 100,000 refugees from Myanmar were ordered to shut after the U.S. froze funding to the International Rescue Committee, according to a senior aid worker.
Washington said it would grant waivers to the freeze in some areas including emergency food assistance, according to a memo seen by Reuters. Bangladesh’s government said in a statement that the U.S. had granted a waiver for emergency food aid to more than a million Rohingya refugees sheltering in Bangladesh.
But the exemption does not apply to other humanitarian programming. A Bangladesh-based aid worker said organisations working on shelter, for example, would not be able to buy new materials for building and fixing homes for refugees.
The cuts will also affect the supply of lifesaving drugs for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis around the globe, which millions of people depend on, according to another memo seen by Reuters.
On Tuesday, contractors and partners who work with USAID began receiving such memos to stop work immediately.
‘CATASTROPHIC’
“This is catastrophic,” said Atul Gawande, former head of global health at USAID who left the agency this month. “Donated drug supplies keeping 20 million people living with HIV alive. That stops today.”
The cuts will affect organisations working with 6.5 million orphans and vulnerable children with HIV in 23 countries, Gawande said.
World Food Program Country Director for Afghanistan Hsiao-Wei Lee told Reuters she was concerned about the freeze given that the WFP was already only receiving about half the aid it needed for Afghanistan, and that over 6 million people were surviving on “just bread and tea”.
The WFP received $4.7 billion from the U.S. last year, accounting for 54% of its funding, according to the U.N.
Some NGOs are resorting to donations from the public to fund the shortfall caused by the freeze. The Freeland Foundation, a counter-trafficking group in Bangkok, has started a GoFundMe to get it through the 90-day freeze.
“Two days ago, the new Trump administration suddenly froze all foreign aid, including our wildlife protection programs,” the group said. “Poachers and traffickers will not freeze their operations. Can you help us keep our frontline teams going for 90 days until the freeze is lifted?”
The order to freeze funding has thrown USAID missions and their partners into chaos, with many organisations unsure whether to lay off staff, start selling assets such as cars or tell employees to take unpaid leave, according to a source at the agency. USAID has been forbidden from communicating with implementing partners except to say funds have been paused, the person said.
“These are people we work with on a daily basis,” the source added. “We can’t speak with them any more.”
Other agencies said they would be unaffected by the freeze. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh said the agency didn’t receive funding from USAID.
Independent media outlets that receive external funding in countries with authoritarian governments may struggle to survive, say media freedom activists.
In Georgia, where a “foreign agents law” passed last year established punitive fines for NGOs that fail to declare receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas, Shalva Papuashvili, speaker of parliament from the Georgian Dream ruling party, welcomed the U.S. aid freeze.
“I was pleasantly surprised when Trump’s executive order was based on the fact that international assistance, in some cases, is used to create certain… chaos on the ground, including harming U.S. interests,” he was quoted as saying by Georgian media.
LANDMINES AND EDUCATION
In 2023, the U.S. was the largest landmine action donor with a total contribution of $310 million, representing 39% of all international support, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Syria, Myanmar, Ukraine and Afghanistan were among the countries where uncleared mines claim most lives.
The State Department said on Sunday that the U.S. government must refocus on American national interests in its role as steward of taxpayer dollars.
“President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people. Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative,” the State Department said.
Oksana Matiiash, board chair at Teach for Ukraine, an NGO that trains graduates and specialists as teachers to improve the education system, said there was growing panic in Ukraine’s NGO sector.
“It’s not just funding that’s frozen. Behind every grant are real people working in unimaginable conditions,” Matiiash wrote on LinkedIn.

Title: Zelenskiy urges Trump to be on Ukraine’s side, says Putin not afraid of Europe
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:53:28 +0000
Content: Ukraine needed broader security guarantees and Russian President Vladimir Putin was not afraid of Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Fox News in an interview in which he urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be on Ukraine’s side.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT
Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, has promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war soon, without saying how. Aides have suggested that a deal could take months. Trump has expressed willingness to speak to Putin about ending the war, a contrast with the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden, who shunned the Russian leader.
Trump’s election win in November had sparked hope of a diplomatic resolution to end Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine that began in Feb. 2022, but it also led to fears in Kyiv that a quick peace deal could come at a high price for Ukraine.
KEY QUOTES
“We want him (Trump) to be on the side of justice, on the side of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said in the interview aired on Tuesday night. “Putin is not afraid of Europe.”
Zelenskiy added Ukraine cannot recognize Russia’s occupation, but it preferred a diplomatic resolution.
The White House had no immediate comment.
CONTEXT
After the Russian invasion began, the United States under Biden committed over $175 billion in aid for Ukraine, including over $60 billion in security assistance. It was uncertain if the aid would continue at that pace under Trump.

Title: White House bans federal support for child gender transition procedures
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:50:07 +0000
Content: The White House has issued an executive order prohibiting federal funding and support for child gender-transition procedures, citing concerns over irreversible consequences and potential long-term harm.
The administration has described such medical interventions as “chemical and surgical mutilation” under the “radical and false claim that a child’s sex can be changed.” The order argues that children subjected to these procedures may face permanent sterilization and lifelong health complications.
Highlighting the alleged regrets of some individuals who underwent these treatments as minors, the order claims many eventually realize the “horrifying tragedy” of being unable to conceive or breastfeed. It mandates federal agencies to rigorously enforce laws that limit such procedures.
The directive defines “child” as anyone under 19 and categorizes puberty blockers, hormone treatments, and surgeries as forms of “chemical and surgical mutilation,” often branded as “gender-affirming care.” The administration criticized guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), labeling it as lacking “scientific integrity.” Federal agencies have been ordered to withdraw or amend any policies relying on WPATH’s guidance.
Furthermore, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) must review existing literature on gender dysphoria in children and improve data collection on medical transitions involving minors. The order also calls for an end to federal grants for institutions performing these procedures.
The Department of Defense is directed to exclude such treatments from TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program. Similarly, federal employee health plans must eliminate coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries and hormone treatments, with instructions to reduce insurance premiums accordingly.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has been tasked with enforcing protections against female genital mutilation and investigating potential fraud related to gender-transition procedures. The Attorney General has been directed to work with Congress to propose legislation allowing individuals who underwent these treatments as minors to seek legal recourse, including an extended statute of limitations.
The executive order underscores compliance timelines, requiring agency heads to report progress within 60 days. It includes a severability clause, ensuring that if any part of the order is deemed invalid, the remainder will remain effective.

Content: The domestic benchmark indices opened higher on Wednesday for the second day in a row, as investors look forward to positive cues in the upcoming Union Budget 2025–26.
As of 9.33 a.m., Sensex was up 195 points or 0.29 per cent at 76,122 while Nifty 50 was up 65 points or 0.29 per cent at 23,025.
According to market watchers, the US Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday (US time) is unlikely to influence the market since no change in policy is expected from the meeting.
On Tuesday, the benchmark indices had their best session since January 2.
Shrikant Chouhan, head, equity research, Kotak Securities, said that after a promising start, the market bounced back sharply.
“However, profit booking was again witnessed at higher levels. On the daily chart, a long-legged doji candlestick structure is formed, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. We believe 23,150/76,300 would act as the trend decider level for the bulls,” he mentioned.
Above 23,150/76,600, the market may retest the levels of 23,250/76,900 to 23,350/77,200.
In early trade, Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Auto and Tata Consultancy Services added to the Nifty 50 index.
On NSE, 10 sectoral indices rose, and two declined out of 12. The NSE Media rose the most and the NSE FMCG declined the most. Broader markets outperformed benchmark indices. The BSE Midcap and Small-cap were up 0.89 per cent and 1.04 per cent, respectively.
On BSE, 19 sectors advanced and two declined out of 21. The BSE IT rose the most, and BSE FMCG declined the most.
The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 48,500, followed by 48,200 and 47,900. If the index advances further, 49,000 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 49,300 and 49,600, said experts.
The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 4,920.69 crore on January 28. On the other hand, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth Rs 6,814.33 crore on the same day.

Title: ISRO marks 100th mission with successful launch of navigation satellite
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:14:22 +0000
Content: India’s space agency, ISRO, celebrated a historic milestone on Wednesday morning with the launch of its 100th mission. 
A Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) lifted off from the Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh at 6:23 a.m., carrying the NVS-02 navigation satellite into orbit. 
Announcing the success, ISRO said on X: “LIFTOFF! The GSLV-F15 has successfully taken flight, carrying NVS-02 into its planned orbit. Stay tuned for more mission updates!”
Union Minister of State for Science and Technology, Dr. Jitendra Singh, hailed the mission as a “historic moment,” congratulating ISRO “for achieving the landmark milestone.”
In a post on X, Singh said: “It’s a privilege to be associated with the Department of Space at the historic moment of this record feat.”
He added: “From a humble beginning by Vikram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan and few others, it has been an amazing journey. And a quantum leap after PM Sh@narendramodi “unlocked” the Space sector and instilled the confidence that “sky is Not the limit”.
The GSLV-F15 flight is the 17th mission of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and the 11th successful mission using an indigenous cryogenic stage. This flight also marks the 8th operational flight of GSLV featuring the indigenous cryogenic stage.
The NVS-02 satellite is a crucial addition to India’s Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) system, a regional navigation satellite system designed to provide precise Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) services to users in India and regions up to 1,500 km beyond its borders. 
This launch updates India’s Regional Navigation Satellite System from four to five satellites, enhancing service reliability and performance.
“The NVS-02 satellite is the second generation of NavIC satellites, featuring a standard I-2K bus platform. It will have a lift-off mass of 2,250 kg, power handling capability of around 3 kW, navigation payload in L1, L5, and S bands, ranging payload in C-band and will be positioned at 111.75 degrees E, replacing IRNSS-1E,” ISRO said.
NavIC will offer two types of services: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS). The SPS delivers position accuracy of better than 20 meters and timing accuracy of better than 40 nanoseconds across its service area.

Title: Cricket-England win in Rajkot to stay alive in T20 series v India
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:02:39 +0000
Content: England secured a 26-run victory over India in the third T20 International on Tuesday as some sprightly bowling kept the tourists alive in the five-match series against the world champions.
Put into bat, England posted a modest 171-9 with Ben Duckett (51) and Liam Livingstone (43) providing major contributions.
India spinner Varun Chakravarthy claimed 5-24 but the English bowlers made their own mark and restricted their hosts to 145-9 to deny India an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series.
Beaten comprehensively in Kolkata and narrowly in Chennai, England had to win at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in what is their first series under Brendon McCullum as their white-ball coach.
India seamer Hardik Pandya dismissed Phil Salt in his first over but Duckett and England captain Jos Buttler (24) propped up England with a 76-run stand.
An in-form Chakravarthy continued to torment the England batters and dismissed Buttler caught behind to trigger a batting collapse.
Buttler was initially adjudged not out but wicketkeeper Sanju Samson convinced India captain Suryakumar Yadav to review the decision, which was overturned after replays confirmed the batter had gloved the ball.
Duckett raced to a 26-ball fifty but fell soon after to Axar Patel’s left-arm spin.
Chakravarthy dismissed Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton with successive deliveries but a hat-trick eluded him.
Realising he was running out of partners, Livingstone counter-attacked hitting spinner Ravi Bishnoi for three sixes in an over.
For India, seamer Mohammed Shami conceded 25 runs in his three tidy, though wicketless, overs on his return to international cricket after a year on the sidelines with an ankle injury.
Jofra Archer (2-33) dismissed Samson in his second over and then took a tumbling catch to remove the other India opener Abhishek Sharma, who made 24 and was looking dangerous.
Mark Wood got rid of Suryakumar and Adil Rashid sent back Tilak Varma to put England in charge.
Pandya kept India’s hopes alive with a defiant 40 but his dismissal in the 19th over effectively sealed the match in England’s favour.
The teams move to Pune for the penultimate T20 on Friday.

Title: Know why Italy’s PM Meloni got caught up in Libyan war crimes case
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:55:29 +0000
Content: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been placed under investigation over a government decision to release a Libyan police officer wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Here is the background to the case and a look at what might happen next.
WHO IS THE LIBYAN AT THE CENTRE OF THE SCANDAL?
Osama Elmasry Njeem is a brigadier general in Libya’s Judicial Police. The ICC says he was also in charge of Tripoli prisons. In a Jan. 22 statement, the ICC said Njeem was suspected of “crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, torture, rape and sexual violence, allegedly committed in Libya from February 2015 onwards”. A number of his alleged victims are believed to have been migrants.
The ICC said he was assisted by the Special Deterrence Force, one of Tripoli’s main armed factions.
Njeem has not publicly commented on the allegations made against him.
WHY DID ITALY ARREST HIM?
ICC documents show that its prosecutors sought an arrest warrant under seal on Oct. 2, 2024. It was only granted by judges on Jan. 18. At that point, the court knew Njeem was in Italy to watch a soccer match between Juventus and AC Milan, having spent almost two weeks prior in Germany, France and Belgium. The court informed Italian authorities and Njeem was arrested at his Turin hotel early on Jan. 19.
WHY DID ITALY LET HIM GO?
The government abruptly freed him on Jan. 21 on procedural grounds because the police who arrested him had failed to inform the justice ministry, officials have said. However, a legal source told Reuters this was a mere technicality and could easily have been overcome. Njeem was immediately put on a government jet and flown to Tripoli. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has said this was done because of his “social dangerousness”. Critics have suggested the government freed him because it relies on Libyan security forces to slow the flow of boat migrants and did not want to antagonise them by arresting such a high profile figure. The government has denied this.
WHO MADE THE DECISION TO FREE HIM?
Interior Minister Piantedosi said last week Rome’s appeals court ordered Njeem’s release because they considered his arrest non-compliant with procedures. However, it is inconceivable such a move would have been taken without government guidance. That said, there is nothing to indicate Meloni herself was involved in the decision — she was in Washington for U.S. President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration when the case was under review.
WHY DID ROME PROSECUTORS GET INVOLVED?
A Rome lawyer, Luigi Li Gotti, last week lodged a short complaint with local prosecutors asking for an investigation into alleged favouritism towards Njeem and alleged misuse of public funds to fly him to Libya on a state plane. He singled out Meloni, Piantedosi, Justice Minister Carlo Nordio and the cabinet undersecretary for intelligence matters, Alfredo Mantovano. Li Gotti provided no evidence of wrongdoing but attached press clippings about the case. Under Italian law, it is standard for prosecutors to open an investigation following such a request, unless they regard it as manifestly unfounded.
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT SO CROSS?
Ministers believe there was no reason to open an investigation. Meloni supporters accused Rome’s chief prosecutor of politicising the case and say it is part of a broader battle pitting magistrates against the government over planned judicial reform that will shake up Italy’s creaking legal system.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Rome prosecutors have sent the investigation documents to the Court of Ministers, which has judges who are drawn by lot. They have the power to investigate ministers, question them and seek state documents. The court has 90 days to make its findings. At that point it can decide whether to dismiss proceedings or send the documents back to the prosecutor’s office recommending that the case proceeds. If, ultimately, the prosecution seeks a trial, parliament would vote on whether or not to allow it. Meloni has a strong majority in both chambers.

Title: Cabinet approves revised ethanol procurement prices
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:47:19 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the revision of ethanol procurement prices for public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for the Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2024-25. The period extends from November 1, 2024, to October 31, 2025, under the Government of India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme.
The ex-mill price of ethanol derived from C Heavy Molasses (CHM) has been increased from ₹56.58 to ₹57.97 per litre, marking a 3% rise. The revision aims to ensure adequate ethanol supply to achieve higher blending targets, stabilize ethanol prices, and provide a remunerative rate for ethanol producers. Additionally, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and transportation charges will remain payable separately to support sugarcane farmers.
The EBP Programme, which promotes blending ethanol with petrol to reduce crude oil imports and combat environmental pollution, has shown remarkable progress. Ethanol blending by public sector OMCs surged from 38 crore litres in ESY 2013-14 to 707 crore litres in ESY 2023-24, achieving an average blending rate of 14.60%.
Over the past decade, this initiative has led to an estimated foreign exchange saving of over ₹1,13,007 crore and crude oil substitution of approximately 193 lakh metric tonnes. The government has advanced its target of achieving 20% ethanol blending from 2030 to ESY 2025-26, with plans to reach 18% blending during ESY 2024-25.
To support this transition, several measures have been implemented, including the enhancement of ethanol distillation capacity to 1,713 crore litres per annum and the establishment of Dedicated Ethanol Plants (DEPs) in deficit states. Other steps include promoting multi-feed distilleries, facilitating the availability of E-100 and E-20 fuels, and launching flex-fuel vehicles.
The government emphasized that these initiatives align with the broader objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat and ease of doing business, driving investments in greenfield and brownfield distilleries, logistics facilities, and employment opportunities across the country. The EBP Programme is expected to yield substantial environmental benefits, forex savings, and prompt payments to cane farmers.

Title: GCCs propel record office leasing in India, set to surpass 2,500 units in 3-4 years
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:30 +0000
Content: Global Capability Centres (GCCs) drove record-breaking office leasing activity in India, accounting for 36 percent of the total 77.2 million square feet leased in 2024, according to a report released on Wednesday.
GCCs are fully owned and integrated hubs typically established in talent-rich locations to build significant value and intellectual property (IP) using collaborative, distributed teams.
GCCs alone leased 28 million square feet last year, marking a historic high and a 15.2 percent increase, further solidifying their dominance in India’s commercial real estate sector.
As of December 2024, India had over 1,950 GCC units, with projections indicating this number will exceed 2,500 in the next three to four years. Bengaluru remains the epicenter of this growth, playing a key role in shaping the country’s office market, according to the JLL report.
Leasing activity across the top seven cities surged to an all-time high of 77.2 million square feet in 2024, reflecting a 22.6 percent year-on-year growth from 63 million square feet in 2023.
GCCs, a driving force behind this expansion, have accounted for 40 percent of total office leasing activity between 2016 and 2024, underscoring their significance in India’s evolving corporate landscape.
“This trend reinforces India’s position as the ‘office to the world’ and highlights a strong trajectory for sustained economic expansion and innovation in the coming years,” said Dr. Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research and REIS, India, JLL.
Bengaluru continues to lead as India’s premier GCC hub, leveraging its well-established ecosystem to attract further investments and workforce expansion. In 2024, the city captured 47 percent of total GCC leasing demand nationwide, reaffirming its leadership in the sector.
Hyderabad has also emerged as a strong contender, positioning itself as a strategic expansion destination for global firms. Meanwhile, Chennai has recorded the highest growth in GCC activity over the past three years, driven by its thriving talent and innovation ecosystem.
“Momentum remained strong in Delhi NCR and Pune as well. The expansion of GCCs across key cities underscores their deep understanding of India’s tech landscape and their strategic approach to talent acquisition,” the report noted.

Title: RBI may take growth-oriented measures in February policy review: Jefferies
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:10:46 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) upcoming monetary policy committee meeting in February could focus on supporting economic growth, according to brokerage firm Jefferies.
Jefferies said that the central bank’s policies might take a growth-supportive turn, particularly as the government is expected to adopt a tight fiscal stance in its budget on February 1.
A recent move by the RBI to provide liquidity was cited as a positive indicator. The central bank announced that it would inject Rs 1.5 lakh crore liquidity into the banking system until the end of February.
Jefferies observed that if the committee, led by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, adopts a more accommodative stance on liquidity or interest rates, the rupee could see further depreciation.
The brokerage firm expressed a cautious outlook on the budget due to an anticipated slowdown in government capital expenditure. However, it noted that stock market corrections have already accounted for these concerns. With revenue collections at a high base and the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, significant spending growth is unlikely.
Regarding the slowdown in economic growth, Jefferies suggested that most contributing factors are temporary. The March quarter is expected to see improvement as underspending in the first eight months of fiscal 2025 could reverse between November 2024 and March 2025. A potential improvement in liquidity and regulatory measures could contribute to an uptick in economic activity in the coming months.
Jefferies also pointed out rising pressure to increase expenditure on social welfare schemes and speculations about a potential hike in corporate taxes. If neither materializes, the market may react positively.
In its previous monetary policy review on December 6, the RBI reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent, making more funds available for lending while keeping the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. This CRR cut infused Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system to bring down market interest rates and support economic activity.
On Monday, the RBI announced an additional Rs 1.10 lakh crore liquidity injection through open market purchase auctions of government securities and a variable rate repo auction. A $5 billion dollar-rupee swap auction is also planned to enhance liquidity. These measures aim to provide banks with more funds for lending and reduce interest rates to support economic growth amid geopolitical uncertainties.

The Nifty IT index recorded a gain of 2.62 per cent, supported by stocks such as Persistent Systems and LTIMindtree. Other sectors, including Auto, Healthcare, Financial Services, Realty, and Banking, also recorded gains of up to 2.91 per cent.
The India VIX index, which measures market volatility, rose by 2.44 per cent to 18.64 points. Experts noted that the market structure indicates a cautious but positive outlook, with sustained movement above resistance levels required for further momentum.
Gold prices remained steady, trading around $2,760 in Comex and Rs 80,450 in MCX, as investors awaited the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision.

Content: World number six Novak Djokovic has pulled out of Serbia’s Davis Cup first-round qualifying tie due to injury, the country’s tennis federation (TSS) said.
Djokovic, who was set to represent Serbia in their Jan. 31-Feb. 2 meeting with Denmark in Copenhagen, retired due to a hamstring injury in his Australian Open semi-final match against Alexander Zverev last week.
The 24-times Grand Slam champion was booed by the crowd at Melbourne Park and he responded by posting a photo of an MRI taken of his left hamstring with the caption: “Thought I’d leave this here for all the sports injury ‘experts’ out there.”
Djokovic, 37, was part of the Serbian team which lifted the Davis Cup in 2010 following a memorable victory over France in Belgrade.
“We are weakened by not playing Novak, but we are still going for the win. The Danes have a great player in Holger Rune, but our players are also great and I believe in my team,” Serbia captain Viktor Troicki said.

Title: India approves ‘National Critical Mineral Mission’ to boost self-reliance and secure key resources
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 10:52:53 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the launch of the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) with an expenditure of ₹16,300 crore and an expected investment of ₹18,000 crore by public sector undertakings (PSUs) and other stakeholders. The initiative aims to strengthen India’s self-reliance in the critical mineral sector, a key component of the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision.
Recognizing the essential role of critical minerals in high-tech industries, clean energy, and defense, the government has undertaken several initiatives over the past two years to address sectoral challenges. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the mission in the Union Budget 2024-25.
The NCMM will cover all stages of the value chain, including exploration, mining, processing, and recycling. It aims to fast-track domestic exploration, streamline regulatory approvals, and provide financial incentives. The mission will also encourage PSUs and private companies to acquire mineral assets abroad, develop a strategic stockpile, and establish mineral processing parks.
Reforms to boost the sector include amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and the auction of 24 strategic mineral blocks. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has intensified exploration, with 195 ongoing projects in FY 2024-25 and 227 planned for FY 2025-26.
In a bid to foster innovation, the Ministry of Mines launched the Science and Technology – Promotion of Research and Innovation in Startups and MSMEs (S&T PRISM) program in 2023, providing funding to bridge the gap between research and commercialization. Moreover, Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL), a joint venture under the ministry, has acquired 15,703 hectares in Argentina’s Catamarca province for lithium exploration and mining.
The government has also removed customs duties on most critical minerals in the Union Budget 2024-25 to improve domestic availability and encourage local processing.

Content: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday expressed condolences over the stampede at Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, where at least 30 people lost their lives and 60 sustained injuries. Officials confirmed that 25 bodies had been identified, while efforts were ongoing to identify the remaining victims.
Speaking to the media, Adityanath said that the state government has been in continuous contact with the administration since the incident occurred. He announced financial assistance of Rs 25 lakh for the families of the deceased and confirmed that security forces, including the Mela Authority, police, NDRF, SDRF, and other agencies, had been deployed at the site.
A judicial commission will investigate the incident and submit its report to the state government within a set timeframe. The Chief Secretary and Director General of Police (DGP) will visit Prayagraj to assess the situation.
Describing the sequence of events, Adityanath said that a large number of devotees had gathered in Prayagraj since the previous evening to take a holy dip on Mauni Amavasya. The stampede occurred on Akhara Marg when the crowd broke the barricades, resulting in casualties and injuries. He confirmed that 36 injured individuals were receiving treatment in Prayagraj.
Following the incident, a green corridor was created to facilitate the immediate transfer of injured persons to the hospital. Adityanath acknowledged that the incident took place during the main ‘snan’ of Maha Kumbh, leading to congested routes in the city. The administration had been working to ease the situation since the previous night.
A three-member judicial commission will oversee the investigation, chaired by Justice Harsh Kumar, with former DG VK Gupta and retired IAS officer DK Singh as members. Adityanath noted that meetings were held throughout the day, with continuous communication between state officials and the administration. He also stated that guidance had been received from the Prime Minister, Home Minister, BJP National President JP Nadda, Railway Minister, and other officials.

Title: Stage-III GRAP implemented in Delhi as air quality reaches ‘severe’ category
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:24:14 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has implemented Stage-III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect, following a deterioration in air quality to the ‘severe’ category.
According to an official order, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 276 on January 28, 2025, and rose to 365 by 4:00 PM on January 29, 2025. The increase has been attributed to variable wind direction, calm conditions, smog, low mixing heights, and reduced ventilation for pollutant dispersion. Forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) indicate similar conditions in the coming days.
The order states that Stage-III measures are to be implemented when the AQI exceeds 350 as a precautionary step. If the AQI crosses 400, Stage-IV measures will be reintroduced. All implementing agencies have been directed to maintain strict vigilance and intensify measures under the existing GRAP schedule. Residents have been urged to adhere to the citizen charter outlined for Stage-III.
Delhi’s AQI was recorded at 327 at 8:00 AM on Wednesday, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Tuesday, the air quality was categorized as ‘poor’ with an AQI of 258.
The AQI classification system defines levels as follows: 0-50 (good), 51-100 (satisfactory), 101-200 (moderate), 201-300 (poor), 301-400 (very poor), and 401-500 (severe).

Title: Know why Italy’s PM Meloni got caught up in Libyan war crimes case
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:55:29 +0000
Content: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been placed under investigation over a government decision to release a Libyan police officer wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Here is the background to the case and a look at what might happen next.
WHO IS THE LIBYAN AT THE CENTRE OF THE SCANDAL?
Osama Elmasry Njeem is a brigadier general in Libya’s Judicial Police. The ICC says he was also in charge of Tripoli prisons. In a Jan. 22 statement, the ICC said Njeem was suspected of “crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, torture, rape and sexual violence, allegedly committed in Libya from February 2015 onwards”. A number of his alleged victims are believed to have been migrants.
The ICC said he was assisted by the Special Deterrence Force, one of Tripoli’s main armed factions.
Njeem has not publicly commented on the allegations made against him.
WHY DID ITALY ARREST HIM?
ICC documents show that its prosecutors sought an arrest warrant under seal on Oct. 2, 2024. It was only granted by judges on Jan. 18. At that point, the court knew Njeem was in Italy to watch a soccer match between Juventus and AC Milan, having spent almost two weeks prior in Germany, France and Belgium. The court informed Italian authorities and Njeem was arrested at his Turin hotel early on Jan. 19.
WHY DID ITALY LET HIM GO?
The government abruptly freed him on Jan. 21 on procedural grounds because the police who arrested him had failed to inform the justice ministry, officials have said. However, a legal source told Reuters this was a mere technicality and could easily have been overcome. Njeem was immediately put on a government jet and flown to Tripoli. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has said this was done because of his “social dangerousness”. Critics have suggested the government freed him because it relies on Libyan security forces to slow the flow of boat migrants and did not want to antagonise them by arresting such a high profile figure. The government has denied this.
WHO MADE THE DECISION TO FREE HIM?
Interior Minister Piantedosi said last week Rome’s appeals court ordered Njeem’s release because they considered his arrest non-compliant with procedures. However, it is inconceivable such a move would have been taken without government guidance. That said, there is nothing to indicate Meloni herself was involved in the decision — she was in Washington for U.S. President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration when the case was under review.
WHY DID ROME PROSECUTORS GET INVOLVED?
A Rome lawyer, Luigi Li Gotti, last week lodged a short complaint with local prosecutors asking for an investigation into alleged favouritism towards Njeem and alleged misuse of public funds to fly him to Libya on a state plane. He singled out Meloni, Piantedosi, Justice Minister Carlo Nordio and the cabinet undersecretary for intelligence matters, Alfredo Mantovano. Li Gotti provided no evidence of wrongdoing but attached press clippings about the case. Under Italian law, it is standard for prosecutors to open an investigation following such a request, unless they regard it as manifestly unfounded.
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT SO CROSS?
Ministers believe there was no reason to open an investigation. Meloni supporters accused Rome’s chief prosecutor of politicising the case and say it is part of a broader battle pitting magistrates against the government over planned judicial reform that will shake up Italy’s creaking legal system.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Rome prosecutors have sent the investigation documents to the Court of Ministers, which has judges who are drawn by lot. They have the power to investigate ministers, question them and seek state documents. The court has 90 days to make its findings. At that point it can decide whether to dismiss proceedings or send the documents back to the prosecutor’s office recommending that the case proceeds. If, ultimately, the prosecution seeks a trial, parliament would vote on whether or not to allow it. Meloni has a strong majority in both chambers.

Title: New voice-based approach to enable early detection of Alzheimer’s
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:52:22 +0000
Content: Chinese researchers have introduced a groundbreaking voice-based method to address language challenges and enable early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.
The team, led by Prof. Li Hai at the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noted that with the ageing global population, Alzheimer’s is becoming increasingly prevalent, making early detection critical for improving patient outcomes.
“Language decline is often one of the earliest indicators of cognitive decline,” the experts noted in a paper published in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.
Currently, available automated speech analysis offers a non-invasive and cost-effective approach to detecting Alzheimer’s. However, these methods face significant challenges, including complexity, poor interpretability, and limited integration of diverse data types, which hinder accuracy and clinical applicability.
To address these limitations, Hai’s team developed the DEMENTIA framework.
“This innovative approach integrates speech, text, and expert knowledge using a hybrid attention mechanism, significantly enhancing both the accuracy and clinical interpretability of Alzheimer’s disease detection,” the researchers said.
The framework leverages advanced large language model technologies. It captures intricate intra- and inter-modal interactions, improving detection accuracy and enabling the prediction of cognitive function scores.
Additionally, the model scores well in comprehensive interpretability analyses, demonstrating its robust clinical decision-support capabilities and adaptability across diverse datasets.
“The findings underscore the potential of speech-based tools for early Alzheimer’s disease screening and monitoring cognitive decline,” the team said.
Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other critical mental functions. It is the most common form of dementia, constituting around 75 per cent of all dementia cases.
Of the approximately 55 million people worldwide with dementia, 60 to 70 per cent are estimated to have Alzheimer’s.

Title: Cabinet approves revised ethanol procurement prices
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:47:19 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the revision of ethanol procurement prices for public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for the Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2024-25. The period extends from November 1, 2024, to October 31, 2025, under the Government of India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme.
The ex-mill price of ethanol derived from C Heavy Molasses (CHM) has been increased from ₹56.58 to ₹57.97 per litre, marking a 3% rise. The revision aims to ensure adequate ethanol supply to achieve higher blending targets, stabilize ethanol prices, and provide a remunerative rate for ethanol producers. Additionally, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and transportation charges will remain payable separately to support sugarcane farmers.
The EBP Programme, which promotes blending ethanol with petrol to reduce crude oil imports and combat environmental pollution, has shown remarkable progress. Ethanol blending by public sector OMCs surged from 38 crore litres in ESY 2013-14 to 707 crore litres in ESY 2023-24, achieving an average blending rate of 14.60%.
Over the past decade, this initiative has led to an estimated foreign exchange saving of over ₹1,13,007 crore and crude oil substitution of approximately 193 lakh metric tonnes. The government has advanced its target of achieving 20% ethanol blending from 2030 to ESY 2025-26, with plans to reach 18% blending during ESY 2024-25.
To support this transition, several measures have been implemented, including the enhancement of ethanol distillation capacity to 1,713 crore litres per annum and the establishment of Dedicated Ethanol Plants (DEPs) in deficit states. Other steps include promoting multi-feed distilleries, facilitating the availability of E-100 and E-20 fuels, and launching flex-fuel vehicles.
The government emphasized that these initiatives align with the broader objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat and ease of doing business, driving investments in greenfield and brownfield distilleries, logistics facilities, and employment opportunities across the country. The EBP Programme is expected to yield substantial environmental benefits, forex savings, and prompt payments to cane farmers.

Title: GCCs propel record office leasing in India, set to surpass 2,500 units in 3-4 years
Publication Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:30 +0000
Content: Global Capability Centres (GCCs) drove record-breaking office leasing activity in India, accounting for 36 percent of the total 77.2 million square feet leased in 2024, according to a report released on Wednesday.
GCCs are fully owned and integrated hubs typically established in talent-rich locations to build significant value and intellectual property (IP) using collaborative, distributed teams.
GCCs alone leased 28 million square feet last year, marking a historic high and a 15.2 percent increase, further solidifying their dominance in India’s commercial real estate sector.
As of December 2024, India had over 1,950 GCC units, with projections indicating this number will exceed 2,500 in the next three to four years. Bengaluru remains the epicenter of this growth, playing a key role in shaping the country’s office market, according to the JLL report.
Leasing activity across the top seven cities surged to an all-time high of 77.2 million square feet in 2024, reflecting a 22.6 percent year-on-year growth from 63 million square feet in 2023.
GCCs, a driving force behind this expansion, have accounted for 40 percent of total office leasing activity between 2016 and 2024, underscoring their significance in India’s evolving corporate landscape.
“This trend reinforces India’s position as the ‘office to the world’ and highlights a strong trajectory for sustained economic expansion and innovation in the coming years,” said Dr. Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research and REIS, India, JLL.
Bengaluru continues to lead as India’s premier GCC hub, leveraging its well-established ecosystem to attract further investments and workforce expansion. In 2024, the city captured 47 percent of total GCC leasing demand nationwide, reaffirming its leadership in the sector.
Hyderabad has also emerged as a strong contender, positioning itself as a strategic expansion destination for global firms. Meanwhile, Chennai has recorded the highest growth in GCC activity over the past three years, driven by its thriving talent and innovation ecosystem.
“Momentum remained strong in Delhi NCR and Pune as well. The expansion of GCCs across key cities underscores their deep understanding of India’s tech landscape and their strategic approach to talent acquisition,” the report noted.
