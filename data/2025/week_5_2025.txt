It is a day of pride, reflection, and reaffirmation of our commitment to democracy, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Let us honour our freedom fighters and martyrs who made the supreme sacrifice to protect and preserve our motherland. I extend my deepest tribute to the valiant soldiers of the Indian Army, Paramilitary Forces, and Jammu and Kashmir Police, whose relentless dedication and sacrifices ensure the unity, integrity, and security of our nation. Beyond safeguarding our borders, they stand as pillars of peace and stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Their extraordinary valour and service inspire us to work towards a united, secure, and prosperous India.”
“On this momentous occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to every individual contributing to the progress of our Union Territory, farmers, artisans, teachers, healthcare workers, security forces, sportspersons and government officials.

Our journey has been one of resilience and determination, marked by unparalleled achievements in every sphere,” L-G Sinha said.

It was a proud moment for the young officer, as his father, Lt. Gen. Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area, served as the Parade Commander.
These soldiers on horseback have been a prominent feature of the Republic Day parades. Raised in 1953, the 61 Cavalry is the only serving active horsed cavalry regiment in the world, formed through the amalgamation of all the ‘State Horsed Cavalry Units.’
The regiment has the unique distinction of leading the last recorded cavalry charge in history. As part of the 15th Imperial Cavalry Brigade, it defeated the Turkish Eighth Army, leading to the capture of the strategic port of Haifa on September 23, 1918. This victory is celebrated as Haifa Day in both India and Israel. The Teen Murti Haifa Chowk in New Delhi stands as a testament to the valor and courage of the men and horses of this prestigious unit, which has earned 39 battle honors.
The parade was followed by nine mechanized columns and nine marching contingents.
The contingent of the Brigade of the Guards, attired in the resplendent colors of ‘Old Gold and Blood Red,’ proudly marched forward, commanded by Capt. Bharat Ravindra Bhardwaj of 19 Guards. The Brigade of the Guards is the senior-most infantry regiment and one of the most decorated. It holds the distinction of being the first All India, All Class Regiment of the Indian Army and was raised in 1949 as a visionary step for national integration by then Commander-in-Chief, late Field Marshal KM Cariappa, OBE.
Following them was the Jat Regiment, known for its tradition of sacrifice and its well-built contingent. Led by Captain Ajay Singh Garsa, the Jat Regiment traces its origins to 1795, when the Calcutta Militia was raised and later converted into a regular infantry battalion in 1859. Over its more than two-century-long history, the Jat Regiment has actively participated in both World War I and World War II. The regiment’s motto is ‘Sangathan Va Veerta,’ and its war cry is ‘Jat Balwan – Jai Bhagwan.’
The smart, well-turned-out, and synchronized contingent of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), led by Deputy Commandant Navita Thakran, marched down Kartavya Path. The Sentinels of Our Seas, Bharatiya Tatrakshak, stand as steadfast guardians of India’s maritime borders, embodying the very essence of discipline, resilience, and unwavering resolve.
Following this, a tableau from the ICG, focusing on coastal security and maritime search and rescue, rolled down the path. The theme was ‘Swarnim Bharat: Heritage and Progress.’

The last part of the tableau has a lifelike depiction of Kamadhenu or Surabhi. According to Indian mythology, Kamdhenu is a sacred cow, a symbol of prosperity, and fulfills all desires.
On the side of the tableau, the sacred role of indigenous cows is depicted in festivals and religious rituals; on the other hand, their economic contribution is depicted through dairy products like ghee and curd which reflects livelihood of people and their role in the Indian economy.
CPWD tableau commemorated the 75th anniversary of India’s Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949. The front features the Ashoka Chakra and a Wheel of Time, symbolising the eternal flow of life. Behind it, the Constitution is displayed as the supreme legal document declaring India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assuring justice, equality, and liberty to its citizens.
The sides of the tableau are adorned with depictions of Dr B R Ambedkar, who chaired the drafting committee for the Constitution. Live floral decorations in vibrant colours enhance the tableau’s appeal, symbolising the richness of India’s heritage and Constitutional values.
Ahead of this, President Droupadi Murmu unfurled the national flag at Kartavya Path, followed by the national anthem with a thunderous 21-gun salute using 105-mm Light Field Guns, an indigenous weapon system.
