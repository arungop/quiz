Title: MIT researchers devise process to convert skin cells directly into neurons
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:30:37 +0000
Content: Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process to convert skin cells directly into neurons, bypassing the need to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This breakthrough could lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  
Traditionally, converting a skin cell into a neuron involves first inducing it into a pluripotent stem cell state and then differentiating it into a neuron. The MIT researchers have now simplified this process by directly reprogramming skin cells into neurons.  
Working with mouse cells, the team developed a highly efficient conversion method that can generate more than 10 neurons from a single skin cell. If replicated in human cells, this approach could produce large quantities of motor neurons, potentially benefiting patients with spinal cord injuries or mobility-impairing diseases.  
“We were able to achieve yields that allow us to assess whether these cells could be viable candidates for cell replacement therapies. That’s where reprogramming technologies like this can take us,” said Katie Galloway, the WM Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at MIT.  
As an initial step toward therapeutic applications, the researchers demonstrated that the generated motor neurons could be successfully engrafted into mouse brains, where they integrated with host tissue.  
Galloway is the senior author of two papers detailing this method, published today in Cell Systems. MIT graduate student Nathan Wang is the lead author of both papers.  
The MIT team aims to further improve the efficiency of human cell conversion, which could enable large-scale neuron production for treating conditions like ALS. While clinical trials using iPSC-derived neurons to treat ALS are already underway, expanding the available number of neurons could accelerate research and therapeutic applications.  
This research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Title: Study shows how climate change affects rain and floods
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:14:40 +0000
Content: Climate change may lead to increased precipitation and more intense floods. A new study highlights the importance of distinguishing between different types of rainfall and flood events—specifically, short-term events that occur over a few hours and longer-term events that last several days. Climate change impacts each of these differently.
An Austrian research team has demonstrated for the first time that short-term precipitation and flood events, occurring over a few hours, are particularly affected by rising temperatures due to climate change.
For longer-term events, the relationship is more complex. This conclusion was drawn from detailed data collected in Austria for over a century—insights that can also be applied to other regions worldwide. The findings help determine which areas are more likely to experience flooding and how they may be affected. The results have been published in the journal Nature.
Climate change is disrupting water cycles globally, and Austria provides a particularly valuable case study. “We are fortunate to have excellent data available,” says Prof. Gunter Bloschl of TU Wien (Vienna), who led the research project. Since 1900, precipitation in Austria has been recorded by two separate institutions: the meteorological service (now Geosphere Austria) and the Austrian Hydrography, which is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
These highly reliable datasets have been analyzed through a collaboration between TU Wien, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BML), GeoSphere Austria, and the University of Graz.
The analysis revealed that short-term precipitation events lasting only a few hours have increased significantly over the past 30–40 years—by approximately 15%. “Climate models had already predicted this, though with some uncertainties. We have now confirmed it,” says Gunter Bloschl.
However, for longer-term rainfall events lasting several days, the situation differs. Global weather phenomena, such as El Niño—an ocean temperature-influenced climate process—play a more significant role in these cases. As a result, rainfall trends over longer timescales vary across regions.
For example, in the Mediterranean—particularly in parts of Italy, Spain, and Greece—prolonged periods of rainfall may become less frequent due to climate change.

Title: PM Modi congratulates RBI on winning Digital Transformation Award 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:07:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for winning the prestigious Digital Transformation Award 2025 by Central Banking, London.
PM Modi shared his appreciation on social media platform X, quoting RBI’s announcement and calling the achievement a significant milestone. He highlighted the role of digital innovation in strengthening India’s digital ecosystem and empowering millions of people across the country.
“A commendable accomplishment, reflecting a commitment to innovation and efficiency in governance,” PM Modi stated in his post. He further added, “Digital innovation continues to strengthen India’s financial ecosystem, thereby empowering countless lives.”
The RBI was honored for its groundbreaking digital initiatives, Saarathi and Pravaah, both of which were developed by the bank’s in-house tech team. These initiatives have transformed RBI’s internal and external processes, significantly reducing the need for paper-based submissions.
Saarathi, launched in January 2023, has fully digitized RBI’s internal workflow, allowing employees to securely submit and share documents. The system has improved record management, data analysis, task tracking, collaboration, and integration with other RBI systems. Prior to Saarathi, different departments relied on a mix of manual and digital processes, but the platform now serves as a unified digital repository for all the central bank’s information.
Pravaah, introduced in May 2024, is a digital platform for external users to submit regulatory applications to RBI. The documents submitted through Pravaah are automatically linked to the Saarathi database, where they are processed digitally using centralized cybersecurity systems and digital tracking.
Since its launch, Pravaah has digitized over 70 regulatory applications, benefiting nine departments within the RBI.

Title: NCB busts ₹88 crore drug racket in Northeast; no mercy for cartels, says Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 07:56:01 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance policy against drug cartels following a major crackdown on an international narcotics network in the northeast. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) successfully busted the racket in coordinated operations in Guwahati and Imphal, seizing narcotics worth ₹88 crore and arresting four individuals.
In a post on X, Shah said, “No mercy for drug cartels. Accelerating the Modi government’s march to build a drug-free Bharat, a massive consignment of methamphetamine tablets worth ₹88 crore is seized, and four members of the international drug cartel are arrested in Imphal and Guwahati zones.”
He lauded the efforts of the NCB, calling the operation a result of an effective “bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom approach” to investigation. “The drug haul is a testament to the stellar performance of this integrated strategy. Our hunt for drugs continues. Heartfelt congratulations to team NCB,” Shah added.
Inauguration of Lachit Barphukan Police Academy
In a separate event on Saturday, Amit Shah inaugurated the Lachit Barphukan Police Academy at Degaon in Assam, marking a key development in strengthening the region’s law enforcement infrastructure.
Named after the legendary Ahom general Lachit Barphukan, renowned for his leadership during the 1671 Battle of Saraighat against Mughal forces, the academy is designed to provide comprehensive, modern training to police personnel while honouring Assam’s rich history.
Speaking at the inauguration, Shah praised Lachit Barphukan’s legacy, emphasizing the general’s bravery, patriotism, and leadership. “Lachit Barphukan’s bravery is a source of inspiration for all Indians. By dedicating this police academy to his name, we are ensuring that future generations of police personnel imbibe his values of courage, integrity, and selfless service,” he said.
The academy is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including advanced classrooms, simulated law enforcement environments, cybercrime and forensic labs, physical fitness zones, and combat training areas. It aims to train hundreds of police personnel annually, enhancing Assam’s security apparatus and promoting best practices in policing across the region.

Title: Gadkari stresses need for education in Muslim community, slams caste politics
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday emphasised the crucial role of education in the upliftment of the Muslim community and strongly criticised the prevalence of caste-based politics in the country.
Speaking at the convocation ceremony of the Central India Group of Institutions in Nagpur, Gadkari said that education is the cornerstone of development and social progress. He stressed that the Muslim community, in particular, needs to focus more on educational advancement.
“In our society, the community that needs education the most is the Muslim community,” Gadkari said.
Highlighting occupational patterns, he pointed out that only a limited number of professions are currently dominant within the Muslim community. “Unfortunately, professions like running tea stalls, paan shops, scrap dealing, truck driving, and cleaning have gained prominence,” he added.
He urged members of the community to aspire for careers in engineering, medicine, and civil services. “If people from our society become engineers, doctors, IAS and IPS officers, then our society will progress. We may offer prayers in the mosque a hundred times, but without embracing science and technology, what will our future look like?” Gadkari questioned.
Drawing inspiration from former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Gadkari said, “I believe a person’s greatness is not determined by caste, sect, religion, language, or gender, but by their qualities. That is why we must not discriminate based on these identities.”
He praised Dr. Kalam’s achievements, highlighting how his contributions as a nuclear scientist brought global recognition to India.
Taking a firm stand against caste-based politics, Gadkari said he had no interest in appeasing caste leaders for electoral gains. “I am in politics, and caste leaders often come to meet me. But I am clear — I will live on my own terms, whether or not I get votes,” he asserted.
Recalling an earlier public gathering, he added, “I once told a crowd of 50,000 people, ‘Jo karega jaat ki baat, uske kass ke maarunga laat’ (I will kick hard anyone who talks about caste).”
The Union Minister reiterated that education is not merely a tool for individual benefit but a driving force behind societal and national progress. “Education does not just benefit you and your family. It uplifts society and the nation. Knowledge is power, and imbibing this power must be your mission,” he concluded.

Title: FIIs selling declines in Indian market, expected to stabilise next quarter: experts
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:11:58 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling in India continues in early March, but the intensity of the sell-off is gradually declining as stock market valuations become more reasonable, according to experts.
As of March 14, FIIs have sold equity worth ₹30,015 crore this month, taking the total equity sold in CY 2025 so far to ₹1,42,616 crore.
In contrast, FIIs have turned buyers in the debt segment in March. The total buying figure for debt (general category plus VRR) stood at ₹7,029 crore so far this month, say market watchers.
However, experts noted that heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing trade war between the US and other nations is likely to push more investments towards safe asset classes such as gold and the US dollar.
Shridatta Bhandwaldar, Head of Equities at Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, highlighted that FIIs have been significant sellers in the Indian equity market over the past three months, with outflows amounting to $15–20 billion.
“However, as the initial shocks subside, we expect FII flows to at least stabilise in the next quarter and eventually turn positive over time,” he said.
“For this to materialise, though, our corporate earnings will need to show substantial improvement from current levels. We believe the slowdown in earnings growth is more cyclical than structural, noting that a similar trend was observed in FY23,” he added.
Valuations for the Nifty index are already below its 10-year average for one-year forward earnings.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets remained largely range-bound last week, ending slightly lower amid mixed global cues and investor caution.
The benchmark indices experienced mild corrections as concerns over global trade policies and sector-specific sell-offs weighed on market sentiment.
Analysts expect volatility to persist in the upcoming sessions as investors monitor global developments, particularly economic data releases from the US Federal Reserve and domestic macroeconomic indicators.
Market experts pointed out that the 22,250–22,650 range remains a crucial technical zone for the Nifty 50. A breakout in either direction could determine the market’s trajectory in the near term.

Title: Astronaut crew docks with space station to replace ‘Butch and Suni’
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:50:12 +0000
Content: A SpaceX capsule delivered four astronauts to the International Space Station early on Sunday in a NASA crew-swap mission that will allow a pair of stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to return home after nine months on the orbiting lab.
About 29 hours since launching at 7:03 p.m. ET on Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Crew-10 astronauts’ SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked to the ISS at 12:04 a.m. ET (0404 GMT) on Sunday.
They were welcomed by the station’s seven-member crew, which includes Wilmore and Williams – veteran NASA astronauts and retired Navy test pilots who have remained on the station after problems with Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule forced NASA to bring it back empty.
Otherwise a routine crew rotation flight, the Crew-10 mission is a long-awaited first step to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth – part of a plan set by NASA last year that has been given greater urgency by President Donald Trump since he took office in January.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to depart the ISS on Wednesday as early as 4 a.m. ET (0800 GMT), along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
Hague and Gorbunov flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams, and that craft has been attached to the station since.
The Crew-10 crew, scheduled to stay on the station for roughly six months, includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.
The crew-swap mission became entangled in politics as Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, urged a quicker Crew-10 launch. They claimed, without evidence, that Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had abandoned Wilmore and Williams on the station for political reasons.
Having seen their mission turn into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the other five astronauts.
Williams told reporters this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. “It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” she said.

Title: Who are Yemen’s Houthis and why are they under attack by the US?
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:43:18 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has launched the biggest military operation in the Middle East since taking office against Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis after they resumed Red Sea shipping attacks.
The strikes, which have killed at least 24 people so far, could last for weeks according to one U.S. official and come as Trump ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HOUTHIS?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in the far north of Yemen set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shi’ite Islam, which had once ruled Yemen, but whose northern heartland had became impoverished and marginalized.
As friction with the government in the capital Sanaa grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia.
WHO IS THE HOUTHI LEADER?
Abdul Malik al-Houthi created the defiant force challenging world powers from a group of ragtag mountain fighters in sandals. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement.
Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.
Al-Houthi is known for rarely staying long in one place, for never meeting the media and for extreme reluctance to make scheduled public appearances.
HOW DID THE HOUTHIS COME TO CONTROL MUCH OF YEMEN?
A civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. Worried by the growing influence of Shi’ite Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia led a Western-backed coalition in March 2015, which intervened in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other large population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in the port city of Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a U.N.-led peace push, but a sharp escalation in regional tensions since the start of the Gaza war has increased risks of a new conflict between the militia and Riyadh.
WHY ATTACK SHIPS?
The Houthis have waded into the Gaza conflict with attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea as a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
They have also claimed attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the United States and Britain, shipping industry sources say all ships were at risk.
The U.S. and Britain had retaliated with air strikes against the Houthis as part of international efforts to restore the free flow of trade along a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15% of the world’s shipping traffic.
A period of relative calm started in January alongside the Gaza ceasefire but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval operations if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza.
The Houthis then announced on March 12 a resumption of attacks with immediate effect.
WHAT ARE THE HOUTHIS’ LINKS WITH IRAN?
The Houthis are part of what has been called the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance of regional militias including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, backed by Iran.
The Houthis’ slogan is “Death to America, Death to Israel, curse the Jews and victory to Islam”.
The Saudi-led coalition accuses Tehran of arming and training the Houthis, a charge both deny. The coalition also says Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah is helping the Houthis, an accusation it rejects.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Houthis deny being puppets of Iran, and Yemen experts say they are motivated primarily by a domestic agenda.

Title: Russia, Ukraine continue air attacks with ceasefire prospects uncertain
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:16:33 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine continued aerial attacks on each other, inflicting injuries and damages, officials said early on Sunday, as the fate of a proposed ceasefire to the three-year-old war remained uncertain.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Both sides have since traded heavy aerial strikes, and Russia moved closer on battlefield to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
Early on Sunday, three people were injured, including a 7-year-old, in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.
Two of them were injured after a drone hit their house, sparking a fire in the Gubkinsky district of the region, while the other person was injured in a drone attack on the village of Dolgoye, Gladkov said.
Alexander Gusev, governor of the southwestern Russia region of Voronezh, said on Telegram that air defence units had destroyed more than 15 Ukrainian drones over the region. There was no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Gusev said.
The acting governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov said defence units repelled an overnight drone attack on the region, with no injuries or damage reported.
In Ukraine, authorities reported several Russian drone strikes, including on the northern region of Chernihiv, where firefighters were battling a blaze at a high-rise building that was sparked by Russian drone attack, Ukraine’s state of emergency service said.
Ukrainian media reported a series of explosions in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv, after Ukraine’s air force issued warnings of a threat of drone attacks on the Kyiv and a number of other central Ukrainian regions.
By 0300 GMT on Sunday, there was no official information about potential damage in the Kyiv region.
