Title: MIT researchers devise process to convert skin cells directly into neurons
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:30:37 +0000
Content: Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process to convert skin cells directly into neurons, bypassing the need to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This breakthrough could lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  
Traditionally, converting a skin cell into a neuron involves first inducing it into a pluripotent stem cell state and then differentiating it into a neuron. The MIT researchers have now simplified this process by directly reprogramming skin cells into neurons.  
Working with mouse cells, the team developed a highly efficient conversion method that can generate more than 10 neurons from a single skin cell. If replicated in human cells, this approach could produce large quantities of motor neurons, potentially benefiting patients with spinal cord injuries or mobility-impairing diseases.  
“We were able to achieve yields that allow us to assess whether these cells could be viable candidates for cell replacement therapies. That’s where reprogramming technologies like this can take us,” said Katie Galloway, the WM Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at MIT.  
As an initial step toward therapeutic applications, the researchers demonstrated that the generated motor neurons could be successfully engrafted into mouse brains, where they integrated with host tissue.  
Galloway is the senior author of two papers detailing this method, published today in Cell Systems. MIT graduate student Nathan Wang is the lead author of both papers.  
The MIT team aims to further improve the efficiency of human cell conversion, which could enable large-scale neuron production for treating conditions like ALS. While clinical trials using iPSC-derived neurons to treat ALS are already underway, expanding the available number of neurons could accelerate research and therapeutic applications.  
This research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Title: Study shows how climate change affects rain and floods
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:14:40 +0000
Content: Climate change may lead to increased precipitation and more intense floods. A new study highlights the importance of distinguishing between different types of rainfall and flood events—specifically, short-term events that occur over a few hours and longer-term events that last several days. Climate change impacts each of these differently.
An Austrian research team has demonstrated for the first time that short-term precipitation and flood events, occurring over a few hours, are particularly affected by rising temperatures due to climate change.
For longer-term events, the relationship is more complex. This conclusion was drawn from detailed data collected in Austria for over a century—insights that can also be applied to other regions worldwide. The findings help determine which areas are more likely to experience flooding and how they may be affected. The results have been published in the journal Nature.
Climate change is disrupting water cycles globally, and Austria provides a particularly valuable case study. “We are fortunate to have excellent data available,” says Prof. Gunter Bloschl of TU Wien (Vienna), who led the research project. Since 1900, precipitation in Austria has been recorded by two separate institutions: the meteorological service (now Geosphere Austria) and the Austrian Hydrography, which is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
These highly reliable datasets have been analyzed through a collaboration between TU Wien, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BML), GeoSphere Austria, and the University of Graz.
The analysis revealed that short-term precipitation events lasting only a few hours have increased significantly over the past 30–40 years—by approximately 15%. “Climate models had already predicted this, though with some uncertainties. We have now confirmed it,” says Gunter Bloschl.
However, for longer-term rainfall events lasting several days, the situation differs. Global weather phenomena, such as El Niño—an ocean temperature-influenced climate process—play a more significant role in these cases. As a result, rainfall trends over longer timescales vary across regions.
For example, in the Mediterranean—particularly in parts of Italy, Spain, and Greece—prolonged periods of rainfall may become less frequent due to climate change.

Title: PM Modi congratulates RBI on winning Digital Transformation Award 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:07:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for winning the prestigious Digital Transformation Award 2025 by Central Banking, London.
PM Modi shared his appreciation on social media platform X, quoting RBI’s announcement and calling the achievement a significant milestone. He highlighted the role of digital innovation in strengthening India’s digital ecosystem and empowering millions of people across the country.
“A commendable accomplishment, reflecting a commitment to innovation and efficiency in governance,” PM Modi stated in his post. He further added, “Digital innovation continues to strengthen India’s financial ecosystem, thereby empowering countless lives.”
The RBI was honored for its groundbreaking digital initiatives, Saarathi and Pravaah, both of which were developed by the bank’s in-house tech team. These initiatives have transformed RBI’s internal and external processes, significantly reducing the need for paper-based submissions.
Saarathi, launched in January 2023, has fully digitized RBI’s internal workflow, allowing employees to securely submit and share documents. The system has improved record management, data analysis, task tracking, collaboration, and integration with other RBI systems. Prior to Saarathi, different departments relied on a mix of manual and digital processes, but the platform now serves as a unified digital repository for all the central bank’s information.
Pravaah, introduced in May 2024, is a digital platform for external users to submit regulatory applications to RBI. The documents submitted through Pravaah are automatically linked to the Saarathi database, where they are processed digitally using centralized cybersecurity systems and digital tracking.
Since its launch, Pravaah has digitized over 70 regulatory applications, benefiting nine departments within the RBI.

Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 07:56:01 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance policy against drug cartels following a major crackdown on an international narcotics network in the northeast. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) successfully busted the racket in coordinated operations in Guwahati and Imphal, seizing narcotics worth ₹88 crore and arresting four individuals.
In a post on X, Shah said, “No mercy for drug cartels. Accelerating the Modi government’s march to build a drug-free Bharat, a massive consignment of methamphetamine tablets worth ₹88 crore is seized, and four members of the international drug cartel are arrested in Imphal and Guwahati zones.”
He lauded the efforts of the NCB, calling the operation a result of an effective “bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom approach” to investigation. “The drug haul is a testament to the stellar performance of this integrated strategy. Our hunt for drugs continues. Heartfelt congratulations to team NCB,” Shah added.
Inauguration of Lachit Barphukan Police Academy
In a separate event on Saturday, Amit Shah inaugurated the Lachit Barphukan Police Academy at Degaon in Assam, marking a key development in strengthening the region’s law enforcement infrastructure.
Named after the legendary Ahom general Lachit Barphukan, renowned for his leadership during the 1671 Battle of Saraighat against Mughal forces, the academy is designed to provide comprehensive, modern training to police personnel while honouring Assam’s rich history.
Speaking at the inauguration, Shah praised Lachit Barphukan’s legacy, emphasizing the general’s bravery, patriotism, and leadership. “Lachit Barphukan’s bravery is a source of inspiration for all Indians. By dedicating this police academy to his name, we are ensuring that future generations of police personnel imbibe his values of courage, integrity, and selfless service,” he said.

Title: Gadkari stresses need for education in Muslim community, slams caste politics
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday emphasised the crucial role of education in the upliftment of the Muslim community and strongly criticised the prevalence of caste-based politics in the country.
Speaking at the convocation ceremony of the Central India Group of Institutions in Nagpur, Gadkari said that education is the cornerstone of development and social progress. He stressed that the Muslim community, in particular, needs to focus more on educational advancement.
“In our society, the community that needs education the most is the Muslim community,” Gadkari said.
Highlighting occupational patterns, he pointed out that only a limited number of professions are currently dominant within the Muslim community. “Unfortunately, professions like running tea stalls, paan shops, scrap dealing, truck driving, and cleaning have gained prominence,” he added.
He urged members of the community to aspire for careers in engineering, medicine, and civil services. “If people from our society become engineers, doctors, IAS and IPS officers, then our society will progress. We may offer prayers in the mosque a hundred times, but without embracing science and technology, what will our future look like?” Gadkari questioned.
Drawing inspiration from former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Gadkari said, “I believe a person’s greatness is not determined by caste, sect, religion, language, or gender, but by their qualities. That is why we must not discriminate based on these identities.”
He praised Dr. Kalam’s achievements, highlighting how his contributions as a nuclear scientist brought global recognition to India.
Taking a firm stand against caste-based politics, Gadkari said he had no interest in appeasing caste leaders for electoral gains. “I am in politics, and caste leaders often come to meet me. But I am clear — I will live on my own terms, whether or not I get votes,” he asserted.
Recalling an earlier public gathering, he added, “I once told a crowd of 50,000 people, ‘Jo karega jaat ki baat, uske kass ke maarunga laat’ (I will kick hard anyone who talks about caste).”
The Union Minister reiterated that education is not merely a tool for individual benefit but a driving force behind societal and national progress. “Education does not just benefit you and your family. It uplifts society and the nation. Knowledge is power, and imbibing this power must be your mission,” he concluded.

Title: FIIs selling declines in Indian market, expected to stabilise next quarter: experts
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:11:58 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling in India continues in early March, but the intensity of the sell-off is gradually declining as stock market valuations become more reasonable, according to experts.
As of March 14, FIIs have sold equity worth ₹30,015 crore this month, taking the total equity sold in CY 2025 so far to ₹1,42,616 crore.
In contrast, FIIs have turned buyers in the debt segment in March. The total buying figure for debt (general category plus VRR) stood at ₹7,029 crore so far this month, say market watchers.
However, experts noted that heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing trade war between the US and other nations is likely to push more investments towards safe asset classes such as gold and the US dollar.
Shridatta Bhandwaldar, Head of Equities at Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, highlighted that FIIs have been significant sellers in the Indian equity market over the past three months, with outflows amounting to $15–20 billion.
“However, as the initial shocks subside, we expect FII flows to at least stabilise in the next quarter and eventually turn positive over time,” he said.
“For this to materialise, though, our corporate earnings will need to show substantial improvement from current levels. We believe the slowdown in earnings growth is more cyclical than structural, noting that a similar trend was observed in FY23,” he added.
Valuations for the Nifty index are already below its 10-year average for one-year forward earnings.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets remained largely range-bound last week, ending slightly lower amid mixed global cues and investor caution.
The benchmark indices experienced mild corrections as concerns over global trade policies and sector-specific sell-offs weighed on market sentiment.
Analysts expect volatility to persist in the upcoming sessions as investors monitor global developments, particularly economic data releases from the US Federal Reserve and domestic macroeconomic indicators.
Market experts pointed out that the 22,250–22,650 range remains a crucial technical zone for the Nifty 50. A breakout in either direction could determine the market’s trajectory in the near term.

Title: Astronaut crew docks with space station to replace ‘Butch and Suni’
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:50:12 +0000
Content: A SpaceX capsule delivered four astronauts to the International Space Station early on Sunday in a NASA crew-swap mission that will allow a pair of stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to return home after nine months on the orbiting lab.
About 29 hours since launching at 7:03 p.m. ET on Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Crew-10 astronauts’ SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked to the ISS at 12:04 a.m. ET (0404 GMT) on Sunday.
They were welcomed by the station’s seven-member crew, which includes Wilmore and Williams – veteran NASA astronauts and retired Navy test pilots who have remained on the station after problems with Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule forced NASA to bring it back empty.
Otherwise a routine crew rotation flight, the Crew-10 mission is a long-awaited first step to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth – part of a plan set by NASA last year that has been given greater urgency by President Donald Trump since he took office in January.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to depart the ISS on Wednesday as early as 4 a.m. ET (0800 GMT), along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
Hague and Gorbunov flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams, and that craft has been attached to the station since.
The Crew-10 crew, scheduled to stay on the station for roughly six months, includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.
The crew-swap mission became entangled in politics as Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, urged a quicker Crew-10 launch. They claimed, without evidence, that Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had abandoned Wilmore and Williams on the station for political reasons.
Having seen their mission turn into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the other five astronauts.
Williams told reporters this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. “It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” she said.

Title: Who are Yemen’s Houthis and why are they under attack by the US?
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:43:18 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has launched the biggest military operation in the Middle East since taking office against Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis after they resumed Red Sea shipping attacks.
The strikes, which have killed at least 24 people so far, could last for weeks according to one U.S. official and come as Trump ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HOUTHIS?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in the far north of Yemen set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shi’ite Islam, which had once ruled Yemen, but whose northern heartland had became impoverished and marginalized.
As friction with the government in the capital Sanaa grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia.
WHO IS THE HOUTHI LEADER?
Abdul Malik al-Houthi created the defiant force challenging world powers from a group of ragtag mountain fighters in sandals. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement.
Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.
Al-Houthi is known for rarely staying long in one place, for never meeting the media and for extreme reluctance to make scheduled public appearances.
HOW DID THE HOUTHIS COME TO CONTROL MUCH OF YEMEN?
A civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. Worried by the growing influence of Shi’ite Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia led a Western-backed coalition in March 2015, which intervened in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other large population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in the port city of Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a U.N.-led peace push, but a sharp escalation in regional tensions since the start of the Gaza war has increased risks of a new conflict between the militia and Riyadh.
WHY ATTACK SHIPS?
The Houthis have waded into the Gaza conflict with attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea as a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
They have also claimed attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the United States and Britain, shipping industry sources say all ships were at risk.
The U.S. and Britain had retaliated with air strikes against the Houthis as part of international efforts to restore the free flow of trade along a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15% of the world’s shipping traffic.
A period of relative calm started in January alongside the Gaza ceasefire but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval operations if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza.
The Houthis then announced on March 12 a resumption of attacks with immediate effect.
WHAT ARE THE HOUTHIS’ LINKS WITH IRAN?
The Houthis are part of what has been called the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance of regional militias including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, backed by Iran.
The Houthis’ slogan is “Death to America, Death to Israel, curse the Jews and victory to Islam”.
The Saudi-led coalition accuses Tehran of arming and training the Houthis, a charge both deny. The coalition also says Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah is helping the Houthis, an accusation it rejects.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Houthis deny being puppets of Iran, and Yemen experts say they are motivated primarily by a domestic agenda.

Title: Russia, Ukraine continue air attacks with ceasefire prospects uncertain
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:16:33 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine continued aerial attacks on each other, inflicting injuries and damages, officials said early on Sunday, as the fate of a proposed ceasefire to the three-year-old war remained uncertain.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Both sides have since traded heavy aerial strikes, and Russia moved closer on battlefield to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
Early on Sunday, three people were injured, including a 7-year-old, in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.
Two of them were injured after a drone hit their house, sparking a fire in the Gubkinsky district of the region, while the other person was injured in a drone attack on the village of Dolgoye, Gladkov said.
Alexander Gusev, governor of the southwestern Russia region of Voronezh, said on Telegram that air defence units had destroyed more than 15 Ukrainian drones over the region. There was no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Gusev said.
The acting governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov said defence units repelled an overnight drone attack on the region, with no injuries or damage reported.
In Ukraine, authorities reported several Russian drone strikes, including on the northern region of Chernihiv, where firefighters were battling a blaze at a high-rise building that was sparked by Russian drone attack, Ukraine’s state of emergency service said.
Ukrainian media reported a series of explosions in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv, after Ukraine’s air force issued warnings of a threat of drone attacks on the Kyiv and a number of other central Ukrainian regions.
By 0300 GMT on Sunday, there was no official information about potential damage in the Kyiv region.

Content: ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan on Sunday said that the central government has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country’s long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. Speaking at a felicitation event marking his appointment as the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, Narayanan outlined the future projects and vision for ISRO, emphasizing the space agency’s crucial role in advancing India’s space exploration efforts.
Narayanan revealed that several key missions are in the pipeline. He shared that Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan. Narayanan highlighted the growing scope of India’s lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.
ISRO’s recent success with Chandrayaan-3, which safely and successfully landed on the Moon’s south pole, added another remarkable achievement to India’s space exploration history. Union Minister Jitendra Singh had previously confirmed that the government has also approved the Chandrayaan-4 mission, which aims to showcase technology for safe landings, sample collection, and return to Earth.
Looking ahead, Narayanan underscored the goal of establishing the Bharatiya Antriksh Station by 2035. This ambitious project will mark India’s entry into the realm of space stations. Additionally, Narayanan emphasized the government’s vision of sending Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an Indian-made rocket, reinforcing the commitment to advancing India’s space capabilities.
Reflecting on his journey, Narayanan expressed deep gratitude for his role in ISRO’s achievements. He acknowledged the hard work of his predecessor, Dr. K. Sivan, and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unwavering support and vision for a developed India. Narayanan also candidly shared the emotional challenges faced by ISRO, particularly the setbacks experienced with Chandrayaan-2, which, despite its failed soft landing, succeeded in gathering valuable data and images from lunar orbit.
Over the past decade, ISRO has made significant strides in satellite launches, sending a total of 433 satellites into space, with a remarkable 90% success rate. This includes the successful launch of 393 foreign satellites across 34 countries, highlighting India’s position as a global leader in space technology and satellite services.
Narayanan also discussed the progress of India’s second spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam, a coastal village in Tamil Nadu. The foundation for this new spaceport was laid in February 2024, with construction beginning in March 2025. The Kulasekarapattinam spaceport will primarily support the launch of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a vehicle that aims to capture the growing market for launching small satellites weighing up to 500kg. This development will further enhance India’s capabilities in space launch services.
Reflecting on past achievements, Narayanan celebrated the success of ISRO’s Chandrayaan missions. Chandrayaan-1 was pivotal in discovering water on the Moon, while Chandrayaan-2, despite the landing failure, provided invaluable images and data from lunar orbit. Chandrayaan-3 made history as the first mission to achieve a soft landing at the Moon’s south pole. Narayanan also pointed out ISRO’s milestone as the fourth country in the world to launch a satellite dedicated to studying the Sun.

Title: Impact of US tariffs on India minimal as country diversifies exports: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:25:00 +0000
Content: The impact of US trade reciprocal tariffs on India will be minimal as the country has diversified its exports, pitched value addition, exploring alternate areas and works on new routes that transcend from Europe to the US via the Middle East, redrawing new supply chain algorithms, a new SBI Research report said on Monday.
The decline in the exports is expected to be in the range of 3-3.5 per cent, which again should be negated through higher export goals across both manufacturing and services fronts, the report mentioned.
India will also be able to take advantage of the aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the US last week. India has a trade deficit for aluminium ($13 million) and steel ($406 million) trade with the US where it can potentially take advantage.
The US reciprocal tariffs are expected to come into effect on April 2, and intense bilateral talks between New Delhi and Washington are currently on.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said last week that he “had a forward-looking discussion with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement” between India and the US.
“Our approach will be guided by ‘India First’, ‘Viksit Bharat’ and our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” Goyal said in a post on X..
Goyal had previously met Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during his visit to the US. This followed US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi’s talks on negotiating the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.
According to SBI Research, India has also been talking about free trade agreements (FTAs) with several partners – both bilateral and regional – in a bid to boost export-oriented domestic manufacturing.
India has signed 13 FTAs in the last five years with its trading partners like Mauritius, the UAE, Australia, etc.
The country is also negotiating FTAs with the UK, Canada, and the EU, targeting sectors like services, digital trade, and sustainable development.
India and New Zealand have also announced the launch of negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial FTA.
The FTA with the UK alone is expected to increase bilateral trade by $15 billion by 2030. Future FTAs will likely focus on enhancing digital trade, with projections indicating that the digital economy could add $1 trillion to India’s GDP by 2025, according to the report.
“The shift towards regional supply chains and the impact of geopolitical changes, such as the US tariff war, are influencing India’s FTA strategies to ensure alignment with global trade dynamics,” the report added.
These FTAs cover a wide array of topics, such as tariff reduction impacting the entire manufacturing and agricultural sectors; rules on services trade; digital issues such as data localisation; intellectual property rights that may have an impact on the accessibility of pharmaceutical drugs; and investment promotion, facilitation, and protection.

Title: Russian teen Andreeva beats top seed Sabalenka to claim Indian Wells title
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:57:27 +0000
Content: Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva fought back to overcome world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6 6-4 6-3 in the Indian Wells final on Sunday, winning a second WTA 1000-level event in a row to keep her charmed year on track.
The 17-year-old Andreeva, the youngest women’s champion at the tournament since Serena Williams in 1999, found her form midway through the match and crumpled to the ground in celebration after closing it out with a forehand winner.
Top seed Sabalenka pulled herself out of a slump to bring some of her best tennis to the California desert this year and got off to a hot start on Sunday but her form unravelled as the match wore on and she was left to rue missed opportunities.
“I would like to thank myself for fighting until the end and for always believing in me and for never quitting,” Andreeva said at the trophy ceremony.
“I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna, she’s been sending bullets and it was really hard to just keep up.”
Andreeva had lost to Sabalenka twice this year and it looked as though the pattern would continue as the top-seeded Belarusian mixed some nifty drop shots with her usual forehand power to save four break points in the third game.
Sabalenka sent a backhand winner down the line to break in the fourth game and four games later a visibly frustrated Andreeva whacked a ball into the stands after sending a shot into the net as the Russian was broken again.
The teenager got a confidence boost in the second set, however, when she broke Sabalenka with a forehand winner in the third game and fended off two break points in the sixth.
After trading breaks to open the third set, Sabalenka’s errors began to pile up and she fired into the net on break point in the third game to give the ninth seed the advantage.
‘MORE AGGRESSIVE’
“After the first set, I just realised, that, ‘oh, well, what I do now, it doesn’t work, so I have to change something’,” Andreeva told reporters.
“In the second set, I tried to play a little bit more aggressive. I didn’t try to over hit her, because I don’t think anyone can over hit Aryna, because she’s super-powerful player.
“I tried to really, I don’t know, create something to make her uncomfortable, and, you know, point-by-point, game-by-game, I managed to do that.”
Gracious in defeat, 2023 runner-up Sabalenka brought her trademark sense of humour to the trophy ceremony, while holding onto the petite consolation prize.
“I kind of have a love-hate relationship with this place. I’ll just put this trophy on top of another one and pretend it’s the trophy for the winning,” said Sabalenka.
“It’s going to be a quite similar size, you know?”
The win on Sunday sees Andreeva continue her meteoric rise, after she partnered with coach Conchita Martinez a year ago, as she recorded her fifth straight win over a top-10 player.
Former world number two Martinez guided Andreeva into the French Open semi-finals last year and helped steer her into the world’s top 10 with her triumph in Dubai last month.
Andreeva, who downed twice champion Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals, heaped praise on her team in her victory speech and later told reporters they were “super protective” of her.
“(Martinez) gives me advice, you know, how to play and also how to maybe not to spend too much time on-site or how not to waste your energy,” she said. “Because I have such a good team around me, they help to protect me.”

Title: Trump says will speak with Putin on Tuesday to discuss ending Ukraine war
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:47:34 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and discuss ending the war in Ukraine, after positive talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow.
“I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work’s been done over the weekend,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a late flight back to the Washington area from Florida.
“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance,” Trump said.
Trump is trying to win Putin’s support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, as both sides continued trading heavy aerial strikes through the weekend and Russia moved closer to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
When asked about what concessions are being considered in ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: “We’ll be talking about land. We’ll be talking about power plants”.
“I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We’re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.”
Trump said a lot of work had been done on the issue over the weekend, which the president spent in Florida, where he has a residence. He landed back at Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, in the early hours of Monday morning and returned to the White House.
Trump, who has upended U.S. policy by shifting closer to Moscow, has described Ukraine as being more difficult to work with than Russia. He held an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last month that ended with the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House early.
But Ukraine’s acceptance of a proposed ceasefire has put the onus on Russia to cede to Trump’s demands and will test the U.S. president’s more positive view of Putin, who launched Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

Title: PM Modi urges Russia and Ukraine to negotiate, emphasizes peace in podcast with Lex Fridman
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:45:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again called for a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stressing that the conditions are now favorable for both nations to come to the negotiating table and end the three-year war.
Speaking on a podcast with American research scientist Lex Fridman, PM Modi underscored the importance of global stability and made it clear that rather than remaining neutral, he stands firmly for peace and harmony.
When asked by Fridman about his approach to peacemaking, PM Modi said that he represents the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, whose teachings, words, actions, and behavior are dedicated to peace.
“That is why culturally and historically, our background is so strong that whenever we speak of peace, the world listens to us because India is the land of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, and Indians aren’t hardwired to espouse strife and conflict. We espouse harmony instead. We seek neither to wage war against nature nor to foster strife among nations. We stand for peace, and wherever we can act as peacemakers, we have gladly embraced that responsibility,” PM Modi said.
Speaking about India’s ties with Russia and Ukraine, the prime minister said, “I have a close relationship with both Russia and Ukraine alike. I can sit with President Putin and say that this is not the time for war, and I can also tell President Zelenskyy in a friendly way that, brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. The resolution will only come when both Ukraine and Russia come to the negotiating table. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with their allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both parties instead.”
The PM highlighted that initially, it was challenging to find peace, but now a situation has emerged which “presents an opportunity for meaningful and productive talks between Ukraine and Russia.”
Underscoring how the impact of war has spilled onto the rest of the world, PM Modi said, “There has been a lot of suffering. Even the Global South has suffered. The world has been grappling with a food, fuel, and fertilizer crisis. So the global community should unite in the pursuit of peace.”
The PM reiterated his views and said, “As for me, I have always maintained that I stand with peace. I am not neutral. I have a stance, and that is peace, and peace is what I strive for.”
PM Modi’s remarks to Lex Fridman come as progress is being made toward bringing peace to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said that he had “good and productive discussions” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hinted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could “finally come to an end.” Trump said that he “strongly requested” Putin to spare the lives of thousands of Ukrainian troops, or else it would be a “horrible massacre.”
PM Modi emphasized that for people, the prudent choice is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation.
“I believe that modern wars are no longer just about resources or interests. Today I see so many kinds of conflicts happening. Physical battles often get discussed. Struggles are happening in every domain. International organizations that were once powerful have become almost irrelevant. No real reforms are happening. Institutions, like the UN, are failing to fulfill their role”, the PM said.
“People who disregard international laws and rules continue to act freely, and no one can stop them. In such situations, the prudent choice for everyone is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation. A development-driven approach is the way forward. Expansionism will not work. As I’ve said before, the world is interdependent and interconnected. Every nation needs one another; no one can stand alone. And from all the different forums I attend, one thing is clear: Everyone is deeply worried about these conflicts. We can only hope that peace is restored very soon,” the PM added.
Lex Fridman’s podcasts have featured several personalities from various walks of life, discussing issues ranging from complex niches to other areas of mass understanding. Notable figures include political leaders like US President Donald Trump, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as leading personalities in their fields, such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.
Fridman’s YouTube page has 4.8 million subscribers, with over 82,000,000 views.

Title: Tennis: Draper lives out dreams with Indian Wells breakthrough
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:43:42 +0000
Content: Briton Jack Draper turned his childhood dreams into reality at Indian Wells on Sunday, claiming his maiden Masters 1000 title and catapulting himself into the top 10 for the first time after a rapid ascent through his sport.
The 23-year-old downed Denmark’s Holger Rune 6-2 6-2 in a display of total dominance in the final, after overcoming the twice defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final and swatting aside top U.S. hopes Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton.
“I have been watching this tournament since I was a young guy, watching all the champions play on this big court,” said Draper, who will be ranked seventh after picking up the title.
“It means the world to me, honestly, to be able to be a champion here.”
It was only 18 months ago that Draper – then ranked 123rd in the world – emerged as the unlikely hope for British men’s tennis when he defied injury and the odds to reach the fourth round of the 2023 U.S. Open.
He quickly added to his credentials from there, beating Italian Matteo Berrettini for his first ATP title in Stuttgart in June.
Weeks later, he was in the final four at Flushing, becoming the first British man since Andy Murray in 2012 to reach the U.S. Open semi-final and he picked up his first ATP 500-level title in October in Vienna.
“You dream of winning this stuff when you’re a kid. I think over the years, especially when you’re playing pro and stuff, it kind of gets lost a little bit, because maybe that, you know, when you’re young you think, ‘Oh, I’m just going to rock up and win’,” he told reporters.
“It doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to go through many ups and downs and emotions.”
Draper, whose competition schedule early this year was limited due to a nagging hip issue, credited his coach with providing a structured approach to help him weather the highs and lows.
“I want to achieve amazing things in this sport, but my main goal is keep on improving and keep on knuckling down,” he said.
“I know there is a long way ahead of me. I’m very ambitious. I don’t want to just stop here.”

Title: Amit Shah addresses 57th annual conference of ABSU in Assam’s Kokrajhar
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:27:03 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah, addressed the 57th annual conference of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) as the Chief Guest in Kokrajhar, Assam on Sunday.
According to an official statement from the Ministry, Shah praised the significant role played by ABSU in bringing peace, development, and unity to the Bodoland region, noting that the Bodo Accord would not have been possible without their efforts.
The event was attended by Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Shri Biswajit Daimary, the Union Home Secretary, and the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), alongside other dignitaries.
During his address, Amit Shah paid tribute to the five thousand martyrs who fought for Bodoland’s peace, emphasizing the legacy of Upendra Nath Brahma, a key leader of the Bodo community. Shah announced that a prominent road in Delhi would be named Bodopa Upendra Nath Brahma Marg in Brahma’s honour, and a bust of Brahma would be unveiled in a special program in Delhi in April.
Shah highlighted the positive outcomes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) peace accord, signed on January 27, 2020, stating that 82 percent of the agreement’s terms have already been fulfilled. 
He assured that the remaining terms would be fully implemented in the next two years, leading to lasting peace in the BTR. He also noted that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had been removed from the entire BTR area on April 1, 2022, as part of the peace process.
Shah emphasized that peace in Bodoland has led to significant economic progress. Under the ‘One District, One Product’ program, Kokrajhar’s famous “Mushroom from Bodoland” is now being served in hotels in Delhi.
The Home Minister also mentioned the region’s growing industrial base, with over a dozen Bodo products receiving Geographical Indication (GI) tags. He encouraged Bodo athletes to begin preparing for the potential Olympics in India in 2036, following Bodoland’s success in hosting the Durand Cup tournament.
Amit Shah stressed that hundreds of Bodo youth have been brought into the mainstream through education and development. The government has allocated Rs. 287 crore for the rehabilitation of former National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) members, with 90% of the funding provided by the Modi government. This rehabilitation effort has been pivotal in shifting the focus from separatism to progress in Bodoland.
The Home Minister reaffirmed the central government’s commitment to Bodoland’s development, stating that Rs. 1,500 crore has been allocated for the region, despite its population being only 3.5 million. He also praised ABSU’s contributions to education, which has enabled students to take their 12th-grade exams in the Bodo language, ensuring the survival of the Bodo language for generations to come.
Shah concluded his address by calling on Bodo youth to focus on education and contribute to the ongoing peace process. He expressed the government’s vision of building world-class infrastructure in Bodoland so that its youth can compete globally.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).

Title: Global displacement to rise by 6.7 million people by end of next year, aid group says
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:19:55 +0000
Content: Some 6.7 million additional people are expected to be newly displaced around the world by the end of next year, the Danish Refugee Council said on Friday, just as aid cuts from key donors like the United States take effect.
The U.N. refugee agency said last year that the number of forcibly displaced people around the globe stood at over 117 million people and warned that number could rise.
“These are not cold statistics. These are families forced to flee their homes, carrying next to nothing, and searching for water, food, and shelter,” said Charlotte Slente, secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council in a statement.
Twenty-seven countries account for nearly all of global displacements. The projection is based on an AI-driven model that predicts displacement trends by analysing over 100 indicators including factors such as security, politics and economics in those countries.
It forecasts that nearly a third of new displacements will be from Sudan, which is already the world’s worst refugee crisis after nearly two years of war. Another 1.4 million people are expected to be forcibly displaced from Myanmar, the report said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid programmes globally as part of a major spending overhaul by the world’s biggest aid donor.
The Danish Refugee Council is one of the aid groups hit and has had more than 20 contract terminations.
Cuts from Washington and other key donors are already impacting refugees.
The U.N. refugee agency said that funding shortages had shuttered programmes to protect adolescent girls from child marriage in South Sudan and a safe house for displaced women in danger of being killed in Ethiopia.
“Millions are facing starvation and displacement, and just as they need us most, wealthy nations are slashing aid. It’s a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” said Slente.

Both benchmark indices—Sensex and Nifty—ended in positive territory despite a cautious start. The Sensex opened slightly lower, slipping to 73,796, down 33 points in early trade. However, it soon gained momentum, climbing to an intraday high of 74,376, nearly 400 points above the day’s low. After trading in a range-bound manner for the rest of the session, the Sensex settled 341 points higher at 74,170.

Title: No shortcuts in life: PM Modi urges youth to see challenges as opportunities in Lex Fridman podcast
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:54:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged young people to avoid taking shortcuts in life. In a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman, PM Modi emphasized that while challenges are inevitable, they do not define who we are. He encouraged viewing every crisis and difficulty as an opportunity for personal growth.
When asked about young people who are facing challenges and feeling uncertain, PM Modi said that patience and self-confidence are crucial for achieving success.
“I want to tell all the young people, no matter how dark the night may seem, it is still just night, and morning is bound to come. That’s why we need patience and self-confidence. The challenges are real, but I am not defined by my circumstances. I am here for a purpose, sent by a higher power, and I am not alone. The one who sent me is always with me. This unwavering faith should always remain within us,” PM Modi said.
“Difficulties are a test of endurance. They are not meant to defeat me. Hardships exist to make me stronger, help me grow and improve, and not leave me feeling hopeless or discouraged. Personally, I see every crisis and challenge as an opportunity,” he added.
The prime minister also encouraged youth to be patient, saying, “There are no shortcuts in life. At our railway stations, there’s a sign for those who habitually cross the tracks instead of using the bridge, which reads, ‘Shortcut will cut you short.’ I would tell young people the same: a shortcut will cut you short. Patience and perseverance are essential.”
“Whatever responsibility we are given, we must pour our hearts into it. We should live it with passion. Enjoy the journey and find fulfillment in it. I truly believe that if this mindset is cultivated, it transforms life.”
PM Modi further explained that abundance alone is not enough and there is no guarantee of success. “Even a wealthy person who indulges in comfort and idleness will eventually wither away,” he said.
“I must contribute more to society with my own strength. Even if I am in a good position, there is still so much more to do. Even if I am not in a good position, there is still so much work to do. I have also noticed that some people tend to think, ‘I’ve learned enough. That’s it.’ But one should never let the student within them die. Learning should never stop.”
Sharing his personal experiences, the PM said, “I believe that as long as I am alive, I must have a purpose. Perhaps I exist to keep learning, to keep growing. Now, my mother tongue is Gujarati, and we were not very familiar with the Hindi language, nor did we know how to speak it eloquently or communicate effectively. But as a child, I used to sit at my father’s tea shop, and at that young age, I got the chance to meet so many people. And every time, I learned something from them; I observed their ways of speaking, their expressions. These things taught me a lot, even though I wasn’t in a position to apply them then. I thought, ‘If I ever get the chance, why not? Why shouldn’t I present myself well?’ So, I believe the desire to learn should always remain alive.”

Content: Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Singh Patel, inaugurated a three-day Quad Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness for the Indo-Pacific Region in Delhi on Monday.
Jointly organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of External Affairs, the workshop, running from March 17 to 19, aims to strengthen global health emergency frameworks, boost preparedness, and enhance resilience against future health threats, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs.
In her address, Patel stressed the urgent need for global collaboration in the face of emerging health threats. “The rise of emerging and re-emerging health threats in recent times underscores the critical necessity of strengthened preparedness, enhanced surveillance, and well-coordinated international response mechanisms to safeguard global health security,” she said.
Patel highlighted India’s contribution to global pandemic preparedness, stating, “India has contributed USD 10 million towards the establishment of the Pandemic Fund, which was specially conceptualized for fighting pandemics. We have further pledged an additional USD 12 million to support its sustained functioning.”
She emphasized that “India is at the forefront of leveraging digital health technologies to improve healthcare access and outcomes, creating sustainable, data-driven systems.”
Patel also pointed to India’s initiatives such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and the National One Health Program for Prevention and Control of Zoonosis as part of the country’s broader strategy to build a pandemic-ready healthcare system.
Prof. Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, highlighted the importance of regional collaboration in addressing zoonotic diseases, especially for countries with significant livestock sectors.
Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava emphasized the need for people-centered pandemic preparedness and the Quad’s pivotal role in strengthening health security in the Indo-Pacific.
The workshop follows the One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. Discussions will focus on risk communication, community engagement, disease surveillance, and capacity building. Delegates will also participate in simulations aimed at refining response strategies for pandemics like Avian Influenza, Mpox, and ebola, while promoting cross-border coordination.
A significant part of the event includes field visits to India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Centre for Vector-Borne Disease Control, offering delegates first-hand insights into India’s public health infrastructure and emergency response systems.
As an outcome of the 6th Quad Leaders’ Summit held in September 2024, the workshop serves as a platform for global health security collaboration. Senior health officials and technical experts from Quad nations—India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—are joined by over 25 delegates from 15 Indo-Pacific countries, including Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, as well as international health organizations.

Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:50:26 +0000
Content: US Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation tour, on Monday said that Washington and New Delhi are engaged in high-level discussions on trade tariffs.
Speaking to ANI, Gabbard highlighted the potential for strengthening economic ties between the two nations.
“What I have heard from Indian government officials over the past few days is that there is a strong opportunity to enhance our economic relationship,” Gabbard said. She added that while tariffs have been a point of contention, both nations are approaching the issue with a constructive outlook.
“Prime Minister Modi is prioritizing India’s economic interests and opportunities for its people, just as President Trump is focused on the US economy and the well-being of Americans. Both leaders are committed to finding a solution that works for both sides,” she said.
Gabbard pointed out that both President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are pragmatic leaders who are actively seeking mutually beneficial solutions. She stressed the importance of ongoing discussions at various levels of government.
“What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders with common sense, looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is taking place not only at the highest level but also among cabinet members and secretaries. This is key to mapping out a sustainable path forward,” she said.
She also expressed optimism about the growing interest from the private sector in both India and the United States, suggesting that economic collaboration extends beyond government negotiations.
According to Gabbard, the personal friendship between PM Modi and President Trump has set a strong foundation for expanding bilateral ties. She recalled the Prime Minister’s visit to the White House, which helped establish a shared vision for cooperation.
“As you know, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump are already good friends. Their White House meeting set a positive tone for the US-India partnership, and there is immense potential to strengthen it further,” she said.
During her discussions with Indian government and intelligence officials, Gabbard explored opportunities for deeper collaboration in intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She emphasized that the partnership holds “nothing but opportunity” for both nations.
Beyond geopolitics, Gabbard also spoke about her personal admiration for Indian philosophy, mentioning her inspiration from the Mahabharata, particularly Krishna’s teachings to Arjuna.

Title: Results speak for themselves: PM Modi on India-Pakistan cricket rivalry
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:00:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on the iconic India-Pakistan cricket rivalry in a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman. He also emphasised the role of sports in bridging divides and uniting people across borders.
The prime minister was asked about the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan, particularly in terms of which country has the stronger cricket team. Fridman also raised the question of how sports, especially cricket and football, can play a role in easing geopolitical tensions.
PM Modi underscored the unifying power of sports, highlighting that it goes beyond mere competition and plays a crucial role in connecting people across nations.
“I think sports have the power to energize the entire world. The spirit of sports brings people together from different nations. That’s why I would never want to see sports being discredited. I truly believe that sports play a major role in human evolution. They’re not just games; they connect people on a deeper level,” he said.
“Now, coming to the question of who’s better and who’s not, when it comes to techniques in sports, I’m not an expert. Only those who specialize in the technical aspects can judge which techniques are superior and who the best players really are. But sometimes, the results speak for themselves,” the PM added.
“Just a few days ago, India and Pakistan played a match. The result reveals which is the better team. That’s how we know,” the PM stressed.
The prime minister was referring to the recently concluded Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan in Dubai, where India comfortably defeated their arch-rivals by six wickets.
India has overwhelmingly dominated Pakistan in ICC World Cups, winning 14 out of 15 encounters, with Pakistan securing only one victory in a T20 World Cup match. India also leads 8-0 in ODI World Cups.

Title: US reports first outbreak of deadly H7N9 bird flu since 2017
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:20:30 +0000
Content: The United States reported the first outbreak of the deadly H7N9 bird flu on a poultry farm since 2017, as the country continues to grapple with another bird flu strain that has infected humans and caused egg prices to hit record highs.
The spread of avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has ravaged flocks around the world, disrupting supply and fuelling higher food prices. Its spread to mammals, including dairy cows in the U.S., has raised concerns among governments about a risk of a new pandemic.
The strain that has caused most damage to poultry in recent years and the death of one person in the U.S. is the H5N1.
The H7N9 bird flu virus has proved to have a high death rate for humans worldwide killing 616 people, or 39%, of the 1,568 people infected worldwide since it was first detected in 2013 in China, the World Health Organisation said.
The WHO has said that both forms of the bird flu virus do not appear to transmit easily from person to person.
The latest outbreak of H7N9 in the U.S., detected on a farm of 47,654 commercial broiler breeder chickens in Noxubee, Mississippi, was confirmed on March 13, the Paris-based World Animal Health Organisation said in a report on Monday, citing U.S. Authorities.
The Mississippi departments of agriculture and health did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. response to bird flu was disrupted in the early weeks of the Trump administration, when federal agencies cancelled congressional briefings and meetings with state animal health officials, according to Reuters reporting.
Some of that coordination has since resumed and the USDA says it will spend $1 billion to tackle the spread of the virus.

Title: Top creditor China approved no loans to Cambodia in 2024, data shows
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:19:10 +0000
Content: China signed no new loans to Cambodia last year, latest data from Cambodia’s finance ministry shows, in a dramatic reversal by the country’s top creditor that if continued could affect infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation.
With about $4 billion in outstanding loans, China accounts for more than a third of the country’s debt, Cambodian government data shows. That makes it the largest creditor, with a stock worth around one-tenth of Cambodia’s gross domestic product.
The collapse in signed loan agreements last year contrasts with new credit deals worth $302 million in 2023, and $567 million in 2022, according to the official data.
China’s loans to Cambodia have largely gone to infrastructure projects, such as roads, airports and power transmission lines.
Listed by the United Nations as a Least Developed Country, Cambodia is highly reliant on foreign financing, the IMF noted in a January report.
China’s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing has extensively supported Cambodia’s development in recent years and “will continue to provide assistance to Cambodia’s economic and social development to the best of its ability.”
Beijing has downsized its overseas investments in recent years and some projects it funded in Cambodia were seen as unsuccessful, officials have said.
Meas Soksensan, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s finance ministry, told Reuters on Monday the government was not concerned by the fall in loans, noting credit agreements depended on feasibility studies. “New projects are being discussed and will be signed soon,” he added.
Cambodia has announced Chinese investment for a new canal with an estimated cost of $1.7 billion that could be the country’s most expensive infrastructure project, but so far Beijing has not disclosed any figure for its possible contribution.
Chinese disbursements for previously agreed loans continued last year but at a lower pace than in the past, the data shows.
Cambodia received credit worth nearly $241 million from Beijing last year, down from $366 million in 2023 and $301 million in 2022, the official data showed.

Title: India records 47.90% surge in foreign tourist arrivals in 2023
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:50:59 +0000
Content: India witnessed a significant boost in Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in 2023, recording a 47.90% increase compared to the previous year, according to data released by the Bureau of Immigration. Union Minister for Tourism and Culture, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, revealed the figures in a written statement to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The country welcomed 9.52 million foreign tourists in 2023, reflecting a robust recovery in global travel post-pandemic. Of this, 4.40 million arrivals were for leisure, holiday, and recreation purposes, registering an impressive 86.96% growth over 2022. Foreign tourists visiting India for business and professional reasons totalled 0.98 million, marking a 49.66% rise from the previous year.
Foreign tourist arrivals have now recovered to 87.1% of pre-pandemic levels, closely aligning with the global recovery rate of 88.8%, and significantly surpassing the Asia-Pacific region’s recovery rate of 65.4%.
The surge in FTAs is attributed to the post-pandemic revival of international travel and India’s growing reputation as a diverse and culturally rich destination. Enhanced air connectivity, improved tourism infrastructure, and targeted marketing campaigns have played a crucial role in making India a preferred destination for global travellers.
The Ministry of Tourism has implemented various initiatives to support this growth, including the development of tourism infrastructure through schemes like ‘Swadesh Darshan,’ ‘PRASHAD,’ and financial assistance to states for tourism development. The Ministry also promotes India’s tourism offerings through campaigns such as ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ and ‘Chalo India,’ along with events like the International Tourism Mart and Bharat Parv.
In addition to these efforts, India has expanded its tourism appeal through niche sectors like wellness tourism, culinary tourism, and eco-tourism. Further measures include capacity-building programs like the ‘Incredible India Tourist Facilitator’ (IITF) and collaborations with the Ministry of Civil Aviation to improve air connectivity under the RCS-UDAN scheme, which has operationalized 53 tourism routes.
India’s e-Visa scheme, which is available to citizens of 167 countries across nine categories, including e-Tourist, e-Business, and e-Medical visas, has further streamlined the entry process for foreign visitors, contributing to the rise in FTAs.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).
