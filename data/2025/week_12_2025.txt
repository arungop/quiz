Title: MIT researchers devise process to convert skin cells directly into neurons
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:30:37 +0000
Content: Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process to convert skin cells directly into neurons, bypassing the need to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This breakthrough could lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  
Traditionally, converting a skin cell into a neuron involves first inducing it into a pluripotent stem cell state and then differentiating it into a neuron. The MIT researchers have now simplified this process by directly reprogramming skin cells into neurons.  
Working with mouse cells, the team developed a highly efficient conversion method that can generate more than 10 neurons from a single skin cell. If replicated in human cells, this approach could produce large quantities of motor neurons, potentially benefiting patients with spinal cord injuries or mobility-impairing diseases.  
“We were able to achieve yields that allow us to assess whether these cells could be viable candidates for cell replacement therapies. That’s where reprogramming technologies like this can take us,” said Katie Galloway, the WM Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at MIT.  
As an initial step toward therapeutic applications, the researchers demonstrated that the generated motor neurons could be successfully engrafted into mouse brains, where they integrated with host tissue.  
Galloway is the senior author of two papers detailing this method, published today in Cell Systems. MIT graduate student Nathan Wang is the lead author of both papers.  
The MIT team aims to further improve the efficiency of human cell conversion, which could enable large-scale neuron production for treating conditions like ALS. While clinical trials using iPSC-derived neurons to treat ALS are already underway, expanding the available number of neurons could accelerate research and therapeutic applications.  
This research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Title: Study shows how climate change affects rain and floods
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:14:40 +0000
Content: Climate change may lead to increased precipitation and more intense floods. A new study highlights the importance of distinguishing between different types of rainfall and flood events—specifically, short-term events that occur over a few hours and longer-term events that last several days. Climate change impacts each of these differently.
An Austrian research team has demonstrated for the first time that short-term precipitation and flood events, occurring over a few hours, are particularly affected by rising temperatures due to climate change.
For longer-term events, the relationship is more complex. This conclusion was drawn from detailed data collected in Austria for over a century—insights that can also be applied to other regions worldwide. The findings help determine which areas are more likely to experience flooding and how they may be affected. The results have been published in the journal Nature.
Climate change is disrupting water cycles globally, and Austria provides a particularly valuable case study. “We are fortunate to have excellent data available,” says Prof. Gunter Bloschl of TU Wien (Vienna), who led the research project. Since 1900, precipitation in Austria has been recorded by two separate institutions: the meteorological service (now Geosphere Austria) and the Austrian Hydrography, which is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
These highly reliable datasets have been analyzed through a collaboration between TU Wien, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BML), GeoSphere Austria, and the University of Graz.
The analysis revealed that short-term precipitation events lasting only a few hours have increased significantly over the past 30–40 years—by approximately 15%. “Climate models had already predicted this, though with some uncertainties. We have now confirmed it,” says Gunter Bloschl.
However, for longer-term rainfall events lasting several days, the situation differs. Global weather phenomena, such as El Niño—an ocean temperature-influenced climate process—play a more significant role in these cases. As a result, rainfall trends over longer timescales vary across regions.
For example, in the Mediterranean—particularly in parts of Italy, Spain, and Greece—prolonged periods of rainfall may become less frequent due to climate change.

Title: PM Modi congratulates RBI on winning Digital Transformation Award 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:07:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for winning the prestigious Digital Transformation Award 2025 by Central Banking, London.
PM Modi shared his appreciation on social media platform X, quoting RBI’s announcement and calling the achievement a significant milestone. He highlighted the role of digital innovation in strengthening India’s digital ecosystem and empowering millions of people across the country.
“A commendable accomplishment, reflecting a commitment to innovation and efficiency in governance,” PM Modi stated in his post. He further added, “Digital innovation continues to strengthen India’s financial ecosystem, thereby empowering countless lives.”
The RBI was honored for its groundbreaking digital initiatives, Saarathi and Pravaah, both of which were developed by the bank’s in-house tech team. These initiatives have transformed RBI’s internal and external processes, significantly reducing the need for paper-based submissions.
Saarathi, launched in January 2023, has fully digitized RBI’s internal workflow, allowing employees to securely submit and share documents. The system has improved record management, data analysis, task tracking, collaboration, and integration with other RBI systems. Prior to Saarathi, different departments relied on a mix of manual and digital processes, but the platform now serves as a unified digital repository for all the central bank’s information.
Pravaah, introduced in May 2024, is a digital platform for external users to submit regulatory applications to RBI. The documents submitted through Pravaah are automatically linked to the Saarathi database, where they are processed digitally using centralized cybersecurity systems and digital tracking.
Since its launch, Pravaah has digitized over 70 regulatory applications, benefiting nine departments within the RBI.

Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 07:56:01 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance policy against drug cartels following a major crackdown on an international narcotics network in the northeast. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) successfully busted the racket in coordinated operations in Guwahati and Imphal, seizing narcotics worth ₹88 crore and arresting four individuals.
In a post on X, Shah said, “No mercy for drug cartels. Accelerating the Modi government’s march to build a drug-free Bharat, a massive consignment of methamphetamine tablets worth ₹88 crore is seized, and four members of the international drug cartel are arrested in Imphal and Guwahati zones.”
He lauded the efforts of the NCB, calling the operation a result of an effective “bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom approach” to investigation. “The drug haul is a testament to the stellar performance of this integrated strategy. Our hunt for drugs continues. Heartfelt congratulations to team NCB,” Shah added.
Inauguration of Lachit Barphukan Police Academy
In a separate event on Saturday, Amit Shah inaugurated the Lachit Barphukan Police Academy at Degaon in Assam, marking a key development in strengthening the region’s law enforcement infrastructure.
Named after the legendary Ahom general Lachit Barphukan, renowned for his leadership during the 1671 Battle of Saraighat against Mughal forces, the academy is designed to provide comprehensive, modern training to police personnel while honouring Assam’s rich history.
Speaking at the inauguration, Shah praised Lachit Barphukan’s legacy, emphasizing the general’s bravery, patriotism, and leadership. “Lachit Barphukan’s bravery is a source of inspiration for all Indians. By dedicating this police academy to his name, we are ensuring that future generations of police personnel imbibe his values of courage, integrity, and selfless service,” he said.

Title: Gadkari stresses need for education in Muslim community, slams caste politics
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday emphasised the crucial role of education in the upliftment of the Muslim community and strongly criticised the prevalence of caste-based politics in the country.
Speaking at the convocation ceremony of the Central India Group of Institutions in Nagpur, Gadkari said that education is the cornerstone of development and social progress. He stressed that the Muslim community, in particular, needs to focus more on educational advancement.
“In our society, the community that needs education the most is the Muslim community,” Gadkari said.
Highlighting occupational patterns, he pointed out that only a limited number of professions are currently dominant within the Muslim community. “Unfortunately, professions like running tea stalls, paan shops, scrap dealing, truck driving, and cleaning have gained prominence,” he added.
He urged members of the community to aspire for careers in engineering, medicine, and civil services. “If people from our society become engineers, doctors, IAS and IPS officers, then our society will progress. We may offer prayers in the mosque a hundred times, but without embracing science and technology, what will our future look like?” Gadkari questioned.
Drawing inspiration from former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Gadkari said, “I believe a person’s greatness is not determined by caste, sect, religion, language, or gender, but by their qualities. That is why we must not discriminate based on these identities.”
He praised Dr. Kalam’s achievements, highlighting how his contributions as a nuclear scientist brought global recognition to India.
Taking a firm stand against caste-based politics, Gadkari said he had no interest in appeasing caste leaders for electoral gains. “I am in politics, and caste leaders often come to meet me. But I am clear — I will live on my own terms, whether or not I get votes,” he asserted.
Recalling an earlier public gathering, he added, “I once told a crowd of 50,000 people, ‘Jo karega jaat ki baat, uske kass ke maarunga laat’ (I will kick hard anyone who talks about caste).”
The Union Minister reiterated that education is not merely a tool for individual benefit but a driving force behind societal and national progress. “Education does not just benefit you and your family. It uplifts society and the nation. Knowledge is power, and imbibing this power must be your mission,” he concluded.

Title: FIIs selling declines in Indian market, expected to stabilise next quarter: experts
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:11:58 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling in India continues in early March, but the intensity of the sell-off is gradually declining as stock market valuations become more reasonable, according to experts.
As of March 14, FIIs have sold equity worth ₹30,015 crore this month, taking the total equity sold in CY 2025 so far to ₹1,42,616 crore.
In contrast, FIIs have turned buyers in the debt segment in March. The total buying figure for debt (general category plus VRR) stood at ₹7,029 crore so far this month, say market watchers.
However, experts noted that heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing trade war between the US and other nations is likely to push more investments towards safe asset classes such as gold and the US dollar.
Shridatta Bhandwaldar, Head of Equities at Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, highlighted that FIIs have been significant sellers in the Indian equity market over the past three months, with outflows amounting to $15–20 billion.
“However, as the initial shocks subside, we expect FII flows to at least stabilise in the next quarter and eventually turn positive over time,” he said.
“For this to materialise, though, our corporate earnings will need to show substantial improvement from current levels. We believe the slowdown in earnings growth is more cyclical than structural, noting that a similar trend was observed in FY23,” he added.
Valuations for the Nifty index are already below its 10-year average for one-year forward earnings.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets remained largely range-bound last week, ending slightly lower amid mixed global cues and investor caution.
The benchmark indices experienced mild corrections as concerns over global trade policies and sector-specific sell-offs weighed on market sentiment.
Analysts expect volatility to persist in the upcoming sessions as investors monitor global developments, particularly economic data releases from the US Federal Reserve and domestic macroeconomic indicators.
Market experts pointed out that the 22,250–22,650 range remains a crucial technical zone for the Nifty 50. A breakout in either direction could determine the market’s trajectory in the near term.

Title: Astronaut crew docks with space station to replace ‘Butch and Suni’
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:50:12 +0000
Content: A SpaceX capsule delivered four astronauts to the International Space Station early on Sunday in a NASA crew-swap mission that will allow a pair of stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to return home after nine months on the orbiting lab.
About 29 hours since launching at 7:03 p.m. ET on Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Crew-10 astronauts’ SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked to the ISS at 12:04 a.m. ET (0404 GMT) on Sunday.
They were welcomed by the station’s seven-member crew, which includes Wilmore and Williams – veteran NASA astronauts and retired Navy test pilots who have remained on the station after problems with Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule forced NASA to bring it back empty.
Otherwise a routine crew rotation flight, the Crew-10 mission is a long-awaited first step to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth – part of a plan set by NASA last year that has been given greater urgency by President Donald Trump since he took office in January.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to depart the ISS on Wednesday as early as 4 a.m. ET (0800 GMT), along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
Hague and Gorbunov flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams, and that craft has been attached to the station since.
The Crew-10 crew, scheduled to stay on the station for roughly six months, includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.
The crew-swap mission became entangled in politics as Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, urged a quicker Crew-10 launch. They claimed, without evidence, that Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had abandoned Wilmore and Williams on the station for political reasons.
Having seen their mission turn into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the other five astronauts.
Williams told reporters this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. “It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” she said.

Title: Who are Yemen’s Houthis and why are they under attack by the US?
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:43:18 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has launched the biggest military operation in the Middle East since taking office against Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis after they resumed Red Sea shipping attacks.
The strikes, which have killed at least 24 people so far, could last for weeks according to one U.S. official and come as Trump ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HOUTHIS?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in the far north of Yemen set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shi’ite Islam, which had once ruled Yemen, but whose northern heartland had became impoverished and marginalized.
As friction with the government in the capital Sanaa grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia.
WHO IS THE HOUTHI LEADER?
Abdul Malik al-Houthi created the defiant force challenging world powers from a group of ragtag mountain fighters in sandals. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement.
Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.
Al-Houthi is known for rarely staying long in one place, for never meeting the media and for extreme reluctance to make scheduled public appearances.
HOW DID THE HOUTHIS COME TO CONTROL MUCH OF YEMEN?
A civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. Worried by the growing influence of Shi’ite Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia led a Western-backed coalition in March 2015, which intervened in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other large population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in the port city of Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a U.N.-led peace push, but a sharp escalation in regional tensions since the start of the Gaza war has increased risks of a new conflict between the militia and Riyadh.
WHY ATTACK SHIPS?
The Houthis have waded into the Gaza conflict with attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea as a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
They have also claimed attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the United States and Britain, shipping industry sources say all ships were at risk.
The U.S. and Britain had retaliated with air strikes against the Houthis as part of international efforts to restore the free flow of trade along a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15% of the world’s shipping traffic.
A period of relative calm started in January alongside the Gaza ceasefire but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval operations if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza.
The Houthis then announced on March 12 a resumption of attacks with immediate effect.
WHAT ARE THE HOUTHIS’ LINKS WITH IRAN?
The Houthis are part of what has been called the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance of regional militias including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, backed by Iran.
The Houthis’ slogan is “Death to America, Death to Israel, curse the Jews and victory to Islam”.
The Saudi-led coalition accuses Tehran of arming and training the Houthis, a charge both deny. The coalition also says Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah is helping the Houthis, an accusation it rejects.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Houthis deny being puppets of Iran, and Yemen experts say they are motivated primarily by a domestic agenda.

Title: Russia, Ukraine continue air attacks with ceasefire prospects uncertain
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:16:33 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine continued aerial attacks on each other, inflicting injuries and damages, officials said early on Sunday, as the fate of a proposed ceasefire to the three-year-old war remained uncertain.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Both sides have since traded heavy aerial strikes, and Russia moved closer on battlefield to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
Early on Sunday, three people were injured, including a 7-year-old, in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.
Two of them were injured after a drone hit their house, sparking a fire in the Gubkinsky district of the region, while the other person was injured in a drone attack on the village of Dolgoye, Gladkov said.
Alexander Gusev, governor of the southwestern Russia region of Voronezh, said on Telegram that air defence units had destroyed more than 15 Ukrainian drones over the region. There was no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Gusev said.
The acting governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov said defence units repelled an overnight drone attack on the region, with no injuries or damage reported.
In Ukraine, authorities reported several Russian drone strikes, including on the northern region of Chernihiv, where firefighters were battling a blaze at a high-rise building that was sparked by Russian drone attack, Ukraine’s state of emergency service said.
Ukrainian media reported a series of explosions in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv, after Ukraine’s air force issued warnings of a threat of drone attacks on the Kyiv and a number of other central Ukrainian regions.
By 0300 GMT on Sunday, there was no official information about potential damage in the Kyiv region.

Content: ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan on Sunday said that the central government has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country’s long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. Speaking at a felicitation event marking his appointment as the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, Narayanan outlined the future projects and vision for ISRO, emphasizing the space agency’s crucial role in advancing India’s space exploration efforts.
Narayanan revealed that several key missions are in the pipeline. He shared that Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan. Narayanan highlighted the growing scope of India’s lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.
ISRO’s recent success with Chandrayaan-3, which safely and successfully landed on the Moon’s south pole, added another remarkable achievement to India’s space exploration history. Union Minister Jitendra Singh had previously confirmed that the government has also approved the Chandrayaan-4 mission, which aims to showcase technology for safe landings, sample collection, and return to Earth.
Looking ahead, Narayanan underscored the goal of establishing the Bharatiya Antriksh Station by 2035. This ambitious project will mark India’s entry into the realm of space stations. Additionally, Narayanan emphasized the government’s vision of sending Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an Indian-made rocket, reinforcing the commitment to advancing India’s space capabilities.
Reflecting on his journey, Narayanan expressed deep gratitude for his role in ISRO’s achievements. He acknowledged the hard work of his predecessor, Dr. K. Sivan, and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unwavering support and vision for a developed India. Narayanan also candidly shared the emotional challenges faced by ISRO, particularly the setbacks experienced with Chandrayaan-2, which, despite its failed soft landing, succeeded in gathering valuable data and images from lunar orbit.
Over the past decade, ISRO has made significant strides in satellite launches, sending a total of 433 satellites into space, with a remarkable 90% success rate. This includes the successful launch of 393 foreign satellites across 34 countries, highlighting India’s position as a global leader in space technology and satellite services.
Narayanan also discussed the progress of India’s second spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam, a coastal village in Tamil Nadu. The foundation for this new spaceport was laid in February 2024, with construction beginning in March 2025. The Kulasekarapattinam spaceport will primarily support the launch of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a vehicle that aims to capture the growing market for launching small satellites weighing up to 500kg. This development will further enhance India’s capabilities in space launch services.
Reflecting on past achievements, Narayanan celebrated the success of ISRO’s Chandrayaan missions. Chandrayaan-1 was pivotal in discovering water on the Moon, while Chandrayaan-2, despite the landing failure, provided invaluable images and data from lunar orbit. Chandrayaan-3 made history as the first mission to achieve a soft landing at the Moon’s south pole. Narayanan also pointed out ISRO’s milestone as the fourth country in the world to launch a satellite dedicated to studying the Sun.

Title: Impact of US tariffs on India minimal as country diversifies exports: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:25:00 +0000
Content: The impact of US trade reciprocal tariffs on India will be minimal as the country has diversified its exports, pitched value addition, exploring alternate areas and works on new routes that transcend from Europe to the US via the Middle East, redrawing new supply chain algorithms, a new SBI Research report said on Monday.
The decline in the exports is expected to be in the range of 3-3.5 per cent, which again should be negated through higher export goals across both manufacturing and services fronts, the report mentioned.
India will also be able to take advantage of the aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the US last week. India has a trade deficit for aluminium ($13 million) and steel ($406 million) trade with the US where it can potentially take advantage.
The US reciprocal tariffs are expected to come into effect on April 2, and intense bilateral talks between New Delhi and Washington are currently on.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said last week that he “had a forward-looking discussion with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement” between India and the US.
“Our approach will be guided by ‘India First’, ‘Viksit Bharat’ and our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” Goyal said in a post on X..
Goyal had previously met Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during his visit to the US. This followed US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi’s talks on negotiating the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.
According to SBI Research, India has also been talking about free trade agreements (FTAs) with several partners – both bilateral and regional – in a bid to boost export-oriented domestic manufacturing.
India has signed 13 FTAs in the last five years with its trading partners like Mauritius, the UAE, Australia, etc.
The country is also negotiating FTAs with the UK, Canada, and the EU, targeting sectors like services, digital trade, and sustainable development.
India and New Zealand have also announced the launch of negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial FTA.
The FTA with the UK alone is expected to increase bilateral trade by $15 billion by 2030. Future FTAs will likely focus on enhancing digital trade, with projections indicating that the digital economy could add $1 trillion to India’s GDP by 2025, according to the report.
“The shift towards regional supply chains and the impact of geopolitical changes, such as the US tariff war, are influencing India’s FTA strategies to ensure alignment with global trade dynamics,” the report added.
These FTAs cover a wide array of topics, such as tariff reduction impacting the entire manufacturing and agricultural sectors; rules on services trade; digital issues such as data localisation; intellectual property rights that may have an impact on the accessibility of pharmaceutical drugs; and investment promotion, facilitation, and protection.

Title: Russian teen Andreeva beats top seed Sabalenka to claim Indian Wells title
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:57:27 +0000
Content: Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva fought back to overcome world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6 6-4 6-3 in the Indian Wells final on Sunday, winning a second WTA 1000-level event in a row to keep her charmed year on track.
The 17-year-old Andreeva, the youngest women’s champion at the tournament since Serena Williams in 1999, found her form midway through the match and crumpled to the ground in celebration after closing it out with a forehand winner.
Top seed Sabalenka pulled herself out of a slump to bring some of her best tennis to the California desert this year and got off to a hot start on Sunday but her form unravelled as the match wore on and she was left to rue missed opportunities.
“I would like to thank myself for fighting until the end and for always believing in me and for never quitting,” Andreeva said at the trophy ceremony.
“I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna, she’s been sending bullets and it was really hard to just keep up.”
Andreeva had lost to Sabalenka twice this year and it looked as though the pattern would continue as the top-seeded Belarusian mixed some nifty drop shots with her usual forehand power to save four break points in the third game.
Sabalenka sent a backhand winner down the line to break in the fourth game and four games later a visibly frustrated Andreeva whacked a ball into the stands after sending a shot into the net as the Russian was broken again.
The teenager got a confidence boost in the second set, however, when she broke Sabalenka with a forehand winner in the third game and fended off two break points in the sixth.
After trading breaks to open the third set, Sabalenka’s errors began to pile up and she fired into the net on break point in the third game to give the ninth seed the advantage.
‘MORE AGGRESSIVE’
“After the first set, I just realised, that, ‘oh, well, what I do now, it doesn’t work, so I have to change something’,” Andreeva told reporters.
“In the second set, I tried to play a little bit more aggressive. I didn’t try to over hit her, because I don’t think anyone can over hit Aryna, because she’s super-powerful player.
“I tried to really, I don’t know, create something to make her uncomfortable, and, you know, point-by-point, game-by-game, I managed to do that.”
Gracious in defeat, 2023 runner-up Sabalenka brought her trademark sense of humour to the trophy ceremony, while holding onto the petite consolation prize.
“I kind of have a love-hate relationship with this place. I’ll just put this trophy on top of another one and pretend it’s the trophy for the winning,” said Sabalenka.
“It’s going to be a quite similar size, you know?”
The win on Sunday sees Andreeva continue her meteoric rise, after she partnered with coach Conchita Martinez a year ago, as she recorded her fifth straight win over a top-10 player.
Former world number two Martinez guided Andreeva into the French Open semi-finals last year and helped steer her into the world’s top 10 with her triumph in Dubai last month.
Andreeva, who downed twice champion Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals, heaped praise on her team in her victory speech and later told reporters they were “super protective” of her.
“(Martinez) gives me advice, you know, how to play and also how to maybe not to spend too much time on-site or how not to waste your energy,” she said. “Because I have such a good team around me, they help to protect me.”

Title: Trump says will speak with Putin on Tuesday to discuss ending Ukraine war
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:47:34 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and discuss ending the war in Ukraine, after positive talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow.
“I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work’s been done over the weekend,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a late flight back to the Washington area from Florida.
“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance,” Trump said.
Trump is trying to win Putin’s support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, as both sides continued trading heavy aerial strikes through the weekend and Russia moved closer to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
When asked about what concessions are being considered in ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: “We’ll be talking about land. We’ll be talking about power plants”.
“I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We’re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.”
Trump said a lot of work had been done on the issue over the weekend, which the president spent in Florida, where he has a residence. He landed back at Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, in the early hours of Monday morning and returned to the White House.
Trump, who has upended U.S. policy by shifting closer to Moscow, has described Ukraine as being more difficult to work with than Russia. He held an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last month that ended with the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House early.
But Ukraine’s acceptance of a proposed ceasefire has put the onus on Russia to cede to Trump’s demands and will test the U.S. president’s more positive view of Putin, who launched Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

Title: PM Modi urges Russia and Ukraine to negotiate, emphasizes peace in podcast with Lex Fridman
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:45:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again called for a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stressing that the conditions are now favorable for both nations to come to the negotiating table and end the three-year war.
Speaking on a podcast with American research scientist Lex Fridman, PM Modi underscored the importance of global stability and made it clear that rather than remaining neutral, he stands firmly for peace and harmony.
When asked by Fridman about his approach to peacemaking, PM Modi said that he represents the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, whose teachings, words, actions, and behavior are dedicated to peace.
“That is why culturally and historically, our background is so strong that whenever we speak of peace, the world listens to us because India is the land of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, and Indians aren’t hardwired to espouse strife and conflict. We espouse harmony instead. We seek neither to wage war against nature nor to foster strife among nations. We stand for peace, and wherever we can act as peacemakers, we have gladly embraced that responsibility,” PM Modi said.
Speaking about India’s ties with Russia and Ukraine, the prime minister said, “I have a close relationship with both Russia and Ukraine alike. I can sit with President Putin and say that this is not the time for war, and I can also tell President Zelenskyy in a friendly way that, brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. The resolution will only come when both Ukraine and Russia come to the negotiating table. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with their allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both parties instead.”
The PM highlighted that initially, it was challenging to find peace, but now a situation has emerged which “presents an opportunity for meaningful and productive talks between Ukraine and Russia.”
Underscoring how the impact of war has spilled onto the rest of the world, PM Modi said, “There has been a lot of suffering. Even the Global South has suffered. The world has been grappling with a food, fuel, and fertilizer crisis. So the global community should unite in the pursuit of peace.”
The PM reiterated his views and said, “As for me, I have always maintained that I stand with peace. I am not neutral. I have a stance, and that is peace, and peace is what I strive for.”
PM Modi’s remarks to Lex Fridman come as progress is being made toward bringing peace to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said that he had “good and productive discussions” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hinted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could “finally come to an end.” Trump said that he “strongly requested” Putin to spare the lives of thousands of Ukrainian troops, or else it would be a “horrible massacre.”
PM Modi emphasized that for people, the prudent choice is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation.
“I believe that modern wars are no longer just about resources or interests. Today I see so many kinds of conflicts happening. Physical battles often get discussed. Struggles are happening in every domain. International organizations that were once powerful have become almost irrelevant. No real reforms are happening. Institutions, like the UN, are failing to fulfill their role”, the PM said.
“People who disregard international laws and rules continue to act freely, and no one can stop them. In such situations, the prudent choice for everyone is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation. A development-driven approach is the way forward. Expansionism will not work. As I’ve said before, the world is interdependent and interconnected. Every nation needs one another; no one can stand alone. And from all the different forums I attend, one thing is clear: Everyone is deeply worried about these conflicts. We can only hope that peace is restored very soon,” the PM added.
Lex Fridman’s podcasts have featured several personalities from various walks of life, discussing issues ranging from complex niches to other areas of mass understanding. Notable figures include political leaders like US President Donald Trump, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as leading personalities in their fields, such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.
Fridman’s YouTube page has 4.8 million subscribers, with over 82,000,000 views.

Title: Tennis: Draper lives out dreams with Indian Wells breakthrough
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:43:42 +0000
Content: Briton Jack Draper turned his childhood dreams into reality at Indian Wells on Sunday, claiming his maiden Masters 1000 title and catapulting himself into the top 10 for the first time after a rapid ascent through his sport.
The 23-year-old downed Denmark’s Holger Rune 6-2 6-2 in a display of total dominance in the final, after overcoming the twice defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final and swatting aside top U.S. hopes Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton.
“I have been watching this tournament since I was a young guy, watching all the champions play on this big court,” said Draper, who will be ranked seventh after picking up the title.
“It means the world to me, honestly, to be able to be a champion here.”
It was only 18 months ago that Draper – then ranked 123rd in the world – emerged as the unlikely hope for British men’s tennis when he defied injury and the odds to reach the fourth round of the 2023 U.S. Open.
He quickly added to his credentials from there, beating Italian Matteo Berrettini for his first ATP title in Stuttgart in June.
Weeks later, he was in the final four at Flushing, becoming the first British man since Andy Murray in 2012 to reach the U.S. Open semi-final and he picked up his first ATP 500-level title in October in Vienna.
“You dream of winning this stuff when you’re a kid. I think over the years, especially when you’re playing pro and stuff, it kind of gets lost a little bit, because maybe that, you know, when you’re young you think, ‘Oh, I’m just going to rock up and win’,” he told reporters.
“It doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to go through many ups and downs and emotions.”
Draper, whose competition schedule early this year was limited due to a nagging hip issue, credited his coach with providing a structured approach to help him weather the highs and lows.
“I want to achieve amazing things in this sport, but my main goal is keep on improving and keep on knuckling down,” he said.
“I know there is a long way ahead of me. I’m very ambitious. I don’t want to just stop here.”

Title: Amit Shah addresses 57th annual conference of ABSU in Assam’s Kokrajhar
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:27:03 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah, addressed the 57th annual conference of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) as the Chief Guest in Kokrajhar, Assam on Sunday.
According to an official statement from the Ministry, Shah praised the significant role played by ABSU in bringing peace, development, and unity to the Bodoland region, noting that the Bodo Accord would not have been possible without their efforts.
The event was attended by Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Shri Biswajit Daimary, the Union Home Secretary, and the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), alongside other dignitaries.
During his address, Amit Shah paid tribute to the five thousand martyrs who fought for Bodoland’s peace, emphasizing the legacy of Upendra Nath Brahma, a key leader of the Bodo community. Shah announced that a prominent road in Delhi would be named Bodopa Upendra Nath Brahma Marg in Brahma’s honour, and a bust of Brahma would be unveiled in a special program in Delhi in April.
Shah highlighted the positive outcomes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) peace accord, signed on January 27, 2020, stating that 82 percent of the agreement’s terms have already been fulfilled. 
He assured that the remaining terms would be fully implemented in the next two years, leading to lasting peace in the BTR. He also noted that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had been removed from the entire BTR area on April 1, 2022, as part of the peace process.
Shah emphasized that peace in Bodoland has led to significant economic progress. Under the ‘One District, One Product’ program, Kokrajhar’s famous “Mushroom from Bodoland” is now being served in hotels in Delhi.
The Home Minister also mentioned the region’s growing industrial base, with over a dozen Bodo products receiving Geographical Indication (GI) tags. He encouraged Bodo athletes to begin preparing for the potential Olympics in India in 2036, following Bodoland’s success in hosting the Durand Cup tournament.
Amit Shah stressed that hundreds of Bodo youth have been brought into the mainstream through education and development. The government has allocated Rs. 287 crore for the rehabilitation of former National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) members, with 90% of the funding provided by the Modi government. This rehabilitation effort has been pivotal in shifting the focus from separatism to progress in Bodoland.
The Home Minister reaffirmed the central government’s commitment to Bodoland’s development, stating that Rs. 1,500 crore has been allocated for the region, despite its population being only 3.5 million. He also praised ABSU’s contributions to education, which has enabled students to take their 12th-grade exams in the Bodo language, ensuring the survival of the Bodo language for generations to come.
Shah concluded his address by calling on Bodo youth to focus on education and contribute to the ongoing peace process. He expressed the government’s vision of building world-class infrastructure in Bodoland so that its youth can compete globally.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).

Title: Global displacement to rise by 6.7 million people by end of next year, aid group says
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:19:55 +0000
Content: Some 6.7 million additional people are expected to be newly displaced around the world by the end of next year, the Danish Refugee Council said on Friday, just as aid cuts from key donors like the United States take effect.
The U.N. refugee agency said last year that the number of forcibly displaced people around the globe stood at over 117 million people and warned that number could rise.
“These are not cold statistics. These are families forced to flee their homes, carrying next to nothing, and searching for water, food, and shelter,” said Charlotte Slente, secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council in a statement.
Twenty-seven countries account for nearly all of global displacements. The projection is based on an AI-driven model that predicts displacement trends by analysing over 100 indicators including factors such as security, politics and economics in those countries.
It forecasts that nearly a third of new displacements will be from Sudan, which is already the world’s worst refugee crisis after nearly two years of war. Another 1.4 million people are expected to be forcibly displaced from Myanmar, the report said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid programmes globally as part of a major spending overhaul by the world’s biggest aid donor.
The Danish Refugee Council is one of the aid groups hit and has had more than 20 contract terminations.
Cuts from Washington and other key donors are already impacting refugees.
The U.N. refugee agency said that funding shortages had shuttered programmes to protect adolescent girls from child marriage in South Sudan and a safe house for displaced women in danger of being killed in Ethiopia.
“Millions are facing starvation and displacement, and just as they need us most, wealthy nations are slashing aid. It’s a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” said Slente.

Both benchmark indices—Sensex and Nifty—ended in positive territory despite a cautious start. The Sensex opened slightly lower, slipping to 73,796, down 33 points in early trade. However, it soon gained momentum, climbing to an intraday high of 74,376, nearly 400 points above the day’s low. After trading in a range-bound manner for the rest of the session, the Sensex settled 341 points higher at 74,170.

Title: No shortcuts in life: PM Modi urges youth to see challenges as opportunities in Lex Fridman podcast
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:54:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged young people to avoid taking shortcuts in life. In a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman, PM Modi emphasized that while challenges are inevitable, they do not define who we are. He encouraged viewing every crisis and difficulty as an opportunity for personal growth.
When asked about young people who are facing challenges and feeling uncertain, PM Modi said that patience and self-confidence are crucial for achieving success.
“I want to tell all the young people, no matter how dark the night may seem, it is still just night, and morning is bound to come. That’s why we need patience and self-confidence. The challenges are real, but I am not defined by my circumstances. I am here for a purpose, sent by a higher power, and I am not alone. The one who sent me is always with me. This unwavering faith should always remain within us,” PM Modi said.
“Difficulties are a test of endurance. They are not meant to defeat me. Hardships exist to make me stronger, help me grow and improve, and not leave me feeling hopeless or discouraged. Personally, I see every crisis and challenge as an opportunity,” he added.
The prime minister also encouraged youth to be patient, saying, “There are no shortcuts in life. At our railway stations, there’s a sign for those who habitually cross the tracks instead of using the bridge, which reads, ‘Shortcut will cut you short.’ I would tell young people the same: a shortcut will cut you short. Patience and perseverance are essential.”
“Whatever responsibility we are given, we must pour our hearts into it. We should live it with passion. Enjoy the journey and find fulfillment in it. I truly believe that if this mindset is cultivated, it transforms life.”
PM Modi further explained that abundance alone is not enough and there is no guarantee of success. “Even a wealthy person who indulges in comfort and idleness will eventually wither away,” he said.
“I must contribute more to society with my own strength. Even if I am in a good position, there is still so much more to do. Even if I am not in a good position, there is still so much work to do. I have also noticed that some people tend to think, ‘I’ve learned enough. That’s it.’ But one should never let the student within them die. Learning should never stop.”
Sharing his personal experiences, the PM said, “I believe that as long as I am alive, I must have a purpose. Perhaps I exist to keep learning, to keep growing. Now, my mother tongue is Gujarati, and we were not very familiar with the Hindi language, nor did we know how to speak it eloquently or communicate effectively. But as a child, I used to sit at my father’s tea shop, and at that young age, I got the chance to meet so many people. And every time, I learned something from them; I observed their ways of speaking, their expressions. These things taught me a lot, even though I wasn’t in a position to apply them then. I thought, ‘If I ever get the chance, why not? Why shouldn’t I present myself well?’ So, I believe the desire to learn should always remain alive.”

Content: Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Singh Patel, inaugurated a three-day Quad Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness for the Indo-Pacific Region in Delhi on Monday.
Jointly organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of External Affairs, the workshop, running from March 17 to 19, aims to strengthen global health emergency frameworks, boost preparedness, and enhance resilience against future health threats, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs.
In her address, Patel stressed the urgent need for global collaboration in the face of emerging health threats. “The rise of emerging and re-emerging health threats in recent times underscores the critical necessity of strengthened preparedness, enhanced surveillance, and well-coordinated international response mechanisms to safeguard global health security,” she said.
Patel highlighted India’s contribution to global pandemic preparedness, stating, “India has contributed USD 10 million towards the establishment of the Pandemic Fund, which was specially conceptualized for fighting pandemics. We have further pledged an additional USD 12 million to support its sustained functioning.”
She emphasized that “India is at the forefront of leveraging digital health technologies to improve healthcare access and outcomes, creating sustainable, data-driven systems.”
Patel also pointed to India’s initiatives such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and the National One Health Program for Prevention and Control of Zoonosis as part of the country’s broader strategy to build a pandemic-ready healthcare system.
Prof. Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, highlighted the importance of regional collaboration in addressing zoonotic diseases, especially for countries with significant livestock sectors.
Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava emphasized the need for people-centered pandemic preparedness and the Quad’s pivotal role in strengthening health security in the Indo-Pacific.
The workshop follows the One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. Discussions will focus on risk communication, community engagement, disease surveillance, and capacity building. Delegates will also participate in simulations aimed at refining response strategies for pandemics like Avian Influenza, Mpox, and ebola, while promoting cross-border coordination.
A significant part of the event includes field visits to India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Centre for Vector-Borne Disease Control, offering delegates first-hand insights into India’s public health infrastructure and emergency response systems.
As an outcome of the 6th Quad Leaders’ Summit held in September 2024, the workshop serves as a platform for global health security collaboration. Senior health officials and technical experts from Quad nations—India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—are joined by over 25 delegates from 15 Indo-Pacific countries, including Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, as well as international health organizations.

Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:50:26 +0000
Content: US Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation tour, on Monday said that Washington and New Delhi are engaged in high-level discussions on trade tariffs.
Speaking to ANI, Gabbard highlighted the potential for strengthening economic ties between the two nations.
“What I have heard from Indian government officials over the past few days is that there is a strong opportunity to enhance our economic relationship,” Gabbard said. She added that while tariffs have been a point of contention, both nations are approaching the issue with a constructive outlook.
“Prime Minister Modi is prioritizing India’s economic interests and opportunities for its people, just as President Trump is focused on the US economy and the well-being of Americans. Both leaders are committed to finding a solution that works for both sides,” she said.
Gabbard pointed out that both President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are pragmatic leaders who are actively seeking mutually beneficial solutions. She stressed the importance of ongoing discussions at various levels of government.
“What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders with common sense, looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is taking place not only at the highest level but also among cabinet members and secretaries. This is key to mapping out a sustainable path forward,” she said.
She also expressed optimism about the growing interest from the private sector in both India and the United States, suggesting that economic collaboration extends beyond government negotiations.
According to Gabbard, the personal friendship between PM Modi and President Trump has set a strong foundation for expanding bilateral ties. She recalled the Prime Minister’s visit to the White House, which helped establish a shared vision for cooperation.
“As you know, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump are already good friends. Their White House meeting set a positive tone for the US-India partnership, and there is immense potential to strengthen it further,” she said.
During her discussions with Indian government and intelligence officials, Gabbard explored opportunities for deeper collaboration in intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She emphasized that the partnership holds “nothing but opportunity” for both nations.
Beyond geopolitics, Gabbard also spoke about her personal admiration for Indian philosophy, mentioning her inspiration from the Mahabharata, particularly Krishna’s teachings to Arjuna.

Title: Results speak for themselves: PM Modi on India-Pakistan cricket rivalry
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:00:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on the iconic India-Pakistan cricket rivalry in a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman. He also emphasised the role of sports in bridging divides and uniting people across borders.
The prime minister was asked about the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan, particularly in terms of which country has the stronger cricket team. Fridman also raised the question of how sports, especially cricket and football, can play a role in easing geopolitical tensions.
PM Modi underscored the unifying power of sports, highlighting that it goes beyond mere competition and plays a crucial role in connecting people across nations.
“I think sports have the power to energize the entire world. The spirit of sports brings people together from different nations. That’s why I would never want to see sports being discredited. I truly believe that sports play a major role in human evolution. They’re not just games; they connect people on a deeper level,” he said.
“Now, coming to the question of who’s better and who’s not, when it comes to techniques in sports, I’m not an expert. Only those who specialize in the technical aspects can judge which techniques are superior and who the best players really are. But sometimes, the results speak for themselves,” the PM added.
“Just a few days ago, India and Pakistan played a match. The result reveals which is the better team. That’s how we know,” the PM stressed.
The prime minister was referring to the recently concluded Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan in Dubai, where India comfortably defeated their arch-rivals by six wickets.
India has overwhelmingly dominated Pakistan in ICC World Cups, winning 14 out of 15 encounters, with Pakistan securing only one victory in a T20 World Cup match. India also leads 8-0 in ODI World Cups.

Title: US reports first outbreak of deadly H7N9 bird flu since 2017
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:20:30 +0000
Content: The United States reported the first outbreak of the deadly H7N9 bird flu on a poultry farm since 2017, as the country continues to grapple with another bird flu strain that has infected humans and caused egg prices to hit record highs.
The spread of avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has ravaged flocks around the world, disrupting supply and fuelling higher food prices. Its spread to mammals, including dairy cows in the U.S., has raised concerns among governments about a risk of a new pandemic.
The strain that has caused most damage to poultry in recent years and the death of one person in the U.S. is the H5N1.
The H7N9 bird flu virus has proved to have a high death rate for humans worldwide killing 616 people, or 39%, of the 1,568 people infected worldwide since it was first detected in 2013 in China, the World Health Organisation said.
The WHO has said that both forms of the bird flu virus do not appear to transmit easily from person to person.
The latest outbreak of H7N9 in the U.S., detected on a farm of 47,654 commercial broiler breeder chickens in Noxubee, Mississippi, was confirmed on March 13, the Paris-based World Animal Health Organisation said in a report on Monday, citing U.S. Authorities.
The Mississippi departments of agriculture and health did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. response to bird flu was disrupted in the early weeks of the Trump administration, when federal agencies cancelled congressional briefings and meetings with state animal health officials, according to Reuters reporting.
Some of that coordination has since resumed and the USDA says it will spend $1 billion to tackle the spread of the virus.

Title: Top creditor China approved no loans to Cambodia in 2024, data shows
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:19:10 +0000
Content: China signed no new loans to Cambodia last year, latest data from Cambodia’s finance ministry shows, in a dramatic reversal by the country’s top creditor that if continued could affect infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation.
With about $4 billion in outstanding loans, China accounts for more than a third of the country’s debt, Cambodian government data shows. That makes it the largest creditor, with a stock worth around one-tenth of Cambodia’s gross domestic product.
The collapse in signed loan agreements last year contrasts with new credit deals worth $302 million in 2023, and $567 million in 2022, according to the official data.
China’s loans to Cambodia have largely gone to infrastructure projects, such as roads, airports and power transmission lines.
Listed by the United Nations as a Least Developed Country, Cambodia is highly reliant on foreign financing, the IMF noted in a January report.
China’s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing has extensively supported Cambodia’s development in recent years and “will continue to provide assistance to Cambodia’s economic and social development to the best of its ability.”
Beijing has downsized its overseas investments in recent years and some projects it funded in Cambodia were seen as unsuccessful, officials have said.
Meas Soksensan, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s finance ministry, told Reuters on Monday the government was not concerned by the fall in loans, noting credit agreements depended on feasibility studies. “New projects are being discussed and will be signed soon,” he added.
Cambodia has announced Chinese investment for a new canal with an estimated cost of $1.7 billion that could be the country’s most expensive infrastructure project, but so far Beijing has not disclosed any figure for its possible contribution.
Chinese disbursements for previously agreed loans continued last year but at a lower pace than in the past, the data shows.
Cambodia received credit worth nearly $241 million from Beijing last year, down from $366 million in 2023 and $301 million in 2022, the official data showed.

Title: India records 47.90% surge in foreign tourist arrivals in 2023
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:50:59 +0000
Content: India witnessed a significant boost in Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in 2023, recording a 47.90% increase compared to the previous year, according to data released by the Bureau of Immigration. Union Minister for Tourism and Culture, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, revealed the figures in a written statement to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The country welcomed 9.52 million foreign tourists in 2023, reflecting a robust recovery in global travel post-pandemic. Of this, 4.40 million arrivals were for leisure, holiday, and recreation purposes, registering an impressive 86.96% growth over 2022. Foreign tourists visiting India for business and professional reasons totalled 0.98 million, marking a 49.66% rise from the previous year.
Foreign tourist arrivals have now recovered to 87.1% of pre-pandemic levels, closely aligning with the global recovery rate of 88.8%, and significantly surpassing the Asia-Pacific region’s recovery rate of 65.4%.
The surge in FTAs is attributed to the post-pandemic revival of international travel and India’s growing reputation as a diverse and culturally rich destination. Enhanced air connectivity, improved tourism infrastructure, and targeted marketing campaigns have played a crucial role in making India a preferred destination for global travellers.
The Ministry of Tourism has implemented various initiatives to support this growth, including the development of tourism infrastructure through schemes like ‘Swadesh Darshan,’ ‘PRASHAD,’ and financial assistance to states for tourism development. The Ministry also promotes India’s tourism offerings through campaigns such as ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ and ‘Chalo India,’ along with events like the International Tourism Mart and Bharat Parv.
In addition to these efforts, India has expanded its tourism appeal through niche sectors like wellness tourism, culinary tourism, and eco-tourism. Further measures include capacity-building programs like the ‘Incredible India Tourist Facilitator’ (IITF) and collaborations with the Ministry of Civil Aviation to improve air connectivity under the RCS-UDAN scheme, which has operationalized 53 tourism routes.
India’s e-Visa scheme, which is available to citizens of 167 countries across nine categories, including e-Tourist, e-Business, and e-Medical visas, has further streamlined the entry process for foreign visitors, contributing to the rise in FTAs.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).

Title: FIFA report finds wide discrepancy in women’s pay, contracts, attendance
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:13:01 +0000
Content: The average annual salary for a female professional soccer player globally is $10,900, says FIFA’s annual report on the women’s game, a figure skewed by a small number of top clubs.
Among the teams FIFA designated as Tier 1, which includes 41 clubs from 16 countries, the average salary was around $24,030, although 16 of those top clubs paid an average gross salary of over $50,000, according to the “Setting the Pace, FIFA Benchmarking Report on Women’s Football” released on Monday.
The highest of those salaries was approximately $120,000.
The average gross salary, however, at Tier 2 and 3 clubs was $4,361 and $2,805, respectively.
“There is a need for players of a certain standard to earn a reliable and sufficient income solely from playing, reducing their dependence on secondary sources of income and allowing them to dedicate the time required to play at a higher level,” the report said.
Tier 1 clubs also featured the longest player contracts, most commonly between one and three years, with salaries highest for contracts of two to three years, while Tier 3 teams were most likely of the tiers to offer contracts under three months.
“A longer contract enables players to commit to a club and a location, giving them more stability so they can focus on their footballing careers,” said the report.
It also highlighted the attendance as an area of concern.
LEAGUE RECORD
While Arsenal hosted Manchester United in front of a Women’s Super League record 60,160 fans at Emirates Stadium last year, Tier 1 teams averaged 1,713 fans, while Tiers 2 and 3 were 480 and 380, respectively.
Arsenal were among the 23% of clubs that played some matches at a stadium other than their regular ground, playing five home league games at The Emirates and the rest at Meadow Park, which has a seating capacity of 1,700 and a total capacity of 4,500.
“For clubs in Tier 1, the average attendance at the other stadium was typically double that at the regular stadium, indicating that the sport can attract larger audiences on occasion,” the report said.
Women are under-represented in coaching roles, with 22% of head coaches across all tiers being female. There is more gender equity among officials, with 42% of referees being female, ranging from 57% in Tier 1 leagues to 25% in Tiers 2 and 3.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the report helps clubs, leagues and stakeholders gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success.
“The strides made in recent years have been remarkable, but there is still more work to be done to unlock its full potential,” he said.
Surveys for “Setting the Pace” were sent to 135 leagues and 1,518 clubs, with a total of 677 clubs in 90 leagues responding.
FIFA tiers were determined by factors such as whether the league had a club licensing system, the number of a league’s players who featured in the 2023 Women’s World Cup, and a member association’s total budget for women’s football among others.

Title: Lok Sabha to discuss railway, Jal Shakti grants; opposition seeks adjournment
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:49:08 +0000
Content: The Lok Sabha is scheduled to take up discussions and voting on the demands for grants pertaining to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Jal Shakti today. According to an official list released by Secretary General Utpal Kumar Singh on Tuesday, the session will see Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and C. R. Patil presenting the demands for grants under their respective ministries.
In addition to the discussions on the Railway and Jal Shakti Ministries, thirteen other Union Ministers are expected to lay papers related to their respective portfolios. 
Meanwhile, the Opposition has stepped up its efforts to raise key concerns by submitting adjournment motions. Congress MPs have filed motions seeking immediate discussion on two pressing issues—the affordability and quality of medicines, and the impact of the Reserve Bank of India’s new regulations on jewel loans.
Congress MP Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion highlighting the potential hardships caused by the RBI’s recent policy change. Tagore pointed out that under the previous rule, customers could repay only the interest accrued on jewel loans during the loan period and had the option to renew their loan without settling the entire principal amount. However, the new rule mandates repayment of the full amount before customers can repledge their jewelry for fresh loans. He expressed concern that this change would severely affect small businesses, farmers, and financially vulnerable sections of society.
Another Congress MP, Vijay Vasanth, raised concerns over the rising cost of medicines, emphasizing that the sharp increase in drug prices has placed a heavy burden on ordinary citizens. Citing data from the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), he noted that the prices of more than 800 essential medicines have surged by 10-20 percent over the past five years. Vijay Vasanth also called for a discussion on the affordability of life-saving drugs, the dominance of pharmaceutical monopolies, and the limited contribution of India’s domestic pharmaceutical industry, particularly in areas such as the local manufacturing of oncology medicines.
The Lok Sabha reconvenes at 11 a.m. today after a break for the Holi festival, which lasted until March 17.

Title: Zinc supplements can halt growth of cancer cells
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:39:36 +0000
Content: A team of researchers has recently suggested that taking zinc supplements can significantly inhibit the rapid growth of cancer cells in the human body.
The researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington in Texas found that zinc supplements can significantly inhibit the proliferation of esophageal cancer, which affects the tube running from the throat to the stomach.
They explained that zinc impedes overactive calcium signals in cancer cells, a feature absent in normal cells, and thus zinc selectively inhibits cancer cell growth.
Team lead Zui Pan stated that zinc selectively halts the growth of cancer cells but not normal esophageal epithelial cells.
Pan added that this study could provide a pathway for better esophageal cancer prevention and treatment.
Zinc deficiency has been observed in many cancer patients, and both clinical data and animal studies have shown that this mineral is essential for overall body health and cancer prevention, Pan noted.
Zinc is an important element in many proteins and enzymes, and without it, cells cannot function properly, the authors explained.
“It now appears that zinc and calcium can have a cross-talk, meaning that they can be linked.”
An insufficient amount of zinc can lead to the development of cancer and other diseases, Pan said.
“That’s why it is important to maintain a good diet,” she added.
Zinc-enriched foods include spinach, flax seeds, beef, pumpkin seeds, and seafood like shrimp and oysters.
Pan said that in the future, they will study how these two signals interact, how they impact each other, and how researchers can leverage this knowledge. Such steps could guide the development of better prevention and treatment strategies, she concluded.
The research appeared in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology journal.

Title: India women’s team has changed view of female sport, says Kohli
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:39:05 +0000
Content: The achievements of India’s women’s cricket team in recent years have revolutionized perceptions towards women’s sport, driving increased engagement, commercial success, and financial stability, according to batsman Virat Kohli.
The India women’s team, who won silver at the Commonwealth Games and gold at the Asian Games in 2022, are third in the International Cricket Council’s Twenty20 and one-day rankings, trailing only Australia and England.
“I think what the India women’s cricket team has done over the last few years, they are the ones who were the catalysts to put the attention onto them,” Kohli said at the RCB Innovation Lab Indian Sports Summit on Saturday in Bengaluru.
“I literally saw it happening like in a timespan of six, seven years. The way they started playing, you could see the belief that people started engaging in a lot more.
“Eventually, it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women’s game and then you have the WPL (Women’s Premier League).”
While the men’s Indian Premier League started in 2008, it took 15 years for women to have their own T20 league in India.
Kohli, the T20 World Cup, and Champions Trophy winner, said the league has taken the game “two to three levels higher than it used to be.
“You can’t just look at the men for the improvement of sport in any country. It has to be a collective sports culture and it includes everyone. And women’s sport is a massive part of it,” Kohli said.
“We have so much talent in women’s sport, not just cricket, but all the other sports. We have had great individual athletes over the years – tennis, badminton, wrestling, and boxing.
“… It’s definitely heading in the right direction and it keeps getting more backing and more infrastructure to be developed for them as well as for their sport to grow.”
DRIVING FORCE
Cricket has been the driving force behind change in the sporting ecosystem in India but women’s participation in other sports in the country still needs more support and platforms for exposure.
Former Australia soccer player and FIFA Council member Moya Dodd, echoed Kohli’s sentiments, saying the success of women’s cricket in India would pave the way for the development of other sports in the country.
“I think there’s room for more than one sport and even though one sport may lead, I think it does create space for women to participate in other sports,” she said at the Summit on Friday.
“I think seeing the success of the WPL… it’s extraordinary and that does help shift mindset and cultural views towards women playing sport full stop and that will help other sports.”
Dodd compared the potential impact of the India women’s cricket team to that of the Matildas, Australia’s national women’s football team, which she said created a “social movement around gender equality, women’s empowerment, and inclusion.
“The success of women’s cricket in India will drive that movement, and other women’s sports will gain the permission of society to also reflect that and build their growth from that.”

Title: Raisina Dialogue 2025: Jaishankar calls for strong, fair UN, says “Kashmir invasion was made into a dispute”; highlights importance of international order
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:33:13 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday stressed the importance of having an international order just like a domestic order. He slammed the United Nations for making the Kashmir invasion a dispute and turning the attacker and victim at par and called for having a “strong and fair” UN.
In his remarks at the Session on ‘Thrones and Thorns: Defending the Integrity of Nations’ at Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday, Jaishankar called the occupation of some parts of Kashmir by Pakistan “the longest standing illegal occupation” of territory by another country after the Second World War.
When asked about his earlier remarks, where he said, “If you don’t have an order, then you are looking at a very anarchic world’, Jaishankar responded, “Look, I think we do need an international order just like we need a domestic order. Just like you need a society in a country, you need an international version of that and its not just big countries who will benefit if there is no order. I would argue that any country which would take risk, which would have an extreme positions, which would test the system will actually use the disorder to its advantage. I mean we have seen in our own neighbourhood. You don’t have to a big country to be a risky country. I have smaller neighbours who have done a pretty good job. So, first of all, we should all understand the importance of an order.”
“Now, the old order, it was an order, it was a product of its times. But, why I felt its virtuals were exaggerated was I think the rule maker and rule taker had somewhat different perspective because I also said in the same interview that if you are at the receiving end of those rules or the application of those rules, we had issues and let me give you two or three practical examples. You know, if you capriciously, you know, if it suits your interests, somebody is good, not good, well, I’ll make up my mind how they’re going to do and you apply that order to the same country on the same issues differently,” he added.
He said that the Taliban was welcomed in the Doha process and Oslo. He stressed that when it suits to deal with the Taliban, it is okay and when it is not, it is called extremist.
“Take Afghanistan, so, the same Afghanistan, the same Taliban which was an outlier was welcomed in the Doha process, was welcomed in Oslo, apparently, at that time people were okay with it. Today again we going back saying, Taliban is doing all these not so good things. Now, if they were doing all of that. what was discussed in Oslo and Doha. You know you had a British general who described them at that time as they are country boys with their own honour code. Now, so when it suits you to deal with the Taliban, they are okay. When it is not, they are not okay. You are an extremist today, you wear a suit and tie, you are okay. You know, I think I have a problem with that all,” Jaishankar said.
The EAM termed sovereignty and territorial integrity the “bedrock of global rules.” He also spoke on political interference, where he mentioned that when the West goes into other nations, it is “apparently in the perseverance of democratic freedoms.” However, he noted that when other nations come into the West, it appears to have a “very malign intention.”
Jaishankar said, “Let’s give you a second example. We all speak of sovereignty and territorial integrity. All of us agree. It’s a vital principle. It’s a bedrock of global rules. After the Second World War, the longest standing illegal, I would say presence, occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India, what we saw in Kashmir. Now we went to the UN, what was an invasion was made into a dispute. So the attacker and the victim were put on par. Who were the culpable parties? UK, Canada, Belgium, Australia, USA. So, pardon me, I have some question marks on that one. Now, I can give you many more. We speak today of political interference. When the West goes out into other countries, it’s apparently in perseverance of democratic freedoms. When other countries come into the West, it seems to have a very malign intention.”
Calling for a strong and fair UN, EAM Jaishankar said, “So I think we need to have an order, there must be fairness. agree with you, Dominique, we need a strong UN, but a strong UN requires a fair UN. A strong global order must have some basic consistency of standards. We have military crews to our east in Myanmar. They are no-no. We have them even more regularly to the west. You know where? They seem to be okay. I think it’s important to audit the working of the world for the last eight decades and be honest about it and to understand today that the balances, the share holdings in the world have changed. We need a different conversation. We need frankly in that sense a different order.”
Slovakia’s Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Juraj Blanar, former Sweden Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Liechtenstein’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport, Dominique Hasler, Fiker Institute Founder Dubai Abulhoul participated alongside Jaishankar in this session.
The Raisina Dialogue, which is being held in Delhi from March 17-19, is hosted by the Observer Research Foundation in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs. It is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics committed to addressing the most challenging issues facing the global community.

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:25:18 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla, inaugurated a two-day orientation programme for the members of the Delhi legislative assembly on Tuesday. The event aimed at equipping the legislators with the knowledge and skills required for effective governance and legislative procedures.
The inaugural session was attended by Vijender Gupta, Speaker of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Rekha Gupta, Chief Minister of Delhi, along with Delhi government ministers and members of the Delhi legislative assembly.
In his inaugural address, Lok Sabha Speaker, praised the Delhi legislative assembly for its transition into a democratic system in the new India. He urged the members to strive towards making the Delhi assembly a model legislature that sets standards for others to follow.
Birla emphasized the importance of maintaining a smooth functioning of the Assembly, saying, “There should not be deadlock in the House. Dissent should be expressed in a dignified manner, with meaningful dialogue.” He also stressed that the expectations and aspirations of the public from the new government are exceptionally high, highlighting the critical role that Delhi’s elected representatives play in meeting those expectations.
“The public representatives of Delhi are accountable not just to the people of Delhi but to the entire nation, which will closely observe their work,” Birla said.
The Lok Sabha Speaker further underscored that to be an effective public representative, legislators must have an in-depth knowledge of the Constitution, the rules, and procedures of the House. He advised the members to actively participate in the House discussions to improve their understanding and effectiveness as public representatives.
“To discharge the responsibilities of a public representative effectively, one must constantly work to improve their capacity and efficiency,” said Birla, adding that the importance of the Question Hour and other legislative tools cannot be overstated. Members would only be able to take full advantage of these processes if they are well-versed in the rules and procedures of the House.
He also highlighted the vital role of committees, describing them as “mini assemblies,” and encouraged members to actively participate in their meetings.
Speaking about the role of the Opposition, the Lok Sabha Speaker emphasized the need for a positive and constructive approach, stating, “The foundation of democracy is based on dialogue and consensus.”

Title: India’s direct tax collections rise 16% to ₹25.86 lakh crore
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:20:31 +0000
Content: India’s direct tax collections have increased by 16.2%, totaling ₹25.86 lakh crore during the period from April 1, 2024, to March 16, 2025, as per the most recent figures from the Income Tax Department, compared to the same period in the previous financial year.
Direct taxes include corporate tax, personal income tax, and securities transaction tax (STT). Corporate tax collections surged to ₹12.40 lakh crore in the current financial year, up from ₹10.1 lakh crore in the same period last year. Personal income tax receipts also saw a notable increase, rising to ₹12.90 lakh crore from ₹10.91 lakh crore in the previous year.
STT collections experienced a sharp rise, reaching ₹53,095 crore compared to ₹34,131 crore in the prior year. However, other taxes, including wealth tax, saw a slight dip, dropping from ₹3,656 crore to ₹3,399 crore.
After accounting for refunds, which increased by 32.51% to ₹4.6 lakh crore, net direct tax collections stood at ₹21.26 lakh crore, reflecting a 13.13% year-on-year increase from ₹18.8 lakh crore.
The increase in tax collections highlights the country’s strong macroeconomic position. It enables the government to raise funds for large infrastructure projects, support welfare initiatives for the poor, and maintain fiscal discipline. A lower fiscal deficit reduces borrowing needs, leaving more funds in the banking system for corporate investments, ultimately contributing to higher economic growth and job creation.
Additionally, a lower fiscal deficit helps control inflation, stabilizing the economy and ensuring sustainable growth.

Title: Government e marketplace surpasses Rs.5 lakh crore GMV ahead of FY 2024-25 year-end
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:06:55 +0000
Content: The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) has reached a significant milestone by crossing Rs.5 lakh crore in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), just weeks before the financial year 2024-25 concludes. This achievement underscores GeM’s rapid growth as a key platform for public procurement, benefiting over 1.6 lakh government entities across India.
According to a statement from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry on Monday, the platform’s growth has been particularly impressive, with the leap from Rs.4 lakh crore to Rs.5 lakh crore happening in under 50 days since January 23.
In recent months, GeM has implemented key policy reforms to increase market accessibility and support a wide range of sellers, including Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), startups, and women-led businesses. Changes such as the reduction in transaction charges, vendor assessment fees, and caution money requirements have made the platform more inclusive. By February 13, over 22 lakh sellers and service providers were registered on GeM, contributing to a vibrant and competitive procurement environment.
This year also marks the sixth anniversary of SWAYATT, an initiative promoting startups, women, and youth through digital transactions. As of mid-February, GeM had successfully onboarded more than 29,000 startups and 1.8 lakh Udyam-verified women-led businesses, furthering its mission of economic inclusivity.
Technological advancements have also played a pivotal role in boosting procurement efficiency. In FY 2024-25, GeM executed one of the largest cloud migrations by a government organization, enhancing scalability and improving the platform’s reliability. The integration of AI-powered search tools, through GeM AI, has further streamlined procurement by providing users with real-time data insights for informed decision-making.

Title: Piyush Goyal supports New Zealand PM’s proposal for FTA signing in 60 days
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:54:21 +0000
Content: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has endorsed New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s ambitious proposal to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two nations within 60 days. Speaking at the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI on Tuesday, Goyal expressed confidence in expediting the process, stating that he aims to achieve the agreement “equally fast, maybe even faster.”
“So we are two aspirational friends working together in a spirit of cooperation, respecting each other’s sensitivities. And we will be aspiring to do this equally fast, maybe faster,” Goyal told reporters on the sidelines of the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI, while standing alongside New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay.
Goyal highlighted India’s prior achievement of signing a trade pact with the UAE in just 90 days, emphasizing that no one had anticipated such a swift conclusion.
“But I’ve also always said that no free trade agreement is ever negotiated with a gun on anybody’s head. There’s never a timeline or a sacrosanct deadline. But it’s good to be aspirational. Both our leaders, Prime Minister Luxon and Prime Minister Modi, are ambitious about strengthening this relationship, creating opportunities for the youth of both countries, and leveraging the strengths of New Zealand and India,” Goyal added.
“Our job is to ensure that we do a good job, ensuring a win-win situation for both countries, resulting in expanded opportunities and economic growth.”
He further expressed confidence that the India-New Zealand FTA would be a comprehensive agreement.
“We don’t foresee any difficulties. We will cover the entire gamut of a full-fledged comprehensive economic partnership between New Zealand and India, addressing every issue of mutual interest,” Goyal said.
New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of delivering a strong agreement.
“We have to make sure that we do a good job for the business communities of both India and New Zealand. Our negotiators will come together very soon. It’s encouraging to see that the relationship between India and New Zealand has strengthened to the point where our leaders are urging us to meet frequently and advance our discussions,” McClay said.
Earlier at the FICCI event, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his commitment to signing the FTA with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi within the proposed 60-day timeline.
“We are very ambitious. We have massive aspirations. We can move forward in the world with positivity and confidence, ensuring that we achieve what we deserve. The people of our two countries deserve the best. Despite the challenges, we are well-positioned to accomplish exceptional results for both our nations in the years and decades ahead,” Luxon remarked in his address.
India and New Zealand formally launched negotiations for a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial” Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Sunday, coinciding with Luxon’s arrival in New Delhi for a five-day official visit.
A meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and his New Zealand counterpart Todd McClay in New Delhi laid the groundwork for strengthening economic and trade ties between the two nations.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, New Zealand exported goods and services worth USD 0.84 billion to India, while India’s exports to New Zealand amounted to USD 0.91 billion, bringing the total trade value to USD 1.75 billion.
India primarily imports wool, iron and steel, fruits and nuts, and aluminum from New Zealand. Meanwhile, Indian exports to New Zealand include pharmaceuticals, mechanical machinery, textile articles, pearls, precious stones, and metals.
At the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is visiting India from March 16 to 20.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising ministers, senior officials, business representatives, media personnel, and members of the Indian diaspora in New Zealand.
This marks Prime Minister Luxon’s first visit to India in his current capacity.
On Monday, Luxon held discussions with Prime Minister Modi, covering various aspects of India-New Zealand relations.
Additionally, Luxon served as the chief guest and keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the 10th Raisina Dialogue 2025, held on March 17 in New Delhi.
As part of his itinerary, Luxon will visit Mumbai on March 19-20, where he is scheduled to engage with Indian business leaders and representatives from diverse sectors.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis won’t ‘dial down’ under US pressure or Iranian appeals
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:03:29 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthis will not “dial down” their action against Israeli shipping in the Red Sea in response to U.S. military pressure or appeals from the group’s allies such as Iran, the Yemeni militant group’s foreign minister said.
Jamal Amer spoke to Reuters late on Monday after the U.S. launched a wave of strikes in areas of Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, who said last week they were resuming attacks on Red Sea shipping to support Palestinians in Gaza.
Two senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran had delivered a verbal message to the Houthi envoy in Tehran on Friday to cool tensions and that Iran’s foreign minister asked Oman, which has mediated with the Houthis, to convey a similar message to the group when he visited Muscat on Sunday. Both officials asked not to be named.
Iran has not made any public comment about recent outreach to the Houthis over their renewed action. Tehran says the group takes decisions independently.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis.
“There will be no talk of any dialling down of operations before ending the aid blockade in Gaza. Iran is not interfering in our decision but what is happening is that it mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things,” Amer said, in his first comments on the issue to a foreign news agency.
Speaking from Yemen’s capital Sanaa, which has been hit by U.S. strikes, he said he had not been informed of any message Iran delivered to the Houthi envoy in Tehran.
There were messages from other powers to dial down, he said, but added: “Now we see that Yemen is at war with the U.S. and that means that we have a right to defend ourselves with all possible means, so escalation is likely.”
IRANIAN CONCERNS
Iran, whose network of proxies and allies across the Middle East has taken a hammering since the war in Gaza erupted in 2023, has shown increasing concern it could be drawn deeper into conflict with the United States. Iran and Israel exchanged direct strikes for the first time last year as the Gaza war escalated.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers that curbed its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief, has stepped up a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since returning to office for a second term in January.
“(The U.S.) is threatening Iran and hitting Yemen. Now all scenarios are possible. We will do what they will do to us. If they are hitting us from (U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S.) Truman, we will retaliate by hitting Truman,” the Houthi foreign minister said.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Yemeni group says it is aligned with Tehran and its ‘Axis of Resistance’ network without being puppets. Experts on Yemen, where the Houthis expanded control during years of civil war, say the group seems mainly motivated by domestic concerns and support base.
The Houthis said on March 12 they had resumed attacks on Israeli ships using routes that pass through the Red Sea after the group said Israel had not met a Houthi deadline for ending an aid blockade on Gaza.
Israel’s blockade, which includes food and medical supplies, began on March 2 as a standoff over a ceasefire deal in Gaza escalated. Israel launched heavy strikes on Gaza overnight into Tuesday.
WAVES OF STRIKES
The Houthis had launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas, another of Iran’s regional allies, in Gaza. It suspended operations when the Gaza ceasefire came into effect in January.
The Houthi foreign minister said the group had aimed only to target Israeli ships, but the U.S. had escalated and the Houthis had a right to defend themselves.
The U.S. began a wave of strikes on Saturday that have hit the capital and expanded across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, killing dozens of people.
Amer said some European Union countries had advised the Houthis not to escalate, and said the group had sought to reassure them that the target was Israeli shipping.
He also said Saudi Arabia, which backed Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthis in the civil war, had not intervened militarily so far, and nor had other Gulf states. That was something that Houthis valued, he added, while warning that Gulf states risked being caught in the crossfire if they intervened militarily.
“If any aircraft or base is used against us then we will escalate and we will defend ourselves, but if they (Gulf states) continue to be neutral we will stay away,” he said.
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Indore to launch India’s first PPP green waste processing plant under Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:33:38 +0000
Content: In a significant leap toward environmental sustainability, Indore is set to become the first city in India to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model-based green waste processing plant under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban. This initiative aims to revolutionize waste management by converting green waste into valuable, eco-friendly resources.
The plant, built on 55,000 square feet of land in Bicholi Hapsi, will process green waste like wood, branches, leaves, and flowers, and generate revenue for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), which will earn approximately Rs 3,000 per tonne in royalty for supplying wood and branches. The facility will recycle this green waste into wooden pellets, serving as a sustainable alternative to coal and contributing to energy conservation efforts.
Each day, the city of Indore generates around 30 tons of green waste, a figure that can rise to 60-70 tons during peak seasons like autumn. As part of the project, large tree branches will be redirected to the Green Waste Processing Plant at City Forest for repurposing into valuable products. Additionally, green waste from major institutions will be collected and sent to the facility, under a fixed fee structure.
Astronomical Industries Private Limited has partnered with the IMC to process this waste into sawdust, which will undergo a drying process over 3-4 months, reducing its moisture content by 90%. Once dried, the material will be processed into fine dust particles using cutting-edge machinery, transforming it into a resource for various industries.
The sawdust produced will serve multiple eco-friendly purposes, including being used as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuel sources, crafting durable packing materials to replace plastic, enhancing furniture manufacturing, and even producing biodegradable disposable plates for the food industry. Additionally, the sawdust will be used to create fertilizers that help enrich soil and promote healthier crops for farmers.
The IMC will play a critical role by providing land and transporting green waste to the facility, while Astronomical Industries will manage the installation, operation, and maintenance of the plant. Other private companies have also contributed to waste management in the city by setting up plants like Meghdoot and sub-grade facilities to process garden waste, as well as composting in municipal gardens.
The initiative is set to contribute significantly to improving waste management practices, reducing pollution, and controlling the Air Quality Index (AQI) by offering a sustainable alternative to coal.

Title: Poland and Baltic nations plan to pull out from landmines convention
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:57:04 +0000
Content: NATO members Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plan to withdraw from the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines due to the military threat from their neighbour Russia, the four countries said on Tuesday.
Quitting the 1997 treaty, which has been ratified or acceded to by more than 160 nations but not by Russia, will allow Poland and the three Baltic countries to start stockpiling landmines again.
“Military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased,” the countries’ defence ministers said in a joint statement.
“With this decision we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs,” they said.
The planned withdrawal was done to allow an effective protection of the region’s borders, Lithuanian Defence Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a separate statement.
Finland said in December it was also considering pulling out of the international agreement because of Russia’s use of such weapons in Ukraine.

Title: India Innovation Summit: TB cases hit record 26.07 lakh in 2024, incidence down 17.7% since 2015
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:56:46 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Patel, inaugurated the India Innovation Summit – “Pioneering Solutions to End TB” at the Bharat Mandapam Convention Centre in Delhi.
The event comes as India’s National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) reaches a major milestone, with 26.07 lakh TB cases notified in 2024, the highest ever recorded. Since 2015, the incidence rate of TB has dropped by 17.7%, from 237 cases per lakh population to 195 in 2023, while TB-related deaths have decreased by 21.4%.
Addressing the summit, Patel highlighted these achievements and praised the transformative role of innovation in India’s TB elimination efforts. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has made remarkable strides in TB control,” she said. “The number of missing cases has been reduced from 15 lakh in 2015 to 2.5 lakh in 2023.”
The summit, jointly organized by the Department of Health Research (DHR), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the Central TB Division (CTD) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, aims to fast-track India’s progress toward eliminating TB by 2025.
Patel also detailed the advancements in TB treatment, including the rollout of a shorter, safer oral regimen for drug-resistant TB across all states and Union Territories, which has improved treatment success rates from 68% in 2020 to 75% in 2022. She highlighted the introduction of the mBPaL treatment regimen, which is 80% more effective in treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and reduces treatment duration to six months.
Further, she discussed the Energy Dense Nutritional Support (EDNS) initiative for undernourished TB patients, and the expansion of the Ni-kshay Mitra Initiative, which provides additional support and food baskets to TB patients and their household contacts. The financial assistance for TB patients under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana has been doubled to ₹1,000 per month, effective November 2024.
Patel also underscored the impact of the ongoing “TB Mukt Bharat – 100 Days Intensified Campaign,” launched on 7th December 2024, covering 455 high-priority districts. The campaign focuses on early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and comprehensive care for vulnerable populations, with the report set to be released on World TB Day in March 2025.
Highlighting innovations, Patel revealed that ICMR has validated three indigenous handheld X-ray devices, enabling more accessible TB screening for vulnerable populations. Additionally, AI-based tools like DeepCXR are enhancing the speed and accuracy of TB detection, and indigenous molecular diagnostic tests, such as PathoDetectTM, are expanding the capacity for early detection of drug resistance.
Dr. V. K. Paul, Member of NITI Aayog, praised India’s progress and emphasized the need for innovation in TB detection and treatment. He reiterated India’s commitment to eliminating not only TB but also five other diseases—Leprosy, Lymphatic filariasis, Measles, Rubella, and Kala-azar—within the next five years.
The one-and-a-half-day summit brings together over 1,200 participants from academia, industry, healthcare, and research to showcase more than 200 innovations. It aims to foster collaborations and ensure that cutting-edge solutions are integrated into national TB programs, reaffirming India’s goal of eliminating TB by 2025.

Title: Sensex soars 1,131 points, Nifty ends above 22,800 as markets rally
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:49:49 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed sharply higher on Tuesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty delivering notable gains, driven by broad-based buying across sectors.
The Sensex jumped 1,131.31 points, or 1.53 per cent, to settle at 75,301.26, while the Nifty advanced 325.55 points, or 1.45 per cent, finishing the session at 22,834.30. During intraday trade, the Sensex touched a high of 75,385.76, and the Nifty oscillated between 22,599.20 and 22,845.95.
This marked the second consecutive session of strong performance for the benchmark indices, buoyed by sustained investor optimism.
According to Sundar Kewat from the Institutional Equity Desk, the rally was predominantly supported by gains in realty, automobile, metal, and banking stocks. “From an options data perspective, we noticed the highest open interest on the call side at 23,000 and 23,500 levels, while the put side showed concentration at 22,500 and 22,700,” Kewat noted.
Adding to the bullish sentiment was softer-than-expected US retail sales data, which spurred hopes that the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates later this year. This global cue, combined with robust domestic fundamentals, contributed to the day’s strong momentum.
The overall market breadth remained firmly positive, with 2,715 stocks advancing, 1,153 declining, and 117 remaining unchanged. Leading the gains on the Nifty were stocks like ICICI Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Shriram Finance, Larsen & Toubro, and Tata Motors. However, Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, and Tech Mahindra were among the few counters that ended in the red.
Sectorally, all indices closed in positive territory. Notable gains were seen in auto, capital goods, consumer durables, metal, power, realty, and media stocks, which rose between 2 to 3 per cent.
The upbeat mood extended to the broader markets as well. The Nifty Smallcap100 index surged by 2.71 per cent, while the Nifty Midcap100 index climbed 2.10 per cent, reflecting strong participation from small- and mid-cap counters.
Additionally, the Indian rupee appreciated against the US dollar, strengthening by 23 paise to end at 86.56 per dollar, compared to the previous close of 86.79.
Investor confidence remained robust, lifting the markets to fresh highs and signalling positive sentiment across sectors.

Title: Japan eye win over Bahrain to become first team to qualify for 2026 World Cup
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:22:45 +0000
Content: Japan will become the first nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Thursday if they defeat Bahrain at Saitama Stadium as Hajime Moriyasu’s side looks to continue their imperious form in Asia’s preliminaries.
Three points would guarantee Japan a top-two finish in Group C and see them join co-hosts the United States, Canada, and Mexico at next year’s finals.
The Japanese have dropped only two points from their six qualifiers—a 1-1 draw with Australia in October—and are 10 points ahead of third-placed Indonesia with four games left.
Australia occupies the second automatic qualification berth in the group, nine points behind the Samurai Blue, but the Socceroos are just a point clear of Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and China.
“Nothing is decided yet, and I believe we should prioritize how we can play to our abilities to win the game right in front of us and make sure of securing World Cup qualification,” Moriyasu said when naming his squad last week.
Australia hosts an Indonesia side playing under new coach Patrick Kluivert for the first time, while Saudi Arabia faces China in Riyadh.
Perennial qualifiers South Korea is on the verge of advancing from Group B, with Hong Myung-bo’s side needing to defeat Oman in Goyang on Thursday and then pick up another positive result against Jordan to book their spot.
The South Koreans have 14 points from their six qualifiers, three ahead of second-placed Iraq, with Jordan in third a further two points adrift.
Iraq, who are looking to qualify for the finals for the first time since 1986, host fifth-placed Kuwait in Basra while Palestine takes on Jordan in Amman.
Iran can also close in on a place at the finals when they host the United Arab Emirates in Tehran in Group A.
Amir Ghalenoei’s team tops the standings from Uzbekistan by three points while sitting a further three ahead of the UAE.
Uzbekistan, chasing their first-ever appearance at a World Cup, hosts Kyrgyzstan in Tashkent while Qatar entertains North Korea, needing a win to maintain their chances of automatic qualification.

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:15:25 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a meeting with his Netherlands counterpart, Ruben Brekelmans, in Delhi on Tuesday.
Brekelmans is visiting India to attend the Raisina Dialogue, which is currently underway in New Delhi from March 17. The Raisina Dialogue 2025 is being hosted by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). It is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics, aimed at addressing the most challenging issues facing the global community.
Nearly 3,700 attendees, including over 800 speakers and delegates from around 130 countries worldwide, are attending the Raisina Dialogue. The participants include serving and former heads of state, ministers, lawmakers, diplomats, policy planners, military leaders, heads of multilateral institutions, business leaders, and eminent thinkers. The theme of this year’s Raisina Dialogue is “Kalachakra: People, Peace, Planet.”
Earlier this month, Netherlands Ambassador to India, Marisa Gerards, stated that India and the Netherlands share a “very strong bilateral relationship.”
“We have a very strong bilateral relationship. We go back a long way. We were one of the first countries to recognize the independence of India. We have significant trade and investment ties,” she said.
Speaking to ANI, Gerards mentioned that the Netherlands is the fourth-largest foreign investor in India, with around 300 Dutch companies operating here.
“We are the fourth-largest investor in your country. About 300 different Dutch companies are very active. On the other hand, we also have a number of Indian companies investing in the Netherlands. Currently, we are working on a strategic partnership to explore further opportunities in trade and investment, security, innovation, and research. We collaborate across various sectors, including water management, health, agriculture, energy, ports, logistics, and climate. Innovation and high-tech research are key areas of cooperation, which strengthens our relationship,” she said.
However, Gerards believes that there is still much more to be done. She emphasized that the green energy sector holds great potential for further collaboration.
“I think there’s a lot of room for further growth. Green energy, particularly green hydrogen, is very high on our agenda. We are also collaborating with both the central government and companies in Gujarat. Several Dutch companies are involved in your ports. The Port of Rotterdam, which is the largest port in Europe, is keen to explore more opportunities in the areas of green energy and green hydrogen,” Gerards added.

Title: Coal India requests BSE, NSE to waive penalty
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:27:50 +0000
Content: Coal India Ltd (CIL) has approached the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), requesting a waiver of the penalties imposed on the company for non-compliance with SEBI’s regulations concerning the appointment of Independent Directors, including one woman director, on its Board.
Both BSE and NSE have levied penalties of ₹9.7 lakh each on the state-owned coal mining giant for failing to meet the provisions outlined under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, for the quarter ending December 31, 2024.
In its appeal, CIL clarified that the non-compliance was neither due to negligence nor deliberate default on the company’s part. It emphasized that the issue was beyond the control of its management and that consistent efforts have been made to fulfill the regulatory requirements.
Coal India explained that, being a government-owned entity under the administrative control of the Ministry of Coal, the appointment of Board members falls under the jurisdiction of the President of India. As per its Articles of Association, the company does not have the authority to appoint its Board members independently. The company has been regularly following up with the Ministry of Coal to expedite the appointment of the requisite number of Independent Directors, including a Woman Independent Director, as mandated by SEBI.
In a regulatory filing on March 18, CIL disclosed that it had received formal notices from both exchanges on March 17, citing violations of specific regulations—namely, Regulations 17(1), 18(1), 19(1 & 2), and 21(2) of the SEBI LODR. Consequently, a fine of ₹9,69,960 each was imposed by the BSE and NSE.
CIL expressed optimism in its filing, stating that in the past, similar requests for penalty waivers had been favourably considered by the stock exchanges.

Title: Trump and Putin discuss Ukraine war, Russia says the talks have ended
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:12:07 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the Ukraine war on Tuesday in a phone call which Washington hoped would convince Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire and move towards a permanent peace deal.
The White House said the talks had begun at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) and White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino wrote on social media that the call was “going well”.
The Kremlin said the talks had ended, Russia’s TASS news agency reported.
Kirill Dmitriev, who was named by Putin last month as his special envoy on international economic and investment cooperation, said that under the leadership of Trump and Putin the world had become a much a safer place.
Ukraine has already agreed to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two, in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced and towns have been reduced to rubble.
Putin, whose forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, said last week he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a truce but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Trump hopes also to secure progress towards a longer-term peace plan, which he has hinted could include territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
The Kremlin said before the call that Trump and Putin would discuss settling the conflict in Ukraine and normalising relations between Russia and the United States, and that they would speak “for as long as they deem necessary.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was already a “certain understanding” between the two leaders, based on a phone call they held on February 12 and on subsequent high-level contacts between the two countries.
“But there are also a large number of questions regarding the further normalisation of our bilateral relations, and a settlement on Ukraine,” Peskov told reporters.

Content: A delegation of six Supreme Court judges, led by Justice BR Gavai, will visit relief camps in violence-affected Manipur on March 22 to strengthen legal and humanitarian support for the displaced communities.
The delegation comprises Justices BR Gavai, Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, MM Sundresh, KV Viswanathan, and N Kotishwar, all of whom will engage with internally displaced persons (IDPs) and oversee various relief initiatives.
Justice Gavai, who serves as the Executive Chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), will virtually inaugurate legal services camps and medical camps across all districts of Manipur, along with new legal aid clinics in Imphal East, Imphal West, and Ukhrul districts.
The visit will include the distribution of essential relief materials to IDPs. Additionally, the legal services camps will facilitate access to government welfare programs, ensuring displaced individuals can benefit from, healthcare services, pensions, employment schemes, identity document reconstruction.
“Each participating state department will outline at least five key schemes tailored to address the needs of the displaced population. A team of 25 specialized doctors from Chennai will conduct medical camps across all relief camps. Their services will continue for six additional days, ensuring sustained medical support, treatment, and access to essential medicines for displaced families,” NALSA stated.
NALSA, in collaboration with the Manipur State Legal Services Authority (MASLSA), has played a critical role in offering legal aid and support to affected communities. So far, 273 special legal aid clinics have been established at relief camps, assisting IDPs with accessing government benefits, retrieving lost documents, and receiving medical aid.
“This visit underscores NALSA’s steadfast commitment to justice, especially for marginalized and vulnerable communities. By bridging the gap between legal rights and accessibility, NALSA aims to ensure that every displaced person receives the support, protection, and resources they need to rebuild their lives with dignity,” the organization stated.
The Supreme Court delegation will visit relief camps in Manipur on March 22, coinciding with the Duo Decennial Celebration of the High Court of Manipur.
Violence erupted in Manipur on May 3, 2023, following a rally organized by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM). The conflict primarily involved Hindu Meiteis and tribal Kukis, who are Christians. The unrest escalated across the state, prompting the Central government to deploy paramilitary forces to restore order.

Title: Election Commission holds high-level meeting on EPIC-Aadhaar linking, emphasizes Constitutional compliance
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:50:57 +0000
Content: The Election Commission of India (ECI), led by Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, convened a crucial meeting with key officials and technical experts on Tuesday to discuss the linking of Voter ID (EPIC) with Aadhaar.
Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, along with the Union Home Secretary, Secretary of the Legislative Department, Secretary of MeitY, CEO of UIDAI, and technical experts of the ECI, participated in the meeting.
The Commission reaffirmed that the process will strictly adhere to Article 326 of the Constitution and relevant provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950. In line with a Supreme Court ruling, the ECI emphasized that Aadhaar serves only as proof of identity and not citizenship. Technical consultations between UIDAI and ECI experts will soon commence on the matter.
“As per Article 326 of the Constitution of India, voting rights can only be given to a citizen of India; an Aadhaar card only establishes the identity of a person,” the Commission said.
“Therefore, it was decided that the linking of EPIC with Aadhaar will be done only as per the provisions of Article 326 of the Constitution, Sections 23(4), 23(5), and 23(6) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and in line with the Supreme Court judgment in WP (Civil) No. 177/2023. Accordingly, technical consultations between UIDAI and the technical experts of ECI are to begin soon,” the statement added.
Meanwhile, within less than a month of assuming office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar has initiated a series of proactive and definitive measures to address long-pending electoral challenges, some of which have remained unresolved for decades.
According to sources within the Election Commission of India (ECI), these steps aim to enhance transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency in the electoral process ahead of the upcoming elections.
As part of these efforts, the Election Commission is set to conduct All Party Meetings at the levels of Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), District Election Officers (DEOs), and Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) before March 31, 2025. This initiative seeks to foster direct engagement with political parties at every level of election management, ensuring that their concerns and suggestions are heard at the grassroots level.
For the first time in decades, the ECI has officially invited suggestions from all National and State-recognized political parties within the legal framework by April 30, 2025.

Title: Trump is considering recognising Ukraine’s Crimea as part of Russia, Semafor reports
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:59:30 +0000
Content: The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering recognising Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory in a possible future peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, the Semafor news website reported.
Semafor, citing two people familiar with the matter, said U.S. officials had also discussed the possibility of having Washington urge the United Nations to do the same.
Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Semafor said the White House had declined comment.
Semafor said Trump had not formally made any decisions, and that the possible Crimea moves were among various options being floated.
Trump was due to speak with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to try to convince the Russian President to accept a ceasefire in his country’s war with Ukraine and move towards a more permanent end to the three-year-old conflict.
Crimea is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine by most countries, and Kyiv has said it wants the Black Sea peninsula back even though it has recognised that returning it by force is unrealistic for now.
The Kremlin has repeatedly said that Crimea, where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based and whose pre-annexation population was mostly Russian speakers, is already formally part of Russia, a question it says has been closed “forever.”

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:43:17 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took to social media to share pictures from his meeting with renowned music composer Ilaiyaraaja, lauding him for his recent symphony performance in London.
Sharing several pictures on X, PM Modi expressed his admiration for the legendary composer. “Delighted to meet Rajya Sabha MP Thiru Ilaiyaraaja Ji, a musical titan whose genius has a monumental impact on our music and culture,” he wrote.
He further praised Ilaiyaraaja’s latest accomplishment: “He is a trailblazer in every sense and made history yet again by presenting his first-ever Western classical symphony, ‘Valiant,’ in London a few days ago. This performance, accompanied by the world-renowned Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, marks another milestone in his unparalleled musical journey—one that continues to redefine excellence on a global scale.”
Ilaiyaraaja also shared his thoughts on X, writing, “A memorable meeting with Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji. We spoke about many things, including my Symphony ‘Valiant.’ Humbled by his appreciation and support. @OneMercuri.”
Upon his return from London on March 10, Ilaiyaraaja received a grand welcome at Chennai Airport from political and cultural figures, including Tamil Nadu Minister Thangam Thenarasu, BJP State Vice President Karu Nagarajan, and VCK functionary Vanni Arasu.
Minister Thangam Thenarasu, on behalf of the Tamil Nadu government, honored Ilaiyaraaja for his contributions to Indian and global music. BJP’s Karu Nagarajan and VCK’s Vanni Arasu also extended their greetings, celebrating the maestro’s exceptional career.
Speaking to the media, Ilaiyaraaja expressed his gratitude to his supporters, particularly his fans in London. “Thanks to everyone. You all sent me off with smiling faces, which made the event hugely successful. The love I received from the fans during the Symphony was overwhelming. Every moment there was filled with appreciation from the audience,” he said.
Ilaiyaraaja, widely regarded as one of India’s greatest music composers, has left an indelible mark on the industry, particularly in Tamil and Telugu cinema.
Born as R. Gnanathesikan in 1943 in Pannaipuram, Theni district, Ilaiyaraaja began his musical journey at a young age. Over four decades, he has composed music for more than a thousand films, blending folk rhythms with classical techniques to create a distinctive sound that continues to captivate audiences.
His compositions are not just musical masterpieces but also reflect deep cultural and social themes, often carrying powerful political messages.
Some of Ilaiyaraaja’s most memorable compositions include, Machana Pathingala (Annakili, 1975) – Marking his debut in Tamil cinema, this song seamlessly blends folk rhythms with contemporary film music. Metti Oli Kaatrodu (Metti, 1980) – Sung by Janaki, this song remains a favorite for its enchanting lyrics and melody. Thenpaandi Cheemayile (Nayagan, 1987) – A deeply emotional classic that continues to resonate with listeners. Janani Janani (Thaai Moogambhigai, 1982) – A devotional anthem cherished by devotees even today. Uravugal Thodarkathai (Aval Appadithan, 1978) – Sung by K. J. Yesudas, this melody highlights Ilaiyaraaja’s mastery over emotion-laden music.

Title: Piyush Goyal supports New Zealand PM’s proposal for FTA signing in 60 days
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:54:21 +0000
Content: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has endorsed New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s ambitious proposal to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two nations within 60 days. Speaking at the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI on Tuesday, Goyal expressed confidence in expediting the process, stating that he aims to achieve the agreement “equally fast, maybe even faster.”
“So we are two aspirational friends working together in a spirit of cooperation, respecting each other’s sensitivities. And we will be aspiring to do this equally fast, maybe faster,” Goyal told reporters on the sidelines of the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI, while standing alongside New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay.
Goyal highlighted India’s prior achievement of signing a trade pact with the UAE in just 90 days, emphasizing that no one had anticipated such a swift conclusion.
“But I’ve also always said that no free trade agreement is ever negotiated with a gun on anybody’s head. There’s never a timeline or a sacrosanct deadline. But it’s good to be aspirational. Both our leaders, Prime Minister Luxon and Prime Minister Modi, are ambitious about strengthening this relationship, creating opportunities for the youth of both countries, and leveraging the strengths of New Zealand and India,” Goyal added.
“Our job is to ensure that we do a good job, ensuring a win-win situation for both countries, resulting in expanded opportunities and economic growth.”
He further expressed confidence that the India-New Zealand FTA would be a comprehensive agreement.
“We don’t foresee any difficulties. We will cover the entire gamut of a full-fledged comprehensive economic partnership between New Zealand and India, addressing every issue of mutual interest,” Goyal said.
New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of delivering a strong agreement.
“We have to make sure that we do a good job for the business communities of both India and New Zealand. Our negotiators will come together very soon. It’s encouraging to see that the relationship between India and New Zealand has strengthened to the point where our leaders are urging us to meet frequently and advance our discussions,” McClay said.
Earlier at the FICCI event, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his commitment to signing the FTA with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi within the proposed 60-day timeline.
“We are very ambitious. We have massive aspirations. We can move forward in the world with positivity and confidence, ensuring that we achieve what we deserve. The people of our two countries deserve the best. Despite the challenges, we are well-positioned to accomplish exceptional results for both our nations in the years and decades ahead,” Luxon remarked in his address.
India and New Zealand formally launched negotiations for a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial” Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Sunday, coinciding with Luxon’s arrival in New Delhi for a five-day official visit.
A meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and his New Zealand counterpart Todd McClay in New Delhi laid the groundwork for strengthening economic and trade ties between the two nations.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, New Zealand exported goods and services worth USD 0.84 billion to India, while India’s exports to New Zealand amounted to USD 0.91 billion, bringing the total trade value to USD 1.75 billion.
India primarily imports wool, iron and steel, fruits and nuts, and aluminum from New Zealand. Meanwhile, Indian exports to New Zealand include pharmaceuticals, mechanical machinery, textile articles, pearls, precious stones, and metals.
At the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is visiting India from March 16 to 20.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising ministers, senior officials, business representatives, media personnel, and members of the Indian diaspora in New Zealand.
This marks Prime Minister Luxon’s first visit to India in his current capacity.
On Monday, Luxon held discussions with Prime Minister Modi, covering various aspects of India-New Zealand relations.
Additionally, Luxon served as the chief guest and keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the 10th Raisina Dialogue 2025, held on March 17 in New Delhi.
As part of his itinerary, Luxon will visit Mumbai on March 19-20, where he is scheduled to engage with Indian business leaders and representatives from diverse sectors.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis won’t ‘dial down’ under US pressure or Iranian appeals
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:03:29 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthis will not “dial down” their action against Israeli shipping in the Red Sea in response to U.S. military pressure or appeals from the group’s allies such as Iran, the Yemeni militant group’s foreign minister said.
Jamal Amer spoke to Reuters late on Monday after the U.S. launched a wave of strikes in areas of Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, who said last week they were resuming attacks on Red Sea shipping to support Palestinians in Gaza.
Two senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran had delivered a verbal message to the Houthi envoy in Tehran on Friday to cool tensions and that Iran’s foreign minister asked Oman, which has mediated with the Houthis, to convey a similar message to the group when he visited Muscat on Sunday. Both officials asked not to be named.
Iran has not made any public comment about recent outreach to the Houthis over their renewed action. Tehran says the group takes decisions independently.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis.
“There will be no talk of any dialling down of operations before ending the aid blockade in Gaza. Iran is not interfering in our decision but what is happening is that it mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things,” Amer said, in his first comments on the issue to a foreign news agency.
Speaking from Yemen’s capital Sanaa, which has been hit by U.S. strikes, he said he had not been informed of any message Iran delivered to the Houthi envoy in Tehran.
There were messages from other powers to dial down, he said, but added: “Now we see that Yemen is at war with the U.S. and that means that we have a right to defend ourselves with all possible means, so escalation is likely.”
IRANIAN CONCERNS
Iran, whose network of proxies and allies across the Middle East has taken a hammering since the war in Gaza erupted in 2023, has shown increasing concern it could be drawn deeper into conflict with the United States. Iran and Israel exchanged direct strikes for the first time last year as the Gaza war escalated.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers that curbed its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief, has stepped up a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since returning to office for a second term in January.
“(The U.S.) is threatening Iran and hitting Yemen. Now all scenarios are possible. We will do what they will do to us. If they are hitting us from (U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S.) Truman, we will retaliate by hitting Truman,” the Houthi foreign minister said.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Yemeni group says it is aligned with Tehran and its ‘Axis of Resistance’ network without being puppets. Experts on Yemen, where the Houthis expanded control during years of civil war, say the group seems mainly motivated by domestic concerns and support base.
The Houthis said on March 12 they had resumed attacks on Israeli ships using routes that pass through the Red Sea after the group said Israel had not met a Houthi deadline for ending an aid blockade on Gaza.
Israel’s blockade, which includes food and medical supplies, began on March 2 as a standoff over a ceasefire deal in Gaza escalated. Israel launched heavy strikes on Gaza overnight into Tuesday.
WAVES OF STRIKES
The Houthis had launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas, another of Iran’s regional allies, in Gaza. It suspended operations when the Gaza ceasefire came into effect in January.
The Houthi foreign minister said the group had aimed only to target Israeli ships, but the U.S. had escalated and the Houthis had a right to defend themselves.
The U.S. began a wave of strikes on Saturday that have hit the capital and expanded across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, killing dozens of people.
Amer said some European Union countries had advised the Houthis not to escalate, and said the group had sought to reassure them that the target was Israeli shipping.
He also said Saudi Arabia, which backed Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthis in the civil war, had not intervened militarily so far, and nor had other Gulf states. That was something that Houthis valued, he added, while warning that Gulf states risked being caught in the crossfire if they intervened militarily.
“If any aircraft or base is used against us then we will escalate and we will defend ourselves, but if they (Gulf states) continue to be neutral we will stay away,” he said.
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Indore to launch India’s first PPP green waste processing plant under Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:33:38 +0000
Content: In a significant leap toward environmental sustainability, Indore is set to become the first city in India to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model-based green waste processing plant under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban. This initiative aims to revolutionize waste management by converting green waste into valuable, eco-friendly resources.
The plant, built on 55,000 square feet of land in Bicholi Hapsi, will process green waste like wood, branches, leaves, and flowers, and generate revenue for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), which will earn approximately Rs 3,000 per tonne in royalty for supplying wood and branches. The facility will recycle this green waste into wooden pellets, serving as a sustainable alternative to coal and contributing to energy conservation efforts.
Each day, the city of Indore generates around 30 tons of green waste, a figure that can rise to 60-70 tons during peak seasons like autumn. As part of the project, large tree branches will be redirected to the Green Waste Processing Plant at City Forest for repurposing into valuable products. Additionally, green waste from major institutions will be collected and sent to the facility, under a fixed fee structure.
Astronomical Industries Private Limited has partnered with the IMC to process this waste into sawdust, which will undergo a drying process over 3-4 months, reducing its moisture content by 90%. Once dried, the material will be processed into fine dust particles using cutting-edge machinery, transforming it into a resource for various industries.
The sawdust produced will serve multiple eco-friendly purposes, including being used as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuel sources, crafting durable packing materials to replace plastic, enhancing furniture manufacturing, and even producing biodegradable disposable plates for the food industry. Additionally, the sawdust will be used to create fertilizers that help enrich soil and promote healthier crops for farmers.
The IMC will play a critical role by providing land and transporting green waste to the facility, while Astronomical Industries will manage the installation, operation, and maintenance of the plant. Other private companies have also contributed to waste management in the city by setting up plants like Meghdoot and sub-grade facilities to process garden waste, as well as composting in municipal gardens.
The initiative is set to contribute significantly to improving waste management practices, reducing pollution, and controlling the Air Quality Index (AQI) by offering a sustainable alternative to coal.

Title: Poland and Baltic nations plan to pull out from landmines convention
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:57:04 +0000
Content: NATO members Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plan to withdraw from the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines due to the military threat from their neighbour Russia, the four countries said on Tuesday.
Quitting the 1997 treaty, which has been ratified or acceded to by more than 160 nations but not by Russia, will allow Poland and the three Baltic countries to start stockpiling landmines again.
“Military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased,” the countries’ defence ministers said in a joint statement.
“With this decision we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs,” they said.
The planned withdrawal was done to allow an effective protection of the region’s borders, Lithuanian Defence Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a separate statement.
Finland said in December it was also considering pulling out of the international agreement because of Russia’s use of such weapons in Ukraine.

Title: India’s agricultural and processed food exports see strong growth in FY2024
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:33:09 +0000
Content: India’s exports of agricultural and processed food products have experienced a significant 13 percent increase, reaching $22.67 billion during the April-February period of the current financial year.
According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, rice exports—including both basmati and non-basmati varieties—saw a substantial 21 percent jump, rising to over $11 billion from $9.32 billion during the same period last year. The increase comes after the government began easing restrictions on rice exports in September 2024, following a strong crop forecast. These restrictions were initially imposed in 2023 to curb domestic food inflation caused by a poor monsoon and crop shortages.
With the restrictions now lifted, rice exports surged by 13.21 percent in February 2025, reaching $1.19 billion compared to $1.05 billion in February 2024.
India’s tea exports have also hit a 10-year high, reaching 255 million kilograms in 2024, despite facing challenges from global geopolitical tensions. The Tea Board of India’s data shows a robust 10 percent increase from the previous year’s 231.69 million kilograms, marking a positive trend for the industry.
The price of Indian tea in international markets also rose by 10 percent, providing much-needed relief to the tea sector, which was affected by adverse weather conditions in 2023. Indian exporters capitalized on market opportunities in West Asia when Sri Lanka’s crop was low, and have successfully maintained strong shipment volumes to those regions.
India is one of the top five tea exporters globally, accounting for about 10 percent of total world tea exports. Its Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri teas are regarded as some of the finest globally, with black tea making up the majority of exports (approximately 96 percent). Other varieties, including regular tea, green tea, herbal tea, masala tea, and lemon tea, also contribute to the country’s diverse tea export portfolio.
India’s major tea export markets include the UAE, Iraq, Iran, Russia, the US, and the UK, and the increase in both export volumes and average prices bodes well for the country’s position as a global leader in tea production and export.

Title: Understanding the collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:17:43 +0000
Content: The fragile peace that had held in Gaza for nearly two months shattered on Tuesday as Israeli airstrikes pummeled the territory, killing more than 400 Palestinians, according to health officials. The renewed violence follows the collapse of a truce that had been in place since January, with both Israel and Hamas blaming each other for its failure.
“This is just the beginning,” warned Israeli officials as plumes of smoke rose over Gaza’s devastated landscape. The return to full-scale hostilities signals the failure of diplomatic efforts that had briefly offered hope for de-escalation in the long-running conflict.
At the core of the ceasefire breakdown is a fundamental impasse between Israel and Hamas. Israel has pursued two primary objectives—securing the release of hostages and dismantling Hamas as a governing force in Gaza. However, these goals have proven to be at odds with one another. The military campaign to eliminate Hamas jeopardizes the safety of the 59 hostages still held captive, complicating negotiations for their release.
Hamas, meanwhile, regards the hostages as its primary leverage in talks. The group has refused to release more captives unless Israel commits to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full military withdrawal from Gaza—conditions that Israel has categorically rejected as long as Hamas remains in power. This deadlock has stalled efforts to move beyond the initial phase of the ceasefire.
The truce, which began on January 19, had initially facilitated a prisoner exchange between the two sides, but it was only meant to be the first step in a broader peace process. The second phase, which was intended to secure a permanent resolution, has failed to progress due to these intractable differences.
Mediators from Egypt and Qatar have attempted to salvage the ceasefire by proposing a phased compromise. Their latest proposal would have Hamas release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander and the remains of four American hostages in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire extension. During this period, approximately half of the remaining hostages would be freed, and negotiations for a lasting truce would continue.
U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff recently visited the region to push for an agreement prioritizing hostage releases before discussions on ending the war. However, he accused Hamas of “publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.” Hamas, in response, insisted that it was simply upholding the original terms of the ceasefire rather than renegotiating a new agreement.
Israel had indicated as early as February that it would not withdraw from key strategic areas in Gaza, a stance that undermined the second phase of the truce agreement. With both sides unwilling to compromise on their core positions, the ceasefire collapsed, giving way to renewed military operations.
The conflict in Gaza is further complicated by rising regional tensions. Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have expressed support for Hamas, have launched attacks on international shipping and targeted Israel. In response, U.S. forces have carried out strikes against Houthi positions. The Houthis claimed to have launched drones at a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though American forces intercepted the attack.
Witkoff has warned that Hamas should take note of these developments, suggesting that further military escalation in the region could have consequences for the group.
Domestic political factors in Israel also play a role in the renewed hostilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced plans to remove his domestic security chief, citing a loss of trust. This marks the third senior security official to leave office in recent weeks, fueling speculation that Netanyahu’s government may be using military escalation to divert attention from ongoing legal and political challenges.
Hamas has accused Israel of abandoning the ceasefire agreement and warned that the remaining hostages face an uncertain fate. However, the group has not officially declared a return to full-scale war, instead calling for renewed international mediation.
With diplomatic efforts at a standstill, the suffering continues for both the hostages still held in Hamas tunnels and the Palestinian civilians enduring relentless bombardment. The international community faces the daunting challenge of bridging a seemingly unbridgeable gap, while the human toll continues to rise in a conflict where neither side appears willing to compromise on its core demands.

Title: Welcome back, Earth missed you: PM Modi hails Sunita Williams’ return
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:38:38 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday hailed NASA astronaut Sunita Williams’s return to Earth and said the achievement of Crew-9 astronauts “shows us what perseverance truly means.”
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Welcome back, #Crew9! The Earth missed you. Your journey has been a true test of grit, courage, and the boundless human spirit. Sunita Williams and the #Crew9 astronauts have once again shown us what perseverance truly means. Their unwavering determination in the face of the vast unknown will forever inspire millions.” 
PM Modi also praised those who worked tirelessly to ensure Williams’ safe return, saying, “Space exploration is about pushing the limits of human potential, daring to dream, and having the courage to turn those dreams into reality. Sunita Williams, a trailblazer and an icon, has exemplified this spirit throughout her career. We are incredibly proud of all those who worked tirelessly to ensure their safe return. They have demonstrated what happens when precision meets passion and technology meets tenacity,” PM Modi added. 
Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two veteran NASA astronauts and retired U.S. Navy test pilots, had launched into space as Starliner’s first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner’s propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a NASA decision to fold them into its crew rotation schedule and return them on a SpaceX craft this year.
On Tuesday, Wilmore and Williams strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
The four-person crew, formally part of NASA’s Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, plunged through Earth’s atmosphere, using its heatshield and two sets of parachutes to slow its orbital speed of 17,000 mph (27,359 kph) to a soft 17 mph at splashdown, which occurred at 5:57 p.m. ET some 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Coast under clear skies.

Title: Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket: Luxon
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:21:56 +0000
Content: New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon shared pictures of him and former New Zealand cricketer Ross Taylor playing ‘gully cricket’ with children in New Delhi.
In a post on X, Luxon said, “Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket,” highlighting the deep-rooted connection both countries share through the sport.
Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was amused by Luxon’s witty remark about the Champions Trophy 2025 final. During his address, Luxon joked that he had intentionally avoided mentioning cricket and the final to prevent a “diplomatic incident.”
“I really appreciate that PM Modi didn’t bring up New Zealand’s Champions Trophy loss to India, and I didn’t mention our Test victories in India. Let’s keep it that way and avoid a diplomatic incident,” Luxon said while PM Modi was seen laughing at the banter.
Taylor was also in attendance and even he was left amused by the banter between the two world leaders during the event.
India defeated New Zealand in the summit clash to claim the Champions Trophy 2025 title in Dubai last month.
Luxon had also praised the Indian cricket team for their dominant display in recent times.
“During PM Modi’s tenure, the men in blue (Indian cricket team) have been the most dominant side in cricket, most recently winning the Champions Trophy in Dubai against my men in black (New Zealand cricket team). They broke many many New Zealanders’ hearts in the process, including mine. I will be the bigger person and just say congratulations,” Luxon said.

Title: Trump releases JFK assassination documents
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:15:37 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump released material related to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday, seeking to honor his campaign promise to provide more transparency about the shock event in Texas.
An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website in the evening with a total of more than 80,000 expected to be published after Justice Department lawyers spent hours scouring them.
The digital documents, including PDFs of previously classified memos, offers a window into the climate of fear at the time surrounding U.S. relations with the Soviet Union shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 nearly led to a nuclear war.
The release is nonetheless likely to intrigue people who have long been fascinated with a dramatic period in history, with the assassination and with Kennedy himself.
Many of the documents reflected the work by investigators to learn more about assassin Lee Harvey Oswald’s time in the Soviet Union and track his movements in the months leading up to Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
An initial review of the papers did not show deviations from the central narrative.
Trump’s secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, has said he believes the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in his uncle’s death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless.
Kennedy Jr. declined comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s grandson, said on X on Tuesday: “The Trump administration did not give anyone in President Kennedy’s family ‘a heads up’ about the release.”
Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard history professor whose books include “JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century 1917-56,” said in an email the new documents may help fill in the picture.
“It’s valuable to get all the documentation out, ideally in unredacted form. But I don’t expect dramatic new revelations that alters in some fundamental way our grasp of the event,” he said.
One document with the heading “secret” was a typed account with handwritten notes of a 1964 interview by a Warren Commission researcher who questioned Lee Wigren, a CIA employee, about inconsistencies in material provided to the commission by the State Department and the CIA about marriages between Soviet women and American men.
Oswald was married to a Soviet woman, Marina Oswald, at the time of the shooting.
Department of Defense documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the U.S. involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s support of communist forces in other countries.
The documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the United States or escalate to the point “that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime.”
“It appears more likely that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin America,” the document reads.
One document released from January 1962 reveals details of a top secret project called “Operation Mongoose,” or simply “the Cuban Project,” which was a CIA-led campaign of covert operations and sabotage against Cuba, authorized by Kennedy in 1961, aimed at removing the Castro regime.
Trump signed an order shortly after taking office in January related to the documents release, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to find thousands of new documents related to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas.
In the scramble to comply with Trump’s order, the U.S. Justice Department ordered some of its lawyers who handle sensitive national security matters to urgently review records from the assassination, according to a Monday evening email seen by Reuters.
“President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a post on X.
Alice L. George, a historian whose books, including The Assassination of John F. Kennedy, explore modern America, said American’s curiosity about assassinations and questions about government transparency add “to a sense that there must be important evidence hidden away in these files.”
But she said government records were unlikely to resolve questions people still have.
“I think there may continue to be more record releases,” she said. “I seriously doubt that any will include great revelations. The Warren Commission report was done well, but it was done when many of the key players were alive. It’s much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.”
Kennedy’s murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Oswald. The Justice Department and other federal government bodies have reaffirmed that conclusion in the intervening decades. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.
Trump has also promised to release documents on the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were killed in 1968.
Trump has allowed more time to come up with a plan for those releases.

Title: Cabinet approves construction of 6-lane high-speed highway in Maharashtra
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:09:39 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the construction of a six-lane access-controlled Greenfield High-Speed National Highway from JNPA Port (Pagote) to Chowk in Maharashtra. The project, spanning 29.219 km, will be developed under the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) mode at a total capital cost of ₹4,500.62 crore.
The development of road connectivity to major and minor ports in India is a key focus area under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan principles. With the increasing container volume at JNPA Port and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, the need for enhanced National Highway connectivity in the region has been identified.
Currently, it takes 2-3 hours for vehicles to move from JNPA Port to the arterial Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) section of NH-48 and the Mumbai-Pune Expressway due to heavy congestion in urban areas such as Palaspe Phata, D-Point, Kalamboli Junction, and Panvel, with traffic volumes reaching approximately 1.8 lakh Passenger Car Units (PCU) per day. Following the operationalization of Navi Mumbai International Airport in 2025, the demand for direct connectivity is expected to increase further.
The newly approved project aims to address these connectivity challenges and enhance logistics efficiency between JNPA Port and Navi Mumbai International Airport. The highway alignment will commence at JNPA Port (NH 348) in Pagote village and conclude at Mumbai-Pune Highway (NH-48), while also linking the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Mumbai-Goa National Highway (NH-66).
To facilitate smooth movement of commercial vehicles, two tunnels will be constructed through the Sahyadri hills, eliminating the need to navigate the ghat section in the hilly terrain. This design ensures high-speed travel and ease of movement for large container trucks.
The new six-lane Greenfield highway corridor is expected to significantly improve port connectivity, ensuring safe and efficient freight movement.

Title: India’s role in ending Russia-Ukraine War welcomed by Munich Security Conference VC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:50:51 +0000
Content: The Vice Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Rainer Rudolph, has welcomed India’s contribution toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasizing the need to uphold international principles. Speaking on Wednesday, Rudolph described the conflict as a “war of aggression” by one United Nations member against another.
“Any contribution to peacefully end this war is welcome. This is not a conflict; this is a war of aggression by one member of the United Nations against another. It’s these principles that have to be kept in mind when we talk about ending the war peacefully,” Rudolph told ANI on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi.
Reaffirming the importance of safeguarding Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he added, “It’s important to remember that Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be maintained, and it’s the Ukrainians themselves who have to decide their country’s destiny.”
Commenting on the recent speech by United States Vice-President J.D. Vance at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday, Rudolph noted that while he may not entirely agree with Vance’s message to Europeans, it served as a “wake-up call” for the continent to strengthen its foreign policy.
“Obviously, he chose a public event to give his message to the Germans and to the Europeans beyond that, even if at first sight it was a domestic situation in Europe as he saw it, with which maybe I would not always agree with how he presented it. But still, it had a foreign policy effect because it served as a wake-up call to Europeans that we have to invest more in our security and develop a stronger European foreign policy,” he said.
Expressing confidence in the evolving US-Europe relationship, Rudolph remarked, “I think the relationship between Europe and the US will develop. JD Vance also said that, and the administration has since confirmed it. They are still committed to NATO and the alliance. The relationship is changing, and as far as we Europeans are concerned, we will have to contribute our share to common security.”
During the summit, Vance also criticized the tendency to “use cheap labor as a crutch,” arguing that it hampers global innovation.
“Our workers, the populists on the one hand, the tech optimists on the other, have been failed by this government,” Vance said, as reported by Fox News.
He further said, “Not just the government of the last administration, but the government in some ways of the last 40 years, because there were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization.”
Addressing how other nations are gaining ground on the United States, Fox News reported Vance as saying, “Now, we assume that other nations will always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end. We were squeezed from both ends. Now, that was the first conceit of globalization.”

Title: Cabinet approves implementation of Revised Rashtriya Gokul Mission with enhanced allocation for 2024-25 and 2025-26
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:31:30 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Revised Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) to boost growth in the livestock sector. The revised mission will be implemented as a Central Sector component of the Development Programmes scheme, with an additional outlay of ₹1,000 crore, bringing the total allocation to ₹3,400 crore for the 15th Finance Commission cycle from 2021-22 to 2025-26.
Two new activities have been introduced under the revised RGM. The first is a one-time assistance of 35 percent of the capital cost for the establishment of Heifer Rearing Centres, which will help in creating 30 housing facilities with a total of 15,000 heifers. The second initiative aims to encourage farmers to purchase High Genetic Merit (HGM) IVF heifers by providing a 3 percent interest subvention on loans taken from milk unions, financial institutions, or banks for such purchases. This will facilitate the systematic induction of high-yielding breeds.
The scheme will continue its core activities, including strengthening semen stations and artificial insemination networks, implementing bull production and accelerated breed improvement programs using sex-sorted semen, supporting skill development and farmer awareness initiatives, and establishing Centres of Excellence while reinforcing Central Cattle Breeding Farms.
With the implementation of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission and other government efforts, milk production has increased by 63.55 percent over the past decade. The availability of milk per capita, which stood at 307 grams per day in 2013-14, has risen to 471 grams per day in 2023-24. Productivity has also improved by 26.34 percent in the last ten years.
The Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) under RGM provides free artificial insemination at farmers’ doorsteps in 605 districts across the country where baseline AI coverage was below 50 percent. To date, over 8.39 crore animals have been covered, and 5.21 crore farmers have benefitted. RGM has also been at the forefront of introducing advanced breeding technologies to farmers. A total of 22 in vitro fertilization (IVF) labs have been set up under State Livestock Boards or universities, leading to the birth of 2,541 high-genetic-merit calves.
Additionally, the development of Gau Chip and Mahish Chip, genomic chips for indigenous bovines created by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the ICAR National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), along with Gau Sort, an indigenously developed sex-sorted semen production technology, marks a significant milestone in India’s self-reliance in dairy technology.

Title: Cabinet approves Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:30:11 +0000
Content: The union cabinet on Wednesday approved the incentive scheme for the promotion of low-value BHIM-UPI transactions (P2M) for the financial year 2024-25. The scheme is designed to encourage the adoption of the BHIM-UPI platform among small merchants and aligns with the government’s broader vision of transitioning towards a less-cash economy.
The initiative, with an estimated outlay of Rs 1,500 crore, will be implemented from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. The focus will be on low-value UPI transactions, specifically those under Rs 2,000, conducted by small merchants.
Under the scheme, small merchants will receive an incentive of 0.15% per transaction for transactions up to Rs 2,000, while large merchants will not be eligible for this incentive. For each quarter, 80% of the admitted claim amount will be disbursed without any conditions. However, the remaining 20% will be contingent upon meeting specific performance criteria. This includes maintaining a technical decline rate of less than 0.75% and ensuring system uptime greater than 99.5%.
The scheme is designed to improve financial access for small merchants, offering them greater opportunities to use digital payment solutions that can enhance cash flow and credit access. Citizens will also benefit from seamless UPI transactions with no additional charges, further encouraging the adoption of digital payments across the country. By promoting the use of UPI services like UPI 123PAY and UPI Lite, the scheme aims to reduce reliance on cash, particularly in rural and remote areas, while also contributing to the goal of financial inclusion.
The government’s objectives for this scheme include promoting the indigenous BHIM-UPI platform, with a target transaction volume of ₹20,000 crore in FY 2024-25. It also aims to strengthen the digital payment infrastructure, especially in underserved areas, and support the wider adoption of secure and reliable payment solutions.

Title: Cabinet approves revised ₹2,790 crore dairy development scheme to boost infrastructure
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:21:51 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Revised National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD), aimed at modernizing India’s dairy sector and ensuring its long-term growth. The scheme, classified as a Central Sector initiative, has been allocated an additional ₹1,000 crore, taking the total budget outlay to ₹2,790 crore for the duration of the 15th Finance Commission period from 2021-22 to 2025-26.
The revised programme is focused on strengthening the dairy infrastructure across the country. It seeks to boost milk procurement and processing capacity, improve quality control systems, and ensure better market access for dairy farmers. The initiative is designed to encourage value addition in the sector, streamline supply chain efficiency, and ultimately raise rural incomes, particularly benefiting women, who represent 70% of India’s dairy workforce.
The revised NPDD is structured around two key components. The first focuses on developing essential dairy infrastructure, including the establishment of milk chilling plants, advanced milk testing laboratories, and certification systems. It also prioritizes the formation of new village-level dairy cooperative societies and aims to bolster milk procurement and processing capacities, particularly in the North Eastern Region, hilly areas, Union Territories, and other remote regions. This component also includes financial support for the formation of two new Milk Producer Companies (MPCs).
The second component, known as “Dairying through Cooperatives (DTC),” continues efforts to sustainably develop dairy cooperatives. This component is being implemented in partnership with the Government of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under existing agreements. It targets improving dairy production, processing, and marketing infrastructure in nine states: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
Since its inception, the NPDD has had a considerable socio-economic impact. The scheme has benefited over 18.74 lakh farmers and generated more than 30,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities. It has increased milk procurement capacity by an additional 100.95 lakh litres per day.
The programme has also led to the strengthening of over 51,777 village-level milk testing laboratories and the installation of 5,123 bulk milk coolers with a combined capacity of 123.33 lakh litres. Additionally, 169 laboratories have been equipped with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) milk analysers, and 232 dairy plants have adopted advanced adulteration detection systems.
Under the revised NPDD, the government aims to establish 10,000 new Dairy Cooperative Societies and form two new Milk Producer Companies. The initiative is projected to generate an additional 3.2 lakh employment opportunities and further promote the use of advanced technology and quality testing infrastructure in the dairy sector.

Title: World Sparrow Day: Saving the ‘Goraiya’ to restore ecological balance
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:14:01 +0000
Content: World Sparrow Day, celebrated annually on March 20, aims to raise awareness about the alarming decline in sparrow populations due to urbanization, pollution, and habitat loss.
The day also promotes crucial conservation efforts to protect these small but vital birds, which play a key role in maintaining ecological balance.
Launched in 2010 by the bird conservation group “Nature Forever,” World Sparrow Day now spans over 50 countries, highlighting the urgent need to reverse the decline of sparrows. These birds are essential to ecosystems, controlling insect populations, aiding in pollination, and dispersing seeds—functions vital to both rural and urban environments.
According to a 2018 report by the Royal Society of London, the relationship between humans and sparrows dates back 11,000 years, illustrating their long-standing presence in our shared history.
In India, sparrows, known by various names such as “Goraiya” (Hindi), “Kuruvi” (Tamil), and “Chirya” (Urdu), are facing a sharp population decline.
Several factors, including the use of unleaded petrol that produces toxic compounds harmful to insects sparrows feed on, as well as pesticide use that reduces insect populations, have impacted their food supply. Additionally, rapid urbanization has led to the loss of nesting spaces in modern buildings, further shrinking their habitat.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change issued a statement underscoring the importance of World Sparrow Day, emphasizing that small actions—such as planting greenery, reducing pesticide use, and creating safe nesting spaces—can collectively support sparrow conservation.
Grassroots initiatives across India are already making strides. In Chennai, the Koodugal Trust has involved schoolchildren in building sparrow nests, resulting in over 10,000 nests between 2020 and 2024, significantly boosting local sparrow numbers.
In Mysuru, the “Early Bird” campaign educates children on the importance of sparrows through birdwatching trips, libraries, and village visits, fostering appreciation for these birds.
In 2012, the Delhi government declared the house sparrow as the state bird, marking its symbolic importance in the capital.
Several individuals are also contributing to sparrow conservation. The “Save the Sparrow” campaign, led by environmental conservationist Jagat Kinkhabwala, gained significant momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi supported it in 2017.
Rajya Sabha MP Brij Lal has built 50 nests at his home, where sparrows now return to lay eggs—a commitment praised by PM Modi as an exemplary initiative in the fight to protect sparrows.

Title: Sensex, Nifty extend gains for third straight session; midcap stocks outperform
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:40:17 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets maintained their upward momentum for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty closing higher.
The 30-share BSE Sensex touched an intra-day high of 75,568.38 before ending at 75,449.05, up 147.79 points or 0.20 per cent from the previous close. Similarly, the broader Nifty settled at 22,907.60, rising 73.30 points or 0.32 per cent. The index moved within a range of 22,940.70 and 22,807.95 during the session.
“Market sentiment remained buoyant, supported by mixed global cues and renewed optimism over a potential Russia-Ukraine truce,” said Vikram Kasat, Head of Advisory at PL Capital. He added that key global events, including the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, anticipated talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and former US President Donald Trump, and a surge in gold prices, also kept investors on edge.
Out of the Nifty 50 stocks, 33 closed in the green. Shriram Finance, HDFC Life, Apollo Hospitals, Tata Steel, and Power Grid Corporation were among the top gainers, posting gains of up to 3.91 per cent. Conversely, Tech Mahindra, Britannia, TCS, Infosys, and Sun Pharma were among the 17 laggards, with losses of up to 2.32 per cent.
Broader market indices outperformed the benchmarks. The Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 indices each rallied over 2 per cent, reflecting strong buying interest in mid- and small-cap stocks.
Sector-wise, most indices on the NSE closed in positive territory, except for FMCG and IT, which ended lower.
The markets opened on a flat but slightly positive note on Wednesday, even as global markets showed signs of weakness. At the opening bell, the Sensex rose by 80.04 points or 0.11 per cent to 75,381.30, while the Nifty edged up by 15.25 points or 0.07 per cent to 22,849.55.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee strengthened by 12 paise, closing at 86.44 against the US dollar, compared to the previous session’s close of 86.56.

Title: S. Jaishankar stresses importance of national security in business decisions at Raisina Dialogue
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:36:38 +0000
Content: National security has become a critical factor in business decisions, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital age, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Wednesday.
Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi during a session titled “Commissars and Capitalists: Politics, Business, and the New World Order,” Jaishankar highlighted that the swift changes in the global business landscape are increasingly shaped by national security concerns.
He noted that this growing awareness of security risks is now influencing economic decisions across industries worldwide.
“In the digital era, business decisions are increasingly being made with national security in mind, in a way that was not the case before,” Jaishankar explained. “There are different ways of dealing with weaponization. One is to stay on the right side of the weapon, so you don’t get hit while others do. But the reality is that today, the world makes business decisions factoring in national security like never before.”
Jaishankar suggested that these changes do not necessitate the creation of entirely alternative systems for critical industries like telecommunications or international couriers. Rather, he stressed the importance of collaborating with like-minded nations and partners who share similar security goals.
“Sometimes, you may find yourself compelled to create alternative systems, but I would argue that this is more of an aberration than a strategic desire to replace the existing systems,” he said. “If we can make the current systems work for us, it is the smarter choice.”
The minister also highlighted the importance of trust and reliability in today’s business relationships, especially in the digital era. He pointed out that partnerships in sectors like telecommunications are now defined more by comfort and security than by cost alone. “In the digital era, it’s not just about cost; it’s about comfort. It’s about trust. When making business decisions, we want to engage with those who ensure resilience, reliability, trust, and transparency,” Jaishankar added. “You want to do business with those who are secure.”
Jaishankar’s comments come amid the announcement of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet satellite service, which is set to launch in India. Starlink has partnered with major telecom players Jio and Bharti Airtel for the launch, but Jaishankar emphasized the importance of carefully assessing potential risks when forming business partnerships.
“Every partner offers some risks, yes, but you would rather take the risks with those whose interests align with yours, rather than those with whom your interests may clash,” he said.
In addition, Jaishankar discussed India’s ongoing trade negotiations with its key global partners, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. He underlined the importance of these relationships for India’s economic growth and technology partnerships. “India is currently engaged in three major trade negotiations with the EU, UK, and the US, these are our growth markets, these are our technology partners,” Jaishankar said.

Title: IOC session starts in Greece, president Bach presides for the last time
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:35:39 +0000
Content: The opening day of the 144th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session got underway in Greece on Wednesday (March 19), with the imminent presidential election looming large.
Outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach welcomed the members to the Greek town of Pylos and prepared to present a report ahead of Thursday’s election.
The candidates to replace Bach include international cycling chief David Lappartient, current IOC vice-president Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe, multiple Olympic swimming champion Kirsty Coventry, who is Zimbabwe’s sports minister, and Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan.
International Gymnastics Federation head Morinari Watanabe and Olympic newcomer and multimillionaire Johan Eliasch, who heads the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, complete the list.
While there is no clear front-runner, as was the case in 2013 when then-favourite Bach swept to victory, Coe, Samaranch and Coventry, long seen as Bach’s preferred choice, are considered to have an edge over the other candidates.
Just over 100 IOC members, including federation chiefs, national Olympic committee presidents, royalty and billionaires among others, will cast their votes on Thursday.
The new president is elected on an eight-year term with the possibility of re-election to a second four-year term for a maximum of 12 years in total.

Title: Google charged with breaching landmark EU rules, Apple told to open up to rivals
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:31:59 +0000
Content: Alphabet unit Google was hit with two charges of breaching landmark EU rules on Wednesday while Apple was ordered to help rivals connect with its iPhones and iPads, as antitrust regulators continued a crackdown against Big Tech.
The move by the European Commission came amid tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries which impose fines on U.S. companies.
Both Google and Apple have been in the European Commission’s crosshairs since March last year over concerns that they may not be complying with the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in the power of Big Tech via a list of dos and don’ts.
The Google case centred on whether it restricts app developers from informing users about offers outside its app store Google Play and whether it favours its vertical search services such as Google Flights in Google Search.
The EU competition watchdog on Wednesday issued preliminary findings charging Google of DMA violations in both areas, confirming a Reuters story on Feb. 21.
The Commission also issued two orders to Apple to open up its ecosystem to rivals, six months after it opened so-called specification proceedings against the iPhone maker.
The first charge in the Google case focused on the company’s practices on its app store Google Play. Alphabet technically prevents app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels for better offers, regulators said.
A service fee charged by the company for facilitating the initial acquisition of a new customer by an app developer via Google Play goes beyond what is justified, they added.
In the second charge, regulators said Google favoured its own services such as Google Shopping, Google Hotels and Google Flights over rivals.
Google pushed back, saying that EU competition rules are hurting consumers and businesses.
“The Commission’s findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of Search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses,” Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director, Competition, said in a blogpost.
He said if the company can’t charge reasonable fees to support the ongoing development of Android and the Play services, then it cannot invest in an open platform.
EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement that the measures “ensure that Alphabet abides by EU rules when it comes to two services widely used by businesses and consumers across the EU, Google Search and Android phones.”

Title: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s helicopter rides cost taxpayers over ₹31 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:01:37 +0000
Content: Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s extensive use of helicopter travel has sparked controversy, with official records revealing that his chopper expenses amounted to ₹12.65 crore in 2023-24 and ₹19.35 crore in 2024-25, up to January 15, 2025.
What has drawn further criticism is Siddaramaiah’s preference for helicopters even for short distances, such as Mysuru, which is just a 1.5-hour drive from Bengaluru. According to government documents tabled in the legislative assembly, ₹10.85 lakh was spent on a helicopter ride to Mysuru, despite the short travel time by road.
In response to a question raised by JD(S) MLC T.N. Javarayigowda in the Legislative Council regarding the Chief Minister’s use of jets and flights, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) confirmed that Siddaramaiah had opted for chopper travel even for nearby destinations like Mysuru.
The documents further reveal that the Chief Minister booked charter flights to destinations such as Delhi and Chennai, which are well-connected by commercial airlines. One instance highlighted a charter flight to Delhi that cost ₹44.40 lakh, while a business-class round-trip ticket on a commercial airline would have been approximately ₹70,000.
BJP leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar criticized Siddaramaiah’s travel expenses, alleging that the state’s financial priorities were misplaced. He accused the government of allocating significant funds for the Chief Minister’s private jets while development, farmer welfare, and infrastructure projects faced financial constraints.
“Wah @siddaramaiahavare wah! @RahulGandhi’s ‘paradigm change’ governance in full flow in Karnataka—No money for development, No money for farmers, No money for infra, but plenty of money for CM’s private jets and plenty of land to be grabbed,” Chandrasekhar posted on X.
Earlier in the day, a delegation of Karnataka BJP leaders met Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot at Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum against the state government’s Bills.

Title: TRAI tightens regulations to control spam calls, reduces action time against unregistered telemarketers
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:26:20 +0000
Content: In a decisive step to tackle the rising problem of spam calls, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, according to an official statement from the Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The updated regulations, announced on February 12, introduce stricter measures to strengthen customer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC).
Key highlights of the amendment include:
Extended Complaint Window: Customers can now file complaints about spam/UCC within 7 days of receiving the communication, an extension from the previous 3-day limit.
Reduced Action Time: The time frame for access providers to take action against unregistered senders of spam has been significantly reduced from 30 days to just 5 days, ensuring quicker response times.
Stricter Criteria for Action: TRAI has revised the threshold for triggering action against spam senders. Previously, action would be taken after 10 complaints were filed against a sender within 7 days. The new rule lowers this threshold to 5 complaints within 10 days.
These changes will take effect 30 days after their publication in the Official Gazette, with certain regulations coming into force after 60 days.
Additionally, TRAI had previously issued directions on August 13, 2024, mandating the disconnection of all telecom resources used by unregistered telemarketers (UTMs) for making spam calls. Since then, telecom operators have implemented widespread actions, leading to a notable decrease in complaints against UTMs—from 1,89,419 complaints in August 2024 to 1,34,821 in January 2025. Over 1,150 entities and individuals have been blacklisted, and more than 18.8 lakh telecom resources have been disconnected.

Content: President Vladimir Putin wants U.S. President Donald Trump to formally recognise all four Ukrainian regions that Moscow has claimed as its own in addition to Crimea, Russia’s Kommersant daily reported.
Citing unnamed sources who attended a private business event with Putin on Tuesday, Kommersant said that Putin wanted the U.S. to formally recognise the four regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – as part of Russia along with Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014.
Russia, though advancing on the battlefield, does not fully control any of the four regions.
In return for recognition and if it happened “in the near future”, Kommersant said Putin would undertake not to lay claim to the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and other Ukrainian territory.
Asked about the Kommersant report on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Trump had not discussed the idea on their call on Tuesday.
But he confirmed, without elaborating, that Putin had discussed the conflict in Ukraine at Tuesday’s closed door meeting with members of Russia’s business elite.
Peskov did not confirm, however, whether Putin had floated the idea of the U.S. recognising the four regions in addition to Crimea at the meeting.

Title: ‘Kavach 4.0’ to equip 10,000 locomotives in the next phase: Ashwini Vaishnaw
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:35:47 +0000
Content: India’s cutting-edge automatic train protection system called ‘Kavach 4.0’ is on track to equip 10,000 locomotives in the next phase (the project has been finalised), and 69 loco sheds have been prepared for the installation of the system, the government informed on Wednesday.
Bids for trackside works of Kavach for approximately 15,000 route kilometres (RKm) have been invited, covering all GQ, GD, HDN, and identified sections of Indian Railways, out of which works for 1,865 RKm have been awarded, Union Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.
“Currently, three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are approved for the supply of the Kavach System. To enhance capacity and expand implementation, trials and approvals for additional OEMs are at various stages,” said the minister.
Specialised training programmes on Kavach are being conducted at centralised training institutes of Indian Railways to impart training to all concerned officials.
“By now, more than 20,000 technicians, operators, and engineers have been trained on Kavach technology. Courses have been designed in collaboration with IRISET,” Vaishnaw informed.
The cost for the provision of trackside infrastructure, including station equipment of Kavach, is approximately ₹50 lakh per kilometre, while the cost for installing Kavach equipment on locomotives is approximately ₹80 lakh per locomotive.
“The funds utilised for Kavach works so far amount to ₹1,950 crore. The allocated funds for the year 2024-25 amount to ₹1,112.57 crore. Necessary funds are allocated based on project progress,” the minister noted.
Kavach is an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system that assists the Loco Pilot in operating the train within specified speed limits by automatically applying brakes if the Loco Pilot fails to do so. It also ensures safe train operations during inclement weather conditions.
Major improvements in Kavach Version 4.0 include enhanced location accuracy, improved signal aspect information in larger yards, station-to-station Kavach interface via OFC, and direct integration with the existing Electronic Interlocking System.
“Kavach version 4.0 covers all the major features required for the diverse railway network. This is a significant milestone in safety for Indian Railways. Within a short period, IR has developed, tested, and started deploying the Automatic Train Protection System,” informed the minister.

Title: Cabinet approves construction of 6-lane high-speed highway in Maharashtra
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:09:39 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the construction of a six-lane access-controlled Greenfield High-Speed National Highway from JNPA Port (Pagote) to Chowk in Maharashtra. The project, spanning 29.219 km, will be developed under the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) mode at a total capital cost of ₹4,500.62 crore.
The development of road connectivity to major and minor ports in India is a key focus area under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan principles. With the increasing container volume at JNPA Port and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, the need for enhanced National Highway connectivity in the region has been identified.
Currently, it takes 2-3 hours for vehicles to move from JNPA Port to the arterial Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) section of NH-48 and the Mumbai-Pune Expressway due to heavy congestion in urban areas such as Palaspe Phata, D-Point, Kalamboli Junction, and Panvel, with traffic volumes reaching approximately 1.8 lakh Passenger Car Units (PCU) per day. Following the operationalization of Navi Mumbai International Airport in 2025, the demand for direct connectivity is expected to increase further.
The newly approved project aims to address these connectivity challenges and enhance logistics efficiency between JNPA Port and Navi Mumbai International Airport. The highway alignment will commence at JNPA Port (NH 348) in Pagote village and conclude at Mumbai-Pune Highway (NH-48), while also linking the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Mumbai-Goa National Highway (NH-66).
To facilitate smooth movement of commercial vehicles, two tunnels will be constructed through the Sahyadri hills, eliminating the need to navigate the ghat section in the hilly terrain. This design ensures high-speed travel and ease of movement for large container trucks.
The new six-lane Greenfield highway corridor is expected to significantly improve port connectivity, ensuring safe and efficient freight movement.

Title: India’s role in ending Russia-Ukraine War welcomed by Munich Security Conference VC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:50:51 +0000
Content: The Vice Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Rainer Rudolph, has welcomed India’s contribution toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasizing the need to uphold international principles. Speaking on Wednesday, Rudolph described the conflict as a “war of aggression” by one United Nations member against another.
“Any contribution to peacefully end this war is welcome. This is not a conflict; this is a war of aggression by one member of the United Nations against another. It’s these principles that have to be kept in mind when we talk about ending the war peacefully,” Rudolph told ANI on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi.
Reaffirming the importance of safeguarding Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he added, “It’s important to remember that Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be maintained, and it’s the Ukrainians themselves who have to decide their country’s destiny.”
Commenting on the recent speech by United States Vice-President J.D. Vance at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday, Rudolph noted that while he may not entirely agree with Vance’s message to Europeans, it served as a “wake-up call” for the continent to strengthen its foreign policy.
“Obviously, he chose a public event to give his message to the Germans and to the Europeans beyond that, even if at first sight it was a domestic situation in Europe as he saw it, with which maybe I would not always agree with how he presented it. But still, it had a foreign policy effect because it served as a wake-up call to Europeans that we have to invest more in our security and develop a stronger European foreign policy,” he said.
Expressing confidence in the evolving US-Europe relationship, Rudolph remarked, “I think the relationship between Europe and the US will develop. JD Vance also said that, and the administration has since confirmed it. They are still committed to NATO and the alliance. The relationship is changing, and as far as we Europeans are concerned, we will have to contribute our share to common security.”
During the summit, Vance also criticized the tendency to “use cheap labor as a crutch,” arguing that it hampers global innovation.
“Our workers, the populists on the one hand, the tech optimists on the other, have been failed by this government,” Vance said, as reported by Fox News.
He further said, “Not just the government of the last administration, but the government in some ways of the last 40 years, because there were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization.”
Addressing how other nations are gaining ground on the United States, Fox News reported Vance as saying, “Now, we assume that other nations will always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end. We were squeezed from both ends. Now, that was the first conceit of globalization.”

Title: World War Two steam train ‘Canadian Pacific’ returns to the rails in England
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 07:28:05 +0000
Content: The ‘Canadian Pacific’, a 1940s steam train that took soldiers and supplies to England’s south coast during World War Two, returned to service on Wednesday, taking on board volunteers who spent 14 years reconditioning it and relatives of those who built it.
Billowing smoke from its chimney, the Canadian Pacific set off from the market town of Alresford, in southeast England, for an inaugural journey to nearby Alton marking the completion of a restoration project that began in 2011.
One of the volunteers for the project, 78-year-old retiree Stephen Wilson, said he believed his late mother could have been one of the many women involved in building the train in 1941, while men were away fighting.
“It’s the culmination of a lot of hard work by a lot of people and seeing it… (is) just brilliant,” he said with a big smile as he stood next to the green locomotive.
The train was named after the Canadian Pacific shipping lines that crossed the Atlantic during the war to deliver military and civilian supplies to Britain. Many such vessels were destroyed or damaged by the Nazis.
Seating with her family in one of train’s dining carriages, Blanche Chaisty, 68, said she was proud to be on board knowing that both her mother and grandmother helped build it.
“It’s a bit surreal,” Chaisty said. “I don’t quite know how to feel… it’s wonderful.”
After World War Two, the train was used for regular passenger services to and from the coast, often for holidaymakers. It was last taken out of service in 2008 and is now due to be revived for tourist trips on the heritage Watercress Line.
Canada’s deputy high commissioner in the UK, Robert Fry, was among those who participated in the inaugural trip.
“The railway for us is very symbolic of a united Canada at a time when we are talking a lot about our country and protecting our sovereignty,” he told Reuters, in a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent threats to annex Canada.

Title: India-Philippines ties have grown with expanding cooperation in energy, maritime security, and AI: Foreign Affairs Secretary Manalo
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 07:16:58 +0000
Content: Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary, Enrique Manalo, on Wednesday highlighted the rapid growth of India-Philippines ties as both nations celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations, underlining the expanded cooperation in key sectors like renewable energy, maritime security, cybersecurity, AI, and health, while reaffirming the need for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
Speaking to ANI, Secretary Manalo remarked on the evolving relationship, noting that while the two countries have been partners for centuries, the past 4-5 years have seen a remarkable surge in collaboration. “We are celebrating the 75th anniversary of official relations between the Philippines and India, but we have been partners for much longer. In recent years, our cooperation has grown by leaps and bounds,” Manalo said. He stressed that this enhanced collaboration spans a variety of sectors, including renewable energy, maritime cooperation, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, and health security. He also reaffirmed the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region, one that fosters peace, prosperity, and security for all its people.
Manalo met with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue 2025. Both leaders engaged in discussions on several crucial areas of collaboration, including connectivity, maritime cooperation, and strengthening India-ASEAN ties. Jaishankar later shared an update on their meeting through a post on X, noting the comprehensive discussions that took place on connectivity, maritime infrastructure, and the deepening of ASEAN partnerships.
The two nations are also in active discussions to establish a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA), aimed at boosting trade and commercial engagement. During his address to FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) members, Secretary Manalo emphasized the Philippines’ interest in deepening economic engagement with India in various sectors, including automotive, battery manufacturing, value-added IT and IT-enabled services (ITES), pharmaceuticals, health, and agriculture.
Notably, the Philippines has invited India to source nickel from the country, a strategic move to reduce its dependence on Chinese buyers. The Philippines is the world’s second-largest nickel producer and accounts for 11% of global nickel production, with a significant portion used in lithium-ion battery production. Manalo stressed that India’s participation in the Philippines’ nickel sector would not only help diversify its export markets but also contribute to the processing and development of a value chain. He pointed out that India currently imports significant quantities of raw nickel from countries like Russia, Norway, and Japan, making the Philippines an attractive alternative for supply chain realignment.
The Secretary also underscored the importance of accelerating negotiations on the PTA, which has been under preliminary discussion for the past two years. “We believe that a PTA will help diversify and expand commercial relations between our two Indo-Pacific economies,” Manalo said.
The Philippines is also undergoing a major vehicle modernization program and has extended an invitation to Indian commercial vehicle manufacturers to participate. Manalo highlighted India’s untapped potential as a market for Philippine exports, with an estimated potential of USD 577 million.
Bilateral trade between India and the Philippines reached approximately USD 3.5 billion in 2024, reflecting nearly a twofold increase over the past few years. FICCI President Harsha Vardhan Agarwal noted that India’s pharmaceutical industry plays a significant role in the Philippine market, accounting for about 20% of Indian pharmaceutical exports to the Asian region. Agarwal also pointed out the diversification of collaboration into new and strategic sectors such as waste management, green mobility, and agricultural technology. Additionally, the defense partnership between the two nations has grown, marked by India’s delivery of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines in April 2024.
To further enhance business engagement, the Philippine government has introduced an e-visa system for Indian travelers and business visitors. Secretary Manalo highlighted ongoing efforts to improve the visa system, making it more streamlined and accessible. “We are working on further improving the visa system, specifically for India, to encourage more business visitors and engagement,” Manalo said.
Philippine Ambassador to India, Josel Francisco Ignacio, elaborated on several facilitation measures, including a “fast track” process for legitimate businesses with investments in the Philippines. He also mentioned that the e-visa system allows multiple-entry visas valid for six months or one year, with ongoing improvements expected soon.

Title: Government expands National Youth Parliament Scheme, invites all citizens to participate in NYPS 2.0
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 06:59:58 +0000
Content: The government has launched a revamped version of the National Youth Parliament Scheme (NYPS) web portal, known as NYPS 2.0, aimed at broadening citizen participation in the mock parliamentary initiative, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs said in a statement on Wednesday.
What is NYPS?
First introduced in February 2019, the National Youth Parliament Scheme (NYPS) seeks to promote democratic values among India’s youth by providing a platform for engaging in structured debates on social, political, and governance issues. The scheme allows participants to simulate parliamentary proceedings, mirroring the functioning of the Indian Parliament.
Key Objectives of NYPS 2.0
The key objectives of NYPS 2.0 are to strengthen the roots of democracy, inculcate discipline and tolerance for diverse views, enable the student community and citizens to understand parliamentary procedures and enhance their knowledge of the Government’s functioning and Constitutional values, and foster a sense of living life in a democratic way.
Expanded Access and Inclusivity
The upgraded NYPS 2.0 expands its scope beyond students of recognized institutions, allowing all citizens to participate, irrespective of economic status, gender, caste, creed, religion, race, or region.
Participation Categories
The revamped scheme enables participation through three categories: Educational institutions can organize Youth Parliament sittings as per the guidelines on the portal. Students from classes VI to XII can participate in the “Kishore Sabha” sub-category, while Undergraduate and Postgraduate students can join the “Tarun Sabha” sub-category. Citizens can form groups to organize Youth Parliament sittings following the guidelines on the portal. Any individual citizen can participate by attempting a quiz on the theme “Bharatiya Democracy in Action.”
Growing Participation
Since its inception, the NYPS has seen varying levels of participation. Registration numbers for Youth Parliament sittings were 4,369 in 2019-20, 3,579 in 2020-21, and just 65 in 2021-22 due to the pandemic. Participation rebounded to 2,337 in 2022-23 and 1,346 in 2023-24. As of March 17, 2025, the 2024-25 period has already recorded 7,261 registrations, reflecting growing interest in the revamped scheme.

Title: Trump, Zelenskiy pledge in phone call to work for end to war in Ukraine
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 04:49:54 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed on Wednesday to work together to end Russia’s war with Ukraine, in what the White House described as a “fantastic” one-hour phone call.
In their first conversation since an Oval Office shouting match on February 28, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for U.S. support and the two leaders agreed that technical teams would meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days.
Zelenskiy asked Trump for more air defence support to protect his country against Russian attacks and the U.S. president said he would help locate the necessary military equipment in Europe, the White House said.
Trump briefed Zelenskiy on his phone call on Tuesday with Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian president rejected a proposed full 30-day ceasefire sought by Trump that Ukraine said it would be prepared to accept, but agreed to pause attacks on energy infrastructure.
That narrowly defined pause appeared in doubt on Wednesday, however, with Moscow saying Ukraine hit an oil depot in southern Russia while Kyiv said Russia had struck hospitals and homes, and knocked out power to some railways.
Still, the two sides carried out a prisoner exchange, each releasing 175 troops in a deal facilitated by the United Arab Emirates. Moscow said it freed an additional 22 wounded Ukrainians as a goodwill gesture.
Zelenskiy, describing his conversation with Trump as “positive, very substantive and frank,” said he had confirmed Kyiv’s readiness to halt strikes on Russian infrastructure and to accept an unconditional frontline ceasefire as the U.S. proposed earlier.
“One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it,” he said on social media.
Later, the Ukrainian president told reporters in a video call that Trump understands Kyiv will not recognize occupied land as Russian.
Zelenskiy said the Russian strikes, which he said were carried out since Trump’s call with Putin, showed that Russia was not ready for peace. He said the U.S. should be in charge of monitoring any ceasefire, adding a halt to infrastructure attacks could be quickly established.
The Kremlin said it had called off planned attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including by shooting down seven of Russia’s own drones heading towards Ukraine. It accused Kyiv of failing to call off its own attacks in what it called an attempt to sabotage the agreement.
Trump suggested to Zelenskiy the U.S. could help run, and possibly own, Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, according to a statement by the U.S. administration. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, has been shut down since Russian troops occupied it in 2022.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine has begun talks with the U.S. about its possible involvement in restoring the Zaporizhzhia plant.
EUROPEANS WARY
Trump has long promised to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two. But his outreach to Putin has unnerved European allies, who fear it heralds a fundamental shift after 80 years in which defending Europe from Russian expansionism was the core mission of U.S. foreign policy.
Some European leaders said Putin’s rejection of Trump’s proposed full truce was proof Moscow was not seeking peace. The offer to temporarily stop attacking Ukrainian energy facilities counted for “nothing” and Trump would have to win greater concessions, Germany’s defence minister said.
“Putin is playing a game here and I’m sure that the American president won’t be able to sit and watch for much longer,” Boris Pistorius told German broadcaster ZDF.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she would present a proposal to European leaders in Brussels on Thursday to provide Ukraine with 2 million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
SCORES OF ATTACKS
For most of the past three years, Russia has relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s power grid, arguing that civilian infrastructure is a legitimate target because it facilitates Kyiv’s fighting capabilities. Ukrainians say such attacks have subsided in recent months.
Kyiv has steadily developed capabilities to mount long-range attacks into Russia, frequently using drones to target distant oil and gas sites, which it says provide fuel for Russia’s troops and income to fund the war.
In the attacks overnight, Ukrainian regional authorities said Russian drones damaged two hospitals in the northeastern Sumy region, causing no injuries but forcing the evacuation of patients and staff.
Near Kyiv, a 60-year-old man was injured and airstrikes hit homes and businesses in the Bucha district north of the capital. Attacks damaged power systems for railways in Dnipropetrovsk in the south on Wednesday, the state railway said.
Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya. No one was injured.
The depot is a rail terminal for Russian oil supplies to a pipeline linking Kazakhstan to the Black Sea. A representative of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium operator said oil flows were stable. Two industry sources said the attack could reduce Russian supplies to the pipeline.

Title: Miami Open: Kyrgios earns first win in more than two years
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 04:00:27 +0000
Content: Australian Nick Kyrgios came from behind to defeat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the first round of the Miami Open on Wednesday to earn his first win since October 2022.
Kyrgios, who retired from his first-round match at Indian Wells this month due to pain in his surgically repaired right wrist, soaked in the moment, looking skyward and taking a deep breath after sealing the win.
“It has been a long journey even to get to the start line of matches and be scared to even be able to finish them,” he told Tennis TV.
“So to come in and get a win and feel like I belong again, it’s pretty special.”
Kyrgios, who had lost all three matches he played this year, got off to a slow start on a hot and humid day in South Florida but after dropping the first set, he began to settle in, finding his rhythm on serve to level the contest.
In the decider, he hit a well-disguised drop shot to set up a break point and converted when his American opponent double-faulted to hand Kyrgios a 4-3 lead.
From there he rode his best shot, his booming serve, to the finish line.
Next up for Kyrgios is Russian Karen Khachanov, who stunned the Australian in a hard-fought quarter-final at the 2022 U.S. Open, a tournament Kyrgios was among the favourites to win that year.
Soon after that bitter disappointment he would take a lengthy break from the court to tend to a series of knee, foot and wrist problems that threatened to permanently derail the 29-year-old’s career before returning to the tour this year.
Frenchman Gael Monfils, Belgian David Goffin, and Russian-born Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik were among the players who also advanced out of the first round with wins on Wednesday.
RADUCANU ROLLS
On the women’s side, former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu barely broke a sweat as she brushed aside Japanese wild card Sayaka Ishii 6-2 6-1 to reach the second round.
Raducanu, who was ousted in the first round at Indian Wells, regained her footing against Ishii as she won 77% of her first-serve points, fired down six aces and converted five of her six break point chances in the 65-minute match.
Up next for Britain’s Raducanu will be American world number 10 Emma Navarro, who won a WTA 500 event in Mexico in early March for her second career title before losing in the third round at Indian Wells.
“It’s going to be an extremely challenging match,” Raducanu said during her on-court interview. “She’s probably in better form, so I can go out and express myself and try and compete for every point.”
In other women’s action Belinda Bencic, fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, overcame a 5-3 third-set deficit to beat Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska on Grandstand.
The Swiss former world number four gave birth to her daughter Bella in April of last year and won her first WTA title as a mother when she triumphed at the WTA 500 event in Abu Dhabi last month.
Twice Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka strolled into the second round with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Ukrainian wild card Anhelina Kalinina in the evening session at Hard Rock Stadium.
The veteran player from Belarus has won the tournament three times and said her game was coming together.
“I feel like this was my best match of the season so far,” she said on-court, where she was joined by her son Leo.
“I felt like I was in command and playing my game.”

Title: Fed in no rush to cut rates amid high uncertainty about Trump tariffs
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 03:57:18 +0000
Content: The Trump administration’s initial policies, including extensive import tariffs, appear to have tilted the U.S. economy toward slower growth and at least temporarily higher inflation, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, with central bank policymakers left guessing over what lies ahead during a period of “unusually elevated” uncertainty.
With overall sentiment sliding due to policy “turmoil,” prices are projected to rise faster than expected at least in part and perhaps largely because of President Donald Trump’s plans to levy duties on imports from U.S. trading partners, Powell said after the Fed announced it had held its benchmark overnight rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range.
While Fed policymakers still expect the central bank to deliver two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year, matching their projection in December, that’s largely due to weakened economic growth offsetting higher inflation, and what Powell called the “inertia” of not knowing what else to do given the muddled outlook.
There is “just really high uncertainty. What would you write down?” when making projections, Powell said in a news conference after the end of the Fed’s latest two-day policy meeting. “I mean it’s just … really hard to know how this is going to work out.”
“We understand that sentiment is quite negative at this time, and that probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that’s making big changes,” Powell said.
Overall economic data remains solid, the Fed chief said, pointing to the current unemployment rate of 4.1% and a sense that the job market remains roughly in balance.
Trump posted late on Wednesday on his Truth Social platform: “The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S. Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing.”
Powell’s remarks and the Fed’s latest set of policymaker projections was heavily influenced by what has transpired since Trump took office on January 20 with a vow to impose the import tariffs.
Data released along with the latest policy and economic projections showed Fed officials in near unanimity that the outlook was less certain than usual, and that risks considered balanced as of the Fed’s January 28-29 meeting were now tilted towards slower growth, higher joblessness, and higher inflation.
If the Fed’s median outlook for the next three years comes to pass, it would be the weakest three-year run of economic growth since at least former President Barack Obama’s first term in the White House and the slow recovery from the 2007-2009 recession.
“We now have inflation coming from an exogenous source,” said Powell, using a term economists employ to describe an outside shock, in this case tariffs that could, if Trump follows through with all his plans, lift the average tax rate on imports to levels not seen since the Great Depression.
Some of those levies have already been imposed, with the bulk due in early April in the form of steep 25% taxes on most goods from Mexico and Canada, and a sweeping set of tariffs meant to match whatever other countries impose on their imported goods from the U.S.
Powell said the Fed will be watching intently in coming months to determine how much of all those actions passes through to consumer prices, whether those levies or other countries’ retaliatory responses seem to be causing more persistent price pressures, and perhaps most importantly whether it all starts to feed into inflationary psychology among families and businesses.
Though some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher in the early weeks of the Trump administration, the longer-run measures that the Fed regards as most important to achieving its policy goals “haven’t moved much,” Powell told reporters.
The Fed will also be watching to see if weaker growth feeds into higher unemployment, and Powell reiterated that it was ready to act in either case, with policy kept tighter if inflation proves more persistent, or relaxed if unemployment starts to rise.
So far, Powell said, the Fed’s two goals are not in conflict, giving it some leeway in coming rate decisions.
STILL NO RUSH TO JUDGMENT
The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point last year, but has kept rates on hold this year as it waits for further evidence that inflation will continue to fall, and, more recently, for more clarity about the impact of Trump’s policies.
“We’re not going to be in any hurry to move,” Powell said. “Our current policy stance is well-positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face … The right thing to do is to wait here for greater clarity about what the economy is doing.”
Fed officials now see their preferred measure of inflation ending the year at 2.7%, versus the 2.5% pace anticipated in December. Their target is 2%, and Fed officials so far view the tariffs as only a temporary blow to reaching it in 2027.
“There may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year,” Powell said.
Fed officials also marked down their outlook for economic growth for this year to 1.7% from the previous 2.1%, with slightly higher unemployment projected by the end of this year.
Major U.S. stock indices extended their gains slightly after the release of the Fed’s policy statement and projections, closing sharply higher. The dollar .DXY pared some of its earlier gains and U.S. Treasury yields eased.
Traders of U.S. interest rate futures saw just over a 62% chance of the Fed resuming its rate cuts at its meeting in June, according to LSEG estimates, compared with 57% before the release of the policy statement and projections.
“The Fed is as lost in the wilderness as the rest of us trying to decipher the continual shifts in economic policy from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” said Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, referring to the street address of the White House. “Beyond the cut to median growth this year and the boost to median inflation, the most telling aspect of the (projections) is the shift higher in uncertainty.”
The Fed also announced on Wednesday that it will slow the ongoing drawdown of its $6.81 trillion balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening.
Fed Governor Chris Waller was the lone dissenter from the latest policy statement because of the change in balance sheet policy.

Title: After airstrikes, Israel says it has launched new ground operation in Gaza
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 03:48:34 +0000
Content: The Israeli military said on Wednesday its forces resumed ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip, as a second day of airstrikes killed at least 48 Palestinians, according to local health workers.
The renewed ground operations came a day after more than 400 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes in one of the deadliest episodes since the beginning of the conflict in October 2023, shattering a ceasefire that has largely held since January.
The Israeli military said its operations extended Israel’s control over the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects Gaza, and were a “focused” manoeuvre aimed at creating a partial buffer zone between the north and the south of the enclave.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas said the ground operation and the incursion into the Netzarim Corridor were a “new and dangerous violation” of the two-month-old ceasefire agreement. In a statement, the group reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and called on mediators to “assume their responsibilities”.
The United Nations said a strike killed a foreign staffer and wounded five workers at a U.N. site in central Gaza City on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry attributed the strike to Israel, but Israel denied this, saying it hit a Hamas site where it detected preparations for firing into Israeli territory.
Jorge Moreira da Silva, executive director of the U.N. Office for Project Services, said: “Israel knew that this was a U.N. premises, that people were living, staying and working there, it is a compound. It is a very well-known place.”
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a full investigation and condemned all attacks on U.N. personnel. In a statement he said the strike brought to at least 280 the number of U.N. colleagues killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023.
In Sofia, the foreign ministry said a Bulgarian working for the U.N. died on Wednesday in Gaza, citing preliminary information.
US SAYS ‘BRIDGE’ PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE
Yosef Levi Sfari, Israel’s ambassador to Sofia, offered condolences for the Bulgarian citizen’s death and said in a social media post that the incident was being investigated. But he added that an initial examination found “no connection” to Israeli military activity.
Israel, which has vowed to eradicate Hamas, said on Tuesday that its latest onslaught in Gaza was “just the beginning”.
The U.S. State Department blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities and said there was still a U.S.-crafted “bridge” proposal on the table to extend the ceasefire and bring about the release of hostages held by the group in Gaza.
“The opportunity is still there, but it’s closing fast,” a State Department spokesperson said, adding that Hamas’ response was “totally unacceptable” and that the U.S. stood with Israel.
In the latest violence, local health workers said an Israeli airstrike killed four people and wounded 10 others in a house in the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, where the army renewed evacuation orders to residents earlier on Wednesday.
In Beit Lahiya, an Israeli airstrike killed 24 people at a mourning tent, medics said.
Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had offered a respite for Gaza’s 2.3 million residents after 17 months of war reduced the enclave to rubble and forced most of its population to evacuate multiple times.
The Israeli campaign has killed more than 49,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health authorities say, and caused a humanitarian crisis with shortages of food, fuel and water.
Israel has accused Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields. Hamas denies this and accuses Israel of indiscriminate bombings.
The war – the most devastating episode in decades of Israel-Palestinian conflict – was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which gunmen killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
PROTESTS IN ISRAEL
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to resume bombardments has triggered protests in Israel as 59 hostages are still held in Gaza, with 24 of them believed to be still alive.
A coalition of hostage families and Netanyahu critics has regrouped and accuses the prime minister of using the war for political ends.
Palestinian medics said Israeli tank shelling on the main north-south Salahuddin Road in Gaza killed one Palestinian and wounded others while medics and witnesses said the Israeli operations there deterred people and vehicles from using the road.
Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua told Reuters the effect of closing the Salahuddin Road was a “total coup” against the three-phase ceasefire agreement and a tightening of the blockade on Gaza.
He said the group would welcome any proposal “as long as it is based on launching negotiation on the second phase and a complete end to the war in Gaza”.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Israeli army dropped leaflets in the northern and southern Gaza Strip, once again ordering residents to evacuate their homes.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video statement that if the hostages were not released, “Israel will act with force you have not yet seen”.
The renewed violence was condemned by some Western nations, including France and Germany, as well as Qatar and Egypt, which had been acting as mediators in the ceasefire negotiations.
Jordan’s King Abdullah called for the ceasefire to be restored and for aid flows to resume. “Israel’s resumption of attacks on Gaza is an extremely dangerous step,” he said on a visit to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Title: Scientists uncover potential new trigger for stomach cancer
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 03:34:20 +0000
Content: Scientists have carefully examined somatic mutations in stomach lining tissue to uncover mutational mechanisms that can lead to cancer.
They also discovered evidence of a possible new cause of stomach cancer, which warrants further investigation.
Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the University of Hong Kong, and their collaborators sequenced the whole genomes of normal stomach lining samples from individuals with and without gastric cancer.
The team found that despite regular exposure to the acidic contents of the stomach, the gastric lining is protected from toxic effects. They discovered that cells with ‘driver’ mutations in cancer-related genes occupy almost 10 percent of the gastric lining by age 60. Additionally, they made an unusual discovery: some individuals—but not all—had mutations resulting in three copies of certain chromosomes, hinting at exposure to an unknown mutagen.
The results contribute to a growing map of mutations in normal tissue from the gastrointestinal tract. This work enables researchers to explore fundamental mutational processes, compare mutation rates across different parts of the body, and better understand the earliest stages of cancer development.
Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly one million new cases in 2022. It is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with the highest number of cases reported in East Asia and South America.
Factors that increase the risk of developing stomach cancer include being overweight, smoking, and infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which can trigger inflammation and stomach ulcers. H. pylori infection is responsible for approximately 40 percent of stomach cancer cases in the UK.
The stomach is highly acidic, serving as a reservoir for the initial stage of food digestion. The cells that line the stomach—the gastric epithelium—form gastric glands, or pits, which contain the cells that can give rise to stomach cancer.
Throughout our lifetime, the cells in our body acquire genetic changes known as somatic mutations. With advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, researchers can now analyze these mutations in normal tissues and trace their development over time, providing insights into aging and the earliest stages of cancer formation.
In a new study, researchers from the Sanger Institute and their collaborators set out to investigate somatic mutations within the gastric epithelium to explore the transition from normal age-related mutations to those that contribute to stomach cancer.
The team sequenced the whole genomes of 238 samples of normal, non-cancerous gastric gland tissue from the stomachs of 30 individuals from Hong Kong, the United States, and the UK—18 of whom had gastric cancer and 12 who did not. Using laser capture microdissection, they precisely dissected individual cells or glands from the stomach lining samples for genome sequencing.
Despite regular exposure to stomach acid, the researchers found that mutations in normal gastric glands accumulated at a rate similar to most other cells in the body. This suggests that the gastric epithelium is protected against the toxic effects of stomach acid.
However, in individuals with gastric cancer, some of the glands in the normal, non-cancerous stomach lining showed changes under the microscope that resembled early-stage cancer development. These glands exhibited increased numbers of mutations, which may have contributed to the onset of gastric cancer. In cancerous tissue, mutation numbers were significantly higher, indicating that gastric cancers accelerate mutation accumulation as they progress.
An unusual finding was that some stomach lining cells carried three copies of certain chromosomes—chromosomes 13, 18, and 20—a condition known as trisomy. This has not been observed in other tissues in previous studies, suggesting it may be unique to the stomach. Trisomies were found multiple times in some individuals but were absent in others, implying that only certain individuals may have been exposed to an unknown external mutagen.
The team also discovered that ‘driver’ mutations in cancer-related genes—many of which are known to be associated with gastric cancer—occupy nearly 10 percent of the stomach lining by age 60. This proportion increases in individuals who experience severe chronic inflammation, a well-known risk factor for gastric cancer. This finding raises further questions about the mechanism through which chronic inflammation increases the risk of stomach cancer.
Dr. Tim Coorens, first author and formerly at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, now at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said, “By studying somatic mutations in normal tissues, which we acquire over our lifetimes, we can explore the earliest stages of cancer development. We found that despite constant exposure to acidic stomach contents, the stomach lining is protected. However, in those with gastric cancer, we see higher numbers of mutations in normal cells, resembling the earliest stages of stomach cancer. This research adds to a mutation map of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon, allowing us to compare mutation rates and mutational processes across the body.”
Professor Suet Yi Leung, co-lead author at the University of Hong Kong, shared, “We discovered an unusual phenomenon where some individuals had three copies of certain chromosomes—known as trisomy—while others did not. We haven’t seen this in any other tissue, which hints at an unknown external mutagen that only some of these individuals may have been exposed to.”
Professor Sir Mike Stratton, co-lead author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said, “Ten years ago, we knew very little about the fundamental processes of mutations occurring in our bodies. Now, with advanced genome sequencing technologies, we can investigate somatic mutations in all cell types across various normal tissues. This allows us to look back at the evolution of our cells over a lifetime to understand the key mutational processes that can lead to cancer. At the Sanger Institute, we are at the forefront of studying the causes and consequences of somatic mutations, exploring the possibility that somatic mutations may contribute to diseases beyond cancer as well.”

Title: “Zero-tolerance policy against Naxals”: Amit Shah praises security forces for neutralising 22 Naxalites
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:55:57 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday commended the efforts of security forces after 22 Naxalites were neutralized in two separate operations in Bijapur and Kanker districts of Chhattisgarh. He described the operation as a significant success in the ongoing ‘Naxal Mukt Bharat Abhiyan’.
“Today, our soldiers have achieved another big success in the direction of ‘Naxal Mukt Bharat Abhiyan’. Twenty-two Naxalites were killed in two separate operations by our security forces in Bijapur and Kanker districts of Chhattisgarh,” Shah said in a post on X.
Reaffirming the government’s stringent stance against Naxalites who refuse to surrender, Shah said that India would be “Naxal-free” before March 31 next year.
“The Modi government is moving forward with a ruthless approach against Naxalites and is adopting a zero-tolerance policy against those who do not surrender despite all the facilities provided for their rehabilitation. The country is on track to be Naxal-free before March 31 next year,” he added.
Security forces successfully eliminated 22 Naxalites in two encounters in Bijapur and Kanker districts, the police reported on Thursday.
In the first operation, 18 Maoists were neutralized in the forest area at the Bijapur-Dantewada border, according to Inspector General (IG) of Bastar, P Sundarraj. However, one personnel from the Bijapur District Reserve Guard lost his life in the encounter. The exchange of fire began at 7 a.m. on Thursday, police added.
In the second encounter, four Naxalites were killed near Koroskodo village in the Chhotebethiya police station area, located on the Kanker-Narayanpur border.
Security forces also recovered automatic weapons, and intermittent firing continued in the region, officials reported. Search operations are still underway in both districts.
The recent operations follow a series of successful actions against Naxalites in Chhattisgarh. Last week, 17 Naxalites surrendered in Bijapur district. In February, security forces arrested 18 Naxalites and recovered explosives in three separate operations in the Bijapur district.

Title: Russia and US to discuss Black Sea shipping and Ukraine peace in Saudi Arabia
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:35:27 +0000
Content: Russia and the U.S. will discuss ways to ensure safe shipping in the Black Sea at talks on a possible Ukrainian peace settlement in the Saudi city of Jeddah over coming days, the Kremlin said on Thursday.
After Russian forces made gains in 2024, President Donald Trump reversed U.S. policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine, demanding that it take steps to end the conflict.
Trump envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this week said U.S.-Russian talks would take place on Sunday in Jeddah. But when asked by Reuters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they might instead be early next week.
“We expect that negotiations will continue at the expert level and will continue in the coming days,” Peskov said, adding that Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov had spoken to Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, on Wednesday.
Peskov said that when Putin and Trump spoke by telephone on Tuesday, they had discussed the “Black Sea Initiative”
Turkey and the United Nations helped mediate the so called Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal struck in July 2022 that allowed the safe export of nearly 33 million metric tons of Ukraine grain across the Black Sea despite the war.
Russia withdrew from the agreement after a year, complaining that its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious obstacles.
“We fulfilled all the conditions then, but the conditions in relation to us were not fulfilled,” Peskov said.
The White House, in its March 18 statement on the Putin-Trump call, said the leaders agreed to technical negotiation on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, a full ceasefire and permanent peace.
The World Bank’s global commodities outlook from April 2024 says that despite the Black Sea shipping risks, both Russia and Ukraine were shipping grain to global markets without major problems. It also said the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative had a minimal fallout.
The bank’s latest report from October 2024 does not mention Black Sea shipping risks.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West in six decades.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces then fighting Ukraine’s armed forces in the east.

Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent a message to Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa supporting efforts to stabilise the situation in the country and saying Russia is ready to engage in “practical cooperation”, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Thursday.
Putin confirmed “Russia’s continuing readiness to develop practical cooperation with the Syrian leadership on the whole range of issues on the bilateral agenda in order to strengthen traditionally friendly Russian-Syrian relations,” it quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.
Syria has been rocked by a wave of sectarian killings. The Kremlin said earlier this month it wanted to see a united and “friendly” Syria because instability there could affect the whole of the Middle East.
Russia, which has two strategically important military bases in Syria, was one of the main supporters of former President Bashar al-Assad, who fled to Russia after he was toppled in December.

Content: Indian stock markets extended their winning streak on Thursday, with both the Sensex and Nifty closing over 1 per cent higher, buoyed by broad-based buying across sectors.
The rally came on the back of global cues after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. The Fed maintained its policy rate in the 4.25 per cent to 4.50 per cent range but signalled a potential half-percentage-point cut by the end of the year, boosting investor sentiment worldwide.
The Sensex ended the session at 76,348.06, up by 899 points or 1.19 per cent. During the day, it fluctuated between 76,456.25 and 75,684.58.
Similarly, the Nifty surged 283 points or 1.24 per cent, closing at 23,190.65. It touched an intra-day high of 23,216.70 and a low of 22,973.95.
Market sentiment remained bullish, with 44 out of the 50 Nifty stocks ending in positive territory.
Top gainers included Bharti Airtel, Titan, Britannia, Eicher Motors, and Bajaj Auto, each registering gains of up to 4.08 per cent.
On the downside, stocks like IndusInd Bank, Trent, Shriram Finance, and Bajaj Finance closed lower, while UltraTech Cement and Axis Bank ended flat.
Broader market indices also witnessed strong performance. The Nifty Midcap100 index rose by 0.64 per cent, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index advanced by 0.70 per cent.
All sectoral indices on the NSE closed in the green. Notably, sectors such as IT, Auto, FMCG, Metal, Media, Realty, Oil & Gas, Consumer Durables, and Healthcare recorded gains of over 1 per cent each.
The positive momentum in global indices further supported domestic markets.
According to market experts, the primary driver behind today’s rally was the US Federal Reserve’s dovish stance, maintaining rates while signalling potential cuts, which boosted confidence across global markets.
The Indian rupee also strengthened, closing at 86.36 against the US dollar, compared to the previous close of 86.44.
Sundar Kewat from Ashika Institutional Equity said that sectoral performance remained broadly positive, with Oil & Gas, Consumption, IT, Automobiles, and Consumer Goods sectors leading the gains. He added that the strong performance in the Nifty Midcap100 and Smallcap indices reflected robust buying interest across the broader market.

Title: International Day of Happiness 2025: Finland tops World Happiness Report
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:30:50 +0000
Content: The International Day of Happiness, celebrated on March 20, is a day to promote happiness as a key factor in leading a healthy and disease-free life. Recognized by the United Nations (UN), happiness is considered a fundamental objective of human life. The UN prioritizes the importance of happiness, advocating for governments and international organizations to nurture the conditions that foster happiness, protect human rights, and incorporate well-being and environmental sustainability into policy frameworks, as outlined in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The UN stresses that governments should uphold peace and social order, ensuring efficiency in areas such as taxation, legal systems, and public service delivery to increase citizens’ overall satisfaction. In line with this goal, the UN declared March 20 as the International Day of Happiness in 2012.
World Happiness Report 2025 Released
On Thursday, the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with Gallup, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and an independent editorial board, released the World Happiness Report 2025. According to the report, Finland once again ranked as the happiest country, followed by Denmark and Iceland. Some countries, including Sudan and Syria, were not ranked due to unfavorable conditions preventing survey data collection.
Key Factors for Happiness
The World Happiness Report evaluates countries based on self-assessed life satisfaction averages from 2022-24. The primary factors influencing happiness rankings include GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
Theme of the International Day of Happiness 2025: Caring and Sharing
The theme for this year’s International Day of Happiness is “Caring and Sharing,” as highlighted in the 2025 Happiness Report, emphasizing the importance of compassion and community in fostering global well-being.
Background of International Happiness Day
The concept of World Happiness Day was first proposed by Bhutan in the 1970s, a country known for prioritizing Gross National Happiness over Gross Domestic Product. The UN General Assembly officially proclaimed the International Day of Happiness in Resolution 66/281 on July 12, 2012, underscoring the significance of happiness and well-being as global aspirations.
The resolution called for a more inclusive, equitable, and balanced approach to economic growth, one that promotes sustainable development, the elimination of poverty, and the well-being of all people.

Content: At least 70 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Thursday after Israel resumed its bombing campaign and ground operations in the enclave, a Gaza health official said.
Medics said Israeli strikes targeted several houses in northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip. Asked for comment, the Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.
The military has resumed its air assaults on Gaza since Tuesday and launched ground operations on Wednesday, effectively abandoning a ceasefire that had held since January.
It said on Thursday that its forces had been engaged for the past 24 hours in what it described as a targeted ground operation to expand a buffer zone separating the northern and southern halves of Gaza, known as the Netza
rim corridor.
It ordered residents to stay away from the Salahuddin road, the main north-south route, and said they should travel along the coast instead.
Tuesday’s first day of resumed airstrikes killed more than 400 Palestinians, one of the deadliest days of the war. At least 510 Palestinians have been killed in the past three days, more than half of them women and children, Khalil Al-Deqran, the spokesperson of the territory’s health ministry told Reuters.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas said the Israeli ground operation and the incursion into the Netzarim Corridor were a “new and dangerous violation” of the two-month-old ceasefire agreement. In a statement, the group reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire deal and called on mediators to “assume their responsibilities”.
A temporary first phase of the ceasefire ended at the start of this month. Hamas wants to move to an agreed second phase, under which Israel would be required to negotiate an end to the war and withdrawal of its troops, and Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
Israel has offered only a temporary extension of the truce, cut off all supplies to Gaza and says it is restarting its military campaign to force Hamas to free remaining hostages.
BULLDOZERS AND TANKS
The resumption of air strikes has sent Palestinian residents again fleeing for their lives from homes they had begun to reinhabit among the ruins of the devastated enclave.
Some Palestinians who tried to use the Salahuddin road said they saw cars come under fire from Israeli troops advancing towards Netzarim. The fate of the passengers in the vehicles was unknown.
“Bulldozers protected by some tanks were heading to the west coming from the areas where they are stationed near the fence east of the Salahuddin road,” one taxi driver told Reuters, asking not to be identified for fear of reprisals.
He said it had become clear the Israelis were advancing on Netzarim when Egyptian and foreign inspectors stationed there under the ceasefire abruptly withdrew.
Some residents turned to social media to report the disappearance of some relatives, while others reported cases to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Speaking to Reuters on Thursday, a Hamas official said mediators had stepped up their efforts with the two warring sides but added that “no breakthrough has yet been made”.
Hamas has yet to make clear threats to retaliate in response to the Israeli escalation. Asked why the group had not yet responded, the Hamas official said it was “giving a chance for things to be contained”.
Some residents said there were no signs yet of preparations by Hamas on the ground to resume fighting.
But an official from one militant group allied to Hamas told Reuters on Thursday that fighters, including from Hamas, had been put on high alert awaiting further instructions.
“Fighters and leaders of the resistance were also advised to avoid the use of cellular phones as a means of precaution,” said the official, who asked not to be identified.
The war started after Hamas militants attacked Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.
More than 49,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing conflict, according to Gaza’s health authorities, with the enclave reduced to rubble.

Title: “Exciting to see effective innovation done in a clever way”: Bill Gates praises India’s growth story
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:00:48 +0000
Content: Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has praised India’s role in global innovation, highlighting the country’s advancements in vaccines, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital infrastructure.
In an interview with Times Now, Gates emphasized the far-reaching impact of India’s digital public infrastructure (DPI) and its growing global influence. Reflecting on his long association with India, he said that the country has always been a hub of talent, something he recognized even during his early days at Microsoft. He cited Satya Nadella, an Indian-origin leader, as an example of India’s contribution to the global tech landscape.
“Even in my Microsoft days, I got to see the depth of talent here. Now, Microsoft has so many great people from India, including Satya Nadella, who’s doing a fantastic job. When I started the foundation, I knew that in terms of improving children’s lives, India would be a place we’d want to be active in partnership with the government. That innovative spirit has spread beyond digital infrastructure and vaccines. It is now transforming agriculture, AI, and diagnostics, especially post-pandemic, where we’ve seen an acceleration,” Gates said.
He also acknowledged India’s thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem, pointing out that many startups are leveraging DPI to develop cost-effective solutions with high impact.
“The financing for entrepreneurs here has been very strong. Some are building on DPI infrastructure, and the successful ones are setting a good example by starting their philanthropy at a young age. It’s exciting to come here and see not only effective innovations but ones that are done in such a clever way that costs remain low,” he added.
Gates praised India’s contribution to global healthcare, particularly in vaccine development and distribution. He highlighted how India’s manufacturing capabilities have played a critical role in ensuring affordable and accessible vaccines worldwide.
“The partnerships we’ve built here—both in delivering new vaccines and inventing new solutions—are remarkable. The majority of the world’s low-cost vaccines are made by key foundation partners in India. This has not only saved millions of lives here but also in other countries,” he said.
Addressing concerns that India is being used as a “laboratory” for vaccine testing, Gates dismissed such claims, emphasizing the rigorous safety measures in place.
“It’s all about innovation. Nobody is more careful about ensuring vaccines are super safe than Indian regulators, who play a critical role in guiding us on these developments,” he clarified.
Gates also discussed the transformative role of AI in India, outlining three major areas where artificial intelligence can significantly improve lives: agriculture, healthcare, and education.
He explained how AI-powered solutions could revolutionize farming, particularly for small-scale farmers. By integrating weather prediction models, soil analysis, and government credit program information, AI can provide valuable insights to farmers, helping them increase productivity and mitigate risks such as pest infestations.
Similarly, in healthcare, Gates envisioned AI as a tool to bridge gaps in medical accessibility. He spoke about how AI chatbots could assist pregnant women in understanding best practices or clarifying doctors’ advice, with support available in local dialects through voice or text-based interfaces.
Education was another area where Gates saw immense potential for AI. He described AI-powered tutoring as a game-changer, providing students with round-the-clock access to personalized learning tools, helping improve motivation and engagement.
“AI can serve as the world’s best tutor, always available and keeping students motivated. This could be a game-changer in ensuring quality education for all,” he added.
Gates also spoke about India’s long-term development goals, praising its ambitious vision for 2047. He noted that both the central and state governments are actively working to drive economic growth, making the vision of a fully developed India by 2047 an achievable target.
“The vision of making India a fully developed country by 2047 is very impressive. Not only is the central government working towards this goal, but individual states are also strategizing on how to accelerate economic progress,” he said.
However, he expressed concerns over ongoing global conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and unrest in the Middle East, which he said are diverting crucial resources away from aid and development projects.
“Unfortunately, wars are diverting resources that should be going into health initiatives, particularly for Africa. It’s taking away crucial funding for aid and debt relief,” he said.

Title: Senior doctor who became face of RG Kar movement transferred to lower-ranked post
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:52:09 +0000
Content: Senior doctor Subarna Goswami, who became a key figure in the medical fraternity’s movement against the R.G. Kar rape and murder tragedy in August last year, has been transferred to Darjeeling—and to a lower-ranked post.
Goswami has been transferred to a position one rank lower than his current one. According to a notification from the state Health & Family Welfare Department, Goswami, who is presently the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH)-II in East Burdwan district, has been reassigned as the Superintendent of Darjeeling TB Hospital.
Reacting to the transfer, Goswami stated that although, as a government servant, he must accept any reassignment, the nature of this transfer clearly suggests a vindictive move.
“My next posting is a rank lower than my current post. Moreover, the hospital where I am being posted in Darjeeling does not have much scope for work. Hardly any patients get admitted there. This is the eighth time I have been transferred under the current Trinamool Congress regime. Out of these eight transfers, five have been at the same rank,” he said.
At the same time, he asserted that this transfer would not deter him from continuing the movement on the RG Kar issue.
“My fight will continue. Not just me, but others who were at the forefront of the R.G. Kar movement are also being targeted. I was questioned by police when the movement was at its peak, but I am not scared,” Goswami said.
Goswami and Kunal Sarkar, two of the state’s most reputed senior doctors, were summoned to the Kolkata Police headquarters last year at the height of the movement and questioned by then City Police Commissioner Vineet Kumar Goyal.
Dr. Utpal Banerjee from the Joint Platform of Doctors criticized the transfer, calling it an act of extreme vendetta.
“We believe this transfer is an act of extreme vendetta. The forum strongly condemns it and demands its immediate cancellation,” Banerjee said.

Title: Karnataka approves 100% salary hike for CM, ministers, and MLAs
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 15:29:50 +0000
Content: The Karnataka government has approved a 100% salary hike for the Chief Minister, Ministers, and MLAs, a decision that has sparked widespread debate. The approval was granted for two amendment bills that will now be tabled in the state Assembly.
The Karnataka Ministers’ Salaries and Allowances (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Karnataka Legislature Members’ Salaries, Pensions, and Allowances (Amendment) Bill 2025 were both cleared by the government, with sources indicating that they are likely to be introduced in the Assembly on Thursday itself.
Defending the decision, Home Minister G Parameshwara justified the salary hike, arguing that lawmakers also face rising expenses like ordinary citizens.
“The justification is that their expenditure is also going up along with other people. A common man is also suffering, and MLAs are also suffering. So, recommendations have come from MLAs and others, and that is why the Chief Minister has taken the decision. Everybody has to survive, and the CM will manage to give this money from some account…,” Parameshwara said.
State Minister MB Patil also supported the proposal, asserting that salary increases should be determined by an independent committee rather than lawmakers themselves. He pointed out that higher salaries for politicians, as seen in other countries, help maintain integrity and reduce corruption.
“There is nothing wrong in the salary and perks of MLAs being raised. It is not fair if we do it ourselves; that’s why a committee is there which recommended this. Take the example of the Prime Minister, Ministers, and MPs— they are among the highest paid in the world. That makes them very independent and not corrupt. We cannot compare our salaries to Singapore, but still, a decent pay should be given…,” Patil told ANI.
However, not all lawmakers are in agreement. Congress legislator Dr Ranganath expressed uncertainty over the salary increase, stating that while some MLAs may require financial support, a more modest hike of 10-20% would be more reasonable.
“I am not very sure about this issue. I am a doctor and an MLA. I am not expecting that hike personally, but there are many MLAs who need a basic salary. If they give a hike, it won’t be more than 10 or 20 per cent,” said Ranganath.
The decision to double lawmakers’ salaries has triggered a heated debate, with critics questioning its necessity, especially as Karnataka faces various financial challenges. While supporters argue that higher salaries ensure greater independence for lawmakers, opponents believe public funds should be allocated more efficiently.

Title: IPL 2025: Saliva ban revoked after captains’ meeting in Mumbai
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:28:29 +0000
Content: Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in IPL 2025, following a key decision made at a captains’ meeting held at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Thursday. Several franchise captains supported the move, prompting IPL authorities to lift the ban.
The saliva ban was initially introduced in May 2020 as a temporary health measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) making it permanent in September 2022. Since then, bowlers have only been allowed to use sweat to shine the ball. However, many fast bowlers have argued that the restriction has significantly reduced their ability to generate reverse swing, especially in white-ball cricket where two new balls are used in ODIs.
The move to reinstate saliva use comes after repeated calls from pacers for a change in the rules. Following India’s victory over Australia in the Champions Trophy, where Mohammed Shami starred with a three-wicket haul, the Indian pacer urged the ICC to bring back saliva usage to aid reverse swing.
“We are trying [to get reverse swing], but using saliva on the ball is not allowed. We keep appealing that we should be allowed to use saliva so that we can bring reverse swing back into the game and make it more interesting,” Shami had said.
New Zealand’s veteran pacer Tim Southee also backed the move, highlighting the importance of reverse swing, especially in batting-friendly conditions. Speaking on ESPNcricinfo’s Match Day program during the New Zealand vs South Africa World Cup semifinal, Southee emphasized the need for a balance between bat and ball.
“That was a rule brought around due to COVID-19, but as a bowler, you want to have a slight advantage. We see teams scoring 362 or frequently crossing 300 in this format. I think there needs to be something in the bowlers’ favor, and whether that’s a little bit of saliva, then yeah, I don’t see why they couldn’t bring that back,” Southee said.

Title: Average monthly data usage in India hits 27.5 GB, 5G traffic triples in 2024
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:35:36 +0000
Content: India’s average monthly data consumption per user surged to 27.5 gigabytes in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% over the past five years, according to a report released on Thursday.
The rise of 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) is a significant driver of this growth, with FWA users consuming over 12 times more data than average mobile users, particularly in residential and business sectors.
The report, Nokia’s annual Mobile Broadband Index (MBiT), revealed that 5G data traffic across India tripled and is projected to surpass 4G traffic by Q1 2026.
Tarun Chhabra, Senior Vice President and Country Head of Nokia India said, “We are committed to partnering with operators to meet the growing connectivity demand.”
Category B and C circles led the surge, with 5G data usage growing by 3.4 and 3.2 times, respectively. In metro areas, 5G now accounts for 43% of mobile broadband data, up from 20% in 2023, as 4G usage declines.

Title: Russia and US to discuss Black Sea shipping and Ukraine peace in Saudi Arabia
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:35:27 +0000
Content: Russia and the U.S. will discuss ways to ensure safe shipping in the Black Sea at talks on a possible Ukrainian peace settlement in the Saudi city of Jeddah over coming days, the Kremlin said on Thursday.
After Russian forces made gains in 2024, President Donald Trump reversed U.S. policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine, demanding that it take steps to end the conflict.
Trump envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this week said U.S.-Russian talks would take place on Sunday in Jeddah. But when asked by Reuters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they might instead be early next week.
“We expect that negotiations will continue at the expert level and will continue in the coming days,” Peskov said, adding that Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov had spoken to Mike Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, on Wednesday.
Peskov said that when Putin and Trump spoke by telephone on Tuesday, they had discussed the “Black Sea Initiative”
Turkey and the United Nations helped mediate the so called Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal struck in July 2022 that allowed the safe export of nearly 33 million metric tons of Ukraine grain across the Black Sea despite the war.
Russia withdrew from the agreement after a year, complaining that its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious obstacles.
“We fulfilled all the conditions then, but the conditions in relation to us were not fulfilled,” Peskov said.
The White House, in its March 18 statement on the Putin-Trump call, said the leaders agreed to technical negotiation on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, a full ceasefire and permanent peace.
The World Bank’s global commodities outlook from April 2024 says that despite the Black Sea shipping risks, both Russia and Ukraine were shipping grain to global markets without major problems. It also said the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative had a minimal fallout.
The bank’s latest report from October 2024 does not mention Black Sea shipping risks.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West in six decades.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces then fighting Ukraine’s armed forces in the east.

Title: Centre reviewing nuclear laws to boost energy capacity: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 06:59:22 +0000
Content: The central government has constituted dedicated task forces to examine amendments required in the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act as part of efforts to accelerate India’s nuclear energy capacity, Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister for Science and Technology, informed Parliament on Thursday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Singh said that the task force under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) includes representatives from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), NITI Aayog, Ministry of Law and Justice (MoLJ), and Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). This group is reviewing key aspects such as the build-own-operate model of nuclear power plants (NPPs) by the private sector, nuclear safety, security, safeguards, fuel procurement, waste management, and spent fuel reprocessing.
A separate task force is also evaluating necessary changes to the CLND Act to address concerns raised by private suppliers, Singh said.
As part of the Union Budget 2025, the government announced an ambitious Nuclear Energy Mission targeting the deployment of 100 GWe of nuclear energy capacity by 2047. This initiative is critical for achieving India’s Net Zero emissions target by 2070. The mission is aimed at providing a reliable, clean alternative to fossil fuels by replacing retiring thermal power plants, supporting energy-intensive industries with captive nuclear plants, and delivering power to remote and off-grid areas to aid in the decarbonization of the energy sector.
To support these objectives, DAE is actively engaged in the design and development of various Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), including the 200 MWe Bharat Small Modular Reactor (BSMR), a 55 MWe SMR, and a gas-cooled high-temperature reactor specifically designed for hydrogen production.
The Union Budget 2025 has allocated ₹20,000 crore for the deployment of five SMRs by 2033. This allocation will also fund continued research and development efforts for these reactors.
Additionally, as part of the current financial year’s policy directive, a move has been made to involve the private sector in nuclear energy projects. NPCIL has issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) inviting private industries to finance and construct small-sized 220 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)-based NPPs as captive plants dedicated to electricity production.
Singh announced on Wednesday that North India’s first nuclear power project will be established in Gorakhpur, Haryana. He described the upcoming facility as a major milestone in India’s nuclear energy expansion and a crucial step in advancing the country’s clean energy ambitions.

Title: South Korea opposition brings motion to impeach acting president
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 06:45:14 +0000
Content: South Korean opposition parties raised a motion to impeach acting President Choi Sang-mok on Friday, the majority Democratic Party said, in a move likely to escalate recent political strife in the country.
Although the motion starts a process that would lead to a vote by parliament to pass it by a simple majority, the timetable was not immediately clear.
Choi, who is the finance minister, has been leading the country after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached over a short-lived martial law he declared in December.
Choi has angered opposition parties, which have a commanding majority in parliament, by repeatedly vetoing bills and holding off appointing a Constitutional Court justice approved by the assembly who is viewed as liberal-leaning.
The court is reviewing Yoon’s impeachment and is expected to deliver its ruling on whether to permanently remove him from office or reinstate him.
The Democratic Party was aware of the fatigue among the public and in parliament over the more than two dozen motions it has brought to impeach officials from the Yoon administration, Myongji University Professor Shin Yul said.
But appointing one more liberal judge to the court could have major political repercussions since it increases the prospect of ousting Yoon and forcing a new election, Shin said.
“There is just one thing the Democratic Party is aiming for and that’s an early election, and as early as possible at that,” he said.
Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung leads polling about who should be the next president.
He faces multiple criminal trials himself that could disqualify him from running for election. The charges include election law violations and misuse of public funds.
If Choi’s presidency is vacated, a new election must be held within 60 days.
As the wait for the court’s ruling has dragged on, tensions between opposing parties in parliament and on the streets have intensified amid calls for and against Yoon’s ouster.
The majority of the public backs Yoon’s removal, according to public opinion polls, although support has ebbed since the initial days after the martial law declaration last December.
A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed 58% of respondents supported Yoon’s removal.
His martial law decree plunged Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which had been considered a thriving democracy, into an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
Opposition parties also impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo after he became acting president. The Constitutional Court is due to rule on his impeachment on Monday; if it is struck down, that would mean Han would return and replace Choi as acting leader.
The Democratic Party has said Choi has been violating his constitutional duty by refusing to appoint the Constitutional Court judge despite a ruling by the top court that such inaction was infringing on parliament’s authority.

Title: Netanyahu government approves firing of Shin Bet head amid protests
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 06:27:33 +0000
Content: The Israeli cabinet voted early on Friday to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence service effective April 10, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said, after three days of protests against the move.
Netanyahu said this week he had lost confidence in Ronen Bar, who has led Shin Bet since 2021, and intended to dismiss him.
Bar did not attend the cabinet meeting but in a letter sent to ministers said the process around his firing did not comply with rules and his dismissal was predicated on baseless claims.
Late on Thursday, police fired water cannon and made numerous arrests as scuffles broke out during the protests in Tel Aviv and close to the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, where police said dozens of protesters tried to break through security cordons.
Over the past three days, demonstrators protesting the move to sack Bar have joined forces with protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza, breaking a two-month-old ceasefire, while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian enclave.
“We’re very, very worried that our country is becoming a dictatorship,” Rinat Hadashi, 59, said in Jerusalem. “They’re abandoning our hostages, they’re neglecting all the important things for this country.”
The decision followed months of tension between Bar and Netanyahu over a corruption investigation into allegations that a number of aides in Netanyahu’s office were offered bribes by figures connected with Qatar.
Netanyahu has dismissed the accusation as a politically motivated attempt to unseat him, but his critics have accused him of undermining the institutions underpinning Israel’s democracy by seeking Bar’s removal.
In his letter to the government, Bar said the decision to fire him was “entirely tainted by … conflicts of interest” and driven by “completely different, extraneous and fundamentally unacceptable motives”.
He had already announced that he intended to step down early to take responsibility for the intelligence lapses that failed to prevent the attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023.
DEEP DIVISIONS
The angry scenes on Thursday highlighted divisions that have deepened since Netanyahu returned to power as head of a right-wing coalition at the end of 2022.
Even before the war in Gaza, tens of thousands of Israelis were joining regular demonstrations protesting a government drive to curb the power of the judiciary that critics saw as an assault on Israeli democracy but which the government said was needed to limit judicial overreach.
On Thursday Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff in the military who now leads the opposition Democrats party, was pushed to the ground during a scuffle, drawing condemnation and calls for an investigation by other opposition politicians.
Former Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the clashes were a direct result of divisions caused by “an extremist government that has lost its grip”.
In Tel Aviv, demonstrators rallied outside the Kirya military headquarters complex as ministers met to formally approve the dismissal of Bar.
Since the start of the war, there have also been regular protests by families and supporters of hostages seized by Hamas during the October 7 attack that have sometimes echoed the criticisms of the government.
With the resumption of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, the fate of 59 hostages, as many as 24 of whom are still believed to be alive, remains unclear and protesters said a return to war could see them either killed by their captors or accidentally by Israeli bombardments.
“This is not an outcome the Israeli people can accept,” The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing hostage families, said in a statement.

Title: Huge fire closes UK’s Heathrow Airport, global flight schedules disrupted
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:26:18 +0000
Content: Britain’s Heathrow Airport said it would be closed all of Friday after a huge fire at a nearby electrical substation wiped out power, disrupting flight schedules around the world.
The London Fire Brigade said around 70 firefighters were tackling the blaze in the west of London, which caused a mass power outage at Heathrow, Europe’s busiest and the world’s fifth-busiest airport.
Huge orange flames and smoke could be seen shooting into the sky. Around 150 people were evacuated from nearby buildings and thousands of properties were without power.
The fire brigade said the cause of the fire was not known.
“To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until 23h59 on 21 March,” Heathrow Airport said in a post on X, adding that passengers were advised not to travel to the airport.
According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, at least 120 inbound flights to Heathrow were having to divert to other airports.
It said at least 1,351 flights to and from Heathrow would be affected on Friday, not including flights that might be cancelled or delayed due to aircraft being out of position.
British Airways itself had 341 flights scheduled to land at Heathrow on Friday.
“Heathrow is one of the major hubs of the world,” said Ian Petchenik, spokesman for FlightRadar24. “This is going to disrupt airlines’ operations around the world.”
The impact was immediate. Qantas Airways sent its flight from Perth to Paris, a United Airlines New York flight headed to Shannon, Ireland and a United Airlines flight from San Francisco was due to land in Washington, D.C. rather than London.
Some flights from the U.S. were turning around mid-air and returning to their point of departure.
Travel experts said the disruption would extend far beyond Heathrow.
Airlines’ carefully choreographed networks depend on airplanes and crews being in specific locations at specific times. Dozens of air carriers will have to hurriedly reconfigure their networks to move planes and crews around.
“The other question is, ‘What will airlines do to deal with the backlog of passengers?'”, said travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt with Atmosphere Research Group. “It’s going to be a chaotic couple of days.”
A Heathrow spokesperson informed in an email that there was no clarity on when power would be restored, and they expected significant disruption over the coming days.
On the ground in London, a number of homes and businesses were without power. “Firefighters have led 29 people to safety from neighbouring properties, and as a precaution, a 200-metre cordon has been established, with around 150 people evacuated,” the fire brigade said.

Title: India’s Sacred Forests: Where Faith Fuels Conservation
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:21:43 +0000
Content: The world unites on Friday to celebrate the International Day of Forests, a day dedicated to recognizing the vital role forests play in sustaining life on Earth. Forests are among the planet’s richest ecosystems, intricately linked to human civilization for millennia. Globally, over five billion people depend on forests and non-timber forest products for essentials like food, medicine, and livelihoods. Moreover, forested watersheds supply freshwater to more than 85% of the world’s major cities, underscoring their ecological significance. In India, however, forests transcend their role as mere ecosystems or habitats –they are woven into the cultural, spiritual, and historical fabric of the nation.
Sacred Forests of India and its Cultural Tapestry 
Imagine a forest where cutting a tree is forbidden not by law, but by faith! In India, forests are more than natural landscapes; they are living repositories of the country’s heritage. With over one million sacred forests dotting the landscape, these groves are steeped in the traditions, stories, and identities of countless communities. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) aptly describes them as “secret wizards of conservation,” highlighting their dual role as ecological sanctuaries and cultural strongholds. These sacred forests are not managed through formal laws or written decrees but are preserved through the unwritten customs, beliefs, and taboos of the communities that revere them. In Meghalaya, the Mawphlang Sacred Grove, guarded by the Khasi tribe, forbids even the removal of a leaf, preserving both biodiversity and ancestral spirits.
The cultural significance of forests in India dates back to ancient times, as evidenced in the Vedas and Samhitas. The Aranyakas, or “forest works” (derived from the Sanskrit word Aranya, meaning forest), emphasize the deep connection between spirituality and nature. Epic tales like the Ramayana, which traces Lord Rama’s journey through the forest trails of Chitrakoot, and the Mahabharata, with its references to the Kamyakavana, further illustrate how forests have long been central to India’s narrative traditions. Beyond these texts, indigenous knowledge about forests has been passed down through generations via songs, folk-lores, and oral histories, keeping the bond between people and nature alive.
India’s tribal communities, such as the Gonds, Bhils, Santhals, Munda, Khasi, and Garasia, share an especially profound relationship with forests. For these groups, forests are not just sources of sustenance, providing food, shelter, and medicine but also sacred spaces integral to their cultural practices and spiritual beliefs. The Gond tribe, for instance, venerates the tribal deity Pashupati, while the story of Lord Jagannatha visiting the Sora tribe reflects the intertwining of mythology and forest life. These tales are more than folklore; they are part of India’s forest heritage, extending beyond the utilitarian gifts of timber and produce to embody a deeper, existential connection. The Santhals of Jharkhand perform annual rituals in their sacred Jaherthan groves, ensuring no hunting or logging occurs, a practice that has kept local wildlife thriving.
In sacred forests, conservation is not a modern imposition but an organic extension of community life. The essence of preservation is rooted in ethnic identity, where the forest is seen as a living entity deserving respect and protection. Customary laws, though rarely documented, are strictly enforced through cultural norms. It is taboo to pluck flowers, uproot plants, harm animals, or disturb religious objects within these groves. This unspoken code has ensured that sacred forests remain untouched, allowing communities to evolve alongside them for centuries.
Forests in Modern India: A Biodiversity Haven 
Today, forests cover more than 25% of India’s land area, totaling approximately 827,357 square kilometers as per the 2023 India State of Forest Report. Maharashtra leads with 14,524.88 square kilometers of tree cover, while 40% of the country’s hilly districts and 67% of the northeastern states are forested. These forests are biodiversity hotspots, with four of the world’s 36 recognized hotspots located in India. The Western Ghats alone Harbour over 5,000 flowering plant species, around 130 mammals, more than 500 birds, and close to 180 amphibians, with at least 325 globally threatened species. The Himalayas support unique species like the snow leopard and red panda, alongside 15,000–25,000 vascular plants, 50% of which are endemic. The Indo-Burma region, spanning North-Eastern India, boasts over 5,000 flowering plants and iconic fauna like the Bengal tiger and Indian rhinoceros. Sundaland’s Nicobar Islands are home to 3,500 plant species, including 648 endemic ones, and rare reptiles like the saltwater crocodile.
A Legacy Worth Protecting 
India’s forests are a global treasure, teeming with life and lessons in sustainable coexistence. The 2023 Forest Survey of India report notes a growing stock of 6,430 million cubic metres and a carbon stock of 7,285.5 million tons, emphasizing their role in climate regulation. As the world sees its industrial developments and climate change looms, these biodiverse havens face threats from deforestation and habitat loss. The traditional stewardship of tribal communities that is rooted in reverence rather than regulation offers a powerful counterpoint to modern conservation challenges.
As the world celebrates the International Day of Forests in 2025, India’s sacred forests stand as a testament to the synergy of culture and ecology. They are not relics but thriving ecosystems where biodiversity flourishes alongside human heritage. Protecting them preserves not just species like the 33% of India’s endemic plants or the 17% of the world’s tiger population they shelter but a timeless ethos of living in harmony with nature.

Title: BCCI introduces major rule changes for IPL 2025: Saliva ban lifted, captains get over-rate relief
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:21:24 +0000
Content: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday announced major rule revisions for IPL 2025, scheduled to commence on March 22. Among the key changes are the lifting of the saliva ban, the continuation of the Impact Player rule, and a modification to over-rate penalties, ensuring captains will no longer face suspensions.
Saliva ban lifted after four years
One of the most notable changes is the lifting of the saliva ban, which was originally implemented in May 2020 as a temporary COVID-19 precaution and later made permanent by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September 2022. The decision to revoke the ban comes after repeated appeals from bowlers, who argued that the restriction made reverse swing more difficult, particularly in white-ball cricket where two new balls are used.
Under the previous rule, players were only permitted to use sweat to shine the ball. The removal of the saliva ban is expected to have a significant impact on bowlers, especially in the latter stages of matches.
Captains exempt from suspension for slow over-rates
In a major relief for team captains, slow over-rate penalties will no longer result in bans. This change follows incidents like the one in IPL 2024, where Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya was handed a one-match suspension after his team failed to maintain the required over-rate against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).
While teams will still face financial penalties and other repercussions for slow over-rates, captains will not be individually banned, ensuring that leadership continuity remains intact throughout the tournament.
Impact player rule to stay
The much-debated Impact Player rule, introduced in IPL 2023, will remain in place for IPL 2025. The rule allows teams to make a strategic substitution during a match, providing an additional tactical element that has been widely discussed since its implementation.
These changes are expected to influence team strategies and gameplay dynamics in IPL 2025. The removal of the saliva ban could aid bowlers, while the captaincy rule change ensures that teams are not disrupted due to slow over-rate penalties. The continuation of the Impact Player rule keeps the door open for innovative team tactics.

Title: French scientist denied entry into the U.S., French government says
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:13:10 +0000
Content: A French scientist has been denied entry into the United States, apparently because the scientist had expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy, the French Education Ministry said on Thursday.
“I learned with concern that a French researcher on assignment for the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) who was traveling to a conference near Houston was denied entry to the United States before being expelled,” Minister for Higher Education and Research Philippe Baptiste said in a statement to AFP.
The measure was apparently taken because the scientist had expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy, he added, but did not elaborate.
An Education Ministry spokesperson confirmed the reports by AFP and Le Monde over a scientist being denied entry, without giving details.
A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said privacy restrictions barred the agency from discussing specific cases, adding that all people arriving in the country are subject to inspection on a case-by-case basis.
“If an individual has material discovered on their electronic media that raises flags during an inspection, it can result in further analysis. Claims that such decisions are politically motivated are completely unfounded,” the spokesperson, Hilton Beckham, said in a statement.
President Donald Trump’s administration has taken various steps to cut or freeze federal funding for universities, medical centres and other research institutions since he took office in January.
On border matters, Trump has announced a number of immigration-related executive orders that focus on stricter border policy, tighter visa vetting procedures and a crackdown on undocumented migrants in the United States.
Germany this week updated its travel advisory for the U.S. to emphasise that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry for its citizens after several Germans were detained at the border recently, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
In recent weeks Britain has also revised its advice for citizens travelling to the U.S., to include a warning that anyone found breaking its entry rules could face arrest or detention.

Title: Asian stocks slide as growth, tariff worries weigh
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:11:23 +0000
Content: Asian stocks fell on Friday in a downbeat end to the week as deepening geopolitical worries and fears over U.S. tariffs and their impact on the global economy curbed investors appetite for risk, keeping safe-haven gold near record highs.
Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were steady in Asian hours, while European futures pointed to a weak open.
Policymakers across the globe struck a cautious note in a week filled with central bank meetings as uncertainty in global economics and politics grew. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank Of Japan and the Bank of England all held rates steady.
Central bankers highlighted the unsettled outlook due largely to rising trade tensions triggered by the U.S under President Donald Trump. Trump intends to impose new reciprocal tariff rates on April 2, ushering in fresh wave of uncertainty.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and a huge blast from a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian military airfield were a reminder of rising geopolitical tensions pushing investors towards safe haven assets.
“With the bar for near-term rate cuts still high, markets have shifted focus back to growth concerns and tariff risks which will continue to fuel volatility,” said Charu Chanana, Saxo’s chief investment strategist.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.85%, with stocks in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia dropping sharply.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid over 2%, poised for its second straight week in the red as investors turned cautious following a surge in tech stocks and the index hitting a three-year high on Tuesday. The Hang Seng is still up 18% for the year, the best performing major stock market in the world.
Japan’s Nikkei, however, was up 0.3% and the broader Topix index touched an eight-month high led by banking stocks as stronger-than-expected inflation data fuelled expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.
Investors will now focus on the details of the Trump administration’s April 2 tariffs as markets become increasingly nervous about the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs on inflation and economic growth.
Ray Sharma-Ong, head of multi-asset investment solutions for Southeast Asia at Aberdeen Investments, said the main uncertainty revolves around the size of reciprocal tariffs, which may lead to markets repricing further downside risks to growth.
The growing uncertainty and the Fed reiterating that it was in no rush to cut rates lent support to the dollar. The dollar index measure against a basket of six counterparts was steady at 103.84, after climbing 0.36% on Thursday.
The index fell to a five-month low this week as earlier hopes for growth-friendly policies under Trump have given way to anxiety that the global trade war he started could trigger a U.S. recession.
The yen was slightly weaker on the day at 149.20 per dollar but stayed close to the near five-month high of 146.545 touched last week. The yen is up 5% this year on expectations that the BOJ will hike rates again in 2025.
Data showed Japan’s core inflation hit 3.0% in February and an index stripping away the effect of fuel rose at the fastest pace in nearly a year, a sign of broadening price pressure that reinforces market expectations of further hikes.
“Although Governor Ueda made much of the risks surrounding U.S. trade policy on Wednesday, we think he’s just hedging his bets – considering it a risk factor,” said Min Joo Kang, senior economist at ING.
“Therefore, if trade tensions don’t escalate more than the market currently expects, they won’t affect the BOJ’s rate hike plans.”
In commodities, oil prices rose on Friday, poised for their strongest weekly performance since January.
Brent crude futures climbed 0.5%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.6%. Both were set for 2% gains for the week.
Gold eased 0.4% to $3,031.5 in Asian hours, just below the record high of the previous session but on course for the third straight week of gains, supported by safe-haven demand.

Title: Panama stun US with stoppage-time winner, Mexico beat Canada to reach Nations League final
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 05:00:23 +0000
Content: The United States’ bid for a fourth consecutive CONCACAF Nations League title came to a stunning end as they fell 1-0 to Panama after a stoppage-time goal from Cecilio Waterman on Thursday in Inglewood, California.
Panama spent the bulk of the match defending but pounced on a giveaway by the Americans before substitute forward Waterman sent a shot from the right side of the area to the bottom left corner late in stoppage time.
Up next for Panama in Sunday’s final will be Mexico, who beat Canada 2-0 in California.
Raul Jimenez fired home from the centre of the box inside the first minute before sealing the win in the 75th minute from a free kick after Stephen Eustaquio fouled Santiago Gimenez.
For the U.S., their latest loss to Panama is a massive blow as their only chance to collect silverware before co-hosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada now rests with the June 14-July 6 CONCACAF Gold Cup.
The U.S. came into the game hoping to avenge a loss to Panama at last year’s Copa America where the hosts failed to reach the knockout stage, a humiliating result that led to the firing of head coach Gregg Berhalter.
After a somewhat tentative start on Thursday the U.S. enjoyed a brief stretch where they threatened Panama, nearly scoring twice while another chance was squandered by an offside call just past the midway mark of a scoreless first half.
Josh Sargent nearly opened the scoring in the 19th minute when he got free in front of the Panama goal from where his shot hit a defender and then the post before being cleared.
Moments later Weston McKennie delivered a strong header from the back post after a brilliant cross from Timothy Weah but Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera was in perfect position to make the save.
Sargent then found the back of the Panama net but Weah was clearly offside in the buildup and the linesman’s flag went up immediately after the ball crossed the goal line.
The U.S. had several chances in the latter portion of the game as the toll of defending all night seemed to sap the Panama players’ strength and left them unable to generate much in the way of an attack until the late turnover.
The U.S. remain the only team to win the CONCACAF Nations League – which launched in 2019 and is modeled after its UEFA counterpart – having triumphed in 2021, 2023 and 2024.

Title: India to host third Central Asian youth delegation under International Youth Exchange Programme
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 11:22:09 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports will host the third Central Asian Youth Delegation to India from March 22 to 28, as part of the International Youth Exchange Programme (IYEP). This initiative aims to foster youth collaboration, promote cultural exchange, and strengthen diplomatic ties between India and the five Central Asian nations: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
The youth exchange program is in line with the vision articulated during the India-Central Asia Summit in January 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed an annual youth exchange initiative to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation among young leaders from the region. The delegation, consisting of 100 members, will engage in a variety of activities that include exploring India’s rich historical, educational, and cultural landmarks. The participants will also have opportunities to interact with local youth leaders and key stakeholders, further building bridges between the nations.
During their visit, the delegation will be immersed in India’s cultural and heritage legacy with visits to iconic sites like the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, and various heritage landmarks in Goa. These experiences will provide them with a deeper understanding of India’s architectural grandeur and historical significance.
The delegation will also engage in academic and economic exchanges, interacting with students and faculty at IIT Delhi, one of India’s premier institutions, and visiting the Goa Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) and the Goa Institute of Management. These interactions are aimed at showcasing India’s advancements in technology, research, and entrepreneurship, providing delegates with valuable insights into India’s growing role in the global economy.
An essential part of the program will involve youth networking and volunteerism. The delegation will meet with MY Bharat volunteers to discuss youth empowerment, leadership, and innovation, providing them with an opportunity to share ideas and best practices to inspire youth engagement back home.
High-level diplomatic interactions are also part of the visit, with the delegation scheduled to meet the External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, Chief Minister of Goa, Pramod Sawant and the Governor of Goa, P.S. Sreedharan Pillai. These meetings will emphasize the importance of youth diplomacy and underscore the need for strengthened international cooperation.

Title: Yuvraj Singh to captain India champions in WCL Season 2; Dhawan set for debut
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 11:20:00 +0000
Content: Cricket legend Yuvraj Singh has confirmed his return as captain of the India Champions for the second season of the World Championship of Legends (WCL), set to be held in July in the United Kingdom.
Having led the team to victory in the tournament’s inaugural edition, Yuvraj will again spearhead the squad, now joined by former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, who will make his WCL debut following his international retirement last year.
Reflecting on his role as captain for the second season, Yuvraj said, “I’m eager to represent our nation again at the World Championship of Legends. The memories of our first title win, alongside my teammates, are cherished and unforgettable.”
The first edition of the WCL saw standout performances from Indian cricketing icons like Yuvraj, Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa, and the Pathan brothers, demonstrating that their love for the game remains undiminished. The tournament gained global attention as fans relished watching their heroes shine on the big stage once more.
Harshit Tomar, the visionary behind WCL, shared his passion for the tournament, stating, “This platform gives senior cricketers a chance to continue inspiring fans. Watching these legends recreate the magic that made them icons is truly fulfilling. Our heroes are our pride, and hosting them with utmost respect and care has always been our goal.”
The India Champions, owned by Sumant Bahl, Salman Ahmed, and Jaspal Bahra, are set to return to Edgbaston, preparing for intense competition against top international stars from Australia, West Indies, England, Pakistan, and South Africa.
Bahl, co-owner of Team India Champions, reflected on their previous success: “Owning Team India Champions and lifting the inaugural trophy after defeating arch-rivals Pakistan still feels like a dream. We’re excited for Season 2 and confident that with an even stronger team, we can recreate history.”

Title: BIS set to launch annual programme for standardisation 2025-26
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 11:00:17 +0000
Content: The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is set to release the Annual Programme for Standardisation (APS) for the year 2025-26, which will include the development of new standards and the revision of existing ones in the coming year, according to a statement issued on Friday.
This effort aligns with ongoing efforts to increase the adoption of over 23,000 standards developed by BIS, ensuring adherence to globally accepted quality standards across various sectors.
The BIS, the National Standards Body of India, has also introduced a digital interface that allows stakeholders to upload proposals and track their progress.
Addressing the stakeholder meeting recently, the Director General of BIS, Pramod Kumar Tiwari, urged representatives from ministries and industry associations to contribute actively to the development of the proposed standards and to nominate relevant experts whenever needed.
He stated, “The Annual Programme for Standardisation 2025-26 will not only facilitate need-based standardisation with a focused strategic approach, ensuring that priority is given to subjects of special concern, but will also promote widespread adoption and seamless implementation of these standards.”
BIS works closely with ministries and industry associations through standardisation cells, aiming to identify gaps and participate in the formulation of national standards. Before the consultative meetings to prepare the APS for 2025-26, BIS conducted a comprehensive mapping exercise of Indian standards against various Government of India schemes and missions, along with a series of focus group meetings from August 24 to January 25.
The APS 2025-26 is expected to significantly enhance the formulation of priority standards, promoting wider adoption and seamless implementation across the manufacturing and service sectors, the official statement added.
BIS also carries out search and seizure operations to ensure that its certified standards are met by manufacturing companies. It carried out raids on multiple e-commerce companies this month and seized goods that did not meet these standards.
Under Section 17 of the BIS Act, 2016, defaulters face a minimum penalty of Rs 2 lakh, which may increase to ten times the value of the goods sold or offered for sale. Furthermore, depending on the severity of the violation, offenders may also face imprisonment of up to two years.

Title: India sets new record with 7% rise in textile exports, government implements multiple schemes to boost sector
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:59:45 +0000
Content: India continues to rank among the top textile-exporting nations, holding a 4% share in global textiles and apparel exports. In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on Friday, the Ministry of Textiles reported a 7% increase in textile and apparel exports, including handicrafts, from April to December 2024, compared to the same period the previous year. Key export markets for Indian textiles—namely the USA, European Union, and UK—accounted for 53% of total exports during FY 2023-24.
To strengthen India’s position in the global textile market, the government has introduced several key initiatives. Among them is the PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks Scheme, aimed at building world-class textile infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, focusing on MMF fabric, apparel, and technical textiles, seeks to boost large-scale manufacturing. Other efforts include the National Technical Textiles Mission, which emphasizes research and market development, and SAMARTH, a capacity-building program designed to provide placement-oriented skilling in the textile sector.
The Indian textiles industry, one of the largest in the world, boasts a robust raw material base comprising natural fibres like cotton, silk, wool, and jute, alongside man-made fibres. The country has comprehensive manufacturing capabilities across the value chain, from fibre to finished garments.
To ensure the steady supply of cotton and encourage its cultivation, the Indian government sets a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for cotton annually. This mechanism protects farmers when market prices fall below MSP rates and ensures cotton availability at competitive prices. Additionally, the custom duty on Extra-Long Staple (ELS) cotton was reduced to zero from February 20, 2024, allowing 51,000 tonnes of duty-free ELS cotton imports under the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) since December 2022.
India has also signed 14 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), including deals with the UAE, Australia, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and six Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) to enhance its export potential. The Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) scheme and the Remissions of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) program further support the industry by enhancing competitiveness and promoting zero-rated exports.
The National Technical Textiles Mission, launched for the period 2020-2026, focuses on cutting-edge research in specialty fibres and application-based textiles such as geotextiles, medical textiles, and sports textiles. The mission also promotes research into biodegradable textiles using unconventional natural fibres like milkweed and bamboo.
As part of the government’s drive for innovation, the Ministry of Textiles conducted various innovation challenges in collaboration with Startup India and the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Winners of these challenges were awarded incubation opportunities and recognition for their contributions to sustainable textile solutions, such as textile waste recycling and bio-based fiber production.
To curb the import of low-quality knitted fabrics, the government imposed a Minimum Import Price (MIP) of USD 3.50 per kilogram on relevant Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes. In the latest budget, the custom duty on certain HSN codes was also revised. Moreover, various Quality Control Orders (QCOs) have been implemented to safeguard domestic producers from the influx of substandard goods.

Title: Sensex, Nifty register weekly gains over 4%; IT, financial stocks lead rally
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:42:47 +0000
Content: Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their winning streak for the fifth consecutive session on Friday, buoyed by a stronger rupee, a rebound in IT stocks, and fresh foreign fund inflows.
The Sensex surged 557 points to close at 76,906, after hitting an intra-day high of 77,042. Over the week, the index advanced by 3,077 points or 4.17 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty gained 160 points to settle at 23,350, after touching a high of 23,403. The index recorded a weekly rise of 953 points or 4.26 per cent.
NTPC emerged as the top gainer on the Sensex, rising 3.3 per cent on Friday. Other notable gainers included Bajaj Finance, Sun Pharma, Larsen & Toubro, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Nestle India, Tata Motors, and Axis Bank.
Conversely, Mahindra & Mahindra declined over 1 per cent, while Tata Steel, Infosys, Titan, and Bajaj Finserv also ended in the red.
In the broader markets, the BSE MidCap index climbed over 1 per cent, while the SmallCap index advanced more than 2 per cent during intra-day trade.
Sectorally, the BSE Oil & Gas index led the gains with a rise of over 2 per cent. Power, Healthcare, and Financial Services indices also posted strong performances. Meanwhile, the BSE Consumer Durables index declined by 0.8 per cent, and the Metal index slipped by 0.4 per cent.
The rupee strengthened sharply, appreciating by 40 paise or 0.46 per cent to settle at 85.94 against the US dollar, aided by increased foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows and strong market sentiment.
“The Federal Reserve’s decision to hold rates steady and its forecast for lower interest rates pulled the dollar down, providing significant support to the rupee. Additionally, robust performance in the capital markets has given the rupee a further boost,” said Jateen Trivedi, Analyst at LKP Securities.
Trivedi also noted that gold prices witnessed profit booking as the strengthening rupee pressured MCX gold prices below ₹88,100, testing the crucial ₹88,000 level.
“Before any fresh upside, gold may test lower support zones around $2,950–$2,965, as risk sentiment appears to be stabilising globally, reducing the premium on uncertainty,” he added.

Title: World Poetry Day 2025: Celebrating the power of poetry to unite and inspire
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:40:26 +0000
Content: Poetry has always been a powerful medium for creative souls to express their deepest emotions and complex thoughts, touching hearts and inspiring change. Creative individuals, often soulful and introspective, use poetry to craft artistic compositions that transcend the ordinary, blending words with imagery to leave a lasting impression on readers. In a world grappling with conflicts and strained relationships, poetry serves as a beacon of hope, reinforcing human progress and connection.
Recognizing the enduring influence of poetry, UNESCO established World Poetry Day in 1999 aiming to promote the reading, writing, publishing, and appreciation of poetry. The event serves not only to inspire creativity but also to recognize poetry’s role in enhancing cultural dialogue and fostering harmony. Each year, World Poetry Day celebrates the linguistic diversity and creative expression that makes poetry a unique force in bridging social and cultural divides.
World Poetry Day 2025: A Theme of Peace and Inclusion
This year’s theme, “Poetry as a Bridge for Peace and Inclusion,” underscores poetry’s ability to connect people across different communities, cultures, and countries, fostering mutual respect and unity. Through its rhythm and pace, poetry can convey powerful emotions and messages that resonate deeply with readers from all walks of life, making it a vital tool for promoting peace and understanding in an increasingly divided world.
The Timeless Presence of Poetry
Poetry is an art form that captures the beauty of emotions, offering a simple yet profound way to express feelings. Whether crafted into a love poem, a political critique, or a reflection on spirituality, poetry has the power to teach, inspire, and heal. The imagination of poets reaches places where words alone may not—expressing the inexpressible, inspiring change, and fostering empathy.
From romantic verses to reflections on social issues, poetry spans a vast range of themes. It allows individuals to convey their thoughts in ways that are not only impactful but deeply personal. As the saying goes, “Where the sun does not reach, a poet can.”
In addition to offering emotional catharsis, poetry provides opportunities for creative expression and even earning potential through digital platforms. Writing a poem can bring peace and fulfillment, serving as an outlet for emotions and a way to inspire others. In moments of gloom or tension, penning thoughts into verse can bring a sense of contentment and relief.
India’s rich legacy of poets
India, a country of rich cultural and religious diversity, has produced a long line of famous poets who have left an indelible mark on literature. Figures like Tulsidas, Raskhan, Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, Mirza Ghalib, Kabir, Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Maithalisharan Gupt, and Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, among many others, continue to inspire new generations of poetry lovers. Their work, whether in Hindi, English, or other regional languages, reflects the depth of India’s literary heritage.
Significance of World Poetry Day
World Poetry Day is a celebration not just of words but of the power of poetry to connect, inspire, and elevate. It serves as a reminder of poetry’s relevance for all, providing a platform for emerging poets to showcase their talents and contribute positively to society. The day marks the beginning of new journeys for poetry enthusiasts, as they explore how their creative expressions can transform their own lives and the lives of others.
As we observe World Poetry Day 2025, let us remember that poetry has the potential to drive social change, unite people, and make the world a better place. On this day, poets around the globe will join hands, using their art to inspire hope, eradicate social evils, and contribute to a more harmonious world.

Title: Gene therapy loses luster as investors eye quicker returns from weight-loss drugs
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:35:38 +0000
Content: Gene therapy, with its offer of a possible cure for rare diseases like sickle cell, is losing early investors to higher-reward sectors like obesity and cancer, as sales for some of the new treatments fall short.
In the last year, some drugmakers have pulled back from the sector, including Pfizer, which recently stopped selling its gene therapy for hemophilia priced at $3.5 million per patient. Bluebird Bio, a gene therapy pioneer once worth nearly $10 billion, was sold to private equity firms for $30 million last month.
In 2024, developers of gene therapies and gene-editing products raised less than $1.4 billion across 39 venture rounds, according to a data analysis from DealForma for Reuters. In 2023, they raised $3.5 billion in 60 deals, which was down 57% from the sector’s peak of $8.2 billion across 122 deals in 2021.
“There needs to be better ways, cheaper ways to make some of these complex products,” in order for investor interest in gene therapy to return, said Subin Baral, Ernst & Young global life sciences deal leader.
Companies like Novartis say they are continuing gene therapy research. More than 95% of infants born in the U.S. with a rare neuromuscular disorder called spinal muscular atrophy are now treated with its Zolgensma gene therapy and it is being developed for older children.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals continues to see patients with sickle cell disease start the process to receive its Casgevy therapy, said Chief Operating Officer Stuart Arbuckle.
He said the treatment, which had 2024 sales of just $10 million, was pursued because the company believed gene editing offered the best solution for people living with the debilitating disease.
Gene therapy — the one-time process of inserting a modified gene to compensate for a faulty gene or change how a patient’s cells produce proteins — is a complex procedure in which patients often have to be hospitalized, with insurance coverage not always clear.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has supported the breakthrough treatments, which have multimillion-dollar prices.
Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told Reuters he is confident “speed bumps” including scientific challenges, manufacturing difficulties and real-world application of gene therapies will be worked out.
“We need to have a streamlined regulatory process… Combine that with manufacturing improvements to have a package of things to bring down cost so they are no longer cost prohibitive,” Marks said earlier this month. “My hope is that we have a group that is going to be here through the next years working on this.”
Safety issues are also a concern even after approval. Sarepta Therapeutics said this week a 16-year-old boy died from acute liver failure months after receiving the company’s gene therapy for a rare muscular dystrophy.
Weight-loss drugs, meanwhile, are forecast to see annual sales of $150 billion in coming years as new, highly-effective medicines have sparked outsized demand. Obesity therapeutics attracted $1.75 billion in venture capital last year, nearly triple 2023’s total of $630 million.
Overall, global biopharma venture funding rose to $27 billion in 2024 from $23.2 billion in 2023. Cancer remained the top sector at $10.3 billion, according to DealForma.
ECONOMICS AND POLICY DIFFICULTIES
Unlike traditional drugs that can be made in large quantities for mass distribution, gene therapies are more individualized, requiring specialized equipment and cell processing materials.
“People believe in the promise of gene therapy,” said Priya Chandran, biopharmaceuticals sector leader at Boston Consulting Group. “Investment is dropping because the overall economics and policy landscape has been problematic.”
The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the industry trade group for the cell and gene therapy sector, said it expects investment to be reinvigorated as new trial data emerges.
“The biggest biopharma companies continue to invest as the gene therapy pipeline evolves to tackle diseases with larger patient populations,” said ARM spokesman Stephen Majors.
When Pfizer last month stopped selling Beqvez, its gene therapy for hemophilia B, it said demand was weak. The company in 2023 had already backed away from early-stage gene therapy research, and last year abandoned efforts on a gene treatment for muscular dystrophy after disappointing results from a late-stage trial.
Bluebird sells three gene therapies in the U.S., including Lyfgenia for sickle cell disease, which competes with Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics’ Casgevy.
Pfizer and Bluebird did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Evidence that expensive gene therapies can provide a sustained benefit and will be accepted by patients, doctors and insurers has become more critical as major pharmaceutical companies face the looming loss of market exclusivity for top-selling medicines.
Morgan Stanley estimated that around $175 billion of 2025 U.S. large-cap biopharma revenue – 35% of the total – will go off patent by the end of the decade.
Companies “are trying to invest fast enough so that they can restock their pipelines and hopefully fill the gap,” said EY’s Baral. “These are capital allocation choices.”

Title: Centre approves construction of over 3.53 lakh houses under PMAY-U 2.0
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:31:51 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has approved the construction of over 3.53 lakh houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban 2.0 (PMAY-U 2.0). The decision was taken during the first meeting of the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) chaired by MoHUA Secretary Srinivas Katikithala on Thursday.
According to the ministry, a total of 3,52,915 houses have been sanctioned under the Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) components. These houses will be built across ten states and union territories—Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.
The scheme emphasizes women’s empowerment, with over 2.67 lakh houses approved specifically for women beneficiaries, including single women and widows. Additionally, 90 houses have been allocated to transgender individuals. The approved list also includes 80,850 houses for Scheduled Caste beneficiaries, 15,928 for Scheduled Tribes, and 2,12,603 for Other Backward Classes, aiming to promote inclusivity across underprivileged groups.
In a special initiative, the Uttar Pradesh government has committed additional financial assistance under the scheme, offering ₹30,000 to senior citizen beneficiaries aged over 70, and ₹20,000 each to unmarried women above 40 years of age, widows, and separated women.
PMAY-U 2.0, launched in September 2024, is currently under implementation, with Memorandums of Agreement signed between the Ministry and 31 states and union territories. The scheme is set to benefit one crore urban poor and middle-class families over five years. Implementation is being carried out through four verticals—Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), Affordable Rental Housing (ARH), and Interest Subsidy Scheme (ISS).
Eligible beneficiaries, particularly families from the EWS, LIG, and MIG categories who do not own a pucca house, are entitled to receive Central assistance of ₹2.50 lakh per housing unit. The total government assistance under PMAY-U 2.0 stands at ₹2.30 lakh crore, with an estimated total investment of ₹10 lakh crore.
Since the launch of PMAY-U in June 2015, 118.64 lakh houses have been sanctioned, with around 92 lakh already constructed and delivered.
Special provisions under PMAY-U 2.0 have been designed to address the housing needs of slum dwellers, SC/STs, minorities, widows, Persons with Disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, including safai karmis, street vendors identified under PM SVANidhi, artisans under Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Yojana, anganwadi workers, construction workers, and residents of slums and chawls.
Beneficiaries can apply directly for the scheme through the dedicated portal: https://pmaymis.gov.in/PMAYMIS2_2024/PmayDefault.aspx.

Title: Over 96,000 vehicles registered as ‘adapted’ for disabled since 2020: Centre
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 10:30:52 +0000
Content: More than 96,000 vehicles have been registered as ‘adapted’ vehicles for persons with disabilities since 2020, the government informed the Parliament on Friday.
An ‘adapted’ vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle that is either specially designed and constructed or modified to accommodate a person with a physical disability and is used exclusively by or for such individuals.
Persons with disabilities, including those with an orthopedic disability of 40% or more, can purchase adapted cars at a concessional Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate, provided they obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI).
According to the ministry, this concession applies only to motor vehicles that do not exceed a length of 4,000 mm. Petrol, LPG, or CNG-driven vehicles must have an engine capacity of no more than 1,200 cc, while diesel-driven vehicles must not exceed 1,500 cc.
The central government provides assistance through various schemes to help disabled individuals acquire or modify aids and appliances such as motorized tricycles, wheelchairs, prosthetic and orthotic devices, walking sticks, accessible smartphones, smart canes, low-vision aids, and hearing aids.

Title: India calls for ethical and responsible use of AI at the UN
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:54:33 +0000
Content: India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, on Thursday underscored the need for the responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI). He also highlighted the actions taken by the central government to integrate AI for good governance and developmental practices.
Speaking at the UN, Harish said that technology serves as a bridge to accelerate development and showcased how India is leveraging AI to achieve economic and developmental goals. He cited examples such as national biometric systems and financial inclusion initiatives as key measures demonstrating India’s integration of AI into development.
“We have integrated national AI missions and systems in a way that facilitates the removal of digital divides within and among countries. We cannot afford to leave anyone digitally behind in this new era. For example, when we deploy digital systems, they are designed to be accessible to all, regardless of economic status or educational background,” he said.
He further elaborated on how digital financial payment systems have empowered citizens.
“A vegetable vendor in Delhi or Mumbai no longer needs to wait for cash payments. Even if they are illiterate, they can use digital payment systems to conduct daily business. Similarly, someone who is illiterate can open a bank account without barriers related to education or class by using biometric identification systems linked to the financial system. Our focus is on ensuring that technological frameworks adhere to common design principles—systems that are open, modular, scalable, and interoperable,” he said.
Harish highlighted that India has developed many digital governance tools in an open-source format and has made their source codes publicly available online.
“This allows our friendly partner countries and companies to use and adapt these tools to their own national circumstances. This represents the future—where AI is not seen as a threat but as a cooperative, interoperable, open-source tool adaptable to different conditions worldwide. In this scenario, access to AI tools is not determined by a country’s wealth or GDP, nor by its membership in any particular group. Instead, AI should be accessible to all because, at a global level, we cannot afford to leave any nation behind in the digital and AI age,” he stressed.
The Ambassador reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance, as expressed at the recent AI Action Summit in Paris, advocating for a strong cooperative framework among all nations to establish effective regulatory systems.
He also announced that India will host the next AI Action Summit, which will serve as a guiding platform for global discussions on AI governance.

Title: Telecom fraud: DoT disconnects over 3.4 cr mobiles, blocks 17 lakh WhatsApp accounts
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 17:08:09 +0000
Content: In an effort to combat telecom fraud, the government on Friday said it has disconnected more than 3.4 crore mobile phones while blocking 3.19 lakh IMEI numbers to date through the Sanchar Saathi portal.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said that with the help of AI and Big Data, it also disengaged 16.97 lakh WhatsApp accounts.
Over 20,000 bulk SMS senders were also blacklisted as part of DoT’s ‘Sanchar Saathi’ initiative, said Dr. Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.
Through the Sanchar Saathi portal, the government facilitates citizens to report suspected fraud communications on the Chakshu facility.
DoT then carries out several analyses and takes action against telecom resources found to be linked to misuse, said the minister.
Rather than acting on individually reported suspected fraud communications, DoT uses crowdsourced data to carry out analyses and zero in on the misuse of telecom resources.
The Department uses AI-based tools and big data analysis to identify suspected mobile connections obtained using fake documents.
Furthermore, DoT and telecom service providers (TSPs) have devised a system for near real-time identification and blocking of incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers and appear to originate from India, said the minister.
Meanwhile, telecom service providers have blacklisted 1,150 entities/individuals and disconnected more than 18.8 lakh resources.
The actions led to a significant reduction in the complaints against unregistered telemarketers (UTMs) — from 1,89,419 in August 2024 to 1,34,821 in January 2025.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 on February 12.
A customer can now file a complaint about spam or unsolicited commercial communication (UCC) within seven days of receiving it, compared to the previous three-day time limit.
The time limit for taking action by the access providers against the UCC from unregistered senders has been reduced from 30 days to 5 days, according to the amendments.

Title: Cash at judge’s residence: CJI to examine ‘in-house’ enquiry report
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 17:02:33 +0000
Content: Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna will receive the report on Friday, prepared by the Delhi High Court’s Chief Justice D.K. Upadhyaya, after a large amount of unaccounted cash was reportedly discovered at the residence of a high court judge in the national capital.
“The Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, who had commenced his inquiry before the Collegium meeting on March 20, 2025, will be submitting his report to the Chief Justice of India today, i.e., on March 21, 2025. The report will be examined and processed for further and necessary action,” said a statement released by the Supreme Court.
According to media reports, a large sum of cash was discovered last week when a fire brigade arrived at the residence of Delhi HC’s Justice Yashwant Varma to extinguish a fire.
The Supreme Court’s press statement clarified that the proposal to transfer Justice Varma—who is the second-senior-most judge in the Delhi High Court—to his parent High Court, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (where he will rank ninth in seniority), is “independent and separate from the in-house inquiry procedure.”
“The proposal was examined by the Collegium comprising the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and four senior-most Judges of the Supreme Court on March 20, 2025, and thereafter letters were written to the consultee Judges of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justices of the High Courts concerned, and Justice Yashwant Varma. Responses received will be examined, and thereupon, the Collegium will pass a resolution,” the statement added.
“Misinformation and rumors are being spread regarding the incident at the residence of Justice Yashwant Varma,” the press statement said.
Under the “in-house procedure,” the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is authorized to receive complaints regarding the conduct of Supreme Court judges and High Court Chief Justices. Similarly, the Chief Justices of the High Courts are authorized to receive complaints against the conduct of High Court judges.
The Supreme Court, in its full-court meeting in May 1997, adopted two resolutions. The first resolution, “The Restatement of Values of Judicial Life,” lays down certain judicial standards and principles to be observed and followed by the judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The second, “in-house procedure,” provides for taking suitable remedial action against judges who do not follow universally accepted values of judicial life, including those included in the Restatement.
According to the Supreme Court judgment in Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India, the report of a committee constituted under the “in-house procedure” is not to be made public.
The existing Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) provides that the proposal for the transfer of High Court judges is initiated by the CJI in consultation with four senior-most puisne judges of the Supreme Court, commonly known as the Collegium. The MoP further provides that the CJI is also expected to take into account the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the judge is to be transferred, as well as the Chief Justice of the High Court to which the transfer is to be effected, besides taking into account the views of one or more Supreme Court judges who are in a position to offer insights.
Born in January 1969, Justice Varma earned a law degree from Rewa University and primarily practiced civil law, handling a wide range of matters related to constitutional issues, industrial disputes, corporate law, taxation, environmental law, and allied fields. He served as Chief Standing Counsel for the State of UP from 2012 till August 2013, when he was designated as ‘senior advocate’ by the Allahabad High Court. Justice Varma was elevated as an Additional Judge in October 2014 and was transferred to the Delhi High Court in October 2021.
At the Delhi High Court, Justice Varma is currently the second-senior-most judge dealing with writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of any law, statutory rule, regulation, or notification pertaining to municipal tax. As per the latest roster, the Justice Varma-led division bench, which also comprised Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, dealt with sales tax cases, GST cases, Letters Patent Appeals, regular First Appeals (Original Side), Company Appeals, matters to be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division, etc.

Title: MEA on Pakistan High Commission’s Iftar invitation: “Nimantran toh rishton pe nirbhar karta hai”
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:15:46 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday emphasized that invitations between nations are contingent upon the state of bilateral relations, responding to queries on whether any Indian government officials were invited to the Iftar dinner hosted by the Pakistan High Commission to mark Pakistan’s National Day.
Addressing the media during the weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal remarked, “Nimantran toh rishton pe nirbhar karta hai” (invitations depend on the relationship between the countries). Accepting an invitation also depends on the relationship.”
The comments came after the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi hosted an Iftar gathering on Thursday as part of its annual observance of Pakistan’s National Day. The event was attended by dignitaries, diplomats, and prominent personalities, including former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was present as a guest. The gathering aimed to foster diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange.
However, alongside discussions on diplomatic courtesies, India reiterated its strong stance against Pakistan’s role in promoting cross-border terrorism, which remains a significant obstacle to regional peace and stability.
“The world clearly knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism. In fact, this is the biggest roadblock to peace and security in the region,” Jaiswal stated.
Jaiswal’s remarks underscored the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding Islamabad’s support for terrorist organizations operating in the region. India has consistently called on Pakistan to take decisive action against these groups.
Referring to Pakistan’s recent comments on Jammu and Kashmir, Jaiswal directed the media to a previous statement issued by the MEA. “I urge you to refer to the statement we released two days ago for more information,” he added.
The MEA’s response follows Pakistan’s remarks on Jammu and Kashmir, which came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed India-Pakistan relations in a podcast interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman.
In the interview, PM Modi reflected on his efforts to improve ties with Pakistan, including inviting then-Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and making a surprise visit to Lahore in 2015 in an attempt to foster goodwill.
“I even personally traveled to Lahore in the pursuit of peace. When I became Prime Minister, I specially invited Pakistan to my swearing-in ceremony so we could turn over a new leaf. Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal,” PM Modi stated in the podcast.
His comments came just days after Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement criticizing India in the wake of the attack on the Jaffar Express train by Baloch rebels, in which passengers were taken hostage. In response to PM Modi’s remarks on the podcast, Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement rebuffing his comments.

Title: Nature’s groceries and safety net: How forests help feed the world better
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:55:51 +0000
Content: Our forests play a vital role in feeding the world. From wild foods to fresh water, from shelter to energy, forests sustain billions of people and biodiversity.
Yet we continue to lose them at an alarming rate through deforestation and land degradation. Between 2015 and 2020, more than 10 million hectares of forest were lost each year—an area roughly the size of the Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, intensifying wildfires and pest outbreaks are further threatening these valuable ecosystems.
Studies have shown that a major underlying driver of deforestation is the need to meet the demands of a growing global population. As we mark International Day of Forests with the theme ‘Forests and Foods’, we must urgently address the question of how we can ensure food security for all, while protecting the forests that are so fundamental to our agrifood systems.
The answer lies in embracing solutions that combine both agriculture and forests.
We can make landscapes more productive through sustainable intensification, integrated production systems and circular economies. By building on both innovation and traditional knowledge, we can limit the expansion of arable land, while producing the foods we need.
FAO’s Action Against Desertification programme has been working in Africa’s Sahel region to ensure that the traditional knowledge and interests of rural communities are at the heart of efforts to restore degraded lands. This has encouraged the selection and planting of many wild food species rich in micronutrients. As a result, not only have regreening and growth rates of plants improved, but food insecurity has also declined.
In Colombia, where Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage 53 percent of land and forests, a new community forest management model is being deployed to help halt deforestation and improve coordination between agriculture and forestry. By establishing nurseries, agroforestry systems and restoration actions, and promoting financial incentives and the use of timber and non-timber forest products, the new model has revitalized community forest enterprises and increased market access, improving the quality of life for many people in rural areas.
In Vanuatu, an innovative project is improving harvests in traditional water gardens by incorporating new technologies, practices and plant varieties for sustainable water and forest management in an area where the deterioration of forests had reduced water capacity. This has helped curb water waste and increase overall water availability, contributing to recharging water sources for taro, an important staple crop for local diets and food security for the country.
In Tunisia, a project jointly implemented by FAO together with partners has focused on reseeding degraded land with a native legume that livestock can graze on, while regenerating local shrubs and trees such as saltbush, carob, medic tree and cactus pear, which support livelihoods, while providing shade for crops and additional fodder. As a result, the cost of feeding livestock on the restored site has halved.
These examples show how forests, bushes and grasslands integration with new crops can enhance food production.
Forests provide habitat for pollinators and are home to most of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, necessary both to increasing food production and improving sustainability.
Forests nourish soils, regulate temperature and offer sustenance and shade for livestock. They can act as natural barriers against wind for crops and deliver fresh water to more than 85 percent of the world’s major cities.
Forests are nature’s groceries, providing a direct source of vegetables, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers, mushrooms, honey, natural herbs and protein-rich wild meat for rural communities and functional foods in the urban areas. This is even more so during times of crisis, when forests serve as an emergency food security net.
Agroforestry—incorporating trees into farming—can improve ecosystem, increase crop resilience, restore degraded land and enhance food production and food diversity, as well as increasing farmer incomes.
Silvopastoral systems, which combine tree cultivation and restoration with livestock grazing and fodder cropping, are also important.
At the same time, more efforts must be made to restore more than two billion hectares of land estimated to be degraded worldwide. The good news is that some 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land are suitable for mosaic restoration, that is combining forests and trees with agriculture.
A further 1 billion hectares of croplands on previous forestlands would benefit from strategic additions of trees and bushes to enrich both agricultural productivity and ecosystem services.
The path forward requires policy changes that reflect the interdependence of agriculture and forests. While many countries have begun integrating agroforestry into their national land use plans, we need a broader commitment to policies that view forests as essential to food security and food diversity.
This extends to private sector commitments to zero deforestation in agricultural value chains and ensuring that those commitments translate to measurable actions.
Finally, educating consumers on healthier diets and healthy life from sustainable agrifood systems and reducing food loss and waste are also key.
Forests are key to the transformation of global agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable.
When forests themselves as a big part of agrifood systems are deemed indispensable to human well-being, then incentives to care for them will grow.
We need to stress forests as a big bridge to integrate implementation under the guidance of the Four Betters: Better Production, Better Nutrition, a Better Environment and a Better Life – leaving no one behind.
Conserving and sustainably managing and using forests is not just an environmental imperative—it’s a crucial strategy for food security and food diversity. Without this, meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) – ending hunger and poverty and restoring ecosystems – becomes more elusive.

Title: SEBI proposes ESOP benefits for startup founders even after IPO
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:04:32 +0000
Content: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a rule change that would allow startup founders to retain Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) even after their company goes public.
This move aims to support founders of new-age technology companies, who often receive ESOPs in place of cash salaries during their company’s early years.
ESOPs align founders’ interests with those of other shareholders. However, as startups raise investments, founders’ ownership stakes are diluted.
Under current SEBI rules, founders are classified as promoters at the time of filing for an initial public offering (IPO).
Existing regulations prohibit issuing ESOPs to promoters, creating a challenge for founders who received stock options as employees before the IPO.
The market regulator noted that an employee who becomes a promoter due to their shareholding may be required to forfeit ESOP benefits, which could be deemed unfair.
It noted that the rules are unclear on whether such founders can exercise their vested and unvested ESOPs after being classified as promoters.
To address this, SEBI has proposed clarifying that stock benefits granted to founders will continue even if they are later classified as promoters in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). However, the rule preventing new ESOP issuances to promoters will still apply.
This proposal is expected to benefit startup founders who receive equity-based compensation and ensure they do not lose their ESOP benefits after their company goes public.
Meanwhile, SEBI recently partnered with DigiLocker to help investors track their securities holdings and reduce unclaimed financial assets.
This initiative aims to enhance investor protection and make access to financial holdings easier and more secure.
With this integration, investors will be able to store and retrieve details of their demat accounts and mutual fund holdings through DigiLocker.
The platform already provides access to bank account statements, insurance policies, and National Pension System (NPS) details.
Now, it will also serve as a centralised place for managing securities information.

Title: At least 10 military personnel, journalists killed in attack on presidential palace in Sudan’s capital
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:59:17 +0000
Content: At least 10 military personnel and journalists were killed in a drone attack targeting a military and media gathering inside the Republican Palace in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, according to a military source.
“A suicide drone attacked the outer courtyard of the palace, killing approximately 10 military personnel and journalists,” the military source told Xinhua news agency on the condition of anonymity.
An eyewitness said the drone launched about two projectiles into the outer courtyard of the palace when “soldiers of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) were celebrating the takeover of the palace, and a Sudan TV team was covering the event.”
Another eyewitness told Xinhua that among the casualties were two military media officers, several soldiers from the SAF’s moral guidance division, and three members of the official Sudan TV, with the death toll expected to rise.
The incident came after the SAF reportedly regained control of the Republican Palace, or the presidential palace, on Friday, which had been held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since mid-April 2023.
Later on Friday, the RSF vowed in a statement that the battle for the palace is “not over yet,” stressing that its forces remain in the vicinity and continue to fight.
The RSF also claimed it had carried out a military operation inside the palace, killing 89 army personnel and destroying various military vehicles.
Sudan has been embroiled in a devastating conflict between the SAF and the RSF since mid-April 2023, which has claimed almost 30,000 lives, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group cited by the United Nations.
The conflict has also displaced more than 15 million people, both inside and outside Sudan, according to estimates by the International Organisation for Migration.

Title: “Conversations and dialogues have been going on”: MEA on ties with China
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:39:18 +0000
Content: India and China continue to make progress in their diplomatic relations, with ongoing constructive engagements at various levels, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Friday.
Addressing a weekly media briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal highlighted key developments in the relationship between the two nations. He pointed out that the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan was a significant step forward, followed by productive discussions between Indian Foreign Secretary and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister. Since then, he said, India and China have remained engaged at multiple levels, including discussions involving External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval.
Jaiswal emphasized that conversations between both sides have been moving in the right direction. He noted that several agreements had been reached in principle, and further progress is expected in the coming days.
The high-level engagement between PM Modi and Xi took place on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, on October 23, 2024. One of the key takeaways from these discussions was the decision to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in 2025. The pilgrimage, which holds immense religious significance for Hindus, had been suspended in recent years. While the finer details are still being worked out, Jaiswal confirmed that both countries had agreed to facilitate the yatra’s revival.
The MEA spokesperson also underscored broader efforts to improve India-China relations, mentioning a series of initiatives agreed upon by both nations. These include the resumption of trade through the Nathula border, cooperation on trans-border rivers, enhanced border management to maintain peace and stability, and renewed efforts to promote cultural, educational, and tourism exchanges. The broader objective, he said, is to foster a stable, predictable, and amicable relationship between the two countries.
Meanwhile, India is also advancing its trade negotiations with Peru, with the long-pending Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries now in its final stages. The eighth round of negotiations is expected to take place soon. According to Jaiswal, discussions on the agreement have been ongoing since 2017, and both sides remain committed to finalizing the deal.
During his visit to India for the Raisina Dialogue 2025, Peru’s Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer spoke about the need to enhance logistical connectivity between the two nations to strengthen economic ties. He proposed the construction of a naval and aerial hub with two large ports to facilitate trade and investment. Schialer stressed that Peru views India as one of its most important trading partners and that a successful FTA would send a strong signal to businesses in both countries to collaborate more closely.
With bilateral trade between India and Peru growing from USD 66 million in 2003 to USD 3.68 billion in 2023, the proposed agreement is expected to further enhance economic cooperation. While some sensitive sectors, such as textiles, have been set aside for later discussions, both nations are determined to move forward in other key areas.
Schialer also spoke about the importance of cooperation within the Global South, emphasizing the need for tangible measures to strengthen ties in trade, investment, and cultural exchanges. He expressed hope that the India-Peru FTA could be finalized by the end of the year, paving the way for deeper economic engagement.

Title: Naxalism will be eliminated from the country by March 21, 2026: Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:12:21 +0000
Content: Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday outlined the steps taken by the BJP-led government to strengthen internal security and said Naxalism will be eliminated from the country by March 21, 2026.
Replying to the debate on the functioning of his ministry in Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah spoke about the steps taken by the government to tackle terrorism in J-K, the Naxal challenge, drug abuse, and issues in the Northeast.
He said the country would be free of the “Naxal problem” during the term of the BJP-led government.
“I say it in this House with responsibility that Naxalism in this country will be eliminated by March 21, 2026,” he said.
Amit Shah spoke about the steps taken by the government to provide accurate intelligence to security forces dealing with Naxalites and expressed pity for those who believe Naxalism is merely a political issue.
“When Narendra Modi Government was elected to power in 2014, we received several legacy issues from prior to 2014. The security and development of this country were always challenged due to three main issues. These three issues caused obstruction to the peace of the country, raised questions on the security of the country, and slowed the pace of development for almost four decades; they also made the country’s entire system appear laughable at times,” he said.
“These three issues were terrorism in J-K, Leftist insurgency, which aimed to extend from Tirupati to Pashupatinath, and the Northeast insurgency. When combined, these three issues have led to the deaths of around 92,000 citizens over four decades. A well-planned effort was never made to eliminate these challenges. PM Narendra Modi took those efforts after coming to power,” he added.
Amit Shah said 21 members shared their views on the functioning of his ministry.
“Efforts were made to address various aspects of the MHA’s work. First of all, I express my gratitude to thousands of state police and central paramilitary force jawans who made the supreme sacrifice to strengthen the country’s internal security as well as its borders,” he said.
Amit Shah said several crimes, such as narcotics trafficking and cybercrime, have inter-state and even international dimensions.
“In a way, the Home Ministry operates under very difficult conditions. The Constitution has given the responsibility of law and order to states, while border security and internal security come under the MHA. This is a correct decision, and there is no need for any changes. However, after 76 years, we now face a situation where many crimes are not confined to state borders—they are inter-state and even multi-state, such as narcotics, cybercrime, organized crime gangs, and hawala transactions,” he said.
“All these crimes do not take place just within a state. Several crimes are committed in the country, even orchestrated from outside its borders. So, keeping all this in view, it becomes essential to make changes in the MHA. I say this with pride that in 10 years, PM Narendra Modi made long-overdue changes to the MHA at once to ensure national security,” he added.
Amit Shah also spoke about the changes in the situation in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.
“After the removal of Article 370, the involvement of Indian youth with terrorists has almost disappeared. Ten years ago, terrorist glorification was common, and funeral processions would take place. But now, when terrorists are killed, they are buried on the spot. Relatives of terrorists who once enjoyed government perks have been dismissed from government posts to send a strong message,” he said.
“I want to thank our Constitution makers for making Article 370 temporary and providing a solution for its removal within the same article. However, vote bank politics kept it safeguarded. But on August 5, 2019, PM Modi took the historic step of removing it, marking the beginning of a new era of Kashmir’s integration with the rest of India,” he said.

Title: One million malnourished children in Nigeria and Ethiopia risk losing aid, UNICEF says
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:25:17 +0000
Content: The United Nations children’s agency said on Friday it will run out of its supply of lifesaving food to treat children suffering from acute forms of malnutrition in Ethiopia and Nigeria within the next two months due to lack of funding exacerbated by Trump administration cuts to foreign aid.
Some 1.3 million children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition risk losing access to lifesaving support this year in Ethiopia and Nigeria, UNICEF says.
“Without new funding, we will run out of our supply chain of Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food by May, and that means that 70,000 children in Ethiopia that depend on this type of treatment cannot be served,” Kitty Van der Heijden, UNICEF’s deputy executive director, told reporters in Geneva via video link from Abuja on Friday. “Interruption to continuous treatment is life-threatening.”
In Nigeria, UNICEF said it may run out of supplies to feed 80,000 malnourished children as soon as the end of this month. Van der Heijden described recently being in a hospital in Maiduguri with a child who was so malnourished that her skin was falling off.
International donors have in recent years reduced contributions to UN agencies, including UNICEF. Its funding woes were accelerated when the United States, its top donor, imposed a 90-day pause on all U.S. foreign aid on the first day of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.
That action, and ensuing orders halting many programmes of the U.S. Agency for International Development worldwide, have jeopardised the delivery of lifesaving food and medical aid, throwing into chaos global humanitarian relief efforts.
“This funding crisis will become a child survival crisis,” warned Van der Heijden, adding that the sudden nature of the cuts did not give the agency the ability to mitigate the risks.
Funding cuts have also hit health programmes offering nutrition and malaria care for pregnant women and children in Ethiopia. Twenty-three mobile health clinics were taken out of operation in the region of Afar, with only seven left operating due to funding cuts, according to UNICEF.

Title: On World Water Day, PM Modi reaffirms commitment to conserve nature’s vital element
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:35:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated the Centre’s dedication to water conservation and sustainable development on the occasion of World Water Day on Saturday.
He emphasised the need to preserve this vital resource for future generations and highlighted India’s ongoing efforts to ensure water security.
Observed annually on March 22 since 1993, World Water Day underscores the significance of freshwater and supports Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims for water and sanitation access for all by 2030. The theme for World Water Day 2025 is ‘Glacier Preservation.’
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “On World Water Day, we reaffirm our commitment to conserve water and promote sustainable development. Water has been the lifeline of civilisations, and thus, it is more important to protect it for future generations!”
In a video post, he further stressed the cultural and historical significance of water conservation in India.
“Water is the foundation of life and the world’s greatest resource. That is why our ancestors focussed so much on water conservation. From the Vedas to the Puranas, it has always been said that it is humanity’s utmost duty to build lakes, dams, and reservoirs to save water,” he said.
PM Modi warned that a lack of water threatens not just individual well-being but also national development. He underscored the role of the Jal Jeevan Mission in ensuring water availability, management, and maintenance, particularly in rural areas.
“Work is also being done to conserve water sources in villages. It may be possible that water is available in sufficient quantity where you are now, but we must always remember the millions who live in water-scarce areas,” he urged.
Highlighting the cultural aspect of water conservation, he called for revitalising traditions that celebrate rivers.
“Taking inspiration from the Maha Kumbh, we must give new meaning to river festivals. This will help the present generation understand the importance of water, encourage river cleanliness, and ensure their protection,” he added.

Title: Trump revokes legal status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:40:46 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration will revoke the temporary legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans in the United States, according to a Federal Register notice on Friday, the latest expansion of his crackdown on immigration.
The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year “parole” granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden that allowed them to enter the country by air if they had U.S. sponsors.
Trump, a Republican, took steps to ramp up immigration enforcement after taking office, including a push to deport record numbers of migrants in the U.S. illegally. He has argued that the legal entry parole programs launched under his Democratic predecessor overstepped the boundaries of federal law and called for their termination in a January 20 executive order.
Trump said on March 6 that he would decide “very soon” whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the U.S. during the conflict with Russia. Trump’s remarks came in response to a Reuters report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.
Biden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the United States have been strained.
The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Trump administration’s decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the U.S. It remains unclear how many who entered the U.S. on parole now have another form of protection or legal status.
In a notice set to formally publish in the Federal Register on Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place the migrants in a fast-track deportation process known as “expedited removal.”
Under a Trump-era policy implemented in January, expedited removal can be applied to certain migrants in the U.S. for two years or less.

Brussels had said last month it would amend the EU’s climate law this quarter – a long-planned move that would set a 2040 target to keep countries on track between their 2030 emissions goal, and the bloc’s aim for zero net emissions by 2050.
However, the proposal has run into political opposition, with some member states and lawmakers reluctant to back the 90% emissions cut, which the Commission has previously indicated should be set as the 2040 target.
The EU’s climate targets set out in law how much countries must reduce their net emissions, compared with 1990 levels.
“We can confidently assume that it will not be adopted in Q1,” a Commission spokesperson told a regular press briefing on Friday, declining to confirm when the target will be proposed.
The EU – like most countries in the world – has also missed a February deadline to submit a 2035 climate plan to the U.N., which the Commission has said should be derived from the EU’s 2040 goal.
The EU has vowed not to backtrack on its climate change commitments, despite President Donald Trump scrapping the green goals of the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, and pulling it out of the Paris climate agreement.
Europe is the planet’s fastest-warming continent, and has suffered disastrous heatwaves, floods and droughts in recent years that scientists have said were directly linked to human-caused global warming.
But Europe’s green agenda is facing increasing pressure from industries and some governments, who say environmental rules are hurting businesses already struggling with high energy prices and weak demand. The EU agreed this month to loosen CO2-cutting rules for carmakers, after pleas from industry.
Some EU officials also note a reluctance to launch political negotiations on the 2040 climate goal ahead of Polish presidential elections in May. Poland currently holds the rotating EU presidency and chairs negotiations among EU countries until July.
Warsaw had initially resisted the EU’s 2050 climate target, citing concerns about the cost of the energy transition for the coal-reliant nation.
“I don’t see a majority backing 90%,” one EU diplomat said, referring to EU countries’ positions on the 2040 goal.

Title: Telecom fraud: DoT disconnects over 3.4 cr mobiles, blocks 17 lakh WhatsApp accounts
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 17:08:09 +0000
Content: In an effort to combat telecom fraud, the government on Friday said it has disconnected more than 3.4 crore mobile phones while blocking 3.19 lakh IMEI numbers to date through the Sanchar Saathi portal.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said that with the help of AI and Big Data, it also disengaged 16.97 lakh WhatsApp accounts.
Over 20,000 bulk SMS senders were also blacklisted as part of DoT’s ‘Sanchar Saathi’ initiative, said Dr. Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.
Through the Sanchar Saathi portal, the government facilitates citizens to report suspected fraud communications on the Chakshu facility.
DoT then carries out several analyses and takes action against telecom resources found to be linked to misuse, said the minister.
Rather than acting on individually reported suspected fraud communications, DoT uses crowdsourced data to carry out analyses and zero in on the misuse of telecom resources.
The Department uses AI-based tools and big data analysis to identify suspected mobile connections obtained using fake documents.
Furthermore, DoT and telecom service providers (TSPs) have devised a system for near real-time identification and blocking of incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers and appear to originate from India, said the minister.
Meanwhile, telecom service providers have blacklisted 1,150 entities/individuals and disconnected more than 18.8 lakh resources.
The actions led to a significant reduction in the complaints against unregistered telemarketers (UTMs) — from 1,89,419 in August 2024 to 1,34,821 in January 2025.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 on February 12.
A customer can now file a complaint about spam or unsolicited commercial communication (UCC) within seven days of receiving it, compared to the previous three-day time limit.
The time limit for taking action by the access providers against the UCC from unregistered senders has been reduced from 30 days to 5 days, according to the amendments.

Title: Cash at judge’s residence: CJI to examine ‘in-house’ enquiry report
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 17:02:33 +0000
Content: Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna will receive the report on Friday, prepared by the Delhi High Court’s Chief Justice D.K. Upadhyaya, after a large amount of unaccounted cash was reportedly discovered at the residence of a high court judge in the national capital.
“The Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, who had commenced his inquiry before the Collegium meeting on March 20, 2025, will be submitting his report to the Chief Justice of India today, i.e., on March 21, 2025. The report will be examined and processed for further and necessary action,” said a statement released by the Supreme Court.
According to media reports, a large sum of cash was discovered last week when a fire brigade arrived at the residence of Delhi HC’s Justice Yashwant Varma to extinguish a fire.
The Supreme Court’s press statement clarified that the proposal to transfer Justice Varma—who is the second-senior-most judge in the Delhi High Court—to his parent High Court, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (where he will rank ninth in seniority), is “independent and separate from the in-house inquiry procedure.”
“The proposal was examined by the Collegium comprising the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and four senior-most Judges of the Supreme Court on March 20, 2025, and thereafter letters were written to the consultee Judges of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justices of the High Courts concerned, and Justice Yashwant Varma. Responses received will be examined, and thereupon, the Collegium will pass a resolution,” the statement added.
“Misinformation and rumors are being spread regarding the incident at the residence of Justice Yashwant Varma,” the press statement said.
Under the “in-house procedure,” the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is authorized to receive complaints regarding the conduct of Supreme Court judges and High Court Chief Justices. Similarly, the Chief Justices of the High Courts are authorized to receive complaints against the conduct of High Court judges.
The Supreme Court, in its full-court meeting in May 1997, adopted two resolutions. The first resolution, “The Restatement of Values of Judicial Life,” lays down certain judicial standards and principles to be observed and followed by the judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The second, “in-house procedure,” provides for taking suitable remedial action against judges who do not follow universally accepted values of judicial life, including those included in the Restatement.
According to the Supreme Court judgment in Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India, the report of a committee constituted under the “in-house procedure” is not to be made public.
The existing Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) provides that the proposal for the transfer of High Court judges is initiated by the CJI in consultation with four senior-most puisne judges of the Supreme Court, commonly known as the Collegium. The MoP further provides that the CJI is also expected to take into account the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the judge is to be transferred, as well as the Chief Justice of the High Court to which the transfer is to be effected, besides taking into account the views of one or more Supreme Court judges who are in a position to offer insights.
Born in January 1969, Justice Varma earned a law degree from Rewa University and primarily practiced civil law, handling a wide range of matters related to constitutional issues, industrial disputes, corporate law, taxation, environmental law, and allied fields. He served as Chief Standing Counsel for the State of UP from 2012 till August 2013, when he was designated as ‘senior advocate’ by the Allahabad High Court. Justice Varma was elevated as an Additional Judge in October 2014 and was transferred to the Delhi High Court in October 2021.
At the Delhi High Court, Justice Varma is currently the second-senior-most judge dealing with writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of any law, statutory rule, regulation, or notification pertaining to municipal tax. As per the latest roster, the Justice Varma-led division bench, which also comprised Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, dealt with sales tax cases, GST cases, Letters Patent Appeals, regular First Appeals (Original Side), Company Appeals, matters to be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division, etc.

Title: MEA on Pakistan High Commission’s Iftar invitation: “Nimantran toh rishton pe nirbhar karta hai”
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:15:46 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday emphasized that invitations between nations are contingent upon the state of bilateral relations, responding to queries on whether any Indian government officials were invited to the Iftar dinner hosted by the Pakistan High Commission to mark Pakistan’s National Day.
Addressing the media during the weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal remarked, “Nimantran toh rishton pe nirbhar karta hai” (invitations depend on the relationship between the countries). Accepting an invitation also depends on the relationship.”
The comments came after the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi hosted an Iftar gathering on Thursday as part of its annual observance of Pakistan’s National Day. The event was attended by dignitaries, diplomats, and prominent personalities, including former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was present as a guest. The gathering aimed to foster diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange.
However, alongside discussions on diplomatic courtesies, India reiterated its strong stance against Pakistan’s role in promoting cross-border terrorism, which remains a significant obstacle to regional peace and stability.
“The world clearly knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism. In fact, this is the biggest roadblock to peace and security in the region,” Jaiswal stated.
Jaiswal’s remarks underscored the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding Islamabad’s support for terrorist organizations operating in the region. India has consistently called on Pakistan to take decisive action against these groups.
Referring to Pakistan’s recent comments on Jammu and Kashmir, Jaiswal directed the media to a previous statement issued by the MEA. “I urge you to refer to the statement we released two days ago for more information,” he added.
The MEA’s response follows Pakistan’s remarks on Jammu and Kashmir, which came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed India-Pakistan relations in a podcast interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman.
In the interview, PM Modi reflected on his efforts to improve ties with Pakistan, including inviting then-Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and making a surprise visit to Lahore in 2015 in an attempt to foster goodwill.
“I even personally traveled to Lahore in the pursuit of peace. When I became Prime Minister, I specially invited Pakistan to my swearing-in ceremony so we could turn over a new leaf. Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal,” PM Modi stated in the podcast.
His comments came just days after Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement criticizing India in the wake of the attack on the Jaffar Express train by Baloch rebels, in which passengers were taken hostage. In response to PM Modi’s remarks on the podcast, Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement rebuffing his comments.

Title: Nature’s groceries and safety net: How forests help feed the world better
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:55:51 +0000
Content: Our forests play a vital role in feeding the world. From wild foods to fresh water, from shelter to energy, forests sustain billions of people and biodiversity.
Yet we continue to lose them at an alarming rate through deforestation and land degradation. Between 2015 and 2020, more than 10 million hectares of forest were lost each year—an area roughly the size of the Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, intensifying wildfires and pest outbreaks are further threatening these valuable ecosystems.
Studies have shown that a major underlying driver of deforestation is the need to meet the demands of a growing global population. As we mark International Day of Forests with the theme ‘Forests and Foods’, we must urgently address the question of how we can ensure food security for all, while protecting the forests that are so fundamental to our agrifood systems.
The answer lies in embracing solutions that combine both agriculture and forests.
We can make landscapes more productive through sustainable intensification, integrated production systems and circular economies. By building on both innovation and traditional knowledge, we can limit the expansion of arable land, while producing the foods we need.
FAO’s Action Against Desertification programme has been working in Africa’s Sahel region to ensure that the traditional knowledge and interests of rural communities are at the heart of efforts to restore degraded lands. This has encouraged the selection and planting of many wild food species rich in micronutrients. As a result, not only have regreening and growth rates of plants improved, but food insecurity has also declined.
In Colombia, where Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage 53 percent of land and forests, a new community forest management model is being deployed to help halt deforestation and improve coordination between agriculture and forestry. By establishing nurseries, agroforestry systems and restoration actions, and promoting financial incentives and the use of timber and non-timber forest products, the new model has revitalized community forest enterprises and increased market access, improving the quality of life for many people in rural areas.
In Vanuatu, an innovative project is improving harvests in traditional water gardens by incorporating new technologies, practices and plant varieties for sustainable water and forest management in an area where the deterioration of forests had reduced water capacity. This has helped curb water waste and increase overall water availability, contributing to recharging water sources for taro, an important staple crop for local diets and food security for the country.
In Tunisia, a project jointly implemented by FAO together with partners has focused on reseeding degraded land with a native legume that livestock can graze on, while regenerating local shrubs and trees such as saltbush, carob, medic tree and cactus pear, which support livelihoods, while providing shade for crops and additional fodder. As a result, the cost of feeding livestock on the restored site has halved.
These examples show how forests, bushes and grasslands integration with new crops can enhance food production.
Forests provide habitat for pollinators and are home to most of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, necessary both to increasing food production and improving sustainability.
Forests nourish soils, regulate temperature and offer sustenance and shade for livestock. They can act as natural barriers against wind for crops and deliver fresh water to more than 85 percent of the world’s major cities.
Forests are nature’s groceries, providing a direct source of vegetables, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers, mushrooms, honey, natural herbs and protein-rich wild meat for rural communities and functional foods in the urban areas. This is even more so during times of crisis, when forests serve as an emergency food security net.
Agroforestry—incorporating trees into farming—can improve ecosystem, increase crop resilience, restore degraded land and enhance food production and food diversity, as well as increasing farmer incomes.
Silvopastoral systems, which combine tree cultivation and restoration with livestock grazing and fodder cropping, are also important.
At the same time, more efforts must be made to restore more than two billion hectares of land estimated to be degraded worldwide. The good news is that some 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land are suitable for mosaic restoration, that is combining forests and trees with agriculture.
A further 1 billion hectares of croplands on previous forestlands would benefit from strategic additions of trees and bushes to enrich both agricultural productivity and ecosystem services.
The path forward requires policy changes that reflect the interdependence of agriculture and forests. While many countries have begun integrating agroforestry into their national land use plans, we need a broader commitment to policies that view forests as essential to food security and food diversity.
This extends to private sector commitments to zero deforestation in agricultural value chains and ensuring that those commitments translate to measurable actions.
Finally, educating consumers on healthier diets and healthy life from sustainable agrifood systems and reducing food loss and waste are also key.
Forests are key to the transformation of global agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable.
When forests themselves as a big part of agrifood systems are deemed indispensable to human well-being, then incentives to care for them will grow.
We need to stress forests as a big bridge to integrate implementation under the guidance of the Four Betters: Better Production, Better Nutrition, a Better Environment and a Better Life – leaving no one behind.
Conserving and sustainably managing and using forests is not just an environmental imperative—it’s a crucial strategy for food security and food diversity. Without this, meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) – ending hunger and poverty and restoring ecosystems – becomes more elusive.

Title: SEBI proposes ESOP benefits for startup founders even after IPO
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:04:32 +0000
Content: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a rule change that would allow startup founders to retain Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) even after their company goes public.
This move aims to support founders of new-age technology companies, who often receive ESOPs in place of cash salaries during their company’s early years.
ESOPs align founders’ interests with those of other shareholders. However, as startups raise investments, founders’ ownership stakes are diluted.
Under current SEBI rules, founders are classified as promoters at the time of filing for an initial public offering (IPO).
Existing regulations prohibit issuing ESOPs to promoters, creating a challenge for founders who received stock options as employees before the IPO.
The market regulator noted that an employee who becomes a promoter due to their shareholding may be required to forfeit ESOP benefits, which could be deemed unfair.
It noted that the rules are unclear on whether such founders can exercise their vested and unvested ESOPs after being classified as promoters.
To address this, SEBI has proposed clarifying that stock benefits granted to founders will continue even if they are later classified as promoters in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). However, the rule preventing new ESOP issuances to promoters will still apply.
This proposal is expected to benefit startup founders who receive equity-based compensation and ensure they do not lose their ESOP benefits after their company goes public.
Meanwhile, SEBI recently partnered with DigiLocker to help investors track their securities holdings and reduce unclaimed financial assets.
This initiative aims to enhance investor protection and make access to financial holdings easier and more secure.
With this integration, investors will be able to store and retrieve details of their demat accounts and mutual fund holdings through DigiLocker.
The platform already provides access to bank account statements, insurance policies, and National Pension System (NPS) details.
Now, it will also serve as a centralised place for managing securities information.

Title: Turkey detains 343 people over protests against Istanbul mayor’s detention, interior ministry says
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:35:43 +0000
Content: Turkish authorities have detained 343 people during overnight protests in several cities against the detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday.
Demonstrations took place in more than a dozen cities including Turkey’s biggest city Istanbul and the capital Ankara, the ministry said in a statement.
It said the detentions were made to prevent “disrupting of public order” and warned that authorities would not tolerate “chaos and provocation.”
Tens of thousands of Turks have taken to the streets in mostly peaceful demonstrations since Wednesday, when Imamoglu was detained on charges such as graft and aiding a terrorist group. He is President Tayyip Erdogan’s main political rival who leads him in some opinion polls.
The mayor’s Republican People’s Party (CHP), the main opposition, condemned the move as politically motivated and urged supporters to demonstrate lawfully.

Title: Motor racing-Piastri takes first pole in China after sprint second
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:23:43 +0000
Content: McLaren’s Oscar Piastri seized the first proper pole position of his Formula One career at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday with the fastest lap yet around the Shanghai International Circuit.
The Australian, a two-time race winner who previously only had sprint poles,lapped in one minute 30.641 seconds and was joined on the front row for Sunday’s start by George Russell after the Mercedes driver put in a storming final effort of 1:30.723.
McLaren’s Lando Norris, the championshipleader and winner of the season-opener in Australia, abandoned his final lap — while Piastri improved his time — and will start third with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen fourth.
Ferrari filled the third row with Lewis Hamilton securing fifth, but 0.286 seconds off the pole pace after winning the earlier sprint race, and teammate Charles Leclerc sixth.
“The laps were a little bit scruffy but I’m just pumped to be on pole,” said Piastri, who started on the front row in Australia but finished only ninth after spinning off.
The first Australian to take pole since Daniel Ricciardo in Mexico in 2018, and 107th pole sitter in F1 history, Piastri had finished second in the sprint and can now look forward to a much bigger points haul on Sunday.
“It’s awesome to have Oscar get his first pole. He’s been close, a lot of front rows, and that was a mega lap,” said McLaren Chief Executive Zak Brown.
Norris congratulated Piastri on his success and was much happier with his own car after labouring to eighth in the sprint.
“We changed quite a lot on the car (after the sprint) because we were nowhere,” he said, blaming himself for some mistakes.
‘CAME ALIVE’
Mercedes’ Russell said he had struggled to get the tyres working properly but that everything changed on the final lap.
“I did something totally different on that last lap and it all came alive, the lap was awesome,” he added.
“I had a big moment at turn one but it just all came together. I was really surprised when I crossed the line, I knew it was a good lap but to be between the McLarens — just buzzing.”
French rookie Isack Hadjar qualified seventh for Racing Bulls, a strong response to his nightmare debut in Melbourne, with Mercedes’ Andrea Kimi Antonelli eighth and Yuki Tsunoda ninth for Racing Bulls.
Alex Albon completed the top 10 in a Williams.
Verstappen’s teammate Liam Lawson, already struggling just two races into the job, had another woeful qualifying and will start last.
“I’ve got to get a handle on it,” said the New Zealander.
“It was a messy session and had we not dealt with traffic and stuff like that it might have been OK, but to be honest it’s still not good enough.
“I just need to get on top of it. I think it’s just time. Unfortunately I don’t really have time.”
Red Bull boss Christian Horner, asked if there was an emerging problem with a driver brought in to replace under-performing Mexican Sergio Perez and score solid points, agreed it had been a tough day for Lawson.
“We’ll have a good look at it and go through it and try to give him the best car for tomorrow,” he said.
Australian Jack Doohan, who collected two penalty points for a collision in the sprint, also went out at the first hurdle and will start 18th with Alpine teammate Pierre Gasly 16th.

Title: India-NZ partnership ‘grown much stronger’ during my visit: Luxon
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:12:35 +0000
Content: Calling India an “increasingly important partner”, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Saturday that the partnership between the two countries has “grown much stronger” during his five-day visit to New Delhi and Mumbai, earlier this week.
“India, the world’s most populous country, is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand. That partnership has grown much stronger during my visit this week,” Luxon said after returning home from an official visit to India from March 16-20.
“It was a pleasure to visit India this week and spend time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss ways to strengthen ties between our countries. I am delighted that negotiations on a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement have now been launched,” he added.
This was Luxon’s first visit to India in his current capacity – also the first by a New Zealand Prime Minister since October 2016. During their discussions, both Prime Ministers welcomed the launch of FTA negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive, and mutually beneficial trade agreement to achieve deeper economic integration.
“India is one of the fastest-growing economies and on track to become the third largest in the world over the next 10 years. Our Government is relentlessly focused on growing our economy so that all Kiwis can do better, and the launch of negotiations presents an opportunity to do exactly that,” Luxon posted on X on Saturday.
Bolstering bilateral defence cooperation, the two countries have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Defence Cooperation and noted the need for ensuring the safety and security of sea lanes of communication while agreeing that there needs to be regular dialogue to discuss enhancement of maritime safety.
“New Zealand’s commitment to regional security has also been reinforced, with New Zealand and India announcing a new Defence Cooperation Arrangement,” the New Zealand PM said on Saturday.
During his five-day visit to New Delhi and Mumbai, Luxon was also accompanied by Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston; Ethnic Communities, and Sport and Recreation Minister Mark Mitchell; Todd McClay, the Minister for Trade and Investment, Agriculture, and Forestry; and, a high-level delegation comprising of officials, and representatives of businesses, community diaspora, media and cultural groups.
“On top of that, I and our business delegation focused on enhancing New Zealand’s presence in key sectors, including education, technology, tourism, investment, manufacturing, food and primary industries. Unlocking new business opportunities, 33 MOUs and other commercial outcomes were progressed on the mission, reflecting the growing partnerships between New Zealand and Indian businesses,” Luxon said after returning home.

Title: Israel strikes Lebanon in response to cross-border launch
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:07:12 +0000
Content: Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes hit southern Lebanon on Saturday after Israel said it had intercepted rockets fired from across the border, threatening a shaky truce that ended a year-long war between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.
That conflict marked the deadliest spillover of the Gaza war, rumbling across the border for months before escalating into a blistering Israeli offensive that wiped out Hezbollah’s top commanders, many of its fighters and much of its arsenal.
The Israeli military said earlier it intercepted three rockets launched from a Lebanese district approximately 6 km (4 miles) north of the border, the first cross-border launch since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November ended the fighting.
Israel’s Army Radio said the military was returning artillery fire. Lebanon’s state news agency said Israeli artillery hit two towns in southern Lebanon and airstrikes hit three other towns closer to the border.
Israel did not say who was responsible for the cross-border launches. Hezbollah did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah was to have no weapons in southern Lebanon, Israeli troops were to withdraw from the region, and Lebanese troops were to deploy to the area.
The agreement specifies that Lebanon’s government is responsible for dismantling all military infrastructure in southern Lebanon and confiscating all unauthorized arms.
Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Saturday that the Lebanese government bears responsibility for the rockets fired onto the border town of Metula.
“We will not allow rocket fire from Lebanon on the Galilee communities. We promised security to the communities of the Galilee – and that is exactly how it will be. The rule for Metula is the rule for Beirut,” Katz said in a statement.
The ceasefire brought an end to Israel’s intense bombardment and ground operations in Lebanon and Hezbollah’s daily rocket barrages into Israel. Each side, however, has accused the other of failing to implement the deal in full.
Israel says Hezbollah still has military infrastructure in the south, while Lebanon and Hezbollah say Israel is occupying Lebanese land by continuing to carry out some airstrikes and keeping its troops at five hilltop positions near the border.

Title: Existing ByteDance investors emerge as front-runners in TikTok deal talks
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 08:05:54 +0000
Content: White House-led talks on the future of TikTok are coalescing around a plan for the biggest non-Chinese investors in parent company ByteDance to up their stakes and acquire the short video app’s U.S. operations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
The plan entails spinning off a U.S. entity for TikTok and diluting Chinese ownership in the new business to below the 20 percent threshold required by U.S. law, rescuing the app from a looming U.S. ban, said the sources, who asked to be kept anonymous because they were not authorized to speak on record.
Jeff Yass’ Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford’s General Atlantic, both of which are represented on ByteDance’s board, are leading discussions with the White House on the plan, the sources said.
Private equity firm KKR is also participating, one of the sources said.
The fate of the short video app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law took effect on Jan. 19 requiring ByteDance to either sell it or face a ban on national security grounds.
The law, passed last year with broad bipartisan support, reflects concern in Washington that TikTok’s ownership makes it beholden to the Chinese government and that Beijing could use the app to conduct influence operations against the United States. Free speech advocates have argued that the ban unlawfully threatens to restrict Americans from accessing foreign media in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.
Under the plan proposed by existing investors, software giant Oracle would continue to house U.S. user data and provide assurances that the data is not accessible from China, this source added.
Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance, Susquehanna, Oracle and the White House could not immediately be reached for comment.
General Atlantic and KKR declined to comment.
The Financial Times reported earlier on Friday that U.S. ByteDance investors were seeking to buy out Chinese investors in a proposed deal for a spun-off TikTok U.S. business, naming investment firm Coatue as another existing investor involved in the talks.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 shortly after taking office and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
According to legal filings from TikTok last year, global investors own about 58% of ByteDance, while the company’s Singapore-based Chinese founder Zhang Yiming owns another 21% and employees of different nationalities – including about 7,000 Americans – own the remaining 21%.
The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank.
Trump initially supported the establishment of the ban during his first term but in recent months has pledged to “save TikTok” and keep the app alive in the U.S., crediting it with helping him win the 2024 presidential election.
The app went dark briefly, then came back online shortly after Trump’s inauguration, after he signed the executive order delaying enforcement of the ban by 75 days.
Trump said earlier this month that his administration was in touch with four different groups about a prospective TikTok deal, without identifying them.
Others vying to acquire the app include an investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast.
Media reported in January that Trump’s administration was working on a plan for TikTok that would involve tapping Oracle and some existing ByteDance investors to take control of the app’s operations.
Under the prospective deal, ByteDance would retain a stake in the company but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok’s infrastructure under an arrangement negotiated during Trump’s first term.

Title: One million malnourished children in Nigeria and Ethiopia risk losing aid, UNICEF says
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:25:17 +0000
Content: The United Nations children’s agency said on Friday it will run out of its supply of lifesaving food to treat children suffering from acute forms of malnutrition in Ethiopia and Nigeria within the next two months due to lack of funding exacerbated by Trump administration cuts to foreign aid.
Some 1.3 million children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition risk losing access to lifesaving support this year in Ethiopia and Nigeria, UNICEF says.
“Without new funding, we will run out of our supply chain of Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food by May, and that means that 70,000 children in Ethiopia that depend on this type of treatment cannot be served,” Kitty Van der Heijden, UNICEF’s deputy executive director, told reporters in Geneva via video link from Abuja on Friday. “Interruption to continuous treatment is life-threatening.”
In Nigeria, UNICEF said it may run out of supplies to feed 80,000 malnourished children as soon as the end of this month. Van der Heijden described recently being in a hospital in Maiduguri with a child who was so malnourished that her skin was falling off.
International donors have in recent years reduced contributions to UN agencies, including UNICEF. Its funding woes were accelerated when the United States, its top donor, imposed a 90-day pause on all U.S. foreign aid on the first day of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.
That action, and ensuing orders halting many programmes of the U.S. Agency for International Development worldwide, have jeopardised the delivery of lifesaving food and medical aid, throwing into chaos global humanitarian relief efforts.
“This funding crisis will become a child survival crisis,” warned Van der Heijden, adding that the sudden nature of the cuts did not give the agency the ability to mitigate the risks.
Funding cuts have also hit health programmes offering nutrition and malaria care for pregnant women and children in Ethiopia. Twenty-three mobile health clinics were taken out of operation in the region of Afar, with only seven left operating due to funding cuts, according to UNICEF.

Title: On World Water Day, PM Modi reaffirms commitment to conserve nature’s vital element
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:35:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated the Centre’s dedication to water conservation and sustainable development on the occasion of World Water Day on Saturday.
He emphasised the need to preserve this vital resource for future generations and highlighted India’s ongoing efforts to ensure water security.
Observed annually on March 22 since 1993, World Water Day underscores the significance of freshwater and supports Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims for water and sanitation access for all by 2030. The theme for World Water Day 2025 is ‘Glacier Preservation.’
Taking to X, PM Modi wrote, “On World Water Day, we reaffirm our commitment to conserve water and promote sustainable development. Water has been the lifeline of civilisations, and thus, it is more important to protect it for future generations!”
In a video post, he further stressed the cultural and historical significance of water conservation in India.
“Water is the foundation of life and the world’s greatest resource. That is why our ancestors focussed so much on water conservation. From the Vedas to the Puranas, it has always been said that it is humanity’s utmost duty to build lakes, dams, and reservoirs to save water,” he said.
PM Modi warned that a lack of water threatens not just individual well-being but also national development. He underscored the role of the Jal Jeevan Mission in ensuring water availability, management, and maintenance, particularly in rural areas.
“Work is also being done to conserve water sources in villages. It may be possible that water is available in sufficient quantity where you are now, but we must always remember the millions who live in water-scarce areas,” he urged.
Highlighting the cultural aspect of water conservation, he called for revitalising traditions that celebrate rivers.
“Taking inspiration from the Maha Kumbh, we must give new meaning to river festivals. This will help the present generation understand the importance of water, encourage river cleanliness, and ensure their protection,” he added.

Title: Trump revokes legal status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:40:46 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration will revoke the temporary legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans in the United States, according to a Federal Register notice on Friday, the latest expansion of his crackdown on immigration.
The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year “parole” granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden that allowed them to enter the country by air if they had U.S. sponsors.
Trump, a Republican, took steps to ramp up immigration enforcement after taking office, including a push to deport record numbers of migrants in the U.S. illegally. He has argued that the legal entry parole programs launched under his Democratic predecessor overstepped the boundaries of federal law and called for their termination in a January 20 executive order.
Trump said on March 6 that he would decide “very soon” whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the U.S. during the conflict with Russia. Trump’s remarks came in response to a Reuters report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.
Biden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the United States have been strained.
The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Trump administration’s decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the U.S. It remains unclear how many who entered the U.S. on parole now have another form of protection or legal status.
In a notice set to formally publish in the Federal Register on Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place the migrants in a fast-track deportation process known as “expedited removal.”
Under a Trump-era policy implemented in January, expedited removal can be applied to certain migrants in the U.S. for two years or less.

Title: EU delays 2040 climate target proposal beyond Q1
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:34:33 +0000
Content: The European Commission has delayed its plan to propose a new EU climate target in the first quarter of this year, pushing back the launch of an expected commitment to cut emissions by 2040, it said on Friday.
Brussels had said last month it would amend the EU’s climate law this quarter – a long-planned move that would set a 2040 target to keep countries on track between their 2030 emissions goal, and the bloc’s aim for zero net emissions by 2050.
However, the proposal has run into political opposition, with some member states and lawmakers reluctant to back the 90% emissions cut, which the Commission has previously indicated should be set as the 2040 target.
The EU’s climate targets set out in law how much countries must reduce their net emissions, compared with 1990 levels.
“We can confidently assume that it will not be adopted in Q1,” a Commission spokesperson told a regular press briefing on Friday, declining to confirm when the target will be proposed.
The EU – like most countries in the world – has also missed a February deadline to submit a 2035 climate plan to the U.N., which the Commission has said should be derived from the EU’s 2040 goal.
The EU has vowed not to backtrack on its climate change commitments, despite President Donald Trump scrapping the green goals of the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, and pulling it out of the Paris climate agreement.
Europe is the planet’s fastest-warming continent, and has suffered disastrous heatwaves, floods and droughts in recent years that scientists have said were directly linked to human-caused global warming.
But Europe’s green agenda is facing increasing pressure from industries and some governments, who say environmental rules are hurting businesses already struggling with high energy prices and weak demand. The EU agreed this month to loosen CO2-cutting rules for carmakers, after pleas from industry.
Some EU officials also note a reluctance to launch political negotiations on the 2040 climate goal ahead of Polish presidential elections in May. Poland currently holds the rotating EU presidency and chairs negotiations among EU countries until July.
Warsaw had initially resisted the EU’s 2050 climate target, citing concerns about the cost of the energy transition for the coal-reliant nation.
“I don’t see a majority backing 90%,” one EU diplomat said, referring to EU countries’ positions on the 2040 goal.
