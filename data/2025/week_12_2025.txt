Title: MIT researchers devise process to convert skin cells directly into neurons
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:30:37 +0000
Content: Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process to convert skin cells directly into neurons, bypassing the need to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This breakthrough could lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  
Traditionally, converting a skin cell into a neuron involves first inducing it into a pluripotent stem cell state and then differentiating it into a neuron. The MIT researchers have now simplified this process by directly reprogramming skin cells into neurons.  
Working with mouse cells, the team developed a highly efficient conversion method that can generate more than 10 neurons from a single skin cell. If replicated in human cells, this approach could produce large quantities of motor neurons, potentially benefiting patients with spinal cord injuries or mobility-impairing diseases.  
“We were able to achieve yields that allow us to assess whether these cells could be viable candidates for cell replacement therapies. That’s where reprogramming technologies like this can take us,” said Katie Galloway, the WM Keck Career Development Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at MIT.  
As an initial step toward therapeutic applications, the researchers demonstrated that the generated motor neurons could be successfully engrafted into mouse brains, where they integrated with host tissue.  
Galloway is the senior author of two papers detailing this method, published today in Cell Systems. MIT graduate student Nathan Wang is the lead author of both papers.  
The MIT team aims to further improve the efficiency of human cell conversion, which could enable large-scale neuron production for treating conditions like ALS. While clinical trials using iPSC-derived neurons to treat ALS are already underway, expanding the available number of neurons could accelerate research and therapeutic applications.  
This research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Title: Study shows how climate change affects rain and floods
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:14:40 +0000
Content: Climate change may lead to increased precipitation and more intense floods. A new study highlights the importance of distinguishing between different types of rainfall and flood events—specifically, short-term events that occur over a few hours and longer-term events that last several days. Climate change impacts each of these differently.
An Austrian research team has demonstrated for the first time that short-term precipitation and flood events, occurring over a few hours, are particularly affected by rising temperatures due to climate change.
For longer-term events, the relationship is more complex. This conclusion was drawn from detailed data collected in Austria for over a century—insights that can also be applied to other regions worldwide. The findings help determine which areas are more likely to experience flooding and how they may be affected. The results have been published in the journal Nature.
Climate change is disrupting water cycles globally, and Austria provides a particularly valuable case study. “We are fortunate to have excellent data available,” says Prof. Gunter Bloschl of TU Wien (Vienna), who led the research project. Since 1900, precipitation in Austria has been recorded by two separate institutions: the meteorological service (now Geosphere Austria) and the Austrian Hydrography, which is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
These highly reliable datasets have been analyzed through a collaboration between TU Wien, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BML), GeoSphere Austria, and the University of Graz.
The analysis revealed that short-term precipitation events lasting only a few hours have increased significantly over the past 30–40 years—by approximately 15%. “Climate models had already predicted this, though with some uncertainties. We have now confirmed it,” says Gunter Bloschl.
However, for longer-term rainfall events lasting several days, the situation differs. Global weather phenomena, such as El Niño—an ocean temperature-influenced climate process—play a more significant role in these cases. As a result, rainfall trends over longer timescales vary across regions.
For example, in the Mediterranean—particularly in parts of Italy, Spain, and Greece—prolonged periods of rainfall may become less frequent due to climate change.

Title: PM Modi congratulates RBI on winning Digital Transformation Award 2025
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:07:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday extended his congratulations to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for winning the prestigious Digital Transformation Award 2025 by Central Banking, London.
PM Modi shared his appreciation on social media platform X, quoting RBI’s announcement and calling the achievement a significant milestone. He highlighted the role of digital innovation in strengthening India’s digital ecosystem and empowering millions of people across the country.
“A commendable accomplishment, reflecting a commitment to innovation and efficiency in governance,” PM Modi stated in his post. He further added, “Digital innovation continues to strengthen India’s financial ecosystem, thereby empowering countless lives.”
The RBI was honored for its groundbreaking digital initiatives, Saarathi and Pravaah, both of which were developed by the bank’s in-house tech team. These initiatives have transformed RBI’s internal and external processes, significantly reducing the need for paper-based submissions.
Saarathi, launched in January 2023, has fully digitized RBI’s internal workflow, allowing employees to securely submit and share documents. The system has improved record management, data analysis, task tracking, collaboration, and integration with other RBI systems. Prior to Saarathi, different departments relied on a mix of manual and digital processes, but the platform now serves as a unified digital repository for all the central bank’s information.
Pravaah, introduced in May 2024, is a digital platform for external users to submit regulatory applications to RBI. The documents submitted through Pravaah are automatically linked to the Saarathi database, where they are processed digitally using centralized cybersecurity systems and digital tracking.
Since its launch, Pravaah has digitized over 70 regulatory applications, benefiting nine departments within the RBI.

Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 07:56:01 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance policy against drug cartels following a major crackdown on an international narcotics network in the northeast. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) successfully busted the racket in coordinated operations in Guwahati and Imphal, seizing narcotics worth ₹88 crore and arresting four individuals.
In a post on X, Shah said, “No mercy for drug cartels. Accelerating the Modi government’s march to build a drug-free Bharat, a massive consignment of methamphetamine tablets worth ₹88 crore is seized, and four members of the international drug cartel are arrested in Imphal and Guwahati zones.”
He lauded the efforts of the NCB, calling the operation a result of an effective “bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom approach” to investigation. “The drug haul is a testament to the stellar performance of this integrated strategy. Our hunt for drugs continues. Heartfelt congratulations to team NCB,” Shah added.
Inauguration of Lachit Barphukan Police Academy
In a separate event on Saturday, Amit Shah inaugurated the Lachit Barphukan Police Academy at Degaon in Assam, marking a key development in strengthening the region’s law enforcement infrastructure.
Named after the legendary Ahom general Lachit Barphukan, renowned for his leadership during the 1671 Battle of Saraighat against Mughal forces, the academy is designed to provide comprehensive, modern training to police personnel while honouring Assam’s rich history.
Speaking at the inauguration, Shah praised Lachit Barphukan’s legacy, emphasizing the general’s bravery, patriotism, and leadership. “Lachit Barphukan’s bravery is a source of inspiration for all Indians. By dedicating this police academy to his name, we are ensuring that future generations of police personnel imbibe his values of courage, integrity, and selfless service,” he said.

Title: Gadkari stresses need for education in Muslim community, slams caste politics
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday emphasised the crucial role of education in the upliftment of the Muslim community and strongly criticised the prevalence of caste-based politics in the country.
Speaking at the convocation ceremony of the Central India Group of Institutions in Nagpur, Gadkari said that education is the cornerstone of development and social progress. He stressed that the Muslim community, in particular, needs to focus more on educational advancement.
“In our society, the community that needs education the most is the Muslim community,” Gadkari said.
Highlighting occupational patterns, he pointed out that only a limited number of professions are currently dominant within the Muslim community. “Unfortunately, professions like running tea stalls, paan shops, scrap dealing, truck driving, and cleaning have gained prominence,” he added.
He urged members of the community to aspire for careers in engineering, medicine, and civil services. “If people from our society become engineers, doctors, IAS and IPS officers, then our society will progress. We may offer prayers in the mosque a hundred times, but without embracing science and technology, what will our future look like?” Gadkari questioned.
Drawing inspiration from former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Gadkari said, “I believe a person’s greatness is not determined by caste, sect, religion, language, or gender, but by their qualities. That is why we must not discriminate based on these identities.”
He praised Dr. Kalam’s achievements, highlighting how his contributions as a nuclear scientist brought global recognition to India.
Taking a firm stand against caste-based politics, Gadkari said he had no interest in appeasing caste leaders for electoral gains. “I am in politics, and caste leaders often come to meet me. But I am clear — I will live on my own terms, whether or not I get votes,” he asserted.
Recalling an earlier public gathering, he added, “I once told a crowd of 50,000 people, ‘Jo karega jaat ki baat, uske kass ke maarunga laat’ (I will kick hard anyone who talks about caste).”
The Union Minister reiterated that education is not merely a tool for individual benefit but a driving force behind societal and national progress. “Education does not just benefit you and your family. It uplifts society and the nation. Knowledge is power, and imbibing this power must be your mission,” he concluded.

Title: FIIs selling declines in Indian market, expected to stabilise next quarter: experts
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 05:11:58 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling in India continues in early March, but the intensity of the sell-off is gradually declining as stock market valuations become more reasonable, according to experts.
As of March 14, FIIs have sold equity worth ₹30,015 crore this month, taking the total equity sold in CY 2025 so far to ₹1,42,616 crore.
In contrast, FIIs have turned buyers in the debt segment in March. The total buying figure for debt (general category plus VRR) stood at ₹7,029 crore so far this month, say market watchers.
However, experts noted that heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing trade war between the US and other nations is likely to push more investments towards safe asset classes such as gold and the US dollar.
Shridatta Bhandwaldar, Head of Equities at Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, highlighted that FIIs have been significant sellers in the Indian equity market over the past three months, with outflows amounting to $15–20 billion.
“However, as the initial shocks subside, we expect FII flows to at least stabilise in the next quarter and eventually turn positive over time,” he said.
“For this to materialise, though, our corporate earnings will need to show substantial improvement from current levels. We believe the slowdown in earnings growth is more cyclical than structural, noting that a similar trend was observed in FY23,” he added.
Valuations for the Nifty index are already below its 10-year average for one-year forward earnings.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets remained largely range-bound last week, ending slightly lower amid mixed global cues and investor caution.
The benchmark indices experienced mild corrections as concerns over global trade policies and sector-specific sell-offs weighed on market sentiment.
Analysts expect volatility to persist in the upcoming sessions as investors monitor global developments, particularly economic data releases from the US Federal Reserve and domestic macroeconomic indicators.
Market experts pointed out that the 22,250–22,650 range remains a crucial technical zone for the Nifty 50. A breakout in either direction could determine the market’s trajectory in the near term.

Title: Astronaut crew docks with space station to replace ‘Butch and Suni’
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:50:12 +0000
Content: A SpaceX capsule delivered four astronauts to the International Space Station early on Sunday in a NASA crew-swap mission that will allow a pair of stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to return home after nine months on the orbiting lab.
About 29 hours since launching at 7:03 p.m. ET on Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Crew-10 astronauts’ SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked to the ISS at 12:04 a.m. ET (0404 GMT) on Sunday.
They were welcomed by the station’s seven-member crew, which includes Wilmore and Williams – veteran NASA astronauts and retired Navy test pilots who have remained on the station after problems with Boeing’s BA.N Starliner capsule forced NASA to bring it back empty.
Otherwise a routine crew rotation flight, the Crew-10 mission is a long-awaited first step to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth – part of a plan set by NASA last year that has been given greater urgency by President Donald Trump since he took office in January.
Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to depart the ISS on Wednesday as early as 4 a.m. ET (0800 GMT), along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
Hague and Gorbunov flew to the ISS in September on a Crew Dragon craft with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams, and that craft has been attached to the station since.
The Crew-10 crew, scheduled to stay on the station for roughly six months, includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.
The crew-swap mission became entangled in politics as Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, urged a quicker Crew-10 launch. They claimed, without evidence, that Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden had abandoned Wilmore and Williams on the station for political reasons.
Having seen their mission turn into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the other five astronauts.
Williams told reporters this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. “It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” she said.

Title: Who are Yemen’s Houthis and why are they under attack by the US?
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:43:18 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump has launched the biggest military operation in the Middle East since taking office against Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis after they resumed Red Sea shipping attacks.
The strikes, which have killed at least 24 people so far, could last for weeks according to one U.S. official and come as Trump ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HOUTHIS?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in the far north of Yemen set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shi’ite Islam, which had once ruled Yemen, but whose northern heartland had became impoverished and marginalized.
As friction with the government in the capital Sanaa grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia.
WHO IS THE HOUTHI LEADER?
Abdul Malik al-Houthi created the defiant force challenging world powers from a group of ragtag mountain fighters in sandals. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement.
Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.
Al-Houthi is known for rarely staying long in one place, for never meeting the media and for extreme reluctance to make scheduled public appearances.
HOW DID THE HOUTHIS COME TO CONTROL MUCH OF YEMEN?
A civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. Worried by the growing influence of Shi’ite Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia led a Western-backed coalition in March 2015, which intervened in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other large population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in the port city of Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a U.N.-led peace push, but a sharp escalation in regional tensions since the start of the Gaza war has increased risks of a new conflict between the militia and Riyadh.
WHY ATTACK SHIPS?
The Houthis have waded into the Gaza conflict with attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea as a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
They have also claimed attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the United States and Britain, shipping industry sources say all ships were at risk.
The U.S. and Britain had retaliated with air strikes against the Houthis as part of international efforts to restore the free flow of trade along a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15% of the world’s shipping traffic.
A period of relative calm started in January alongside the Gaza ceasefire but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval operations if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza.
The Houthis then announced on March 12 a resumption of attacks with immediate effect.
WHAT ARE THE HOUTHIS’ LINKS WITH IRAN?
The Houthis are part of what has been called the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance of regional militias including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, backed by Iran.
The Houthis’ slogan is “Death to America, Death to Israel, curse the Jews and victory to Islam”.
The Saudi-led coalition accuses Tehran of arming and training the Houthis, a charge both deny. The coalition also says Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah is helping the Houthis, an accusation it rejects.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Houthis deny being puppets of Iran, and Yemen experts say they are motivated primarily by a domestic agenda.

Title: Russia, Ukraine continue air attacks with ceasefire prospects uncertain
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:16:33 +0000
Content: Russia and Ukraine continued aerial attacks on each other, inflicting injuries and damages, officials said early on Sunday, as the fate of a proposed ceasefire to the three-year-old war remained uncertain.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Both sides have since traded heavy aerial strikes, and Russia moved closer on battlefield to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
Early on Sunday, three people were injured, including a 7-year-old, in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.
Two of them were injured after a drone hit their house, sparking a fire in the Gubkinsky district of the region, while the other person was injured in a drone attack on the village of Dolgoye, Gladkov said.
Alexander Gusev, governor of the southwestern Russia region of Voronezh, said on Telegram that air defence units had destroyed more than 15 Ukrainian drones over the region. There was no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Gusev said.
The acting governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov said defence units repelled an overnight drone attack on the region, with no injuries or damage reported.
In Ukraine, authorities reported several Russian drone strikes, including on the northern region of Chernihiv, where firefighters were battling a blaze at a high-rise building that was sparked by Russian drone attack, Ukraine’s state of emergency service said.
Ukrainian media reported a series of explosions in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv, after Ukraine’s air force issued warnings of a threat of drone attacks on the Kyiv and a number of other central Ukrainian regions.
By 0300 GMT on Sunday, there was no official information about potential damage in the Kyiv region.

Content: ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan on Sunday said that the central government has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country’s long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. Speaking at a felicitation event marking his appointment as the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, Narayanan outlined the future projects and vision for ISRO, emphasizing the space agency’s crucial role in advancing India’s space exploration efforts.
Narayanan revealed that several key missions are in the pipeline. He shared that Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan. Narayanan highlighted the growing scope of India’s lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.
ISRO’s recent success with Chandrayaan-3, which safely and successfully landed on the Moon’s south pole, added another remarkable achievement to India’s space exploration history. Union Minister Jitendra Singh had previously confirmed that the government has also approved the Chandrayaan-4 mission, which aims to showcase technology for safe landings, sample collection, and return to Earth.
Looking ahead, Narayanan underscored the goal of establishing the Bharatiya Antriksh Station by 2035. This ambitious project will mark India’s entry into the realm of space stations. Additionally, Narayanan emphasized the government’s vision of sending Indian astronauts to the Moon aboard an Indian-made rocket, reinforcing the commitment to advancing India’s space capabilities.
Reflecting on his journey, Narayanan expressed deep gratitude for his role in ISRO’s achievements. He acknowledged the hard work of his predecessor, Dr. K. Sivan, and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unwavering support and vision for a developed India. Narayanan also candidly shared the emotional challenges faced by ISRO, particularly the setbacks experienced with Chandrayaan-2, which, despite its failed soft landing, succeeded in gathering valuable data and images from lunar orbit.
Over the past decade, ISRO has made significant strides in satellite launches, sending a total of 433 satellites into space, with a remarkable 90% success rate. This includes the successful launch of 393 foreign satellites across 34 countries, highlighting India’s position as a global leader in space technology and satellite services.
Narayanan also discussed the progress of India’s second spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam, a coastal village in Tamil Nadu. The foundation for this new spaceport was laid in February 2024, with construction beginning in March 2025. The Kulasekarapattinam spaceport will primarily support the launch of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a vehicle that aims to capture the growing market for launching small satellites weighing up to 500kg. This development will further enhance India’s capabilities in space launch services.
Reflecting on past achievements, Narayanan celebrated the success of ISRO’s Chandrayaan missions. Chandrayaan-1 was pivotal in discovering water on the Moon, while Chandrayaan-2, despite the landing failure, provided invaluable images and data from lunar orbit. Chandrayaan-3 made history as the first mission to achieve a soft landing at the Moon’s south pole. Narayanan also pointed out ISRO’s milestone as the fourth country in the world to launch a satellite dedicated to studying the Sun.

Title: Impact of US tariffs on India minimal as country diversifies exports: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:25:00 +0000
Content: The impact of US trade reciprocal tariffs on India will be minimal as the country has diversified its exports, pitched value addition, exploring alternate areas and works on new routes that transcend from Europe to the US via the Middle East, redrawing new supply chain algorithms, a new SBI Research report said on Monday.
The decline in the exports is expected to be in the range of 3-3.5 per cent, which again should be negated through higher export goals across both manufacturing and services fronts, the report mentioned.
India will also be able to take advantage of the aluminium and steel tariffs imposed by the US last week. India has a trade deficit for aluminium ($13 million) and steel ($406 million) trade with the US where it can potentially take advantage.
The US reciprocal tariffs are expected to come into effect on April 2, and intense bilateral talks between New Delhi and Washington are currently on.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said last week that he “had a forward-looking discussion with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement” between India and the US.
“Our approach will be guided by ‘India First’, ‘Viksit Bharat’ and our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” Goyal said in a post on X..
Goyal had previously met Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during his visit to the US. This followed US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi’s talks on negotiating the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.
According to SBI Research, India has also been talking about free trade agreements (FTAs) with several partners – both bilateral and regional – in a bid to boost export-oriented domestic manufacturing.
India has signed 13 FTAs in the last five years with its trading partners like Mauritius, the UAE, Australia, etc.
The country is also negotiating FTAs with the UK, Canada, and the EU, targeting sectors like services, digital trade, and sustainable development.
India and New Zealand have also announced the launch of negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial FTA.
The FTA with the UK alone is expected to increase bilateral trade by $15 billion by 2030. Future FTAs will likely focus on enhancing digital trade, with projections indicating that the digital economy could add $1 trillion to India’s GDP by 2025, according to the report.
“The shift towards regional supply chains and the impact of geopolitical changes, such as the US tariff war, are influencing India’s FTA strategies to ensure alignment with global trade dynamics,” the report added.
These FTAs cover a wide array of topics, such as tariff reduction impacting the entire manufacturing and agricultural sectors; rules on services trade; digital issues such as data localisation; intellectual property rights that may have an impact on the accessibility of pharmaceutical drugs; and investment promotion, facilitation, and protection.

Title: Russian teen Andreeva beats top seed Sabalenka to claim Indian Wells title
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:57:27 +0000
Content: Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva fought back to overcome world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6 6-4 6-3 in the Indian Wells final on Sunday, winning a second WTA 1000-level event in a row to keep her charmed year on track.
The 17-year-old Andreeva, the youngest women’s champion at the tournament since Serena Williams in 1999, found her form midway through the match and crumpled to the ground in celebration after closing it out with a forehand winner.
Top seed Sabalenka pulled herself out of a slump to bring some of her best tennis to the California desert this year and got off to a hot start on Sunday but her form unravelled as the match wore on and she was left to rue missed opportunities.
“I would like to thank myself for fighting until the end and for always believing in me and for never quitting,” Andreeva said at the trophy ceremony.
“I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna, she’s been sending bullets and it was really hard to just keep up.”
Andreeva had lost to Sabalenka twice this year and it looked as though the pattern would continue as the top-seeded Belarusian mixed some nifty drop shots with her usual forehand power to save four break points in the third game.
Sabalenka sent a backhand winner down the line to break in the fourth game and four games later a visibly frustrated Andreeva whacked a ball into the stands after sending a shot into the net as the Russian was broken again.
The teenager got a confidence boost in the second set, however, when she broke Sabalenka with a forehand winner in the third game and fended off two break points in the sixth.
After trading breaks to open the third set, Sabalenka’s errors began to pile up and she fired into the net on break point in the third game to give the ninth seed the advantage.
‘MORE AGGRESSIVE’
“After the first set, I just realised, that, ‘oh, well, what I do now, it doesn’t work, so I have to change something’,” Andreeva told reporters.
“In the second set, I tried to play a little bit more aggressive. I didn’t try to over hit her, because I don’t think anyone can over hit Aryna, because she’s super-powerful player.
“I tried to really, I don’t know, create something to make her uncomfortable, and, you know, point-by-point, game-by-game, I managed to do that.”
Gracious in defeat, 2023 runner-up Sabalenka brought her trademark sense of humour to the trophy ceremony, while holding onto the petite consolation prize.
“I kind of have a love-hate relationship with this place. I’ll just put this trophy on top of another one and pretend it’s the trophy for the winning,” said Sabalenka.
“It’s going to be a quite similar size, you know?”
The win on Sunday sees Andreeva continue her meteoric rise, after she partnered with coach Conchita Martinez a year ago, as she recorded her fifth straight win over a top-10 player.
Former world number two Martinez guided Andreeva into the French Open semi-finals last year and helped steer her into the world’s top 10 with her triumph in Dubai last month.
Andreeva, who downed twice champion Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals, heaped praise on her team in her victory speech and later told reporters they were “super protective” of her.
“(Martinez) gives me advice, you know, how to play and also how to maybe not to spend too much time on-site or how not to waste your energy,” she said. “Because I have such a good team around me, they help to protect me.”

Title: Trump says will speak with Putin on Tuesday to discuss ending Ukraine war
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:47:34 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and discuss ending the war in Ukraine, after positive talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow.
“I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work’s been done over the weekend,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a late flight back to the Washington area from Florida.
“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance,” Trump said.
Trump is trying to win Putin’s support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, as both sides continued trading heavy aerial strikes through the weekend and Russia moved closer to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.
When asked about what concessions are being considered in ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: “We’ll be talking about land. We’ll be talking about power plants”.
“I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We’re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.”
Trump said a lot of work had been done on the issue over the weekend, which the president spent in Florida, where he has a residence. He landed back at Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, in the early hours of Monday morning and returned to the White House.
Trump, who has upended U.S. policy by shifting closer to Moscow, has described Ukraine as being more difficult to work with than Russia. He held an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last month that ended with the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House early.
But Ukraine’s acceptance of a proposed ceasefire has put the onus on Russia to cede to Trump’s demands and will test the U.S. president’s more positive view of Putin, who launched Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

Title: PM Modi urges Russia and Ukraine to negotiate, emphasizes peace in podcast with Lex Fridman
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:45:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again called for a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stressing that the conditions are now favorable for both nations to come to the negotiating table and end the three-year war.
Speaking on a podcast with American research scientist Lex Fridman, PM Modi underscored the importance of global stability and made it clear that rather than remaining neutral, he stands firmly for peace and harmony.
When asked by Fridman about his approach to peacemaking, PM Modi said that he represents the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, whose teachings, words, actions, and behavior are dedicated to peace.
“That is why culturally and historically, our background is so strong that whenever we speak of peace, the world listens to us because India is the land of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, and Indians aren’t hardwired to espouse strife and conflict. We espouse harmony instead. We seek neither to wage war against nature nor to foster strife among nations. We stand for peace, and wherever we can act as peacemakers, we have gladly embraced that responsibility,” PM Modi said.
Speaking about India’s ties with Russia and Ukraine, the prime minister said, “I have a close relationship with both Russia and Ukraine alike. I can sit with President Putin and say that this is not the time for war, and I can also tell President Zelenskyy in a friendly way that, brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. The resolution will only come when both Ukraine and Russia come to the negotiating table. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with their allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both parties instead.”
The PM highlighted that initially, it was challenging to find peace, but now a situation has emerged which “presents an opportunity for meaningful and productive talks between Ukraine and Russia.”
Underscoring how the impact of war has spilled onto the rest of the world, PM Modi said, “There has been a lot of suffering. Even the Global South has suffered. The world has been grappling with a food, fuel, and fertilizer crisis. So the global community should unite in the pursuit of peace.”
The PM reiterated his views and said, “As for me, I have always maintained that I stand with peace. I am not neutral. I have a stance, and that is peace, and peace is what I strive for.”
PM Modi’s remarks to Lex Fridman come as progress is being made toward bringing peace to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said that he had “good and productive discussions” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hinted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could “finally come to an end.” Trump said that he “strongly requested” Putin to spare the lives of thousands of Ukrainian troops, or else it would be a “horrible massacre.”
PM Modi emphasized that for people, the prudent choice is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation.
“I believe that modern wars are no longer just about resources or interests. Today I see so many kinds of conflicts happening. Physical battles often get discussed. Struggles are happening in every domain. International organizations that were once powerful have become almost irrelevant. No real reforms are happening. Institutions, like the UN, are failing to fulfill their role”, the PM said.
“People who disregard international laws and rules continue to act freely, and no one can stop them. In such situations, the prudent choice for everyone is to let go of conflict and move toward cooperation. A development-driven approach is the way forward. Expansionism will not work. As I’ve said before, the world is interdependent and interconnected. Every nation needs one another; no one can stand alone. And from all the different forums I attend, one thing is clear: Everyone is deeply worried about these conflicts. We can only hope that peace is restored very soon,” the PM added.
Lex Fridman’s podcasts have featured several personalities from various walks of life, discussing issues ranging from complex niches to other areas of mass understanding. Notable figures include political leaders like US President Donald Trump, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as leading personalities in their fields, such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.
Fridman’s YouTube page has 4.8 million subscribers, with over 82,000,000 views.

Title: Tennis: Draper lives out dreams with Indian Wells breakthrough
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:43:42 +0000
Content: Briton Jack Draper turned his childhood dreams into reality at Indian Wells on Sunday, claiming his maiden Masters 1000 title and catapulting himself into the top 10 for the first time after a rapid ascent through his sport.
The 23-year-old downed Denmark’s Holger Rune 6-2 6-2 in a display of total dominance in the final, after overcoming the twice defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final and swatting aside top U.S. hopes Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton.
“I have been watching this tournament since I was a young guy, watching all the champions play on this big court,” said Draper, who will be ranked seventh after picking up the title.
“It means the world to me, honestly, to be able to be a champion here.”
It was only 18 months ago that Draper – then ranked 123rd in the world – emerged as the unlikely hope for British men’s tennis when he defied injury and the odds to reach the fourth round of the 2023 U.S. Open.
He quickly added to his credentials from there, beating Italian Matteo Berrettini for his first ATP title in Stuttgart in June.
Weeks later, he was in the final four at Flushing, becoming the first British man since Andy Murray in 2012 to reach the U.S. Open semi-final and he picked up his first ATP 500-level title in October in Vienna.
“You dream of winning this stuff when you’re a kid. I think over the years, especially when you’re playing pro and stuff, it kind of gets lost a little bit, because maybe that, you know, when you’re young you think, ‘Oh, I’m just going to rock up and win’,” he told reporters.
“It doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to go through many ups and downs and emotions.”
Draper, whose competition schedule early this year was limited due to a nagging hip issue, credited his coach with providing a structured approach to help him weather the highs and lows.
“I want to achieve amazing things in this sport, but my main goal is keep on improving and keep on knuckling down,” he said.
“I know there is a long way ahead of me. I’m very ambitious. I don’t want to just stop here.”

Title: Amit Shah addresses 57th annual conference of ABSU in Assam’s Kokrajhar
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 05:27:03 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah, addressed the 57th annual conference of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) as the Chief Guest in Kokrajhar, Assam on Sunday.
According to an official statement from the Ministry, Shah praised the significant role played by ABSU in bringing peace, development, and unity to the Bodoland region, noting that the Bodo Accord would not have been possible without their efforts.
The event was attended by Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Shri Biswajit Daimary, the Union Home Secretary, and the Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), alongside other dignitaries.
During his address, Amit Shah paid tribute to the five thousand martyrs who fought for Bodoland’s peace, emphasizing the legacy of Upendra Nath Brahma, a key leader of the Bodo community. Shah announced that a prominent road in Delhi would be named Bodopa Upendra Nath Brahma Marg in Brahma’s honour, and a bust of Brahma would be unveiled in a special program in Delhi in April.
Shah highlighted the positive outcomes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) peace accord, signed on January 27, 2020, stating that 82 percent of the agreement’s terms have already been fulfilled. 
He assured that the remaining terms would be fully implemented in the next two years, leading to lasting peace in the BTR. He also noted that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) had been removed from the entire BTR area on April 1, 2022, as part of the peace process.
Shah emphasized that peace in Bodoland has led to significant economic progress. Under the ‘One District, One Product’ program, Kokrajhar’s famous “Mushroom from Bodoland” is now being served in hotels in Delhi.
The Home Minister also mentioned the region’s growing industrial base, with over a dozen Bodo products receiving Geographical Indication (GI) tags. He encouraged Bodo athletes to begin preparing for the potential Olympics in India in 2036, following Bodoland’s success in hosting the Durand Cup tournament.
Amit Shah stressed that hundreds of Bodo youth have been brought into the mainstream through education and development. The government has allocated Rs. 287 crore for the rehabilitation of former National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) members, with 90% of the funding provided by the Modi government. This rehabilitation effort has been pivotal in shifting the focus from separatism to progress in Bodoland.
The Home Minister reaffirmed the central government’s commitment to Bodoland’s development, stating that Rs. 1,500 crore has been allocated for the region, despite its population being only 3.5 million. He also praised ABSU’s contributions to education, which has enabled students to take their 12th-grade exams in the Bodo language, ensuring the survival of the Bodo language for generations to come.
Shah concluded his address by calling on Bodo youth to focus on education and contribute to the ongoing peace process. He expressed the government’s vision of building world-class infrastructure in Bodoland so that its youth can compete globally.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).

Title: Global displacement to rise by 6.7 million people by end of next year, aid group says
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:19:55 +0000
Content: Some 6.7 million additional people are expected to be newly displaced around the world by the end of next year, the Danish Refugee Council said on Friday, just as aid cuts from key donors like the United States take effect.
The U.N. refugee agency said last year that the number of forcibly displaced people around the globe stood at over 117 million people and warned that number could rise.
“These are not cold statistics. These are families forced to flee their homes, carrying next to nothing, and searching for water, food, and shelter,” said Charlotte Slente, secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council in a statement.
Twenty-seven countries account for nearly all of global displacements. The projection is based on an AI-driven model that predicts displacement trends by analysing over 100 indicators including factors such as security, politics and economics in those countries.
It forecasts that nearly a third of new displacements will be from Sudan, which is already the world’s worst refugee crisis after nearly two years of war. Another 1.4 million people are expected to be forcibly displaced from Myanmar, the report said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid programmes globally as part of a major spending overhaul by the world’s biggest aid donor.
The Danish Refugee Council is one of the aid groups hit and has had more than 20 contract terminations.
Cuts from Washington and other key donors are already impacting refugees.
The U.N. refugee agency said that funding shortages had shuttered programmes to protect adolescent girls from child marriage in South Sudan and a safe house for displaced women in danger of being killed in Ethiopia.
“Millions are facing starvation and displacement, and just as they need us most, wealthy nations are slashing aid. It’s a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” said Slente.

Both benchmark indices—Sensex and Nifty—ended in positive territory despite a cautious start. The Sensex opened slightly lower, slipping to 73,796, down 33 points in early trade. However, it soon gained momentum, climbing to an intraday high of 74,376, nearly 400 points above the day’s low. After trading in a range-bound manner for the rest of the session, the Sensex settled 341 points higher at 74,170.

Title: No shortcuts in life: PM Modi urges youth to see challenges as opportunities in Lex Fridman podcast
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:54:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged young people to avoid taking shortcuts in life. In a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman, PM Modi emphasized that while challenges are inevitable, they do not define who we are. He encouraged viewing every crisis and difficulty as an opportunity for personal growth.
When asked about young people who are facing challenges and feeling uncertain, PM Modi said that patience and self-confidence are crucial for achieving success.
“I want to tell all the young people, no matter how dark the night may seem, it is still just night, and morning is bound to come. That’s why we need patience and self-confidence. The challenges are real, but I am not defined by my circumstances. I am here for a purpose, sent by a higher power, and I am not alone. The one who sent me is always with me. This unwavering faith should always remain within us,” PM Modi said.
“Difficulties are a test of endurance. They are not meant to defeat me. Hardships exist to make me stronger, help me grow and improve, and not leave me feeling hopeless or discouraged. Personally, I see every crisis and challenge as an opportunity,” he added.
The prime minister also encouraged youth to be patient, saying, “There are no shortcuts in life. At our railway stations, there’s a sign for those who habitually cross the tracks instead of using the bridge, which reads, ‘Shortcut will cut you short.’ I would tell young people the same: a shortcut will cut you short. Patience and perseverance are essential.”
“Whatever responsibility we are given, we must pour our hearts into it. We should live it with passion. Enjoy the journey and find fulfillment in it. I truly believe that if this mindset is cultivated, it transforms life.”
PM Modi further explained that abundance alone is not enough and there is no guarantee of success. “Even a wealthy person who indulges in comfort and idleness will eventually wither away,” he said.
“I must contribute more to society with my own strength. Even if I am in a good position, there is still so much more to do. Even if I am not in a good position, there is still so much work to do. I have also noticed that some people tend to think, ‘I’ve learned enough. That’s it.’ But one should never let the student within them die. Learning should never stop.”
Sharing his personal experiences, the PM said, “I believe that as long as I am alive, I must have a purpose. Perhaps I exist to keep learning, to keep growing. Now, my mother tongue is Gujarati, and we were not very familiar with the Hindi language, nor did we know how to speak it eloquently or communicate effectively. But as a child, I used to sit at my father’s tea shop, and at that young age, I got the chance to meet so many people. And every time, I learned something from them; I observed their ways of speaking, their expressions. These things taught me a lot, even though I wasn’t in a position to apply them then. I thought, ‘If I ever get the chance, why not? Why shouldn’t I present myself well?’ So, I believe the desire to learn should always remain alive.”

Content: Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Singh Patel, inaugurated a three-day Quad Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness for the Indo-Pacific Region in Delhi on Monday.
Jointly organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of External Affairs, the workshop, running from March 17 to 19, aims to strengthen global health emergency frameworks, boost preparedness, and enhance resilience against future health threats, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs.
In her address, Patel stressed the urgent need for global collaboration in the face of emerging health threats. “The rise of emerging and re-emerging health threats in recent times underscores the critical necessity of strengthened preparedness, enhanced surveillance, and well-coordinated international response mechanisms to safeguard global health security,” she said.
Patel highlighted India’s contribution to global pandemic preparedness, stating, “India has contributed USD 10 million towards the establishment of the Pandemic Fund, which was specially conceptualized for fighting pandemics. We have further pledged an additional USD 12 million to support its sustained functioning.”
She emphasized that “India is at the forefront of leveraging digital health technologies to improve healthcare access and outcomes, creating sustainable, data-driven systems.”
Patel also pointed to India’s initiatives such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and the National One Health Program for Prevention and Control of Zoonosis as part of the country’s broader strategy to build a pandemic-ready healthcare system.
Prof. Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India, highlighted the importance of regional collaboration in addressing zoonotic diseases, especially for countries with significant livestock sectors.
Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava emphasized the need for people-centered pandemic preparedness and the Quad’s pivotal role in strengthening health security in the Indo-Pacific.
The workshop follows the One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. Discussions will focus on risk communication, community engagement, disease surveillance, and capacity building. Delegates will also participate in simulations aimed at refining response strategies for pandemics like Avian Influenza, Mpox, and ebola, while promoting cross-border coordination.
A significant part of the event includes field visits to India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Centre for Vector-Borne Disease Control, offering delegates first-hand insights into India’s public health infrastructure and emergency response systems.
As an outcome of the 6th Quad Leaders’ Summit held in September 2024, the workshop serves as a platform for global health security collaboration. Senior health officials and technical experts from Quad nations—India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—are joined by over 25 delegates from 15 Indo-Pacific countries, including Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, as well as international health organizations.

Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:50:26 +0000
Content: US Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation tour, on Monday said that Washington and New Delhi are engaged in high-level discussions on trade tariffs.
Speaking to ANI, Gabbard highlighted the potential for strengthening economic ties between the two nations.
“What I have heard from Indian government officials over the past few days is that there is a strong opportunity to enhance our economic relationship,” Gabbard said. She added that while tariffs have been a point of contention, both nations are approaching the issue with a constructive outlook.
“Prime Minister Modi is prioritizing India’s economic interests and opportunities for its people, just as President Trump is focused on the US economy and the well-being of Americans. Both leaders are committed to finding a solution that works for both sides,” she said.
Gabbard pointed out that both President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are pragmatic leaders who are actively seeking mutually beneficial solutions. She stressed the importance of ongoing discussions at various levels of government.
“What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders with common sense, looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is taking place not only at the highest level but also among cabinet members and secretaries. This is key to mapping out a sustainable path forward,” she said.
She also expressed optimism about the growing interest from the private sector in both India and the United States, suggesting that economic collaboration extends beyond government negotiations.
According to Gabbard, the personal friendship between PM Modi and President Trump has set a strong foundation for expanding bilateral ties. She recalled the Prime Minister’s visit to the White House, which helped establish a shared vision for cooperation.
“As you know, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump are already good friends. Their White House meeting set a positive tone for the US-India partnership, and there is immense potential to strengthen it further,” she said.
During her discussions with Indian government and intelligence officials, Gabbard explored opportunities for deeper collaboration in intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She emphasized that the partnership holds “nothing but opportunity” for both nations.
Beyond geopolitics, Gabbard also spoke about her personal admiration for Indian philosophy, mentioning her inspiration from the Mahabharata, particularly Krishna’s teachings to Arjuna.

Title: Results speak for themselves: PM Modi on India-Pakistan cricket rivalry
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:00:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on the iconic India-Pakistan cricket rivalry in a podcast with American researcher Lex Fridman. He also emphasised the role of sports in bridging divides and uniting people across borders.
The prime minister was asked about the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan, particularly in terms of which country has the stronger cricket team. Fridman also raised the question of how sports, especially cricket and football, can play a role in easing geopolitical tensions.
PM Modi underscored the unifying power of sports, highlighting that it goes beyond mere competition and plays a crucial role in connecting people across nations.
“I think sports have the power to energize the entire world. The spirit of sports brings people together from different nations. That’s why I would never want to see sports being discredited. I truly believe that sports play a major role in human evolution. They’re not just games; they connect people on a deeper level,” he said.
“Now, coming to the question of who’s better and who’s not, when it comes to techniques in sports, I’m not an expert. Only those who specialize in the technical aspects can judge which techniques are superior and who the best players really are. But sometimes, the results speak for themselves,” the PM added.
“Just a few days ago, India and Pakistan played a match. The result reveals which is the better team. That’s how we know,” the PM stressed.
The prime minister was referring to the recently concluded Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan in Dubai, where India comfortably defeated their arch-rivals by six wickets.
India has overwhelmingly dominated Pakistan in ICC World Cups, winning 14 out of 15 encounters, with Pakistan securing only one victory in a T20 World Cup match. India also leads 8-0 in ODI World Cups.

Title: US reports first outbreak of deadly H7N9 bird flu since 2017
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:20:30 +0000
Content: The United States reported the first outbreak of the deadly H7N9 bird flu on a poultry farm since 2017, as the country continues to grapple with another bird flu strain that has infected humans and caused egg prices to hit record highs.
The spread of avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has ravaged flocks around the world, disrupting supply and fuelling higher food prices. Its spread to mammals, including dairy cows in the U.S., has raised concerns among governments about a risk of a new pandemic.
The strain that has caused most damage to poultry in recent years and the death of one person in the U.S. is the H5N1.
The H7N9 bird flu virus has proved to have a high death rate for humans worldwide killing 616 people, or 39%, of the 1,568 people infected worldwide since it was first detected in 2013 in China, the World Health Organisation said.
The WHO has said that both forms of the bird flu virus do not appear to transmit easily from person to person.
The latest outbreak of H7N9 in the U.S., detected on a farm of 47,654 commercial broiler breeder chickens in Noxubee, Mississippi, was confirmed on March 13, the Paris-based World Animal Health Organisation said in a report on Monday, citing U.S. Authorities.
The Mississippi departments of agriculture and health did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. response to bird flu was disrupted in the early weeks of the Trump administration, when federal agencies cancelled congressional briefings and meetings with state animal health officials, according to Reuters reporting.
Some of that coordination has since resumed and the USDA says it will spend $1 billion to tackle the spread of the virus.

Title: Top creditor China approved no loans to Cambodia in 2024, data shows
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:19:10 +0000
Content: China signed no new loans to Cambodia last year, latest data from Cambodia’s finance ministry shows, in a dramatic reversal by the country’s top creditor that if continued could affect infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation.
With about $4 billion in outstanding loans, China accounts for more than a third of the country’s debt, Cambodian government data shows. That makes it the largest creditor, with a stock worth around one-tenth of Cambodia’s gross domestic product.
The collapse in signed loan agreements last year contrasts with new credit deals worth $302 million in 2023, and $567 million in 2022, according to the official data.
China’s loans to Cambodia have largely gone to infrastructure projects, such as roads, airports and power transmission lines.
Listed by the United Nations as a Least Developed Country, Cambodia is highly reliant on foreign financing, the IMF noted in a January report.
China’s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing has extensively supported Cambodia’s development in recent years and “will continue to provide assistance to Cambodia’s economic and social development to the best of its ability.”
Beijing has downsized its overseas investments in recent years and some projects it funded in Cambodia were seen as unsuccessful, officials have said.
Meas Soksensan, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s finance ministry, told Reuters on Monday the government was not concerned by the fall in loans, noting credit agreements depended on feasibility studies. “New projects are being discussed and will be signed soon,” he added.
Cambodia has announced Chinese investment for a new canal with an estimated cost of $1.7 billion that could be the country’s most expensive infrastructure project, but so far Beijing has not disclosed any figure for its possible contribution.
Chinese disbursements for previously agreed loans continued last year but at a lower pace than in the past, the data shows.
Cambodia received credit worth nearly $241 million from Beijing last year, down from $366 million in 2023 and $301 million in 2022, the official data showed.

Title: India records 47.90% surge in foreign tourist arrivals in 2023
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:50:59 +0000
Content: India witnessed a significant boost in Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in 2023, recording a 47.90% increase compared to the previous year, according to data released by the Bureau of Immigration. Union Minister for Tourism and Culture, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, revealed the figures in a written statement to the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The country welcomed 9.52 million foreign tourists in 2023, reflecting a robust recovery in global travel post-pandemic. Of this, 4.40 million arrivals were for leisure, holiday, and recreation purposes, registering an impressive 86.96% growth over 2022. Foreign tourists visiting India for business and professional reasons totalled 0.98 million, marking a 49.66% rise from the previous year.
Foreign tourist arrivals have now recovered to 87.1% of pre-pandemic levels, closely aligning with the global recovery rate of 88.8%, and significantly surpassing the Asia-Pacific region’s recovery rate of 65.4%.
The surge in FTAs is attributed to the post-pandemic revival of international travel and India’s growing reputation as a diverse and culturally rich destination. Enhanced air connectivity, improved tourism infrastructure, and targeted marketing campaigns have played a crucial role in making India a preferred destination for global travellers.
The Ministry of Tourism has implemented various initiatives to support this growth, including the development of tourism infrastructure through schemes like ‘Swadesh Darshan,’ ‘PRASHAD,’ and financial assistance to states for tourism development. The Ministry also promotes India’s tourism offerings through campaigns such as ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ and ‘Chalo India,’ along with events like the International Tourism Mart and Bharat Parv.
In addition to these efforts, India has expanded its tourism appeal through niche sectors like wellness tourism, culinary tourism, and eco-tourism. Further measures include capacity-building programs like the ‘Incredible India Tourist Facilitator’ (IITF) and collaborations with the Ministry of Civil Aviation to improve air connectivity under the RCS-UDAN scheme, which has operationalized 53 tourism routes.
India’s e-Visa scheme, which is available to citizens of 167 countries across nine categories, including e-Tourist, e-Business, and e-Medical visas, has further streamlined the entry process for foreign visitors, contributing to the rise in FTAs.

Title: HKU1 not a new threat, unlikely to cause widespread infection: experts
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:41:36 +0000
Content: Amid concerns over a woman in Kolkata testing positive for Human Coronavirus HKU1, health experts have reassured that the virus is not new and is unlikely to cause a widespread outbreak. HKU1 has been known for at least two decades and is categorized among coronaviruses that generally cause mild respiratory infections.
HKU1 was first identified in 2004 by researchers at Hong Kong University, from which it derives its name. Also known as Betacoronavirus hongkonense, it is a species of coronavirus that affects both humans and animals.
Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, Chairman of the Scientific Committee, IMA Cochin, clarified that HKU1 is different from Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“HKU1 is one of several common cold-causing viruses that belong to the coronavirus group. It is not the same as Covid-19 and is not a new virus,” he told IANS.
Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Additional Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, further explained that HKU1 is a subtype of coronavirus and does not pose a major public health risk.
HKU1 is one of four common cold-causing coronaviruses—along with NL63, OC43, and 229E. In contrast, three coronaviruses are known for causing severe illness: Covid virus, the MERS virus, and the SARS virus.
According to Jayadevan, HKU1 does not typically lead to severe disease. Most cases present mild symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever.
However, in vulnerable individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, HKU1 can cause pneumonia.
Studies indicate that most children experience at least one infection with HKU1 by the age of 3-4 years.
“Most children get exposed to these viruses while growing up. But immunity against coronaviruses is not long-lasting, which means repeated infections are common,” Jayadevan added.
A 2021 study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found that HKU1, along with NL63, OC43, and 229E, accounted for 4.3% of infections among a group of 250 children.
The recent case of HKU1 in India involves a 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, who has been suffering from fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days. However, doctors have confirmed that her condition is stable.
Since the virus is “not commonly tested for, it is meaningless to say it wasn’t found in India,” Jayadevan said.
HKU1 spreads mainly by contact, and also through the air by standing close to someone who is coughing or sneezing.
“Viruses tend to stick to commonly touched surfaces, so washing hands with soap and water after returning from public places is a good preventive habit,” Jayadevan advised.
Dr. Salve emphasized the need to maintain a strong surveillance system to monitor and respond to emerging infections.

Title: Over 6.54 crore people living in slums nationwide; 90.60 lakh houses delivered under PMAY-U
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:24:54 +0000
Content: A total of 6.54 crore people, representing 1.39 crore households, are currently living in slums across the country, and 90.60 lakh houses have been completed or delivered to slum beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) as of March 3, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Tokhan Sahu, said that the data on slum households is based on the 2011 Census.
Under the PMAY-U scheme, the ministry has sanctioned a total of 118.64 lakh houses, of which 112.46 lakh have commenced construction, and 90.60 lakh have been completed or delivered to beneficiaries as of March 3. The scheme’s timeline has been extended to December 31, to allow for the completion of sanctioned houses without altering the funding structure or implementation methodology.
Sahu also outlined the role of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in supporting States and Union Territories by providing central assistance through the PMAY-U, which was launched on June 25. The scheme aims to provide pucca (permanent) houses in urban areas, including slums, through four verticals: Beneficiary-Led Individual House Construction/Enhancements (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), and the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).
The timeline for completing projects varies by state, with different verticals requiring between 12 to 36 months for completion, according to the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the respective projects, Sahu noted.
He added that, based on nine years of implementation experience, the Ministry has revamped the scheme and launched PMAY-U 2.0 under the Housing for All mission, effective September 1, 2024, aiming to support an additional one crore eligible beneficiaries.
As of today, 30 states and Union territories have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for PMAY-U 2.0, and the ministry has granted in-principle approval for 6.77 lakh houses in these regions, Sahu informed.

Title: EPFO registers record 2.16 crore auto claim settlements in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has implemented several measures to streamline the claim settlement process, processing 2.16 crore auto claims in the current financial year up to March 6, 2025. This marks a significant increase from the 89.52 lakh claims settled in FY 2023-24, the Parliament was informed on Monday.
Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Shobha Karandlaje, stated in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the limit for auto-mode processing of advance claims has been raised to ₹1 lakh. Additionally, advances for housing, education, and marriage, along with illness and hospitalisation, are now processed in auto mode. Currently, 60 per cent of advance claims are being settled through auto-mode processing, with claims typically processed within three days.
The minister further informed that the member details correction process has been simplified. Members with Aadhaar-verified Universal Account Numbers (UANs) can now make corrections to their identification details without EPFO intervention. Presently, about 96 per cent of such corrections are being completed without any involvement from EPF offices.
Karandlaje also said that over 99.31 per cent of claims are currently submitted online, eliminating the need for members to visit field offices. In the financial year 2024-25, as of March 6, 7.14 crore claims have been filed in online mode.
In the case of transfer claim submissions, employer attestation of Aadhaar-verified UANs has been removed, and now only 10 per cent of transfer claims require both member and employer attestation. Additionally, the requirement of submitting a cheque leaf with the claim form has been relaxed for KYC-compliant UANs that meet prescribed criteria.
EPFO has also enabled members to de-link EPF accounts that were erroneously or fraudulently linked by establishments. Since the launch of this facility on January 18, 2025, more than 55,000 members have de-linked their accounts as of the end of February 2025.
To assist members in submitting eligible claims, certain upfront validations have been implemented to provide guidance regarding eligibility and admissibility.
The minister added that the claim settlement process is being further simplified with the centralisation of member databases under the Centralised IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01).

Title: FIFA report finds wide discrepancy in women’s pay, contracts, attendance
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:13:01 +0000
Content: The average annual salary for a female professional soccer player globally is $10,900, says FIFA’s annual report on the women’s game, a figure skewed by a small number of top clubs.
Among the teams FIFA designated as Tier 1, which includes 41 clubs from 16 countries, the average salary was around $24,030, although 16 of those top clubs paid an average gross salary of over $50,000, according to the “Setting the Pace, FIFA Benchmarking Report on Women’s Football” released on Monday.
The highest of those salaries was approximately $120,000.
The average gross salary, however, at Tier 2 and 3 clubs was $4,361 and $2,805, respectively.
“There is a need for players of a certain standard to earn a reliable and sufficient income solely from playing, reducing their dependence on secondary sources of income and allowing them to dedicate the time required to play at a higher level,” the report said.
Tier 1 clubs also featured the longest player contracts, most commonly between one and three years, with salaries highest for contracts of two to three years, while Tier 3 teams were most likely of the tiers to offer contracts under three months.
“A longer contract enables players to commit to a club and a location, giving them more stability so they can focus on their footballing careers,” said the report.
It also highlighted the attendance as an area of concern.
LEAGUE RECORD
While Arsenal hosted Manchester United in front of a Women’s Super League record 60,160 fans at Emirates Stadium last year, Tier 1 teams averaged 1,713 fans, while Tiers 2 and 3 were 480 and 380, respectively.
Arsenal were among the 23% of clubs that played some matches at a stadium other than their regular ground, playing five home league games at The Emirates and the rest at Meadow Park, which has a seating capacity of 1,700 and a total capacity of 4,500.
“For clubs in Tier 1, the average attendance at the other stadium was typically double that at the regular stadium, indicating that the sport can attract larger audiences on occasion,” the report said.
Women are under-represented in coaching roles, with 22% of head coaches across all tiers being female. There is more gender equity among officials, with 42% of referees being female, ranging from 57% in Tier 1 leagues to 25% in Tiers 2 and 3.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the report helps clubs, leagues and stakeholders gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success.
“The strides made in recent years have been remarkable, but there is still more work to be done to unlock its full potential,” he said.
Surveys for “Setting the Pace” were sent to 135 leagues and 1,518 clubs, with a total of 677 clubs in 90 leagues responding.
FIFA tiers were determined by factors such as whether the league had a club licensing system, the number of a league’s players who featured in the 2023 Women’s World Cup, and a member association’s total budget for women’s football among others.

Title: Lok Sabha to discuss railway, Jal Shakti grants; opposition seeks adjournment
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:49:08 +0000
Content: The Lok Sabha is scheduled to take up discussions and voting on the demands for grants pertaining to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Jal Shakti today. According to an official list released by Secretary General Utpal Kumar Singh on Tuesday, the session will see Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and C. R. Patil presenting the demands for grants under their respective ministries.
In addition to the discussions on the Railway and Jal Shakti Ministries, thirteen other Union Ministers are expected to lay papers related to their respective portfolios. 
Meanwhile, the Opposition has stepped up its efforts to raise key concerns by submitting adjournment motions. Congress MPs have filed motions seeking immediate discussion on two pressing issues—the affordability and quality of medicines, and the impact of the Reserve Bank of India’s new regulations on jewel loans.
Congress MP Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion highlighting the potential hardships caused by the RBI’s recent policy change. Tagore pointed out that under the previous rule, customers could repay only the interest accrued on jewel loans during the loan period and had the option to renew their loan without settling the entire principal amount. However, the new rule mandates repayment of the full amount before customers can repledge their jewelry for fresh loans. He expressed concern that this change would severely affect small businesses, farmers, and financially vulnerable sections of society.
Another Congress MP, Vijay Vasanth, raised concerns over the rising cost of medicines, emphasizing that the sharp increase in drug prices has placed a heavy burden on ordinary citizens. Citing data from the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), he noted that the prices of more than 800 essential medicines have surged by 10-20 percent over the past five years. Vijay Vasanth also called for a discussion on the affordability of life-saving drugs, the dominance of pharmaceutical monopolies, and the limited contribution of India’s domestic pharmaceutical industry, particularly in areas such as the local manufacturing of oncology medicines.
The Lok Sabha reconvenes at 11 a.m. today after a break for the Holi festival, which lasted until March 17.

Title: Zinc supplements can halt growth of cancer cells
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:39:36 +0000
Content: A team of researchers has recently suggested that taking zinc supplements can significantly inhibit the rapid growth of cancer cells in the human body.
The researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington in Texas found that zinc supplements can significantly inhibit the proliferation of esophageal cancer, which affects the tube running from the throat to the stomach.
They explained that zinc impedes overactive calcium signals in cancer cells, a feature absent in normal cells, and thus zinc selectively inhibits cancer cell growth.
Team lead Zui Pan stated that zinc selectively halts the growth of cancer cells but not normal esophageal epithelial cells.
Pan added that this study could provide a pathway for better esophageal cancer prevention and treatment.
Zinc deficiency has been observed in many cancer patients, and both clinical data and animal studies have shown that this mineral is essential for overall body health and cancer prevention, Pan noted.
Zinc is an important element in many proteins and enzymes, and without it, cells cannot function properly, the authors explained.
“It now appears that zinc and calcium can have a cross-talk, meaning that they can be linked.”
An insufficient amount of zinc can lead to the development of cancer and other diseases, Pan said.
“That’s why it is important to maintain a good diet,” she added.
Zinc-enriched foods include spinach, flax seeds, beef, pumpkin seeds, and seafood like shrimp and oysters.
Pan said that in the future, they will study how these two signals interact, how they impact each other, and how researchers can leverage this knowledge. Such steps could guide the development of better prevention and treatment strategies, she concluded.
The research appeared in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology journal.

Title: India women’s team has changed view of female sport, says Kohli
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:39:05 +0000
Content: The achievements of India’s women’s cricket team in recent years have revolutionized perceptions towards women’s sport, driving increased engagement, commercial success, and financial stability, according to batsman Virat Kohli.
The India women’s team, who won silver at the Commonwealth Games and gold at the Asian Games in 2022, are third in the International Cricket Council’s Twenty20 and one-day rankings, trailing only Australia and England.
“I think what the India women’s cricket team has done over the last few years, they are the ones who were the catalysts to put the attention onto them,” Kohli said at the RCB Innovation Lab Indian Sports Summit on Saturday in Bengaluru.
“I literally saw it happening like in a timespan of six, seven years. The way they started playing, you could see the belief that people started engaging in a lot more.
“Eventually, it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women’s game and then you have the WPL (Women’s Premier League).”
While the men’s Indian Premier League started in 2008, it took 15 years for women to have their own T20 league in India.
Kohli, the T20 World Cup, and Champions Trophy winner, said the league has taken the game “two to three levels higher than it used to be.
“You can’t just look at the men for the improvement of sport in any country. It has to be a collective sports culture and it includes everyone. And women’s sport is a massive part of it,” Kohli said.
“We have so much talent in women’s sport, not just cricket, but all the other sports. We have had great individual athletes over the years – tennis, badminton, wrestling, and boxing.
“… It’s definitely heading in the right direction and it keeps getting more backing and more infrastructure to be developed for them as well as for their sport to grow.”
DRIVING FORCE
Cricket has been the driving force behind change in the sporting ecosystem in India but women’s participation in other sports in the country still needs more support and platforms for exposure.
Former Australia soccer player and FIFA Council member Moya Dodd, echoed Kohli’s sentiments, saying the success of women’s cricket in India would pave the way for the development of other sports in the country.
“I think there’s room for more than one sport and even though one sport may lead, I think it does create space for women to participate in other sports,” she said at the Summit on Friday.
“I think seeing the success of the WPL… it’s extraordinary and that does help shift mindset and cultural views towards women playing sport full stop and that will help other sports.”
Dodd compared the potential impact of the India women’s cricket team to that of the Matildas, Australia’s national women’s football team, which she said created a “social movement around gender equality, women’s empowerment, and inclusion.
“The success of women’s cricket in India will drive that movement, and other women’s sports will gain the permission of society to also reflect that and build their growth from that.”

Title: Raisina Dialogue 2025: Jaishankar calls for strong, fair UN, says “Kashmir invasion was made into a dispute”; highlights importance of international order
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:33:13 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday stressed the importance of having an international order just like a domestic order. He slammed the United Nations for making the Kashmir invasion a dispute and turning the attacker and victim at par and called for having a “strong and fair” UN.
In his remarks at the Session on ‘Thrones and Thorns: Defending the Integrity of Nations’ at Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday, Jaishankar called the occupation of some parts of Kashmir by Pakistan “the longest standing illegal occupation” of territory by another country after the Second World War.
When asked about his earlier remarks, where he said, “If you don’t have an order, then you are looking at a very anarchic world’, Jaishankar responded, “Look, I think we do need an international order just like we need a domestic order. Just like you need a society in a country, you need an international version of that and its not just big countries who will benefit if there is no order. I would argue that any country which would take risk, which would have an extreme positions, which would test the system will actually use the disorder to its advantage. I mean we have seen in our own neighbourhood. You don’t have to a big country to be a risky country. I have smaller neighbours who have done a pretty good job. So, first of all, we should all understand the importance of an order.”
“Now, the old order, it was an order, it was a product of its times. But, why I felt its virtuals were exaggerated was I think the rule maker and rule taker had somewhat different perspective because I also said in the same interview that if you are at the receiving end of those rules or the application of those rules, we had issues and let me give you two or three practical examples. You know, if you capriciously, you know, if it suits your interests, somebody is good, not good, well, I’ll make up my mind how they’re going to do and you apply that order to the same country on the same issues differently,” he added.
He said that the Taliban was welcomed in the Doha process and Oslo. He stressed that when it suits to deal with the Taliban, it is okay and when it is not, it is called extremist.
“Take Afghanistan, so, the same Afghanistan, the same Taliban which was an outlier was welcomed in the Doha process, was welcomed in Oslo, apparently, at that time people were okay with it. Today again we going back saying, Taliban is doing all these not so good things. Now, if they were doing all of that. what was discussed in Oslo and Doha. You know you had a British general who described them at that time as they are country boys with their own honour code. Now, so when it suits you to deal with the Taliban, they are okay. When it is not, they are not okay. You are an extremist today, you wear a suit and tie, you are okay. You know, I think I have a problem with that all,” Jaishankar said.
The EAM termed sovereignty and territorial integrity the “bedrock of global rules.” He also spoke on political interference, where he mentioned that when the West goes into other nations, it is “apparently in the perseverance of democratic freedoms.” However, he noted that when other nations come into the West, it appears to have a “very malign intention.”
Jaishankar said, “Let’s give you a second example. We all speak of sovereignty and territorial integrity. All of us agree. It’s a vital principle. It’s a bedrock of global rules. After the Second World War, the longest standing illegal, I would say presence, occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India, what we saw in Kashmir. Now we went to the UN, what was an invasion was made into a dispute. So the attacker and the victim were put on par. Who were the culpable parties? UK, Canada, Belgium, Australia, USA. So, pardon me, I have some question marks on that one. Now, I can give you many more. We speak today of political interference. When the West goes out into other countries, it’s apparently in perseverance of democratic freedoms. When other countries come into the West, it seems to have a very malign intention.”
Calling for a strong and fair UN, EAM Jaishankar said, “So I think we need to have an order, there must be fairness. agree with you, Dominique, we need a strong UN, but a strong UN requires a fair UN. A strong global order must have some basic consistency of standards. We have military crews to our east in Myanmar. They are no-no. We have them even more regularly to the west. You know where? They seem to be okay. I think it’s important to audit the working of the world for the last eight decades and be honest about it and to understand today that the balances, the share holdings in the world have changed. We need a different conversation. We need frankly in that sense a different order.”
Slovakia’s Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Juraj Blanar, former Sweden Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Liechtenstein’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport, Dominique Hasler, Fiker Institute Founder Dubai Abulhoul participated alongside Jaishankar in this session.
The Raisina Dialogue, which is being held in Delhi from March 17-19, is hosted by the Observer Research Foundation in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs. It is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics committed to addressing the most challenging issues facing the global community.

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:25:18 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla, inaugurated a two-day orientation programme for the members of the Delhi legislative assembly on Tuesday. The event aimed at equipping the legislators with the knowledge and skills required for effective governance and legislative procedures.
The inaugural session was attended by Vijender Gupta, Speaker of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, Rekha Gupta, Chief Minister of Delhi, along with Delhi government ministers and members of the Delhi legislative assembly.
In his inaugural address, Lok Sabha Speaker, praised the Delhi legislative assembly for its transition into a democratic system in the new India. He urged the members to strive towards making the Delhi assembly a model legislature that sets standards for others to follow.
Birla emphasized the importance of maintaining a smooth functioning of the Assembly, saying, “There should not be deadlock in the House. Dissent should be expressed in a dignified manner, with meaningful dialogue.” He also stressed that the expectations and aspirations of the public from the new government are exceptionally high, highlighting the critical role that Delhi’s elected representatives play in meeting those expectations.
“The public representatives of Delhi are accountable not just to the people of Delhi but to the entire nation, which will closely observe their work,” Birla said.
The Lok Sabha Speaker further underscored that to be an effective public representative, legislators must have an in-depth knowledge of the Constitution, the rules, and procedures of the House. He advised the members to actively participate in the House discussions to improve their understanding and effectiveness as public representatives.
“To discharge the responsibilities of a public representative effectively, one must constantly work to improve their capacity and efficiency,” said Birla, adding that the importance of the Question Hour and other legislative tools cannot be overstated. Members would only be able to take full advantage of these processes if they are well-versed in the rules and procedures of the House.
He also highlighted the vital role of committees, describing them as “mini assemblies,” and encouraged members to actively participate in their meetings.
Speaking about the role of the Opposition, the Lok Sabha Speaker emphasized the need for a positive and constructive approach, stating, “The foundation of democracy is based on dialogue and consensus.”

Title: India’s direct tax collections rise 16% to ₹25.86 lakh crore
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:20:31 +0000
Content: India’s direct tax collections have increased by 16.2%, totaling ₹25.86 lakh crore during the period from April 1, 2024, to March 16, 2025, as per the most recent figures from the Income Tax Department, compared to the same period in the previous financial year.
Direct taxes include corporate tax, personal income tax, and securities transaction tax (STT). Corporate tax collections surged to ₹12.40 lakh crore in the current financial year, up from ₹10.1 lakh crore in the same period last year. Personal income tax receipts also saw a notable increase, rising to ₹12.90 lakh crore from ₹10.91 lakh crore in the previous year.
STT collections experienced a sharp rise, reaching ₹53,095 crore compared to ₹34,131 crore in the prior year. However, other taxes, including wealth tax, saw a slight dip, dropping from ₹3,656 crore to ₹3,399 crore.
After accounting for refunds, which increased by 32.51% to ₹4.6 lakh crore, net direct tax collections stood at ₹21.26 lakh crore, reflecting a 13.13% year-on-year increase from ₹18.8 lakh crore.
The increase in tax collections highlights the country’s strong macroeconomic position. It enables the government to raise funds for large infrastructure projects, support welfare initiatives for the poor, and maintain fiscal discipline. A lower fiscal deficit reduces borrowing needs, leaving more funds in the banking system for corporate investments, ultimately contributing to higher economic growth and job creation.
Additionally, a lower fiscal deficit helps control inflation, stabilizing the economy and ensuring sustainable growth.

Title: Government e marketplace surpasses Rs.5 lakh crore GMV ahead of FY 2024-25 year-end
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:06:55 +0000
Content: The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) has reached a significant milestone by crossing Rs.5 lakh crore in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), just weeks before the financial year 2024-25 concludes. This achievement underscores GeM’s rapid growth as a key platform for public procurement, benefiting over 1.6 lakh government entities across India.
According to a statement from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry on Monday, the platform’s growth has been particularly impressive, with the leap from Rs.4 lakh crore to Rs.5 lakh crore happening in under 50 days since January 23.
In recent months, GeM has implemented key policy reforms to increase market accessibility and support a wide range of sellers, including Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), startups, and women-led businesses. Changes such as the reduction in transaction charges, vendor assessment fees, and caution money requirements have made the platform more inclusive. By February 13, over 22 lakh sellers and service providers were registered on GeM, contributing to a vibrant and competitive procurement environment.
This year also marks the sixth anniversary of SWAYATT, an initiative promoting startups, women, and youth through digital transactions. As of mid-February, GeM had successfully onboarded more than 29,000 startups and 1.8 lakh Udyam-verified women-led businesses, furthering its mission of economic inclusivity.
Technological advancements have also played a pivotal role in boosting procurement efficiency. In FY 2024-25, GeM executed one of the largest cloud migrations by a government organization, enhancing scalability and improving the platform’s reliability. The integration of AI-powered search tools, through GeM AI, has further streamlined procurement by providing users with real-time data insights for informed decision-making.

Title: Piyush Goyal supports New Zealand PM’s proposal for FTA signing in 60 days
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:54:21 +0000
Content: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has endorsed New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s ambitious proposal to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two nations within 60 days. Speaking at the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI on Tuesday, Goyal expressed confidence in expediting the process, stating that he aims to achieve the agreement “equally fast, maybe even faster.”
“So we are two aspirational friends working together in a spirit of cooperation, respecting each other’s sensitivities. And we will be aspiring to do this equally fast, maybe faster,” Goyal told reporters on the sidelines of the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI, while standing alongside New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay.
Goyal highlighted India’s prior achievement of signing a trade pact with the UAE in just 90 days, emphasizing that no one had anticipated such a swift conclusion.
“But I’ve also always said that no free trade agreement is ever negotiated with a gun on anybody’s head. There’s never a timeline or a sacrosanct deadline. But it’s good to be aspirational. Both our leaders, Prime Minister Luxon and Prime Minister Modi, are ambitious about strengthening this relationship, creating opportunities for the youth of both countries, and leveraging the strengths of New Zealand and India,” Goyal added.
“Our job is to ensure that we do a good job, ensuring a win-win situation for both countries, resulting in expanded opportunities and economic growth.”
He further expressed confidence that the India-New Zealand FTA would be a comprehensive agreement.
“We don’t foresee any difficulties. We will cover the entire gamut of a full-fledged comprehensive economic partnership between New Zealand and India, addressing every issue of mutual interest,” Goyal said.
New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of delivering a strong agreement.
“We have to make sure that we do a good job for the business communities of both India and New Zealand. Our negotiators will come together very soon. It’s encouraging to see that the relationship between India and New Zealand has strengthened to the point where our leaders are urging us to meet frequently and advance our discussions,” McClay said.
Earlier at the FICCI event, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his commitment to signing the FTA with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi within the proposed 60-day timeline.
“We are very ambitious. We have massive aspirations. We can move forward in the world with positivity and confidence, ensuring that we achieve what we deserve. The people of our two countries deserve the best. Despite the challenges, we are well-positioned to accomplish exceptional results for both our nations in the years and decades ahead,” Luxon remarked in his address.
India and New Zealand formally launched negotiations for a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial” Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Sunday, coinciding with Luxon’s arrival in New Delhi for a five-day official visit.
A meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and his New Zealand counterpart Todd McClay in New Delhi laid the groundwork for strengthening economic and trade ties between the two nations.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, New Zealand exported goods and services worth USD 0.84 billion to India, while India’s exports to New Zealand amounted to USD 0.91 billion, bringing the total trade value to USD 1.75 billion.
India primarily imports wool, iron and steel, fruits and nuts, and aluminum from New Zealand. Meanwhile, Indian exports to New Zealand include pharmaceuticals, mechanical machinery, textile articles, pearls, precious stones, and metals.
At the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is visiting India from March 16 to 20.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising ministers, senior officials, business representatives, media personnel, and members of the Indian diaspora in New Zealand.
This marks Prime Minister Luxon’s first visit to India in his current capacity.
On Monday, Luxon held discussions with Prime Minister Modi, covering various aspects of India-New Zealand relations.
Additionally, Luxon served as the chief guest and keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the 10th Raisina Dialogue 2025, held on March 17 in New Delhi.
As part of his itinerary, Luxon will visit Mumbai on March 19-20, where he is scheduled to engage with Indian business leaders and representatives from diverse sectors.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis won’t ‘dial down’ under US pressure or Iranian appeals
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:03:29 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthis will not “dial down” their action against Israeli shipping in the Red Sea in response to U.S. military pressure or appeals from the group’s allies such as Iran, the Yemeni militant group’s foreign minister said.
Jamal Amer spoke to Reuters late on Monday after the U.S. launched a wave of strikes in areas of Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, who said last week they were resuming attacks on Red Sea shipping to support Palestinians in Gaza.
Two senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran had delivered a verbal message to the Houthi envoy in Tehran on Friday to cool tensions and that Iran’s foreign minister asked Oman, which has mediated with the Houthis, to convey a similar message to the group when he visited Muscat on Sunday. Both officials asked not to be named.
Iran has not made any public comment about recent outreach to the Houthis over their renewed action. Tehran says the group takes decisions independently.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis.
“There will be no talk of any dialling down of operations before ending the aid blockade in Gaza. Iran is not interfering in our decision but what is happening is that it mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things,” Amer said, in his first comments on the issue to a foreign news agency.
Speaking from Yemen’s capital Sanaa, which has been hit by U.S. strikes, he said he had not been informed of any message Iran delivered to the Houthi envoy in Tehran.
There were messages from other powers to dial down, he said, but added: “Now we see that Yemen is at war with the U.S. and that means that we have a right to defend ourselves with all possible means, so escalation is likely.”
IRANIAN CONCERNS
Iran, whose network of proxies and allies across the Middle East has taken a hammering since the war in Gaza erupted in 2023, has shown increasing concern it could be drawn deeper into conflict with the United States. Iran and Israel exchanged direct strikes for the first time last year as the Gaza war escalated.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers that curbed its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief, has stepped up a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since returning to office for a second term in January.
“(The U.S.) is threatening Iran and hitting Yemen. Now all scenarios are possible. We will do what they will do to us. If they are hitting us from (U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S.) Truman, we will retaliate by hitting Truman,” the Houthi foreign minister said.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Yemeni group says it is aligned with Tehran and its ‘Axis of Resistance’ network without being puppets. Experts on Yemen, where the Houthis expanded control during years of civil war, say the group seems mainly motivated by domestic concerns and support base.
The Houthis said on March 12 they had resumed attacks on Israeli ships using routes that pass through the Red Sea after the group said Israel had not met a Houthi deadline for ending an aid blockade on Gaza.
Israel’s blockade, which includes food and medical supplies, began on March 2 as a standoff over a ceasefire deal in Gaza escalated. Israel launched heavy strikes on Gaza overnight into Tuesday.
WAVES OF STRIKES
The Houthis had launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas, another of Iran’s regional allies, in Gaza. It suspended operations when the Gaza ceasefire came into effect in January.
The Houthi foreign minister said the group had aimed only to target Israeli ships, but the U.S. had escalated and the Houthis had a right to defend themselves.
The U.S. began a wave of strikes on Saturday that have hit the capital and expanded across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, killing dozens of people.
Amer said some European Union countries had advised the Houthis not to escalate, and said the group had sought to reassure them that the target was Israeli shipping.
He also said Saudi Arabia, which backed Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthis in the civil war, had not intervened militarily so far, and nor had other Gulf states. That was something that Houthis valued, he added, while warning that Gulf states risked being caught in the crossfire if they intervened militarily.
“If any aircraft or base is used against us then we will escalate and we will defend ourselves, but if they (Gulf states) continue to be neutral we will stay away,” he said.
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Indore to launch India’s first PPP green waste processing plant under Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:33:38 +0000
Content: In a significant leap toward environmental sustainability, Indore is set to become the first city in India to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model-based green waste processing plant under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban. This initiative aims to revolutionize waste management by converting green waste into valuable, eco-friendly resources.
The plant, built on 55,000 square feet of land in Bicholi Hapsi, will process green waste like wood, branches, leaves, and flowers, and generate revenue for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), which will earn approximately Rs 3,000 per tonne in royalty for supplying wood and branches. The facility will recycle this green waste into wooden pellets, serving as a sustainable alternative to coal and contributing to energy conservation efforts.
Each day, the city of Indore generates around 30 tons of green waste, a figure that can rise to 60-70 tons during peak seasons like autumn. As part of the project, large tree branches will be redirected to the Green Waste Processing Plant at City Forest for repurposing into valuable products. Additionally, green waste from major institutions will be collected and sent to the facility, under a fixed fee structure.
Astronomical Industries Private Limited has partnered with the IMC to process this waste into sawdust, which will undergo a drying process over 3-4 months, reducing its moisture content by 90%. Once dried, the material will be processed into fine dust particles using cutting-edge machinery, transforming it into a resource for various industries.
The sawdust produced will serve multiple eco-friendly purposes, including being used as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuel sources, crafting durable packing materials to replace plastic, enhancing furniture manufacturing, and even producing biodegradable disposable plates for the food industry. Additionally, the sawdust will be used to create fertilizers that help enrich soil and promote healthier crops for farmers.
The IMC will play a critical role by providing land and transporting green waste to the facility, while Astronomical Industries will manage the installation, operation, and maintenance of the plant. Other private companies have also contributed to waste management in the city by setting up plants like Meghdoot and sub-grade facilities to process garden waste, as well as composting in municipal gardens.
The initiative is set to contribute significantly to improving waste management practices, reducing pollution, and controlling the Air Quality Index (AQI) by offering a sustainable alternative to coal.

Title: Poland and Baltic nations plan to pull out from landmines convention
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:57:04 +0000
Content: NATO members Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plan to withdraw from the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines due to the military threat from their neighbour Russia, the four countries said on Tuesday.
Quitting the 1997 treaty, which has been ratified or acceded to by more than 160 nations but not by Russia, will allow Poland and the three Baltic countries to start stockpiling landmines again.
“Military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased,” the countries’ defence ministers said in a joint statement.
“With this decision we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs,” they said.
The planned withdrawal was done to allow an effective protection of the region’s borders, Lithuanian Defence Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a separate statement.
Finland said in December it was also considering pulling out of the international agreement because of Russia’s use of such weapons in Ukraine.

Title: India Innovation Summit: TB cases hit record 26.07 lakh in 2024, incidence down 17.7% since 2015
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:56:46 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Patel, inaugurated the India Innovation Summit – “Pioneering Solutions to End TB” at the Bharat Mandapam Convention Centre in Delhi.
The event comes as India’s National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) reaches a major milestone, with 26.07 lakh TB cases notified in 2024, the highest ever recorded. Since 2015, the incidence rate of TB has dropped by 17.7%, from 237 cases per lakh population to 195 in 2023, while TB-related deaths have decreased by 21.4%.
Addressing the summit, Patel highlighted these achievements and praised the transformative role of innovation in India’s TB elimination efforts. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has made remarkable strides in TB control,” she said. “The number of missing cases has been reduced from 15 lakh in 2015 to 2.5 lakh in 2023.”
The summit, jointly organized by the Department of Health Research (DHR), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the Central TB Division (CTD) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, aims to fast-track India’s progress toward eliminating TB by 2025.
Patel also detailed the advancements in TB treatment, including the rollout of a shorter, safer oral regimen for drug-resistant TB across all states and Union Territories, which has improved treatment success rates from 68% in 2020 to 75% in 2022. She highlighted the introduction of the mBPaL treatment regimen, which is 80% more effective in treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and reduces treatment duration to six months.
Further, she discussed the Energy Dense Nutritional Support (EDNS) initiative for undernourished TB patients, and the expansion of the Ni-kshay Mitra Initiative, which provides additional support and food baskets to TB patients and their household contacts. The financial assistance for TB patients under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana has been doubled to ₹1,000 per month, effective November 2024.
Patel also underscored the impact of the ongoing “TB Mukt Bharat – 100 Days Intensified Campaign,” launched on 7th December 2024, covering 455 high-priority districts. The campaign focuses on early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and comprehensive care for vulnerable populations, with the report set to be released on World TB Day in March 2025.
Highlighting innovations, Patel revealed that ICMR has validated three indigenous handheld X-ray devices, enabling more accessible TB screening for vulnerable populations. Additionally, AI-based tools like DeepCXR are enhancing the speed and accuracy of TB detection, and indigenous molecular diagnostic tests, such as PathoDetectTM, are expanding the capacity for early detection of drug resistance.
Dr. V. K. Paul, Member of NITI Aayog, praised India’s progress and emphasized the need for innovation in TB detection and treatment. He reiterated India’s commitment to eliminating not only TB but also five other diseases—Leprosy, Lymphatic filariasis, Measles, Rubella, and Kala-azar—within the next five years.
The one-and-a-half-day summit brings together over 1,200 participants from academia, industry, healthcare, and research to showcase more than 200 innovations. It aims to foster collaborations and ensure that cutting-edge solutions are integrated into national TB programs, reaffirming India’s goal of eliminating TB by 2025.

Title: Sensex soars 1,131 points, Nifty ends above 22,800 as markets rally
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:49:49 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed sharply higher on Tuesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty delivering notable gains, driven by broad-based buying across sectors.
The Sensex jumped 1,131.31 points, or 1.53 per cent, to settle at 75,301.26, while the Nifty advanced 325.55 points, or 1.45 per cent, finishing the session at 22,834.30. During intraday trade, the Sensex touched a high of 75,385.76, and the Nifty oscillated between 22,599.20 and 22,845.95.
This marked the second consecutive session of strong performance for the benchmark indices, buoyed by sustained investor optimism.
According to Sundar Kewat from the Institutional Equity Desk, the rally was predominantly supported by gains in realty, automobile, metal, and banking stocks. “From an options data perspective, we noticed the highest open interest on the call side at 23,000 and 23,500 levels, while the put side showed concentration at 22,500 and 22,700,” Kewat noted.
Adding to the bullish sentiment was softer-than-expected US retail sales data, which spurred hopes that the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates later this year. This global cue, combined with robust domestic fundamentals, contributed to the day’s strong momentum.
The overall market breadth remained firmly positive, with 2,715 stocks advancing, 1,153 declining, and 117 remaining unchanged. Leading the gains on the Nifty were stocks like ICICI Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Shriram Finance, Larsen & Toubro, and Tata Motors. However, Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, and Tech Mahindra were among the few counters that ended in the red.
Sectorally, all indices closed in positive territory. Notable gains were seen in auto, capital goods, consumer durables, metal, power, realty, and media stocks, which rose between 2 to 3 per cent.
The upbeat mood extended to the broader markets as well. The Nifty Smallcap100 index surged by 2.71 per cent, while the Nifty Midcap100 index climbed 2.10 per cent, reflecting strong participation from small- and mid-cap counters.
Additionally, the Indian rupee appreciated against the US dollar, strengthening by 23 paise to end at 86.56 per dollar, compared to the previous close of 86.79.
Investor confidence remained robust, lifting the markets to fresh highs and signalling positive sentiment across sectors.

Title: Japan eye win over Bahrain to become first team to qualify for 2026 World Cup
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:22:45 +0000
Content: Japan will become the first nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Thursday if they defeat Bahrain at Saitama Stadium as Hajime Moriyasu’s side looks to continue their imperious form in Asia’s preliminaries.
Three points would guarantee Japan a top-two finish in Group C and see them join co-hosts the United States, Canada, and Mexico at next year’s finals.
The Japanese have dropped only two points from their six qualifiers—a 1-1 draw with Australia in October—and are 10 points ahead of third-placed Indonesia with four games left.
Australia occupies the second automatic qualification berth in the group, nine points behind the Samurai Blue, but the Socceroos are just a point clear of Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and China.
“Nothing is decided yet, and I believe we should prioritize how we can play to our abilities to win the game right in front of us and make sure of securing World Cup qualification,” Moriyasu said when naming his squad last week.
Australia hosts an Indonesia side playing under new coach Patrick Kluivert for the first time, while Saudi Arabia faces China in Riyadh.
Perennial qualifiers South Korea is on the verge of advancing from Group B, with Hong Myung-bo’s side needing to defeat Oman in Goyang on Thursday and then pick up another positive result against Jordan to book their spot.
The South Koreans have 14 points from their six qualifiers, three ahead of second-placed Iraq, with Jordan in third a further two points adrift.
Iraq, who are looking to qualify for the finals for the first time since 1986, host fifth-placed Kuwait in Basra while Palestine takes on Jordan in Amman.
Iran can also close in on a place at the finals when they host the United Arab Emirates in Tehran in Group A.
Amir Ghalenoei’s team tops the standings from Uzbekistan by three points while sitting a further three ahead of the UAE.
Uzbekistan, chasing their first-ever appearance at a World Cup, hosts Kyrgyzstan in Tashkent while Qatar entertains North Korea, needing a win to maintain their chances of automatic qualification.

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:15:25 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a meeting with his Netherlands counterpart, Ruben Brekelmans, in Delhi on Tuesday.
Brekelmans is visiting India to attend the Raisina Dialogue, which is currently underway in New Delhi from March 17. The Raisina Dialogue 2025 is being hosted by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). It is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics, aimed at addressing the most challenging issues facing the global community.
Nearly 3,700 attendees, including over 800 speakers and delegates from around 130 countries worldwide, are attending the Raisina Dialogue. The participants include serving and former heads of state, ministers, lawmakers, diplomats, policy planners, military leaders, heads of multilateral institutions, business leaders, and eminent thinkers. The theme of this year’s Raisina Dialogue is “Kalachakra: People, Peace, Planet.”
Earlier this month, Netherlands Ambassador to India, Marisa Gerards, stated that India and the Netherlands share a “very strong bilateral relationship.”
“We have a very strong bilateral relationship. We go back a long way. We were one of the first countries to recognize the independence of India. We have significant trade and investment ties,” she said.
Speaking to ANI, Gerards mentioned that the Netherlands is the fourth-largest foreign investor in India, with around 300 Dutch companies operating here.
“We are the fourth-largest investor in your country. About 300 different Dutch companies are very active. On the other hand, we also have a number of Indian companies investing in the Netherlands. Currently, we are working on a strategic partnership to explore further opportunities in trade and investment, security, innovation, and research. We collaborate across various sectors, including water management, health, agriculture, energy, ports, logistics, and climate. Innovation and high-tech research are key areas of cooperation, which strengthens our relationship,” she said.
However, Gerards believes that there is still much more to be done. She emphasized that the green energy sector holds great potential for further collaboration.
“I think there’s a lot of room for further growth. Green energy, particularly green hydrogen, is very high on our agenda. We are also collaborating with both the central government and companies in Gujarat. Several Dutch companies are involved in your ports. The Port of Rotterdam, which is the largest port in Europe, is keen to explore more opportunities in the areas of green energy and green hydrogen,” Gerards added.

Title: Coal India requests BSE, NSE to waive penalty
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:27:50 +0000
Content: Coal India Ltd (CIL) has approached the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), requesting a waiver of the penalties imposed on the company for non-compliance with SEBI’s regulations concerning the appointment of Independent Directors, including one woman director, on its Board.
Both BSE and NSE have levied penalties of ₹9.7 lakh each on the state-owned coal mining giant for failing to meet the provisions outlined under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, for the quarter ending December 31, 2024.
In its appeal, CIL clarified that the non-compliance was neither due to negligence nor deliberate default on the company’s part. It emphasized that the issue was beyond the control of its management and that consistent efforts have been made to fulfill the regulatory requirements.
Coal India explained that, being a government-owned entity under the administrative control of the Ministry of Coal, the appointment of Board members falls under the jurisdiction of the President of India. As per its Articles of Association, the company does not have the authority to appoint its Board members independently. The company has been regularly following up with the Ministry of Coal to expedite the appointment of the requisite number of Independent Directors, including a Woman Independent Director, as mandated by SEBI.
In a regulatory filing on March 18, CIL disclosed that it had received formal notices from both exchanges on March 17, citing violations of specific regulations—namely, Regulations 17(1), 18(1), 19(1 & 2), and 21(2) of the SEBI LODR. Consequently, a fine of ₹9,69,960 each was imposed by the BSE and NSE.
CIL expressed optimism in its filing, stating that in the past, similar requests for penalty waivers had been favourably considered by the stock exchanges.

Title: Trump and Putin discuss Ukraine war, Russia says the talks have ended
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:12:07 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the Ukraine war on Tuesday in a phone call which Washington hoped would convince Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire and move towards a permanent peace deal.
The White House said the talks had begun at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) and White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino wrote on social media that the call was “going well”.
The Kremlin said the talks had ended, Russia’s TASS news agency reported.
Kirill Dmitriev, who was named by Putin last month as his special envoy on international economic and investment cooperation, said that under the leadership of Trump and Putin the world had become a much a safer place.
Ukraine has already agreed to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two, in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced and towns have been reduced to rubble.
Putin, whose forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, said last week he supported in principle Washington’s proposal for a truce but that his forces would fight on until several crucial conditions were worked out.
Trump hopes also to secure progress towards a longer-term peace plan, which he has hinted could include territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
The Kremlin said before the call that Trump and Putin would discuss settling the conflict in Ukraine and normalising relations between Russia and the United States, and that they would speak “for as long as they deem necessary.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was already a “certain understanding” between the two leaders, based on a phone call they held on February 12 and on subsequent high-level contacts between the two countries.
“But there are also a large number of questions regarding the further normalisation of our bilateral relations, and a settlement on Ukraine,” Peskov told reporters.

Content: A delegation of six Supreme Court judges, led by Justice BR Gavai, will visit relief camps in violence-affected Manipur on March 22 to strengthen legal and humanitarian support for the displaced communities.
The delegation comprises Justices BR Gavai, Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, MM Sundresh, KV Viswanathan, and N Kotishwar, all of whom will engage with internally displaced persons (IDPs) and oversee various relief initiatives.
Justice Gavai, who serves as the Executive Chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), will virtually inaugurate legal services camps and medical camps across all districts of Manipur, along with new legal aid clinics in Imphal East, Imphal West, and Ukhrul districts.
The visit will include the distribution of essential relief materials to IDPs. Additionally, the legal services camps will facilitate access to government welfare programs, ensuring displaced individuals can benefit from, healthcare services, pensions, employment schemes, identity document reconstruction.
“Each participating state department will outline at least five key schemes tailored to address the needs of the displaced population. A team of 25 specialized doctors from Chennai will conduct medical camps across all relief camps. Their services will continue for six additional days, ensuring sustained medical support, treatment, and access to essential medicines for displaced families,” NALSA stated.
NALSA, in collaboration with the Manipur State Legal Services Authority (MASLSA), has played a critical role in offering legal aid and support to affected communities. So far, 273 special legal aid clinics have been established at relief camps, assisting IDPs with accessing government benefits, retrieving lost documents, and receiving medical aid.
“This visit underscores NALSA’s steadfast commitment to justice, especially for marginalized and vulnerable communities. By bridging the gap between legal rights and accessibility, NALSA aims to ensure that every displaced person receives the support, protection, and resources they need to rebuild their lives with dignity,” the organization stated.
The Supreme Court delegation will visit relief camps in Manipur on March 22, coinciding with the Duo Decennial Celebration of the High Court of Manipur.
Violence erupted in Manipur on May 3, 2023, following a rally organized by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM). The conflict primarily involved Hindu Meiteis and tribal Kukis, who are Christians. The unrest escalated across the state, prompting the Central government to deploy paramilitary forces to restore order.

Title: Election Commission holds high-level meeting on EPIC-Aadhaar linking, emphasizes Constitutional compliance
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:50:57 +0000
Content: The Election Commission of India (ECI), led by Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, convened a crucial meeting with key officials and technical experts on Tuesday to discuss the linking of Voter ID (EPIC) with Aadhaar.
Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, along with the Union Home Secretary, Secretary of the Legislative Department, Secretary of MeitY, CEO of UIDAI, and technical experts of the ECI, participated in the meeting.
The Commission reaffirmed that the process will strictly adhere to Article 326 of the Constitution and relevant provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950. In line with a Supreme Court ruling, the ECI emphasized that Aadhaar serves only as proof of identity and not citizenship. Technical consultations between UIDAI and ECI experts will soon commence on the matter.
“As per Article 326 of the Constitution of India, voting rights can only be given to a citizen of India; an Aadhaar card only establishes the identity of a person,” the Commission said.
“Therefore, it was decided that the linking of EPIC with Aadhaar will be done only as per the provisions of Article 326 of the Constitution, Sections 23(4), 23(5), and 23(6) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and in line with the Supreme Court judgment in WP (Civil) No. 177/2023. Accordingly, technical consultations between UIDAI and the technical experts of ECI are to begin soon,” the statement added.
Meanwhile, within less than a month of assuming office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar has initiated a series of proactive and definitive measures to address long-pending electoral challenges, some of which have remained unresolved for decades.
According to sources within the Election Commission of India (ECI), these steps aim to enhance transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency in the electoral process ahead of the upcoming elections.
As part of these efforts, the Election Commission is set to conduct All Party Meetings at the levels of Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), District Election Officers (DEOs), and Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) before March 31, 2025. This initiative seeks to foster direct engagement with political parties at every level of election management, ensuring that their concerns and suggestions are heard at the grassroots level.
For the first time in decades, the ECI has officially invited suggestions from all National and State-recognized political parties within the legal framework by April 30, 2025.

Title: Trump is considering recognising Ukraine’s Crimea as part of Russia, Semafor reports
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:59:30 +0000
Content: The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering recognising Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory in a possible future peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, the Semafor news website reported.
Semafor, citing two people familiar with the matter, said U.S. officials had also discussed the possibility of having Washington urge the United Nations to do the same.
Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Semafor said the White House had declined comment.
Semafor said Trump had not formally made any decisions, and that the possible Crimea moves were among various options being floated.
Trump was due to speak with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to try to convince the Russian President to accept a ceasefire in his country’s war with Ukraine and move towards a more permanent end to the three-year-old conflict.
Crimea is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine by most countries, and Kyiv has said it wants the Black Sea peninsula back even though it has recognised that returning it by force is unrealistic for now.
The Kremlin has repeatedly said that Crimea, where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based and whose pre-annexation population was mostly Russian speakers, is already formally part of Russia, a question it says has been closed “forever.”

Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:43:17 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took to social media to share pictures from his meeting with renowned music composer Ilaiyaraaja, lauding him for his recent symphony performance in London.
Sharing several pictures on X, PM Modi expressed his admiration for the legendary composer. “Delighted to meet Rajya Sabha MP Thiru Ilaiyaraaja Ji, a musical titan whose genius has a monumental impact on our music and culture,” he wrote.
He further praised Ilaiyaraaja’s latest accomplishment: “He is a trailblazer in every sense and made history yet again by presenting his first-ever Western classical symphony, ‘Valiant,’ in London a few days ago. This performance, accompanied by the world-renowned Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, marks another milestone in his unparalleled musical journey—one that continues to redefine excellence on a global scale.”
Ilaiyaraaja also shared his thoughts on X, writing, “A memorable meeting with Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji. We spoke about many things, including my Symphony ‘Valiant.’ Humbled by his appreciation and support. @OneMercuri.”
Upon his return from London on March 10, Ilaiyaraaja received a grand welcome at Chennai Airport from political and cultural figures, including Tamil Nadu Minister Thangam Thenarasu, BJP State Vice President Karu Nagarajan, and VCK functionary Vanni Arasu.
Minister Thangam Thenarasu, on behalf of the Tamil Nadu government, honored Ilaiyaraaja for his contributions to Indian and global music. BJP’s Karu Nagarajan and VCK’s Vanni Arasu also extended their greetings, celebrating the maestro’s exceptional career.
Speaking to the media, Ilaiyaraaja expressed his gratitude to his supporters, particularly his fans in London. “Thanks to everyone. You all sent me off with smiling faces, which made the event hugely successful. The love I received from the fans during the Symphony was overwhelming. Every moment there was filled with appreciation from the audience,” he said.
Ilaiyaraaja, widely regarded as one of India’s greatest music composers, has left an indelible mark on the industry, particularly in Tamil and Telugu cinema.
Born as R. Gnanathesikan in 1943 in Pannaipuram, Theni district, Ilaiyaraaja began his musical journey at a young age. Over four decades, he has composed music for more than a thousand films, blending folk rhythms with classical techniques to create a distinctive sound that continues to captivate audiences.
His compositions are not just musical masterpieces but also reflect deep cultural and social themes, often carrying powerful political messages.
Some of Ilaiyaraaja’s most memorable compositions include, Machana Pathingala (Annakili, 1975) – Marking his debut in Tamil cinema, this song seamlessly blends folk rhythms with contemporary film music. Metti Oli Kaatrodu (Metti, 1980) – Sung by Janaki, this song remains a favorite for its enchanting lyrics and melody. Thenpaandi Cheemayile (Nayagan, 1987) – A deeply emotional classic that continues to resonate with listeners. Janani Janani (Thaai Moogambhigai, 1982) – A devotional anthem cherished by devotees even today. Uravugal Thodarkathai (Aval Appadithan, 1978) – Sung by K. J. Yesudas, this melody highlights Ilaiyaraaja’s mastery over emotion-laden music.

Title: Piyush Goyal supports New Zealand PM’s proposal for FTA signing in 60 days
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:54:21 +0000
Content: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has endorsed New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s ambitious proposal to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two nations within 60 days. Speaking at the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI on Tuesday, Goyal expressed confidence in expediting the process, stating that he aims to achieve the agreement “equally fast, maybe even faster.”
“So we are two aspirational friends working together in a spirit of cooperation, respecting each other’s sensitivities. And we will be aspiring to do this equally fast, maybe faster,” Goyal told reporters on the sidelines of the ‘India-New Zealand Economic Forum’ organized by FICCI, while standing alongside New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay.
Goyal highlighted India’s prior achievement of signing a trade pact with the UAE in just 90 days, emphasizing that no one had anticipated such a swift conclusion.
“But I’ve also always said that no free trade agreement is ever negotiated with a gun on anybody’s head. There’s never a timeline or a sacrosanct deadline. But it’s good to be aspirational. Both our leaders, Prime Minister Luxon and Prime Minister Modi, are ambitious about strengthening this relationship, creating opportunities for the youth of both countries, and leveraging the strengths of New Zealand and India,” Goyal added.
“Our job is to ensure that we do a good job, ensuring a win-win situation for both countries, resulting in expanded opportunities and economic growth.”
He further expressed confidence that the India-New Zealand FTA would be a comprehensive agreement.
“We don’t foresee any difficulties. We will cover the entire gamut of a full-fledged comprehensive economic partnership between New Zealand and India, addressing every issue of mutual interest,” Goyal said.
New Zealand’s Minister of Trade and Investment, Todd McClay, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of delivering a strong agreement.
“We have to make sure that we do a good job for the business communities of both India and New Zealand. Our negotiators will come together very soon. It’s encouraging to see that the relationship between India and New Zealand has strengthened to the point where our leaders are urging us to meet frequently and advance our discussions,” McClay said.
Earlier at the FICCI event, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated his commitment to signing the FTA with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi within the proposed 60-day timeline.
“We are very ambitious. We have massive aspirations. We can move forward in the world with positivity and confidence, ensuring that we achieve what we deserve. The people of our two countries deserve the best. Despite the challenges, we are well-positioned to accomplish exceptional results for both our nations in the years and decades ahead,” Luxon remarked in his address.
India and New Zealand formally launched negotiations for a “comprehensive and mutually beneficial” Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on Sunday, coinciding with Luxon’s arrival in New Delhi for a five-day official visit.
A meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and his New Zealand counterpart Todd McClay in New Delhi laid the groundwork for strengthening economic and trade ties between the two nations.
In the fiscal year 2023-24, New Zealand exported goods and services worth USD 0.84 billion to India, while India’s exports to New Zealand amounted to USD 0.91 billion, bringing the total trade value to USD 1.75 billion.
India primarily imports wool, iron and steel, fruits and nuts, and aluminum from New Zealand. Meanwhile, Indian exports to New Zealand include pharmaceuticals, mechanical machinery, textile articles, pearls, precious stones, and metals.
At the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is visiting India from March 16 to 20.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising ministers, senior officials, business representatives, media personnel, and members of the Indian diaspora in New Zealand.
This marks Prime Minister Luxon’s first visit to India in his current capacity.
On Monday, Luxon held discussions with Prime Minister Modi, covering various aspects of India-New Zealand relations.
Additionally, Luxon served as the chief guest and keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the 10th Raisina Dialogue 2025, held on March 17 in New Delhi.
As part of his itinerary, Luxon will visit Mumbai on March 19-20, where he is scheduled to engage with Indian business leaders and representatives from diverse sectors.

Title: Yemen’s Houthis won’t ‘dial down’ under US pressure or Iranian appeals
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:03:29 +0000
Content: Yemen’s Houthis will not “dial down” their action against Israeli shipping in the Red Sea in response to U.S. military pressure or appeals from the group’s allies such as Iran, the Yemeni militant group’s foreign minister said.
Jamal Amer spoke to Reuters late on Monday after the U.S. launched a wave of strikes in areas of Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, who said last week they were resuming attacks on Red Sea shipping to support Palestinians in Gaza.
Two senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran had delivered a verbal message to the Houthi envoy in Tehran on Friday to cool tensions and that Iran’s foreign minister asked Oman, which has mediated with the Houthis, to convey a similar message to the group when he visited Muscat on Sunday. Both officials asked not to be named.
Iran has not made any public comment about recent outreach to the Houthis over their renewed action. Tehran says the group takes decisions independently.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis.
“There will be no talk of any dialling down of operations before ending the aid blockade in Gaza. Iran is not interfering in our decision but what is happening is that it mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things,” Amer said, in his first comments on the issue to a foreign news agency.
Speaking from Yemen’s capital Sanaa, which has been hit by U.S. strikes, he said he had not been informed of any message Iran delivered to the Houthi envoy in Tehran.
There were messages from other powers to dial down, he said, but added: “Now we see that Yemen is at war with the U.S. and that means that we have a right to defend ourselves with all possible means, so escalation is likely.”
IRANIAN CONCERNS
Iran, whose network of proxies and allies across the Middle East has taken a hammering since the war in Gaza erupted in 2023, has shown increasing concern it could be drawn deeper into conflict with the United States. Iran and Israel exchanged direct strikes for the first time last year as the Gaza war escalated.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers that curbed its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief, has stepped up a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since returning to office for a second term in January.
“(The U.S.) is threatening Iran and hitting Yemen. Now all scenarios are possible. We will do what they will do to us. If they are hitting us from (U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S.) Truman, we will retaliate by hitting Truman,” the Houthi foreign minister said.
While Iran champions the Houthis, the Yemeni group says it is aligned with Tehran and its ‘Axis of Resistance’ network without being puppets. Experts on Yemen, where the Houthis expanded control during years of civil war, say the group seems mainly motivated by domestic concerns and support base.
The Houthis said on March 12 they had resumed attacks on Israeli ships using routes that pass through the Red Sea after the group said Israel had not met a Houthi deadline for ending an aid blockade on Gaza.
Israel’s blockade, which includes food and medical supplies, began on March 2 as a standoff over a ceasefire deal in Gaza escalated. Israel launched heavy strikes on Gaza overnight into Tuesday.
WAVES OF STRIKES
The Houthis had launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas, another of Iran’s regional allies, in Gaza. It suspended operations when the Gaza ceasefire came into effect in January.
The Houthi foreign minister said the group had aimed only to target Israeli ships, but the U.S. had escalated and the Houthis had a right to defend themselves.
The U.S. began a wave of strikes on Saturday that have hit the capital and expanded across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, killing dozens of people.
Amer said some European Union countries had advised the Houthis not to escalate, and said the group had sought to reassure them that the target was Israeli shipping.
He also said Saudi Arabia, which backed Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthis in the civil war, had not intervened militarily so far, and nor had other Gulf states. That was something that Houthis valued, he added, while warning that Gulf states risked being caught in the crossfire if they intervened militarily.
“If any aircraft or base is used against us then we will escalate and we will defend ourselves, but if they (Gulf states) continue to be neutral we will stay away,” he said.
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Indore to launch India’s first PPP green waste processing plant under Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:33:38 +0000
Content: In a significant leap toward environmental sustainability, Indore is set to become the first city in India to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model-based green waste processing plant under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban. This initiative aims to revolutionize waste management by converting green waste into valuable, eco-friendly resources.
The plant, built on 55,000 square feet of land in Bicholi Hapsi, will process green waste like wood, branches, leaves, and flowers, and generate revenue for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), which will earn approximately Rs 3,000 per tonne in royalty for supplying wood and branches. The facility will recycle this green waste into wooden pellets, serving as a sustainable alternative to coal and contributing to energy conservation efforts.
Each day, the city of Indore generates around 30 tons of green waste, a figure that can rise to 60-70 tons during peak seasons like autumn. As part of the project, large tree branches will be redirected to the Green Waste Processing Plant at City Forest for repurposing into valuable products. Additionally, green waste from major institutions will be collected and sent to the facility, under a fixed fee structure.
Astronomical Industries Private Limited has partnered with the IMC to process this waste into sawdust, which will undergo a drying process over 3-4 months, reducing its moisture content by 90%. Once dried, the material will be processed into fine dust particles using cutting-edge machinery, transforming it into a resource for various industries.
The sawdust produced will serve multiple eco-friendly purposes, including being used as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuel sources, crafting durable packing materials to replace plastic, enhancing furniture manufacturing, and even producing biodegradable disposable plates for the food industry. Additionally, the sawdust will be used to create fertilizers that help enrich soil and promote healthier crops for farmers.
The IMC will play a critical role by providing land and transporting green waste to the facility, while Astronomical Industries will manage the installation, operation, and maintenance of the plant. Other private companies have also contributed to waste management in the city by setting up plants like Meghdoot and sub-grade facilities to process garden waste, as well as composting in municipal gardens.
The initiative is set to contribute significantly to improving waste management practices, reducing pollution, and controlling the Air Quality Index (AQI) by offering a sustainable alternative to coal.

Title: Poland and Baltic nations plan to pull out from landmines convention
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:57:04 +0000
Content: NATO members Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia plan to withdraw from the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines due to the military threat from their neighbour Russia, the four countries said on Tuesday.
Quitting the 1997 treaty, which has been ratified or acceded to by more than 160 nations but not by Russia, will allow Poland and the three Baltic countries to start stockpiling landmines again.
“Military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased,” the countries’ defence ministers said in a joint statement.
“With this decision we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs,” they said.
The planned withdrawal was done to allow an effective protection of the region’s borders, Lithuanian Defence Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a separate statement.
Finland said in December it was also considering pulling out of the international agreement because of Russia’s use of such weapons in Ukraine.

Title: India’s agricultural and processed food exports see strong growth in FY2024
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:33:09 +0000
Content: India’s exports of agricultural and processed food products have experienced a significant 13 percent increase, reaching $22.67 billion during the April-February period of the current financial year.
According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, rice exports—including both basmati and non-basmati varieties—saw a substantial 21 percent jump, rising to over $11 billion from $9.32 billion during the same period last year. The increase comes after the government began easing restrictions on rice exports in September 2024, following a strong crop forecast. These restrictions were initially imposed in 2023 to curb domestic food inflation caused by a poor monsoon and crop shortages.
With the restrictions now lifted, rice exports surged by 13.21 percent in February 2025, reaching $1.19 billion compared to $1.05 billion in February 2024.
India’s tea exports have also hit a 10-year high, reaching 255 million kilograms in 2024, despite facing challenges from global geopolitical tensions. The Tea Board of India’s data shows a robust 10 percent increase from the previous year’s 231.69 million kilograms, marking a positive trend for the industry.
The price of Indian tea in international markets also rose by 10 percent, providing much-needed relief to the tea sector, which was affected by adverse weather conditions in 2023. Indian exporters capitalized on market opportunities in West Asia when Sri Lanka’s crop was low, and have successfully maintained strong shipment volumes to those regions.
India is one of the top five tea exporters globally, accounting for about 10 percent of total world tea exports. Its Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri teas are regarded as some of the finest globally, with black tea making up the majority of exports (approximately 96 percent). Other varieties, including regular tea, green tea, herbal tea, masala tea, and lemon tea, also contribute to the country’s diverse tea export portfolio.
India’s major tea export markets include the UAE, Iraq, Iran, Russia, the US, and the UK, and the increase in both export volumes and average prices bodes well for the country’s position as a global leader in tea production and export.

Title: Understanding the collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:17:43 +0000
Content: The fragile peace that had held in Gaza for nearly two months shattered on Tuesday as Israeli airstrikes pummeled the territory, killing more than 400 Palestinians, according to health officials. The renewed violence follows the collapse of a truce that had been in place since January, with both Israel and Hamas blaming each other for its failure.
“This is just the beginning,” warned Israeli officials as plumes of smoke rose over Gaza’s devastated landscape. The return to full-scale hostilities signals the failure of diplomatic efforts that had briefly offered hope for de-escalation in the long-running conflict.
At the core of the ceasefire breakdown is a fundamental impasse between Israel and Hamas. Israel has pursued two primary objectives—securing the release of hostages and dismantling Hamas as a governing force in Gaza. However, these goals have proven to be at odds with one another. The military campaign to eliminate Hamas jeopardizes the safety of the 59 hostages still held captive, complicating negotiations for their release.
Hamas, meanwhile, regards the hostages as its primary leverage in talks. The group has refused to release more captives unless Israel commits to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full military withdrawal from Gaza—conditions that Israel has categorically rejected as long as Hamas remains in power. This deadlock has stalled efforts to move beyond the initial phase of the ceasefire.
The truce, which began on January 19, had initially facilitated a prisoner exchange between the two sides, but it was only meant to be the first step in a broader peace process. The second phase, which was intended to secure a permanent resolution, has failed to progress due to these intractable differences.
Mediators from Egypt and Qatar have attempted to salvage the ceasefire by proposing a phased compromise. Their latest proposal would have Hamas release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander and the remains of four American hostages in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire extension. During this period, approximately half of the remaining hostages would be freed, and negotiations for a lasting truce would continue.
U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff recently visited the region to push for an agreement prioritizing hostage releases before discussions on ending the war. However, he accused Hamas of “publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.” Hamas, in response, insisted that it was simply upholding the original terms of the ceasefire rather than renegotiating a new agreement.
Israel had indicated as early as February that it would not withdraw from key strategic areas in Gaza, a stance that undermined the second phase of the truce agreement. With both sides unwilling to compromise on their core positions, the ceasefire collapsed, giving way to renewed military operations.
The conflict in Gaza is further complicated by rising regional tensions. Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have expressed support for Hamas, have launched attacks on international shipping and targeted Israel. In response, U.S. forces have carried out strikes against Houthi positions. The Houthis claimed to have launched drones at a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though American forces intercepted the attack.
Witkoff has warned that Hamas should take note of these developments, suggesting that further military escalation in the region could have consequences for the group.
Domestic political factors in Israel also play a role in the renewed hostilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced plans to remove his domestic security chief, citing a loss of trust. This marks the third senior security official to leave office in recent weeks, fueling speculation that Netanyahu’s government may be using military escalation to divert attention from ongoing legal and political challenges.
Hamas has accused Israel of abandoning the ceasefire agreement and warned that the remaining hostages face an uncertain fate. However, the group has not officially declared a return to full-scale war, instead calling for renewed international mediation.
With diplomatic efforts at a standstill, the suffering continues for both the hostages still held in Hamas tunnels and the Palestinian civilians enduring relentless bombardment. The international community faces the daunting challenge of bridging a seemingly unbridgeable gap, while the human toll continues to rise in a conflict where neither side appears willing to compromise on its core demands.

Title: Welcome back, Earth missed you: PM Modi hails Sunita Williams’ return
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:38:38 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday hailed NASA astronaut Sunita Williams’s return to Earth and said the achievement of Crew-9 astronauts “shows us what perseverance truly means.”
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Welcome back, #Crew9! The Earth missed you. Your journey has been a true test of grit, courage, and the boundless human spirit. Sunita Williams and the #Crew9 astronauts have once again shown us what perseverance truly means. Their unwavering determination in the face of the vast unknown will forever inspire millions.” 
PM Modi also praised those who worked tirelessly to ensure Williams’ safe return, saying, “Space exploration is about pushing the limits of human potential, daring to dream, and having the courage to turn those dreams into reality. Sunita Williams, a trailblazer and an icon, has exemplified this spirit throughout her career. We are incredibly proud of all those who worked tirelessly to ensure their safe return. They have demonstrated what happens when precision meets passion and technology meets tenacity,” PM Modi added. 
Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two veteran NASA astronauts and retired U.S. Navy test pilots, had launched into space as Starliner’s first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner’s propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a NASA decision to fold them into its crew rotation schedule and return them on a SpaceX craft this year.
On Tuesday, Wilmore and Williams strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
The four-person crew, formally part of NASA’s Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, plunged through Earth’s atmosphere, using its heatshield and two sets of parachutes to slow its orbital speed of 17,000 mph (27,359 kph) to a soft 17 mph at splashdown, which occurred at 5:57 p.m. ET some 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Coast under clear skies.

Title: Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket: Luxon
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:21:56 +0000
Content: New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon shared pictures of him and former New Zealand cricketer Ross Taylor playing ‘gully cricket’ with children in New Delhi.
In a post on X, Luxon said, “Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket,” highlighting the deep-rooted connection both countries share through the sport.
Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was amused by Luxon’s witty remark about the Champions Trophy 2025 final. During his address, Luxon joked that he had intentionally avoided mentioning cricket and the final to prevent a “diplomatic incident.”
“I really appreciate that PM Modi didn’t bring up New Zealand’s Champions Trophy loss to India, and I didn’t mention our Test victories in India. Let’s keep it that way and avoid a diplomatic incident,” Luxon said while PM Modi was seen laughing at the banter.
Taylor was also in attendance and even he was left amused by the banter between the two world leaders during the event.
India defeated New Zealand in the summit clash to claim the Champions Trophy 2025 title in Dubai last month.
Luxon had also praised the Indian cricket team for their dominant display in recent times.
“During PM Modi’s tenure, the men in blue (Indian cricket team) have been the most dominant side in cricket, most recently winning the Champions Trophy in Dubai against my men in black (New Zealand cricket team). They broke many many New Zealanders’ hearts in the process, including mine. I will be the bigger person and just say congratulations,” Luxon said.

Title: Trump releases JFK assassination documents
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:15:37 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump released material related to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday, seeking to honor his campaign promise to provide more transparency about the shock event in Texas.
An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website in the evening with a total of more than 80,000 expected to be published after Justice Department lawyers spent hours scouring them.
The digital documents, including PDFs of previously classified memos, offers a window into the climate of fear at the time surrounding U.S. relations with the Soviet Union shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 nearly led to a nuclear war.
The release is nonetheless likely to intrigue people who have long been fascinated with a dramatic period in history, with the assassination and with Kennedy himself.
Many of the documents reflected the work by investigators to learn more about assassin Lee Harvey Oswald’s time in the Soviet Union and track his movements in the months leading up to Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
An initial review of the papers did not show deviations from the central narrative.
Trump’s secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, has said he believes the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in his uncle’s death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless.
Kennedy Jr. declined comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s grandson, said on X on Tuesday: “The Trump administration did not give anyone in President Kennedy’s family ‘a heads up’ about the release.”
Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard history professor whose books include “JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century 1917-56,” said in an email the new documents may help fill in the picture.
“It’s valuable to get all the documentation out, ideally in unredacted form. But I don’t expect dramatic new revelations that alters in some fundamental way our grasp of the event,” he said.
One document with the heading “secret” was a typed account with handwritten notes of a 1964 interview by a Warren Commission researcher who questioned Lee Wigren, a CIA employee, about inconsistencies in material provided to the commission by the State Department and the CIA about marriages between Soviet women and American men.
Oswald was married to a Soviet woman, Marina Oswald, at the time of the shooting.
Department of Defense documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the U.S. involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s support of communist forces in other countries.
The documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the United States or escalate to the point “that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime.”
“It appears more likely that Castro might intensify his support of subversive forces in Latin America,” the document reads.
One document released from January 1962 reveals details of a top secret project called “Operation Mongoose,” or simply “the Cuban Project,” which was a CIA-led campaign of covert operations and sabotage against Cuba, authorized by Kennedy in 1961, aimed at removing the Castro regime.
Trump signed an order shortly after taking office in January related to the documents release, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to find thousands of new documents related to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas.
In the scramble to comply with Trump’s order, the U.S. Justice Department ordered some of its lawyers who handle sensitive national security matters to urgently review records from the assassination, according to a Monday evening email seen by Reuters.
“President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency,” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in a post on X.
Alice L. George, a historian whose books, including The Assassination of John F. Kennedy, explore modern America, said American’s curiosity about assassinations and questions about government transparency add “to a sense that there must be important evidence hidden away in these files.”
But she said government records were unlikely to resolve questions people still have.
“I think there may continue to be more record releases,” she said. “I seriously doubt that any will include great revelations. The Warren Commission report was done well, but it was done when many of the key players were alive. It’s much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.”
Kennedy’s murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Oswald. The Justice Department and other federal government bodies have reaffirmed that conclusion in the intervening decades. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.
Trump has also promised to release documents on the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were killed in 1968.
Trump has allowed more time to come up with a plan for those releases.

Title: Cabinet approves construction of 6-lane high-speed highway in Maharashtra
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:09:39 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the construction of a six-lane access-controlled Greenfield High-Speed National Highway from JNPA Port (Pagote) to Chowk in Maharashtra. The project, spanning 29.219 km, will be developed under the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) mode at a total capital cost of ₹4,500.62 crore.
The development of road connectivity to major and minor ports in India is a key focus area under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan principles. With the increasing container volume at JNPA Port and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, the need for enhanced National Highway connectivity in the region has been identified.
Currently, it takes 2-3 hours for vehicles to move from JNPA Port to the arterial Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) section of NH-48 and the Mumbai-Pune Expressway due to heavy congestion in urban areas such as Palaspe Phata, D-Point, Kalamboli Junction, and Panvel, with traffic volumes reaching approximately 1.8 lakh Passenger Car Units (PCU) per day. Following the operationalization of Navi Mumbai International Airport in 2025, the demand for direct connectivity is expected to increase further.
The newly approved project aims to address these connectivity challenges and enhance logistics efficiency between JNPA Port and Navi Mumbai International Airport. The highway alignment will commence at JNPA Port (NH 348) in Pagote village and conclude at Mumbai-Pune Highway (NH-48), while also linking the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Mumbai-Goa National Highway (NH-66).
To facilitate smooth movement of commercial vehicles, two tunnels will be constructed through the Sahyadri hills, eliminating the need to navigate the ghat section in the hilly terrain. This design ensures high-speed travel and ease of movement for large container trucks.
The new six-lane Greenfield highway corridor is expected to significantly improve port connectivity, ensuring safe and efficient freight movement.

Title: India’s role in ending Russia-Ukraine War welcomed by Munich Security Conference VC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:50:51 +0000
Content: The Vice Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Rainer Rudolph, has welcomed India’s contribution toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasizing the need to uphold international principles. Speaking on Wednesday, Rudolph described the conflict as a “war of aggression” by one United Nations member against another.
“Any contribution to peacefully end this war is welcome. This is not a conflict; this is a war of aggression by one member of the United Nations against another. It’s these principles that have to be kept in mind when we talk about ending the war peacefully,” Rudolph told ANI on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi.
Reaffirming the importance of safeguarding Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he added, “It’s important to remember that Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be maintained, and it’s the Ukrainians themselves who have to decide their country’s destiny.”
Commenting on the recent speech by United States Vice-President J.D. Vance at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday, Rudolph noted that while he may not entirely agree with Vance’s message to Europeans, it served as a “wake-up call” for the continent to strengthen its foreign policy.
“Obviously, he chose a public event to give his message to the Germans and to the Europeans beyond that, even if at first sight it was a domestic situation in Europe as he saw it, with which maybe I would not always agree with how he presented it. But still, it had a foreign policy effect because it served as a wake-up call to Europeans that we have to invest more in our security and develop a stronger European foreign policy,” he said.
Expressing confidence in the evolving US-Europe relationship, Rudolph remarked, “I think the relationship between Europe and the US will develop. JD Vance also said that, and the administration has since confirmed it. They are still committed to NATO and the alliance. The relationship is changing, and as far as we Europeans are concerned, we will have to contribute our share to common security.”
During the summit, Vance also criticized the tendency to “use cheap labor as a crutch,” arguing that it hampers global innovation.
“Our workers, the populists on the one hand, the tech optimists on the other, have been failed by this government,” Vance said, as reported by Fox News.
He further said, “Not just the government of the last administration, but the government in some ways of the last 40 years, because there were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization.”
Addressing how other nations are gaining ground on the United States, Fox News reported Vance as saying, “Now, we assume that other nations will always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end. We were squeezed from both ends. Now, that was the first conceit of globalization.”

Title: Cabinet approves implementation of Revised Rashtriya Gokul Mission with enhanced allocation for 2024-25 and 2025-26
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:31:30 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Revised Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) to boost growth in the livestock sector. The revised mission will be implemented as a Central Sector component of the Development Programmes scheme, with an additional outlay of ₹1,000 crore, bringing the total allocation to ₹3,400 crore for the 15th Finance Commission cycle from 2021-22 to 2025-26.
Two new activities have been introduced under the revised RGM. The first is a one-time assistance of 35 percent of the capital cost for the establishment of Heifer Rearing Centres, which will help in creating 30 housing facilities with a total of 15,000 heifers. The second initiative aims to encourage farmers to purchase High Genetic Merit (HGM) IVF heifers by providing a 3 percent interest subvention on loans taken from milk unions, financial institutions, or banks for such purchases. This will facilitate the systematic induction of high-yielding breeds.
The scheme will continue its core activities, including strengthening semen stations and artificial insemination networks, implementing bull production and accelerated breed improvement programs using sex-sorted semen, supporting skill development and farmer awareness initiatives, and establishing Centres of Excellence while reinforcing Central Cattle Breeding Farms.
With the implementation of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission and other government efforts, milk production has increased by 63.55 percent over the past decade. The availability of milk per capita, which stood at 307 grams per day in 2013-14, has risen to 471 grams per day in 2023-24. Productivity has also improved by 26.34 percent in the last ten years.
The Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) under RGM provides free artificial insemination at farmers’ doorsteps in 605 districts across the country where baseline AI coverage was below 50 percent. To date, over 8.39 crore animals have been covered, and 5.21 crore farmers have benefitted. RGM has also been at the forefront of introducing advanced breeding technologies to farmers. A total of 22 in vitro fertilization (IVF) labs have been set up under State Livestock Boards or universities, leading to the birth of 2,541 high-genetic-merit calves.
Additionally, the development of Gau Chip and Mahish Chip, genomic chips for indigenous bovines created by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the ICAR National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), along with Gau Sort, an indigenously developed sex-sorted semen production technology, marks a significant milestone in India’s self-reliance in dairy technology.

Title: Cabinet approves Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:30:11 +0000
Content: The union cabinet on Wednesday approved the incentive scheme for the promotion of low-value BHIM-UPI transactions (P2M) for the financial year 2024-25. The scheme is designed to encourage the adoption of the BHIM-UPI platform among small merchants and aligns with the government’s broader vision of transitioning towards a less-cash economy.
The initiative, with an estimated outlay of Rs 1,500 crore, will be implemented from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. The focus will be on low-value UPI transactions, specifically those under Rs 2,000, conducted by small merchants.
Under the scheme, small merchants will receive an incentive of 0.15% per transaction for transactions up to Rs 2,000, while large merchants will not be eligible for this incentive. For each quarter, 80% of the admitted claim amount will be disbursed without any conditions. However, the remaining 20% will be contingent upon meeting specific performance criteria. This includes maintaining a technical decline rate of less than 0.75% and ensuring system uptime greater than 99.5%.
The scheme is designed to improve financial access for small merchants, offering them greater opportunities to use digital payment solutions that can enhance cash flow and credit access. Citizens will also benefit from seamless UPI transactions with no additional charges, further encouraging the adoption of digital payments across the country. By promoting the use of UPI services like UPI 123PAY and UPI Lite, the scheme aims to reduce reliance on cash, particularly in rural and remote areas, while also contributing to the goal of financial inclusion.
The government’s objectives for this scheme include promoting the indigenous BHIM-UPI platform, with a target transaction volume of ₹20,000 crore in FY 2024-25. It also aims to strengthen the digital payment infrastructure, especially in underserved areas, and support the wider adoption of secure and reliable payment solutions.

Title: Cabinet approves revised ₹2,790 crore dairy development scheme to boost infrastructure
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:21:51 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Revised National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD), aimed at modernizing India’s dairy sector and ensuring its long-term growth. The scheme, classified as a Central Sector initiative, has been allocated an additional ₹1,000 crore, taking the total budget outlay to ₹2,790 crore for the duration of the 15th Finance Commission period from 2021-22 to 2025-26.
The revised programme is focused on strengthening the dairy infrastructure across the country. It seeks to boost milk procurement and processing capacity, improve quality control systems, and ensure better market access for dairy farmers. The initiative is designed to encourage value addition in the sector, streamline supply chain efficiency, and ultimately raise rural incomes, particularly benefiting women, who represent 70% of India’s dairy workforce.
The revised NPDD is structured around two key components. The first focuses on developing essential dairy infrastructure, including the establishment of milk chilling plants, advanced milk testing laboratories, and certification systems. It also prioritizes the formation of new village-level dairy cooperative societies and aims to bolster milk procurement and processing capacities, particularly in the North Eastern Region, hilly areas, Union Territories, and other remote regions. This component also includes financial support for the formation of two new Milk Producer Companies (MPCs).
The second component, known as “Dairying through Cooperatives (DTC),” continues efforts to sustainably develop dairy cooperatives. This component is being implemented in partnership with the Government of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under existing agreements. It targets improving dairy production, processing, and marketing infrastructure in nine states: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
Since its inception, the NPDD has had a considerable socio-economic impact. The scheme has benefited over 18.74 lakh farmers and generated more than 30,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities. It has increased milk procurement capacity by an additional 100.95 lakh litres per day.
The programme has also led to the strengthening of over 51,777 village-level milk testing laboratories and the installation of 5,123 bulk milk coolers with a combined capacity of 123.33 lakh litres. Additionally, 169 laboratories have been equipped with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) milk analysers, and 232 dairy plants have adopted advanced adulteration detection systems.
Under the revised NPDD, the government aims to establish 10,000 new Dairy Cooperative Societies and form two new Milk Producer Companies. The initiative is projected to generate an additional 3.2 lakh employment opportunities and further promote the use of advanced technology and quality testing infrastructure in the dairy sector.

Title: World Sparrow Day: Saving the ‘Goraiya’ to restore ecological balance
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:14:01 +0000
Content: World Sparrow Day, celebrated annually on March 20, aims to raise awareness about the alarming decline in sparrow populations due to urbanization, pollution, and habitat loss.
The day also promotes crucial conservation efforts to protect these small but vital birds, which play a key role in maintaining ecological balance.
Launched in 2010 by the bird conservation group “Nature Forever,” World Sparrow Day now spans over 50 countries, highlighting the urgent need to reverse the decline of sparrows. These birds are essential to ecosystems, controlling insect populations, aiding in pollination, and dispersing seeds—functions vital to both rural and urban environments.
According to a 2018 report by the Royal Society of London, the relationship between humans and sparrows dates back 11,000 years, illustrating their long-standing presence in our shared history.
In India, sparrows, known by various names such as “Goraiya” (Hindi), “Kuruvi” (Tamil), and “Chirya” (Urdu), are facing a sharp population decline.
Several factors, including the use of unleaded petrol that produces toxic compounds harmful to insects sparrows feed on, as well as pesticide use that reduces insect populations, have impacted their food supply. Additionally, rapid urbanization has led to the loss of nesting spaces in modern buildings, further shrinking their habitat.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change issued a statement underscoring the importance of World Sparrow Day, emphasizing that small actions—such as planting greenery, reducing pesticide use, and creating safe nesting spaces—can collectively support sparrow conservation.
Grassroots initiatives across India are already making strides. In Chennai, the Koodugal Trust has involved schoolchildren in building sparrow nests, resulting in over 10,000 nests between 2020 and 2024, significantly boosting local sparrow numbers.
In Mysuru, the “Early Bird” campaign educates children on the importance of sparrows through birdwatching trips, libraries, and village visits, fostering appreciation for these birds.
In 2012, the Delhi government declared the house sparrow as the state bird, marking its symbolic importance in the capital.
Several individuals are also contributing to sparrow conservation. The “Save the Sparrow” campaign, led by environmental conservationist Jagat Kinkhabwala, gained significant momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi supported it in 2017.
Rajya Sabha MP Brij Lal has built 50 nests at his home, where sparrows now return to lay eggs—a commitment praised by PM Modi as an exemplary initiative in the fight to protect sparrows.

Title: Sensex, Nifty extend gains for third straight session; midcap stocks outperform
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:40:17 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets maintained their upward momentum for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty closing higher.
The 30-share BSE Sensex touched an intra-day high of 75,568.38 before ending at 75,449.05, up 147.79 points or 0.20 per cent from the previous close. Similarly, the broader Nifty settled at 22,907.60, rising 73.30 points or 0.32 per cent. The index moved within a range of 22,940.70 and 22,807.95 during the session.
“Market sentiment remained buoyant, supported by mixed global cues and renewed optimism over a potential Russia-Ukraine truce,” said Vikram Kasat, Head of Advisory at PL Capital. He added that key global events, including the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, anticipated talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and former US President Donald Trump, and a surge in gold prices, also kept investors on edge.
Out of the Nifty 50 stocks, 33 closed in the green. Shriram Finance, HDFC Life, Apollo Hospitals, Tata Steel, and Power Grid Corporation were among the top gainers, posting gains of up to 3.91 per cent. Conversely, Tech Mahindra, Britannia, TCS, Infosys, and Sun Pharma were among the 17 laggards, with losses of up to 2.32 per cent.
Broader market indices outperformed the benchmarks. The Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 indices each rallied over 2 per cent, reflecting strong buying interest in mid- and small-cap stocks.
Sector-wise, most indices on the NSE closed in positive territory, except for FMCG and IT, which ended lower.
The markets opened on a flat but slightly positive note on Wednesday, even as global markets showed signs of weakness. At the opening bell, the Sensex rose by 80.04 points or 0.11 per cent to 75,381.30, while the Nifty edged up by 15.25 points or 0.07 per cent to 22,849.55.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee strengthened by 12 paise, closing at 86.44 against the US dollar, compared to the previous session’s close of 86.56.

Title: S. Jaishankar stresses importance of national security in business decisions at Raisina Dialogue
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:36:38 +0000
Content: National security has become a critical factor in business decisions, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital age, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Wednesday.
Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi during a session titled “Commissars and Capitalists: Politics, Business, and the New World Order,” Jaishankar highlighted that the swift changes in the global business landscape are increasingly shaped by national security concerns.
He noted that this growing awareness of security risks is now influencing economic decisions across industries worldwide.
“In the digital era, business decisions are increasingly being made with national security in mind, in a way that was not the case before,” Jaishankar explained. “There are different ways of dealing with weaponization. One is to stay on the right side of the weapon, so you don’t get hit while others do. But the reality is that today, the world makes business decisions factoring in national security like never before.”
Jaishankar suggested that these changes do not necessitate the creation of entirely alternative systems for critical industries like telecommunications or international couriers. Rather, he stressed the importance of collaborating with like-minded nations and partners who share similar security goals.
“Sometimes, you may find yourself compelled to create alternative systems, but I would argue that this is more of an aberration than a strategic desire to replace the existing systems,” he said. “If we can make the current systems work for us, it is the smarter choice.”
The minister also highlighted the importance of trust and reliability in today’s business relationships, especially in the digital era. He pointed out that partnerships in sectors like telecommunications are now defined more by comfort and security than by cost alone. “In the digital era, it’s not just about cost; it’s about comfort. It’s about trust. When making business decisions, we want to engage with those who ensure resilience, reliability, trust, and transparency,” Jaishankar added. “You want to do business with those who are secure.”
Jaishankar’s comments come amid the announcement of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet satellite service, which is set to launch in India. Starlink has partnered with major telecom players Jio and Bharti Airtel for the launch, but Jaishankar emphasized the importance of carefully assessing potential risks when forming business partnerships.
“Every partner offers some risks, yes, but you would rather take the risks with those whose interests align with yours, rather than those with whom your interests may clash,” he said.
In addition, Jaishankar discussed India’s ongoing trade negotiations with its key global partners, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. He underlined the importance of these relationships for India’s economic growth and technology partnerships. “India is currently engaged in three major trade negotiations with the EU, UK, and the US, these are our growth markets, these are our technology partners,” Jaishankar said.

Title: IOC session starts in Greece, president Bach presides for the last time
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:35:39 +0000
Content: The opening day of the 144th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session got underway in Greece on Wednesday (March 19), with the imminent presidential election looming large.
Outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach welcomed the members to the Greek town of Pylos and prepared to present a report ahead of Thursday’s election.
The candidates to replace Bach include international cycling chief David Lappartient, current IOC vice-president Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe, multiple Olympic swimming champion Kirsty Coventry, who is Zimbabwe’s sports minister, and Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan.
International Gymnastics Federation head Morinari Watanabe and Olympic newcomer and multimillionaire Johan Eliasch, who heads the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, complete the list.
While there is no clear front-runner, as was the case in 2013 when then-favourite Bach swept to victory, Coe, Samaranch and Coventry, long seen as Bach’s preferred choice, are considered to have an edge over the other candidates.
Just over 100 IOC members, including federation chiefs, national Olympic committee presidents, royalty and billionaires among others, will cast their votes on Thursday.
The new president is elected on an eight-year term with the possibility of re-election to a second four-year term for a maximum of 12 years in total.

Title: Google charged with breaching landmark EU rules, Apple told to open up to rivals
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:31:59 +0000
Content: Alphabet unit Google was hit with two charges of breaching landmark EU rules on Wednesday while Apple was ordered to help rivals connect with its iPhones and iPads, as antitrust regulators continued a crackdown against Big Tech.
The move by the European Commission came amid tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries which impose fines on U.S. companies.
Both Google and Apple have been in the European Commission’s crosshairs since March last year over concerns that they may not be complying with the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in the power of Big Tech via a list of dos and don’ts.
The Google case centred on whether it restricts app developers from informing users about offers outside its app store Google Play and whether it favours its vertical search services such as Google Flights in Google Search.
The EU competition watchdog on Wednesday issued preliminary findings charging Google of DMA violations in both areas, confirming a Reuters story on Feb. 21.
The Commission also issued two orders to Apple to open up its ecosystem to rivals, six months after it opened so-called specification proceedings against the iPhone maker.
The first charge in the Google case focused on the company’s practices on its app store Google Play. Alphabet technically prevents app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels for better offers, regulators said.
A service fee charged by the company for facilitating the initial acquisition of a new customer by an app developer via Google Play goes beyond what is justified, they added.
In the second charge, regulators said Google favoured its own services such as Google Shopping, Google Hotels and Google Flights over rivals.
Google pushed back, saying that EU competition rules are hurting consumers and businesses.
“The Commission’s findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of Search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses,” Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director, Competition, said in a blogpost.
He said if the company can’t charge reasonable fees to support the ongoing development of Android and the Play services, then it cannot invest in an open platform.
EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement that the measures “ensure that Alphabet abides by EU rules when it comes to two services widely used by businesses and consumers across the EU, Google Search and Android phones.”

Title: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s helicopter rides cost taxpayers over ₹31 crore
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:01:37 +0000
Content: Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s extensive use of helicopter travel has sparked controversy, with official records revealing that his chopper expenses amounted to ₹12.65 crore in 2023-24 and ₹19.35 crore in 2024-25, up to January 15, 2025.
What has drawn further criticism is Siddaramaiah’s preference for helicopters even for short distances, such as Mysuru, which is just a 1.5-hour drive from Bengaluru. According to government documents tabled in the legislative assembly, ₹10.85 lakh was spent on a helicopter ride to Mysuru, despite the short travel time by road.
In response to a question raised by JD(S) MLC T.N. Javarayigowda in the Legislative Council regarding the Chief Minister’s use of jets and flights, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) confirmed that Siddaramaiah had opted for chopper travel even for nearby destinations like Mysuru.
The documents further reveal that the Chief Minister booked charter flights to destinations such as Delhi and Chennai, which are well-connected by commercial airlines. One instance highlighted a charter flight to Delhi that cost ₹44.40 lakh, while a business-class round-trip ticket on a commercial airline would have been approximately ₹70,000.
BJP leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar criticized Siddaramaiah’s travel expenses, alleging that the state’s financial priorities were misplaced. He accused the government of allocating significant funds for the Chief Minister’s private jets while development, farmer welfare, and infrastructure projects faced financial constraints.
“Wah @siddaramaiahavare wah! @RahulGandhi’s ‘paradigm change’ governance in full flow in Karnataka—No money for development, No money for farmers, No money for infra, but plenty of money for CM’s private jets and plenty of land to be grabbed,” Chandrasekhar posted on X.
Earlier in the day, a delegation of Karnataka BJP leaders met Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot at Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum against the state government’s Bills.

Title: TRAI tightens regulations to control spam calls, reduces action time against unregistered telemarketers
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:26:20 +0000
Content: In a decisive step to tackle the rising problem of spam calls, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, according to an official statement from the Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The updated regulations, announced on February 12, introduce stricter measures to strengthen customer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC).
Key highlights of the amendment include:
Extended Complaint Window: Customers can now file complaints about spam/UCC within 7 days of receiving the communication, an extension from the previous 3-day limit.
Reduced Action Time: The time frame for access providers to take action against unregistered senders of spam has been significantly reduced from 30 days to just 5 days, ensuring quicker response times.
Stricter Criteria for Action: TRAI has revised the threshold for triggering action against spam senders. Previously, action would be taken after 10 complaints were filed against a sender within 7 days. The new rule lowers this threshold to 5 complaints within 10 days.
These changes will take effect 30 days after their publication in the Official Gazette, with certain regulations coming into force after 60 days.
Additionally, TRAI had previously issued directions on August 13, 2024, mandating the disconnection of all telecom resources used by unregistered telemarketers (UTMs) for making spam calls. Since then, telecom operators have implemented widespread actions, leading to a notable decrease in complaints against UTMs—from 1,89,419 complaints in August 2024 to 1,34,821 in January 2025. Over 1,150 entities and individuals have been blacklisted, and more than 18.8 lakh telecom resources have been disconnected.

Content: President Vladimir Putin wants U.S. President Donald Trump to formally recognise all four Ukrainian regions that Moscow has claimed as its own in addition to Crimea, Russia’s Kommersant daily reported.
Citing unnamed sources who attended a private business event with Putin on Tuesday, Kommersant said that Putin wanted the U.S. to formally recognise the four regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – as part of Russia along with Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014.
Russia, though advancing on the battlefield, does not fully control any of the four regions.
In return for recognition and if it happened “in the near future”, Kommersant said Putin would undertake not to lay claim to the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and other Ukrainian territory.
Asked about the Kommersant report on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Trump had not discussed the idea on their call on Tuesday.
But he confirmed, without elaborating, that Putin had discussed the conflict in Ukraine at Tuesday’s closed door meeting with members of Russia’s business elite.
Peskov did not confirm, however, whether Putin had floated the idea of the U.S. recognising the four regions in addition to Crimea at the meeting.

Title: ‘Kavach 4.0’ to equip 10,000 locomotives in the next phase: Ashwini Vaishnaw
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:35:47 +0000
Content: India’s cutting-edge automatic train protection system called ‘Kavach 4.0’ is on track to equip 10,000 locomotives in the next phase (the project has been finalised), and 69 loco sheds have been prepared for the installation of the system, the government informed on Wednesday.
Bids for trackside works of Kavach for approximately 15,000 route kilometres (RKm) have been invited, covering all GQ, GD, HDN, and identified sections of Indian Railways, out of which works for 1,865 RKm have been awarded, Union Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.
“Currently, three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are approved for the supply of the Kavach System. To enhance capacity and expand implementation, trials and approvals for additional OEMs are at various stages,” said the minister.
Specialised training programmes on Kavach are being conducted at centralised training institutes of Indian Railways to impart training to all concerned officials.
“By now, more than 20,000 technicians, operators, and engineers have been trained on Kavach technology. Courses have been designed in collaboration with IRISET,” Vaishnaw informed.
The cost for the provision of trackside infrastructure, including station equipment of Kavach, is approximately ₹50 lakh per kilometre, while the cost for installing Kavach equipment on locomotives is approximately ₹80 lakh per locomotive.
“The funds utilised for Kavach works so far amount to ₹1,950 crore. The allocated funds for the year 2024-25 amount to ₹1,112.57 crore. Necessary funds are allocated based on project progress,” the minister noted.
Kavach is an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system that assists the Loco Pilot in operating the train within specified speed limits by automatically applying brakes if the Loco Pilot fails to do so. It also ensures safe train operations during inclement weather conditions.
Major improvements in Kavach Version 4.0 include enhanced location accuracy, improved signal aspect information in larger yards, station-to-station Kavach interface via OFC, and direct integration with the existing Electronic Interlocking System.
“Kavach version 4.0 covers all the major features required for the diverse railway network. This is a significant milestone in safety for Indian Railways. Within a short period, IR has developed, tested, and started deploying the Automatic Train Protection System,” informed the minister.

Title: Cabinet approves construction of 6-lane high-speed highway in Maharashtra
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:09:39 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the construction of a six-lane access-controlled Greenfield High-Speed National Highway from JNPA Port (Pagote) to Chowk in Maharashtra. The project, spanning 29.219 km, will be developed under the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) mode at a total capital cost of ₹4,500.62 crore.
The development of road connectivity to major and minor ports in India is a key focus area under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan principles. With the increasing container volume at JNPA Port and the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, the need for enhanced National Highway connectivity in the region has been identified.
Currently, it takes 2-3 hours for vehicles to move from JNPA Port to the arterial Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) section of NH-48 and the Mumbai-Pune Expressway due to heavy congestion in urban areas such as Palaspe Phata, D-Point, Kalamboli Junction, and Panvel, with traffic volumes reaching approximately 1.8 lakh Passenger Car Units (PCU) per day. Following the operationalization of Navi Mumbai International Airport in 2025, the demand for direct connectivity is expected to increase further.
The newly approved project aims to address these connectivity challenges and enhance logistics efficiency between JNPA Port and Navi Mumbai International Airport. The highway alignment will commence at JNPA Port (NH 348) in Pagote village and conclude at Mumbai-Pune Highway (NH-48), while also linking the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Mumbai-Goa National Highway (NH-66).
To facilitate smooth movement of commercial vehicles, two tunnels will be constructed through the Sahyadri hills, eliminating the need to navigate the ghat section in the hilly terrain. This design ensures high-speed travel and ease of movement for large container trucks.
The new six-lane Greenfield highway corridor is expected to significantly improve port connectivity, ensuring safe and efficient freight movement.

Title: India’s role in ending Russia-Ukraine War welcomed by Munich Security Conference VC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:50:51 +0000
Content: The Vice Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Rainer Rudolph, has welcomed India’s contribution toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasizing the need to uphold international principles. Speaking on Wednesday, Rudolph described the conflict as a “war of aggression” by one United Nations member against another.
“Any contribution to peacefully end this war is welcome. This is not a conflict; this is a war of aggression by one member of the United Nations against another. It’s these principles that have to be kept in mind when we talk about ending the war peacefully,” Rudolph told ANI on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi.
Reaffirming the importance of safeguarding Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he added, “It’s important to remember that Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be maintained, and it’s the Ukrainians themselves who have to decide their country’s destiny.”
Commenting on the recent speech by United States Vice-President J.D. Vance at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday, Rudolph noted that while he may not entirely agree with Vance’s message to Europeans, it served as a “wake-up call” for the continent to strengthen its foreign policy.
“Obviously, he chose a public event to give his message to the Germans and to the Europeans beyond that, even if at first sight it was a domestic situation in Europe as he saw it, with which maybe I would not always agree with how he presented it. But still, it had a foreign policy effect because it served as a wake-up call to Europeans that we have to invest more in our security and develop a stronger European foreign policy,” he said.
Expressing confidence in the evolving US-Europe relationship, Rudolph remarked, “I think the relationship between Europe and the US will develop. JD Vance also said that, and the administration has since confirmed it. They are still committed to NATO and the alliance. The relationship is changing, and as far as we Europeans are concerned, we will have to contribute our share to common security.”
During the summit, Vance also criticized the tendency to “use cheap labor as a crutch,” arguing that it hampers global innovation.
“Our workers, the populists on the one hand, the tech optimists on the other, have been failed by this government,” Vance said, as reported by Fox News.
He further said, “Not just the government of the last administration, but the government in some ways of the last 40 years, because there were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization.”
Addressing how other nations are gaining ground on the United States, Fox News reported Vance as saying, “Now, we assume that other nations will always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end. We were squeezed from both ends. Now, that was the first conceit of globalization.”
