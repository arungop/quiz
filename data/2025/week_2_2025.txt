Title: India’s demand for petroleum products expected to rise by 4%: report
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:11:26 +0000
Content: India’s demand for petroleum products, including petrol, diesel, and LPG, is projected to increase by 3-4% in the current financial year ending March 31, 2025, according to a report by Fitch Ratings.
The growth is attributed to rising consumer demand, industrial expansion, and infrastructure development, the report noted.
For India’s oil marketing companies (OMCs), refinery margins are expected to decline below their mid-cycle levels in FY25, driven by weaker product cracks, regional oversupply, and reduced gains from price differentials between crude oil varieties.
However, the report highlighted that marketing margins would improve compared to FY24 due to lower Brent crude oil prices this fiscal year. “This improvement will help offset the pressure from reduced refining margins for oil marketing companies. Pure refiners, such as HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL, BB+/Stable), will face greater profitability challenges,” the report said.
Fitch expects refining margins to recover to mid-cycle levels in FY26 as regional oversupply eases and Brent crude prices align with Fitch’s projections. It also anticipates that marketing margins will remain supportive. HMEL, which has limited rating headroom in FY25, is likely to see its position improve in FY26 as refining margins normalize.
For upstream companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL), profits are expected to decline due to subdued production levels and lower crude oil prices. Domestic gas prices from older fields are forecast to remain capped at $6.5/MMBTU in the second half of FY25, as they are determined by a formula pegged to 10% of crude oil prices.
India’s overall oil and gas production is anticipated to remain flat in FY25. Crude oil output is expected to drop by 2-3%, as upstream companies continue to combat natural declines in production from ageing fields despite deploying technology to improve recovery rates and access isolated reservoirs.
Production is projected to grow modestly in FY26, supported by increased output from ONGC’s eastern offshore KG Basin and privately owned fields, the report added.
India’s dependency on crude oil imports is expected to rise in the short term, as the growth in demand for petroleum products outpaces the increase in domestic crude oil production.

Title: CII pushes for employment policies, labour reforms, and boosting women workforce in Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:05:49 +0000
Content: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to prioritize employment generation, implementation of labour reforms, and increased participation of women in the workforce in the upcoming Union Budget 2025-26, set to be presented on February 1.
Highlighting the potential of India’s demographic dividend, CII proposed an integrated National Employment Policy to unify the numerous employment-focused initiatives currently under various ministries and state governments. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of CII, emphasized the need to align employment generation with higher productivity. “India stands at a unique juncture where its demographic dividend presents a tremendous opportunity to propel economic growth and social transformation,” Banerjee said, suggesting that the Budget establish an expert committee to analyze productivity metrics and recommend solutions.
CII also advocated for a single integrated employment portal under the National Career Service (NCS), enhanced with a Universal Labour Information Management System (ULIMS). This system would provide detailed insights into job opportunities, skills demand, and training programs aligned with future projections.
To further boost job creation, the industry body recommended a new section replacing Section 80JJAA to incentivize new employment. The proposal includes a tax deduction for businesses hiring new employees, applicable for the first three years of employment, capped at Rs. 1 lakh per month per employee.
Targeted support for labour-intensive sectors such as construction, textiles, tourism, and low-skilled manufacturing was another key recommendation. CII also stressed the importance of aligning tariff structures, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to boost exports from labour-intensive industries, thereby generating employment.
For rural areas, CII suggested launching an internship program in government offices to engage college-educated youth, which could enhance manpower resources for implementing government initiatives.
Addressing the low female workforce participation rate, CII called for gender-sensitive policies and initiatives such as government-supported creches in industrial clusters, dormitories built with CSR funds, and formalization of the care economy. These measures, CII stated, could significantly improve economic empowerment for women.
The organization also recommended rolling out labour codes with a focus on providing social security for gig and platform workers, further strengthening the employment landscape.
CII proposed the establishment of an International Mobility Authority under the Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate overseas employment opportunities for Indian youth. This authority could collaborate with the Ministry of Skill Development to design training programs that align with global market needs, including cultural orientation and foreign language skills.

Title: AI can spot patients at risk for suicide, finds study
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:44:37 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors identify patients at risk for suicide, potentially improving prevention efforts in routine medical settings, according to new research.
The research, reported in the journal JAMA Network Open, compared two approaches — automatic pop-up alerts that interrupted the doctor’s workflow versus a more passive system that simply displayed risk information in the patient’s electronic chart.
The team found that the interruptive alerts were far more effective, leading doctors to conduct suicide risk assessments in connection with 42 per cent of screening alerts, compared to just 4 per cent with the passive system.
Colin Walsh, associate professor of biomedical informatics, medicine, and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted that most people who die by suicide have seen a health care provider in the year before their death, often for reasons unrelated to mental health.
The team tested their AI system, called the Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood model (VSAIL), to determine whether it could effectively prompt doctors in three neurology clinics to screen patients for suicide risk during routine visits.
“Universal screening isn’t practical in every setting. We developed VSAIL to help identify high-risk patients and prompt focused screening conversations,” said Walsh.
The VSAIL model analyses routine information from electronic health records to calculate a patient’s 30-day risk of suicide attempt.
The researchers suggested that similar systems could be tested in other medical settings.
Health care systems need to balance the effectiveness of interruptive alerts against their potential downsides, Walsh said.
“The findings indicate that automated risk detection, when paired with thoughtfully designed alerts, has the potential to significantly improve suicide prevention efforts,” the authors concluded.
Studies have shown that 77 per cent of people who die by suicide have contact with primary care providers in the year before their death.

Title: PM Modi takes dig at AAP, says ‘Delhi witnessed ‘AAP-DA’ in name of state government
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:20:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged Delhi’s voters to give the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a chance in the 2025 Delhi assembly elections, taking a sharp swipe at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. He labeled the AAP’s governance in Delhi over the past decade as a “tragedy,” coining the term “AAP-DA” to describe it.
Speaking at the ‘Parivartan Rally’ held at Japanese Park in Rohini, PM Modi called on Delhiites to embrace change for the capital’s bright future. “We need to develop Delhi into the capital of Viksit Bharat. In the last 10 years, the government that Delhi has witnessed is no less than an ‘AAP-DA.’ Now, the voice of the people is clear: ‘AAP-DA nahi sahenge, badal ke rahenge.’ Delhi wants development, and its people trust the BJP,” he said.
Highlighting BJP’s vision for Delhi, PM Modi underscored the importance of the next 25 years for India’s journey toward becoming a developed nation. “The coming 25 years are crucial, not just for Delhi but for the entire country. These years will witness India transform into a global economic powerhouse, and Delhi’s contribution is essential in this mission of Viksit Bharat,” he said.
The Prime Minister also shared details of development projects worth thousands of crores of rupees that he had inaugurated earlier in the day, emphasizing BJP’s commitment to progress and modernization. “India is on the brink of becoming the world’s third-largest economy. This new age of modernization will bring unprecedented opportunities, and Delhi must play a pivotal role in this transformation,” he added.
PM Modi asserted that the BJP’s governance model is rooted in good governance, development, and citizen welfare. “Delhi desires development, and I am delighted to see the trust its people place in the BJP. Our party is dedicated to service, fulfills dreams, and is committed to the welfare of every citizen,” he said.
Citing examples from other states like Haryana and Odisha, where the BJP has secured consecutive full-majority governments, PM Modi expressed confidence in the party’s prospects in Delhi. He encouraged BJP workers to connect with voters, share the party’s vision, and highlight its achievements. “Once people trust the BJP, they continue to support it. I am confident that Delhi will bless us again, and the BJP’s lotus will bloom in the assembly elections,” he added.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi interacted with schoolchildren during a ride on the Namo Bharat train, which he inaugurated. The new section of the high-speed corridor connects Delhi with Meerut, marking a significant milestone in public transport and mobility for the National Capital.

Title: Former Greek Prime Minister Simitis dies aged 88
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:15:02 +0000
Content: Former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who ushered the country into the European Union’s single currency in 2001, died on Sunday aged 88 at his summer house in the Peloponnese.
“With sadness and respect, I bid farewell to Costas Simitis, a worthy and noble political opponent, but also the Prime Minister who accompanied Greece in its great national steps,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement.
The government proclaimed four days of mourning and said his funeral will be at the state’s expense, Greek state news agency reported.
Simitis, a law professor and a reformist, assumed leadership of the PASOK socialist party in 1996 and was prime minister until 2004.
Simitis had been vacationing at his summer residence close to Athens in the Peloponnese in recent days. He was transferred unconscious to the hospital early in the morning where his death was confirmed, the director of the Corinth hospital told local media.
During his government, Simitis reduced the budget deficit and public debt to make Athens qualify for euro zone membership.
In 2012, three years after the Greek debt crisis erupted, he published a book criticising the handling of the crisis by Greek politicians and the EU.
In that book, called “Derailment”, he also accused the European Commission of turning a blind eye to overspending by his conservative successor.

Title: Digital data protection rules to empower citizens, curb harms: Govt
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 09:50:36 +0000
Content: The draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules aim to safeguard citizens’ rights for the protection of their personal data and address specific challenges like unauthorized commercial use of data and digital harms, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said on Friday.
The rules aim to give citizens greater control over their personal data by introducing provisions for informed consent, data erasure rights, and an effective grievance redressal mechanism. Parents and guardians are also empowered to ensure online safety for their children, the official statement explained.
Designed to empower citizens in a rapidly growing digital economy, the rules strive to achieve the right balance between regulation and innovation, ensuring that the benefits of India’s growing innovation ecosystem are accessible to all citizens and contribute to the country’s digital economy, the statement added.
Data Fiduciaries—entities responsible for handling personal data—are required to provide clear and accessible information about how data is processed, enabling citizens to make informed decisions. The framework places citizens at the core of the data protection system.
The statement highlights that India’s model strikes a unique balance between fostering innovation and protecting personal data. Unlike restrictive global frameworks, these rules encourage economic growth while prioritizing citizen welfare. Stakeholders view this as a potential global template for data governance.
The framework also aims to reduce compliance burdens for smaller businesses and startups. An adequate transition period will be provided to ensure all stakeholders, from small enterprises to large corporations, can smoothly adapt to the new law, the statement said.
Embracing a “digital by design” philosophy, the rules focus on consent mechanisms, grievance redressal, and the functioning of the Data Protection Board, all aimed at ensuring ease of living and ease of doing business. The Board will operate as a digital office, with a platform and app enabling citizens to file complaints digitally and have them adjudicated without requiring physical presence, the statement explained.
From processing complaints to interacting with Data Fiduciaries, workflows are optimized to ensure speed and transparency, reflecting India’s forward-looking approach to governance and fostering trust between citizens and data handlers.
Graded responsibilities outlined in the rules cater to startups and MSMEs with a lower compliance burden, while Significant Data Fiduciaries have higher obligations. Sector-specific data protection measures can complement the core personal data protection framework established by the Act and its rules.
The Data Protection Board’s digital-first approach is expected to ensure quick and transparent resolution of complaints. While imposing penalties for defaults, the Board is required to consider factors such as the nature and gravity of violations and efforts made to mitigate their impact.
Additionally, Data Fiduciaries may voluntarily offer undertakings during proceedings, which, if accepted by the Board, could lead to the proceedings being dropped. This mechanism balances the need to protect citizens’ rights with a fair adjudicatory process for entities handling personal data.
The draft rules are based on extensive inputs from various stakeholders and a study of global best practices. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has invited feedback and comments from the public and stakeholders until February 18 through the MyGov platform, in line with the government’s commitment to an inclusive approach to law-making.
Meanwhile, the government is planning a comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities under the new framework, fostering a culture of data responsibility.

Title: TRUST Scholarship amount row: TN rural students seek raise
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:07:54 +0000
Content: The parents of students appearing for the Tamil Nadu Rural Students Talent Search (TRUST) exam have called for an increase in the scholarship amount provided to beneficiaries.
Currently, students who clear the TRUST exam receive a scholarship of ₹1,000 per year for four consecutive years, until they complete Class 12.
The exam, designed to encourage rural students in Class 9 to complete their school education, is limited to those whose parents earn less than ₹1 lakh annually.
The 2023 TRUST exam, initially scheduled for December 14, was postponed to February 1 due to heavy rain across several districts, according to a notification by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examination (DGE).
There has been widespread criticism regarding the meagre ₹1,000 annual scholarship. Rajarathinam, the father of a Class 9 student, said, “Without proper incentives, students are not motivated to study for the exam. ₹1,000 per year hardly qualifies as a scholarship.”
Similarly, M.K. Ushakumari from Erode remarked, “Students lack the enthusiasm to write the exam because the annual scholarship of ₹1,000 is too small.”
Teachers have also raised concerns about inadequate preparation resources and training for the exam.
Palaniappan Rajagopal, a mathematics teacher from a government school in Nagercoil, stated, “While algebra is introduced in Class 8, the exam asks more complex questions. Relying solely on outdated question papers is insufficient.”
Currently, Tamil-medium students rely on outdated PDF reference materials, whereas English-medium students do not have access to such resources. In addition, many students from low-income families face challenges in accessing smartphones and the Internet for exam preparation.
Stakeholders are urging the Tamil Nadu government to increase the budget allocation for the TRUST scholarship programme. Teachers have pointed out the need for modern study materials, updated syllabi, and special training sessions to better prepare students for the exam.
The TRUST exam, introduced in 1991 by the government in collaboration with the School Education Department and Rural Development, aims to support rural students in completing their schooling. The exam covers topics from the Class 8 syllabus but is administered to students from Classes 9 to 12 in government-recognised rural schools.
Subjects include mathematics, social studies, mental ability, and science, with a focus on application-based questions to assess reasoning and comprehension skills.
During the 2023-24 academic year, scholarships were awarded to 4,130 students who cleared the exam.
However, concerns have arisen over a decline in the number of students scoring above 50 marks out of 100 compared to the previous year.
While the National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship (NMMS) provides ₹1,000 per month for four years to students from families earning less than ₹3.5 lakh annually, experts argue that the TRUST programme offers better opportunities tailored specifically for Tamil Nadu’s rural students.

Title: Union Health Ministry reviews China’s respiratory illness surge, assures robust preparedness in India
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 05:15:02 +0000
Content: Amid reports of a surge in respiratory illnesses in China, the Union Health Ministry convened a Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) meeting under the chairmanship of the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) in New Delhi on Saturday.
The meeting brought together experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and prominent institutions, including AIIMS, Delhi, to discuss the evolving situation.
According to a government press release, the meeting analyzed reports suggesting that the ongoing flu season in China has caused an increase in cases attributed to common pathogens like the Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV). The experts concluded that the situation is typical of the seasonal variation and does not indicate an unusual trend.
The government emphasized that India is closely monitoring the developments through all available channels and has requested timely updates from the WHO regarding the situation in China. It also highlighted that these viruses, including Influenza, RSV, and HMPV, are already circulating globally, including in India.
India’s robust surveillance system for Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI), managed by the ICMR and IDSP networks, has detected no unusual surge in cases. Hospital physicians have also reported no significant increase in respiratory illnesses beyond the expected seasonal variation.
The ICMR network routinely tests for a range of respiratory pathogens, including Adenovirus, RSV, and HMPV, and the data shows no abnormal rise in their prevalence. However, as a precaution, ICMR will expand the number of laboratories testing for HMPV and monitor trends throughout the year.
The Ministry assured the public that India is well-prepared to handle any potential rise in respiratory illnesses. A recently conducted nationwide preparedness drill demonstrated the country’s readiness, with health systems and surveillance networks remaining vigilant to promptly respond to emerging health challenges.
The Union Health Ministry reiterated its commitment to maintaining public health and urged citizens to remain cautious but not alarmed.

Title: Goldman Sachs sees India among top emerging markets in 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:12:40 +0000
Content: Goldman Sachs has projected India to be among the best-performing emerging markets in 2025, citing the country’s robust macroeconomic stability backed by improving terms of trade, effective inflation targeting, and reliable domestic risk capital.
The global investment bank has forecast earnings growth of 18-20 per cent annually over the next 4-5 years, driven by an emerging private capex cycle, corporate balance sheet re-leveraging, and a structural rise in discretionary consumption.
These factors have reduced India’s beta to emerging markets to approximately 0.4, justifying its premium valuation multiples, the report stated.
Goldman’s investment earnings estimates remain ahead of consensus and highlight a declining correlation of Indian equities with global markets. However, global factors such as policy actions in the US and China, as well as geopolitical developments, will continue to influence Indian markets, the report added.
Goldman expects macro stability to be further strengthened through fiscal consolidation, increased private investment, and a positive real growth-real rates gap. It assumes robust domestic growth, no US recession, benign oil prices, modest rate cuts, and a supportive liquidity environment. Sensex earnings are projected to compound at 17.3 per cent annually through FY27, which is 15 per cent above consensus.
In terms of portfolio strategy, Goldman favours cyclicals over defensives and SMID caps over large caps, recommending overweight positions in Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Technology.
Goldman Sachs Research stated in a report last month that it expects the Indian economy to be relatively insulated against global shocks over the coming year — including tariffs levied by the new administration of US President-elect Donald Trump. India’s GDP is expected to grow strongly in the long term, but with a speed bump next year as government spending and credit growth slow, according to the forecast.
“The structural long-term growth story for India remains intact, driven by favourable demographics and stable governance,” Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs Research, wrote in his team’s report.
The economists expect India’s economy to grow at an average of 6.5 per cent between 2025 and 2030, the report said.
Goldman Sachs also expects headline inflation in India to average 4.2 per cent year-on-year in the 2025 calendar year, with food inflation at 4.6 per cent — much lower than their analysts’ estimate of over 7 per cent for 2024, thanks to adequate rainfall and good sowing of the summer crop.
“Food supply shocks due to weather-related disruptions remain the key risk to this forecast. Thus far, elevated and volatile food inflation, mainly driven by vegetable prices due to weather shocks, has kept the RBI from easing monetary policy,” the report added.

Title: Blinken expresses confidence in South Korea democratic process as Yoon faces arrest
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:06:54 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators will seek an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed confidence in the key Asian ally’s handling of the political turmoil.
Investigators probing Yoon over his Dec. 3 martial law on Friday again failed to serve an arrest warrant, blocked by presidential security service guards who formed a human chain to prevent access to Yoon.
The arrest warrant, the first for a sitting president, expires at midnight on Monday (1500 GMT). The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) plans to request an extension of the arrest warrant in court on Monday.
Yoon, who has been impeached over his martial law declaration, is under criminal investigation for possible insurrection.
The brief six-hour martial law declaration plunged one of Asia’s strongest democracies into uncharted territory with the impeachment of not only Yoon, but also the prime minister who become acting president, and the appointment of a second acting leader.
Yoon’s actions drew a rare rebuke from officials in Washington including Blinken’s deputy, Kurt Campbell, who has said it was “badly misjudged.”
Speaking after his meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken said Washington had expressed “serious concerns” to Seoul over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration.
But the events unfolding since then has been a reflection of South Korea’s brand as a democratic success, “which is remarkably strong,” Blinken said at a news conference.
“The response that we’ve seen, and that we expect to continue to see, is one that is peaceful and fully consistent and in accordance with the constitution and the rule of law.”
Yoon was impeached by parliament on Dec. 14 and suspended from presidential duties. The Constitutional Court is trying the case to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him.
The CIO, which is leading the criminal insurrection probe into Yoon, has sent a notice to police requesting them to take over execution of the arrest warrant.
A police official said at a news briefing that police believed there was a legal dispute over such a transfer and would discuss it with the CIO.
Yonhap news cited a police official as saying the arrest warrant will now be executed under the authority of the police joint investigation team and the CIO.
Yoon’s lawyers have argued that the CIO anti-graft force has no authority under South Korean law to investigate any case involving insurrection accusations.
On Monday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, said the bid to transfer the execution of the arrest warrant is effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were “illegal”.
The unprecedented attempt to arrest an incumbent president has intensified duelling rallies by those supporting Yoon, with the “Stop the Steal” slogans popularised by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voters, and those calling for Yoon’s punishment.
On Monday, a group of hardcore Yoon supporters led by Christian pastor Jun Kwang-hoon held a news conference and described the fight for Yoon as an “international battle” for freedom.
“Sadly, there’s no Fox News in Korea,” it said in a statement, referring to the American cable news channel popular with Trump supporters.
Jun said Yoon supporters would continue rallies outside his residence until they “reap the results”.

Title: EAM Jaishankar meets US NSA Jake Sullivan, discusses bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:04:26 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Monday met US National Security Advisor (NSA) Jake Sullivan in New Delhi to discuss a wide range of strategic, regional, and bilateral issues.
The meeting took place as Sullivan, the outgoing US NSA, embarked on a two-day visit to India, concluding one of the last high-profile engagements of the Biden administration before the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States on January 20.
Sullivan’s visit is aimed at reviewing the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), a significant partnership framework to expand strategic ties between the two nations.
His itinerary includes meetings with NSA Ajit Doval and a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, where he will interact with young Indian entrepreneurs and deliver a speech on the bilateral innovation alliance under iCET.
In his discussions with Doval, Sullivan is expected to delve into the implementation of iCET initiatives. These include cooperation in areas such as space, defense, strategic technology, and shared security priorities in the Indo-Pacific region.
Both NSAs have previously stressed the transformative potential of iCET in strengthening the India-US partnership. During a roundtable in June 2024, NSA Doval had underscored the importance of staying at the forefront of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, and biotechnology, to protect shared value systems.
“iCET has achieved more than what we could imagine,” Doval remarked, highlighting progress in the defense innovation roadmap and the burgeoning semiconductor industry.
Sullivan had echoed similar sentiments, identifying innovation, production, and deployment as the three pillars of the technology partnership and emphasizing the importance of government support for private sector initiatives.
The visit follows EAM Jaishankar’s recent six-day trip to the US, during which he met several senior officials of the Biden administration, including Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The meetings reviewed the progress of the India-US partnership over the past four years.
The iCET, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden in May 2022, has been lauded as a defining element of the India-US strategic relationship, driving advancements in critical sectors such as defense, semiconductors, and Artificial Intelligence.

Title: China rolls out plan to tackle growing issue of dementia
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:59:29 +0000
Content: China has launched a national plan to address the rapidly growing prevalence of dementia, which authorities say is becoming “a widespread societal concern” and poses “significant challenges” to the well being of the elderly and their families.
Ageing has become a growing concern in the world’s second-largest economy, with China’s cohort of people 60 and older expected to rise at least 40% to more than 400 million by 2035, equal to the populations of Britain and the United States combined.
Fifteen Chinese government departments, including the National Health Commission, contributed to the plan to tackle dementia. The proposal outlines seven key tasks and targets to be in place by 2030, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.
“With an aging population and rising average life expectancy, the number of individuals with senile dementia in China continues to increase, becoming a widespread societal concern,” Xinhua said.
A continuous “prevention and control system for dementia, covering prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and care, will be established by 2030”, Xinhua said.
The growth of dementia will be controlled through widespread cognitive screenings for the elderly, with early intervention guaranteed for those most at risk, it said.
China has more than 16 million people suffering from dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type, according to a 2024 official report.
The number of dementia patients in the country accounts for nearly 30% of the global total, it said.
Care services for elderly people with dementia will be expanded, according to the plan. Dedicated care units for seniors with dementia should account for more than 50% of elderly care institutions, while the number of trained dementia care personnel should reach 15 million by 2030 under the plan.

Title: ICMR detects two cases of HMPV in Karnataka, surveillance indicates no unusual surge
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:41:14 +0000
Content: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday confirmed that two cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases have been detected in Karnataka. The cases, detected as part of ICMR’s ongoing efforts to monitor respiratory illnesses, highlight the effectiveness of the country’s robust surveillance systems, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
HMPV, a respiratory virus already in circulation worldwide, including India, has been linked to respiratory illnesses in several countries. Despite the detection of these cases, data from ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) confirm that there has been no unusual surge in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) across the nation.
The first case involved a 3-month-old female infant admitted to Baptist Hospital in Bengaluru with bronchopneumonia. She was diagnosed with HMPV and has since been discharged. The second case, an 8-month-old male infant, tested positive on January 3, 2025, after being admitted to the same hospital with a similar condition. He is currently recovering. Neither of the infants has a history of international travel, indicating localized transmission of the virus.
The health ministry is actively monitoring the situation through extensive surveillance networks, with ICMR continuing to track the virus’s circulation throughout the year. Updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the global status of HMPV, including developments in China, are being closely followed to guide preventive measures.
Authorities have assured the public that there is no immediate cause for concern, with surveillance and response mechanisms firmly in place to ensure public health safety.

Title: The Brutalist,’ ‘Emilia Perez’ triumph at Golden Globes
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:04:12 +0000
Content: “The Brutalist,” the story of a Holocaust survivor who chases the American dream, and musical thriller “Emilia Perez” took home the first major movie honors of Hollywood’s awards season at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
Voters for the Globes, handed out by entertainment journalists around the world, named “The Brutalist” best movie drama and star Adrien Brody the best drama film actor. The film also landed the best director prize for Brady Corbet.
Brody, who plays an architect trying to build a life in the United States, called the movie from independent studio A24 “a monument to humanity and the arts.”
“To the many people who have struggled emigrating to this country, I hope this work stands to lift you up a bit and give you a voice,” Brody said on stage at the black-tie event in Beverly Hills.
“Emilia Perez,” about a Mexican drug lord who transitions to a woman, claimed best movie musical or comedy. The Spanish-language Netflix NFLX.O movie led all films with four awards in total, including a supporting actress honor for Zoe Saldana.
“The light always wins over the darkness,” said Karla Sofía Gascón, the trans actor who plays the lead role in “Emilia Perez.” “You can never take away our soul, or existence or identity.”
The Globes kick off a marathon awards season in Hollywood that culminates with the Academy Awards in March. Winning a Globe can shine a spotlight on movies angling for the coveted best picture prize at the Oscars.
“Wicked,” the box office smash based on the popular Broadway musical, claimed the Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. Director Jon M. Chu spoke of his love for movies as he was surrounded by the cast on stage.
“When pessimism and cynicism sort of rule the planet right now, we can still make art, and still make art that is an act of optimism, that is empowerment and that is joy,” Chu said.
 
DEMI MOORE HONORED
In a surprise, Demi Moore won best actress in a musical or comedy film for her leading role in “The Substance,” the story of a fading actress seeking a fountain of youth.
Known for movies such as “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “Ghost,” Moore told the crowd that she had once been dismissed as a “popcorn actress” and feared her career was over.
“I’m just in shock right now,” Moore said as she held her trophy on stage. “I’ve been doing this a long time, over 45 years. This is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor.”
Among other awards, Brazil’s Fernanda Torres took the trophy for best actress in a movie drama for Portuguese language film “I’m Still Here.” The movie tells the story of a woman who must reinvent herself after her family is shattered by violence during the military dictatorship in Brazil in 1971.
Sebastian Stan was named best actor in a film musical or comedy for “A Different Man,” a movie about a man with facial disfigurement.
“Our ignorance and discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now,” Stan said. “We have to normalize it and continue to expose ourselves to it and our children.”
Kieran Culkin was named best supporting film actor for “A Real Pain,” a dramedy about cousins who travel to Poland to explore their family’s roots.
At the start of the show, first-time host Nikki Glaser welcomed the celebrity crowd to “Ozempic’s biggest night” and teased Timothee Chalamet, Harrison Ford, Selena Gomez and other power players in the audience.
“You could do anything, except tell the country who to vote for,” Glaser said, referring to widespread Hollywood support for the losing candidate in the recent U.S. presidential election.
On the red carpet ahead of the show, celebrities dazzled in black, gold and silver gowns with an occasional red or periwinkle in the mix. “Wicked” star Ariana Grande wore a yellow Givenchy gown with a beaded bodice that she said was a tribute to the yellow brick road leading to Oz in the movie musical.
Globe honorees were chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Academy Awards. The Globes voting body has been expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after being criticized for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity.
In TV categories, “Hacks” won best musical or comedy series, “Baby Reindeer” was named best limited series and “Shogun” earned best TV drama.

According to market experts, the December auto numbers indicate that the much-discussed urban demand deceleration is exaggerated.
“Buying will resume in these resilient domestic segments, supporting the market on declines,” they said, adding that given the current market setup, traders are advised to consider buying on dips as long as the index holds above 24,000, with 23,800 as a closing-basis stop-loss to manage risks effectively.

“The external macro construct continues to be unfavourable with the dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62 per cent. The FIIs are likely to continue selling until the yields decline and the dollar stabilises,” said experts.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 4,227.25 crore on January 3, while domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 820.60 crore on the same day.
The market outlook for this week will be guided by Q3 results, crude oil prices, FIIs, and domestic economic data.

Title: Winter storm hits central US, barrels toward Washington
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:40:47 +0000
Content: A winter storm brought snow, ice and freezing temperatures to a broad swath of the U.S. on Sunday, with some 60 million people across more than a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey under winter weather warnings and advisories.
The storm was moving toward the mid-Atlantic, where Washington, D.C. was bracing for heavy snow and bitter cold on Monday, the same day the U.S. Congress is set to meet and formally certify Republican Donald Trump’s election as president.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News on Sunday the weather would not prevent lawmakers from carrying out their duties. But federal offices in the nation’s capital will be closed, the Office of Personnel Management announced.
Kansas and parts of northwestern Missouri were enduring blizzard conditions, the National Weather Service said. Roadways were blanketed in snow and ice, and officials urged residents to avoid travel.
Much of the main artery in Kansas, Interstate 70, was closed throughout Sunday due to heavy snow and ice.
In Missouri, the state police were sweeping a shut-down stretch of more than 50 miles on Interstate 29, searching for stranded motorists. As of late Sunday afternoon, troopers had responded to nearly 600 stranded drivers and 285 crashes, the agency said on X.
Total snowfall of between six and 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) was expected from southern Ohio to Washington. Hundreds of schools announced in advance that they would not open on Monday due to the storm, including public schools in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Washington and Philadelphia.
In northern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, freezing rain and sleet will produce “hazardous ice accumulations,” the service said. The back end of the storm system, meanwhile, was producing severe thunderstorms capable of spinning off tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
The storm forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights, including more than 275 in both Kansas City and St. Louis, according to the aviation tracking website FlightAware.
Governors in several states, including Kansas, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia and Virginia, declared states of emergency.
The storm will move offshore on Monday night, but bone-chilling arctic air is set to move in behind it, with daytime temperatures on Monday and Tuesday predicted to be 10 to 20 degrees F below average from the Great Plains to the East Coast, according to the weather service.

Title: Bangladesh cancels judicial officials’ training in India
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:40:04 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has withdrawn its judicial officials from participating in training sessions scheduled at India’s National Judicial Academy in Bhopal and a state judicial academy. The program, initially planned for February 10-20, was canceled as per directives issued by the Supreme Court.
The Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs issued a circular on Sunday announcing the cancellation. Earlier, on December 30, 50 judicial officials, including Assistant Judges, Senior Assistant Judges, and District and Sessions Judges, were granted permission to attend the program. The Indian government had agreed to bear all expenses related to the training, which was part of a bilateral agreement signed during Sheikh Hasina’s 2017 visit to India.
This initiative aimed to enhance the expertise of Bangladeshi judicial officials through training at India’s premier institutions. The abrupt cancellation raises questions about the current dynamics between Dhaka and New Delhi, as relations face new challenges.
On January 3, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reaffirmed its commitment to fostering a “democratic, stable, peaceful, and inclusive Bangladesh.” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasized the importance of mutual trust and people-centric ties, adding that India’s engagements with Bangladesh focus on areas like trade, connectivity, and capacity building to benefit its citizens.
