Title: India’s demand for petroleum products expected to rise by 4%: report
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:11:26 +0000
Content: India’s demand for petroleum products, including petrol, diesel, and LPG, is projected to increase by 3-4% in the current financial year ending March 31, 2025, according to a report by Fitch Ratings.
The growth is attributed to rising consumer demand, industrial expansion, and infrastructure development, the report noted.
For India’s oil marketing companies (OMCs), refinery margins are expected to decline below their mid-cycle levels in FY25, driven by weaker product cracks, regional oversupply, and reduced gains from price differentials between crude oil varieties.
However, the report highlighted that marketing margins would improve compared to FY24 due to lower Brent crude oil prices this fiscal year. “This improvement will help offset the pressure from reduced refining margins for oil marketing companies. Pure refiners, such as HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL, BB+/Stable), will face greater profitability challenges,” the report said.
Fitch expects refining margins to recover to mid-cycle levels in FY26 as regional oversupply eases and Brent crude prices align with Fitch’s projections. It also anticipates that marketing margins will remain supportive. HMEL, which has limited rating headroom in FY25, is likely to see its position improve in FY26 as refining margins normalize.
For upstream companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL), profits are expected to decline due to subdued production levels and lower crude oil prices. Domestic gas prices from older fields are forecast to remain capped at $6.5/MMBTU in the second half of FY25, as they are determined by a formula pegged to 10% of crude oil prices.
India’s overall oil and gas production is anticipated to remain flat in FY25. Crude oil output is expected to drop by 2-3%, as upstream companies continue to combat natural declines in production from ageing fields despite deploying technology to improve recovery rates and access isolated reservoirs.
Production is projected to grow modestly in FY26, supported by increased output from ONGC’s eastern offshore KG Basin and privately owned fields, the report added.
India’s dependency on crude oil imports is expected to rise in the short term, as the growth in demand for petroleum products outpaces the increase in domestic crude oil production.

Title: CII pushes for employment policies, labour reforms, and boosting women workforce in Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:05:49 +0000
Content: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to prioritize employment generation, implementation of labour reforms, and increased participation of women in the workforce in the upcoming Union Budget 2025-26, set to be presented on February 1.
Highlighting the potential of India’s demographic dividend, CII proposed an integrated National Employment Policy to unify the numerous employment-focused initiatives currently under various ministries and state governments. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of CII, emphasized the need to align employment generation with higher productivity. “India stands at a unique juncture where its demographic dividend presents a tremendous opportunity to propel economic growth and social transformation,” Banerjee said, suggesting that the Budget establish an expert committee to analyze productivity metrics and recommend solutions.
CII also advocated for a single integrated employment portal under the National Career Service (NCS), enhanced with a Universal Labour Information Management System (ULIMS). This system would provide detailed insights into job opportunities, skills demand, and training programs aligned with future projections.
To further boost job creation, the industry body recommended a new section replacing Section 80JJAA to incentivize new employment. The proposal includes a tax deduction for businesses hiring new employees, applicable for the first three years of employment, capped at Rs. 1 lakh per month per employee.
Targeted support for labour-intensive sectors such as construction, textiles, tourism, and low-skilled manufacturing was another key recommendation. CII also stressed the importance of aligning tariff structures, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to boost exports from labour-intensive industries, thereby generating employment.
For rural areas, CII suggested launching an internship program in government offices to engage college-educated youth, which could enhance manpower resources for implementing government initiatives.
Addressing the low female workforce participation rate, CII called for gender-sensitive policies and initiatives such as government-supported creches in industrial clusters, dormitories built with CSR funds, and formalization of the care economy. These measures, CII stated, could significantly improve economic empowerment for women.
The organization also recommended rolling out labour codes with a focus on providing social security for gig and platform workers, further strengthening the employment landscape.
CII proposed the establishment of an International Mobility Authority under the Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate overseas employment opportunities for Indian youth. This authority could collaborate with the Ministry of Skill Development to design training programs that align with global market needs, including cultural orientation and foreign language skills.

Title: AI can spot patients at risk for suicide, finds study
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:44:37 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors identify patients at risk for suicide, potentially improving prevention efforts in routine medical settings, according to new research.
The research, reported in the journal JAMA Network Open, compared two approaches — automatic pop-up alerts that interrupted the doctor’s workflow versus a more passive system that simply displayed risk information in the patient’s electronic chart.
The team found that the interruptive alerts were far more effective, leading doctors to conduct suicide risk assessments in connection with 42 per cent of screening alerts, compared to just 4 per cent with the passive system.
Colin Walsh, associate professor of biomedical informatics, medicine, and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted that most people who die by suicide have seen a health care provider in the year before their death, often for reasons unrelated to mental health.
The team tested their AI system, called the Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood model (VSAIL), to determine whether it could effectively prompt doctors in three neurology clinics to screen patients for suicide risk during routine visits.
“Universal screening isn’t practical in every setting. We developed VSAIL to help identify high-risk patients and prompt focused screening conversations,” said Walsh.
The VSAIL model analyses routine information from electronic health records to calculate a patient’s 30-day risk of suicide attempt.
The researchers suggested that similar systems could be tested in other medical settings.
Health care systems need to balance the effectiveness of interruptive alerts against their potential downsides, Walsh said.
“The findings indicate that automated risk detection, when paired with thoughtfully designed alerts, has the potential to significantly improve suicide prevention efforts,” the authors concluded.
Studies have shown that 77 per cent of people who die by suicide have contact with primary care providers in the year before their death.

Title: PM Modi takes dig at AAP, says ‘Delhi witnessed ‘AAP-DA’ in name of state government
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:20:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged Delhi’s voters to give the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a chance in the 2025 Delhi assembly elections, taking a sharp swipe at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. He labeled the AAP’s governance in Delhi over the past decade as a “tragedy,” coining the term “AAP-DA” to describe it.
Speaking at the ‘Parivartan Rally’ held at Japanese Park in Rohini, PM Modi called on Delhiites to embrace change for the capital’s bright future. “We need to develop Delhi into the capital of Viksit Bharat. In the last 10 years, the government that Delhi has witnessed is no less than an ‘AAP-DA.’ Now, the voice of the people is clear: ‘AAP-DA nahi sahenge, badal ke rahenge.’ Delhi wants development, and its people trust the BJP,” he said.
Highlighting BJP’s vision for Delhi, PM Modi underscored the importance of the next 25 years for India’s journey toward becoming a developed nation. “The coming 25 years are crucial, not just for Delhi but for the entire country. These years will witness India transform into a global economic powerhouse, and Delhi’s contribution is essential in this mission of Viksit Bharat,” he said.
The Prime Minister also shared details of development projects worth thousands of crores of rupees that he had inaugurated earlier in the day, emphasizing BJP’s commitment to progress and modernization. “India is on the brink of becoming the world’s third-largest economy. This new age of modernization will bring unprecedented opportunities, and Delhi must play a pivotal role in this transformation,” he added.
PM Modi asserted that the BJP’s governance model is rooted in good governance, development, and citizen welfare. “Delhi desires development, and I am delighted to see the trust its people place in the BJP. Our party is dedicated to service, fulfills dreams, and is committed to the welfare of every citizen,” he said.
Citing examples from other states like Haryana and Odisha, where the BJP has secured consecutive full-majority governments, PM Modi expressed confidence in the party’s prospects in Delhi. He encouraged BJP workers to connect with voters, share the party’s vision, and highlight its achievements. “Once people trust the BJP, they continue to support it. I am confident that Delhi will bless us again, and the BJP’s lotus will bloom in the assembly elections,” he added.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi interacted with schoolchildren during a ride on the Namo Bharat train, which he inaugurated. The new section of the high-speed corridor connects Delhi with Meerut, marking a significant milestone in public transport and mobility for the National Capital.

Title: Former Greek Prime Minister Simitis dies aged 88
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:15:02 +0000
Content: Former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who ushered the country into the European Union’s single currency in 2001, died on Sunday aged 88 at his summer house in the Peloponnese.
“With sadness and respect, I bid farewell to Costas Simitis, a worthy and noble political opponent, but also the Prime Minister who accompanied Greece in its great national steps,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement.
The government proclaimed four days of mourning and said his funeral will be at the state’s expense, Greek state news agency reported.
Simitis, a law professor and a reformist, assumed leadership of the PASOK socialist party in 1996 and was prime minister until 2004.
Simitis had been vacationing at his summer residence close to Athens in the Peloponnese in recent days. He was transferred unconscious to the hospital early in the morning where his death was confirmed, the director of the Corinth hospital told local media.
During his government, Simitis reduced the budget deficit and public debt to make Athens qualify for euro zone membership.
In 2012, three years after the Greek debt crisis erupted, he published a book criticising the handling of the crisis by Greek politicians and the EU.
In that book, called “Derailment”, he also accused the European Commission of turning a blind eye to overspending by his conservative successor.

Title: Digital data protection rules to empower citizens, curb harms: Govt
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 09:50:36 +0000
Content: The draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules aim to safeguard citizens’ rights for the protection of their personal data and address specific challenges like unauthorized commercial use of data and digital harms, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said on Friday.
The rules aim to give citizens greater control over their personal data by introducing provisions for informed consent, data erasure rights, and an effective grievance redressal mechanism. Parents and guardians are also empowered to ensure online safety for their children, the official statement explained.
Designed to empower citizens in a rapidly growing digital economy, the rules strive to achieve the right balance between regulation and innovation, ensuring that the benefits of India’s growing innovation ecosystem are accessible to all citizens and contribute to the country’s digital economy, the statement added.
Data Fiduciaries—entities responsible for handling personal data—are required to provide clear and accessible information about how data is processed, enabling citizens to make informed decisions. The framework places citizens at the core of the data protection system.
The statement highlights that India’s model strikes a unique balance between fostering innovation and protecting personal data. Unlike restrictive global frameworks, these rules encourage economic growth while prioritizing citizen welfare. Stakeholders view this as a potential global template for data governance.
The framework also aims to reduce compliance burdens for smaller businesses and startups. An adequate transition period will be provided to ensure all stakeholders, from small enterprises to large corporations, can smoothly adapt to the new law, the statement said.
Embracing a “digital by design” philosophy, the rules focus on consent mechanisms, grievance redressal, and the functioning of the Data Protection Board, all aimed at ensuring ease of living and ease of doing business. The Board will operate as a digital office, with a platform and app enabling citizens to file complaints digitally and have them adjudicated without requiring physical presence, the statement explained.
From processing complaints to interacting with Data Fiduciaries, workflows are optimized to ensure speed and transparency, reflecting India’s forward-looking approach to governance and fostering trust between citizens and data handlers.
Graded responsibilities outlined in the rules cater to startups and MSMEs with a lower compliance burden, while Significant Data Fiduciaries have higher obligations. Sector-specific data protection measures can complement the core personal data protection framework established by the Act and its rules.
The Data Protection Board’s digital-first approach is expected to ensure quick and transparent resolution of complaints. While imposing penalties for defaults, the Board is required to consider factors such as the nature and gravity of violations and efforts made to mitigate their impact.
Additionally, Data Fiduciaries may voluntarily offer undertakings during proceedings, which, if accepted by the Board, could lead to the proceedings being dropped. This mechanism balances the need to protect citizens’ rights with a fair adjudicatory process for entities handling personal data.
The draft rules are based on extensive inputs from various stakeholders and a study of global best practices. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has invited feedback and comments from the public and stakeholders until February 18 through the MyGov platform, in line with the government’s commitment to an inclusive approach to law-making.
Meanwhile, the government is planning a comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities under the new framework, fostering a culture of data responsibility.

Title: TRUST Scholarship amount row: TN rural students seek raise
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:07:54 +0000
Content: The parents of students appearing for the Tamil Nadu Rural Students Talent Search (TRUST) exam have called for an increase in the scholarship amount provided to beneficiaries.
Currently, students who clear the TRUST exam receive a scholarship of ₹1,000 per year for four consecutive years, until they complete Class 12.
The exam, designed to encourage rural students in Class 9 to complete their school education, is limited to those whose parents earn less than ₹1 lakh annually.
The 2023 TRUST exam, initially scheduled for December 14, was postponed to February 1 due to heavy rain across several districts, according to a notification by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examination (DGE).
There has been widespread criticism regarding the meagre ₹1,000 annual scholarship. Rajarathinam, the father of a Class 9 student, said, “Without proper incentives, students are not motivated to study for the exam. ₹1,000 per year hardly qualifies as a scholarship.”
Similarly, M.K. Ushakumari from Erode remarked, “Students lack the enthusiasm to write the exam because the annual scholarship of ₹1,000 is too small.”
Teachers have also raised concerns about inadequate preparation resources and training for the exam.
Palaniappan Rajagopal, a mathematics teacher from a government school in Nagercoil, stated, “While algebra is introduced in Class 8, the exam asks more complex questions. Relying solely on outdated question papers is insufficient.”
Currently, Tamil-medium students rely on outdated PDF reference materials, whereas English-medium students do not have access to such resources. In addition, many students from low-income families face challenges in accessing smartphones and the Internet for exam preparation.
Stakeholders are urging the Tamil Nadu government to increase the budget allocation for the TRUST scholarship programme. Teachers have pointed out the need for modern study materials, updated syllabi, and special training sessions to better prepare students for the exam.
The TRUST exam, introduced in 1991 by the government in collaboration with the School Education Department and Rural Development, aims to support rural students in completing their schooling. The exam covers topics from the Class 8 syllabus but is administered to students from Classes 9 to 12 in government-recognised rural schools.
Subjects include mathematics, social studies, mental ability, and science, with a focus on application-based questions to assess reasoning and comprehension skills.
During the 2023-24 academic year, scholarships were awarded to 4,130 students who cleared the exam.
However, concerns have arisen over a decline in the number of students scoring above 50 marks out of 100 compared to the previous year.
While the National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship (NMMS) provides ₹1,000 per month for four years to students from families earning less than ₹3.5 lakh annually, experts argue that the TRUST programme offers better opportunities tailored specifically for Tamil Nadu’s rural students.

Title: Union Health Ministry reviews China’s respiratory illness surge, assures robust preparedness in India
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 05:15:02 +0000
Content: Amid reports of a surge in respiratory illnesses in China, the Union Health Ministry convened a Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) meeting under the chairmanship of the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) in New Delhi on Saturday.
The meeting brought together experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and prominent institutions, including AIIMS, Delhi, to discuss the evolving situation.
According to a government press release, the meeting analyzed reports suggesting that the ongoing flu season in China has caused an increase in cases attributed to common pathogens like the Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV). The experts concluded that the situation is typical of the seasonal variation and does not indicate an unusual trend.
The government emphasized that India is closely monitoring the developments through all available channels and has requested timely updates from the WHO regarding the situation in China. It also highlighted that these viruses, including Influenza, RSV, and HMPV, are already circulating globally, including in India.
India’s robust surveillance system for Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI), managed by the ICMR and IDSP networks, has detected no unusual surge in cases. Hospital physicians have also reported no significant increase in respiratory illnesses beyond the expected seasonal variation.
The ICMR network routinely tests for a range of respiratory pathogens, including Adenovirus, RSV, and HMPV, and the data shows no abnormal rise in their prevalence. However, as a precaution, ICMR will expand the number of laboratories testing for HMPV and monitor trends throughout the year.
The Ministry assured the public that India is well-prepared to handle any potential rise in respiratory illnesses. A recently conducted nationwide preparedness drill demonstrated the country’s readiness, with health systems and surveillance networks remaining vigilant to promptly respond to emerging health challenges.
The Union Health Ministry reiterated its commitment to maintaining public health and urged citizens to remain cautious but not alarmed.
