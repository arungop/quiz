Title: India’s demand for petroleum products expected to rise by 4%: report
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:11:26 +0000
Content: India’s demand for petroleum products, including petrol, diesel, and LPG, is projected to increase by 3-4% in the current financial year ending March 31, 2025, according to a report by Fitch Ratings.
The growth is attributed to rising consumer demand, industrial expansion, and infrastructure development, the report noted.
For India’s oil marketing companies (OMCs), refinery margins are expected to decline below their mid-cycle levels in FY25, driven by weaker product cracks, regional oversupply, and reduced gains from price differentials between crude oil varieties.
However, the report highlighted that marketing margins would improve compared to FY24 due to lower Brent crude oil prices this fiscal year. “This improvement will help offset the pressure from reduced refining margins for oil marketing companies. Pure refiners, such as HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL, BB+/Stable), will face greater profitability challenges,” the report said.
Fitch expects refining margins to recover to mid-cycle levels in FY26 as regional oversupply eases and Brent crude prices align with Fitch’s projections. It also anticipates that marketing margins will remain supportive. HMEL, which has limited rating headroom in FY25, is likely to see its position improve in FY26 as refining margins normalize.
For upstream companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL), profits are expected to decline due to subdued production levels and lower crude oil prices. Domestic gas prices from older fields are forecast to remain capped at $6.5/MMBTU in the second half of FY25, as they are determined by a formula pegged to 10% of crude oil prices.
India’s overall oil and gas production is anticipated to remain flat in FY25. Crude oil output is expected to drop by 2-3%, as upstream companies continue to combat natural declines in production from ageing fields despite deploying technology to improve recovery rates and access isolated reservoirs.
Production is projected to grow modestly in FY26, supported by increased output from ONGC’s eastern offshore KG Basin and privately owned fields, the report added.
India’s dependency on crude oil imports is expected to rise in the short term, as the growth in demand for petroleum products outpaces the increase in domestic crude oil production.

Title: CII pushes for employment policies, labour reforms, and boosting women workforce in Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:05:49 +0000
Content: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has urged the government to prioritize employment generation, implementation of labour reforms, and increased participation of women in the workforce in the upcoming Union Budget 2025-26, set to be presented on February 1.
Highlighting the potential of India’s demographic dividend, CII proposed an integrated National Employment Policy to unify the numerous employment-focused initiatives currently under various ministries and state governments. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of CII, emphasized the need to align employment generation with higher productivity. “India stands at a unique juncture where its demographic dividend presents a tremendous opportunity to propel economic growth and social transformation,” Banerjee said, suggesting that the Budget establish an expert committee to analyze productivity metrics and recommend solutions.
CII also advocated for a single integrated employment portal under the National Career Service (NCS), enhanced with a Universal Labour Information Management System (ULIMS). This system would provide detailed insights into job opportunities, skills demand, and training programs aligned with future projections.
To further boost job creation, the industry body recommended a new section replacing Section 80JJAA to incentivize new employment. The proposal includes a tax deduction for businesses hiring new employees, applicable for the first three years of employment, capped at Rs. 1 lakh per month per employee.
Targeted support for labour-intensive sectors such as construction, textiles, tourism, and low-skilled manufacturing was another key recommendation. CII also stressed the importance of aligning tariff structures, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to boost exports from labour-intensive industries, thereby generating employment.
For rural areas, CII suggested launching an internship program in government offices to engage college-educated youth, which could enhance manpower resources for implementing government initiatives.
Addressing the low female workforce participation rate, CII called for gender-sensitive policies and initiatives such as government-supported creches in industrial clusters, dormitories built with CSR funds, and formalization of the care economy. These measures, CII stated, could significantly improve economic empowerment for women.
The organization also recommended rolling out labour codes with a focus on providing social security for gig and platform workers, further strengthening the employment landscape.
CII proposed the establishment of an International Mobility Authority under the Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate overseas employment opportunities for Indian youth. This authority could collaborate with the Ministry of Skill Development to design training programs that align with global market needs, including cultural orientation and foreign language skills.

Title: AI can spot patients at risk for suicide, finds study
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:44:37 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence (AI) can help doctors identify patients at risk for suicide, potentially improving prevention efforts in routine medical settings, according to new research.
The research, reported in the journal JAMA Network Open, compared two approaches — automatic pop-up alerts that interrupted the doctor’s workflow versus a more passive system that simply displayed risk information in the patient’s electronic chart.
The team found that the interruptive alerts were far more effective, leading doctors to conduct suicide risk assessments in connection with 42 per cent of screening alerts, compared to just 4 per cent with the passive system.
Colin Walsh, associate professor of biomedical informatics, medicine, and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted that most people who die by suicide have seen a health care provider in the year before their death, often for reasons unrelated to mental health.
The team tested their AI system, called the Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood model (VSAIL), to determine whether it could effectively prompt doctors in three neurology clinics to screen patients for suicide risk during routine visits.
“Universal screening isn’t practical in every setting. We developed VSAIL to help identify high-risk patients and prompt focused screening conversations,” said Walsh.
The VSAIL model analyses routine information from electronic health records to calculate a patient’s 30-day risk of suicide attempt.
The researchers suggested that similar systems could be tested in other medical settings.
Health care systems need to balance the effectiveness of interruptive alerts against their potential downsides, Walsh said.
“The findings indicate that automated risk detection, when paired with thoughtfully designed alerts, has the potential to significantly improve suicide prevention efforts,” the authors concluded.
Studies have shown that 77 per cent of people who die by suicide have contact with primary care providers in the year before their death.

Title: PM Modi takes dig at AAP, says ‘Delhi witnessed ‘AAP-DA’ in name of state government
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 11:20:02 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged Delhi’s voters to give the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a chance in the 2025 Delhi assembly elections, taking a sharp swipe at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. He labeled the AAP’s governance in Delhi over the past decade as a “tragedy,” coining the term “AAP-DA” to describe it.
Speaking at the ‘Parivartan Rally’ held at Japanese Park in Rohini, PM Modi called on Delhiites to embrace change for the capital’s bright future. “We need to develop Delhi into the capital of Viksit Bharat. In the last 10 years, the government that Delhi has witnessed is no less than an ‘AAP-DA.’ Now, the voice of the people is clear: ‘AAP-DA nahi sahenge, badal ke rahenge.’ Delhi wants development, and its people trust the BJP,” he said.
Highlighting BJP’s vision for Delhi, PM Modi underscored the importance of the next 25 years for India’s journey toward becoming a developed nation. “The coming 25 years are crucial, not just for Delhi but for the entire country. These years will witness India transform into a global economic powerhouse, and Delhi’s contribution is essential in this mission of Viksit Bharat,” he said.
The Prime Minister also shared details of development projects worth thousands of crores of rupees that he had inaugurated earlier in the day, emphasizing BJP’s commitment to progress and modernization. “India is on the brink of becoming the world’s third-largest economy. This new age of modernization will bring unprecedented opportunities, and Delhi must play a pivotal role in this transformation,” he added.
PM Modi asserted that the BJP’s governance model is rooted in good governance, development, and citizen welfare. “Delhi desires development, and I am delighted to see the trust its people place in the BJP. Our party is dedicated to service, fulfills dreams, and is committed to the welfare of every citizen,” he said.
Citing examples from other states like Haryana and Odisha, where the BJP has secured consecutive full-majority governments, PM Modi expressed confidence in the party’s prospects in Delhi. He encouraged BJP workers to connect with voters, share the party’s vision, and highlight its achievements. “Once people trust the BJP, they continue to support it. I am confident that Delhi will bless us again, and the BJP’s lotus will bloom in the assembly elections,” he added.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi interacted with schoolchildren during a ride on the Namo Bharat train, which he inaugurated. The new section of the high-speed corridor connects Delhi with Meerut, marking a significant milestone in public transport and mobility for the National Capital.

Title: Former Greek Prime Minister Simitis dies aged 88
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:15:02 +0000
Content: Former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who ushered the country into the European Union’s single currency in 2001, died on Sunday aged 88 at his summer house in the Peloponnese.
“With sadness and respect, I bid farewell to Costas Simitis, a worthy and noble political opponent, but also the Prime Minister who accompanied Greece in its great national steps,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement.
The government proclaimed four days of mourning and said his funeral will be at the state’s expense, Greek state news agency reported.
Simitis, a law professor and a reformist, assumed leadership of the PASOK socialist party in 1996 and was prime minister until 2004.
Simitis had been vacationing at his summer residence close to Athens in the Peloponnese in recent days. He was transferred unconscious to the hospital early in the morning where his death was confirmed, the director of the Corinth hospital told local media.
During his government, Simitis reduced the budget deficit and public debt to make Athens qualify for euro zone membership.
In 2012, three years after the Greek debt crisis erupted, he published a book criticising the handling of the crisis by Greek politicians and the EU.
In that book, called “Derailment”, he also accused the European Commission of turning a blind eye to overspending by his conservative successor.

Title: Digital data protection rules to empower citizens, curb harms: Govt
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 09:50:36 +0000
Content: The draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules aim to safeguard citizens’ rights for the protection of their personal data and address specific challenges like unauthorized commercial use of data and digital harms, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said on Friday.
The rules aim to give citizens greater control over their personal data by introducing provisions for informed consent, data erasure rights, and an effective grievance redressal mechanism. Parents and guardians are also empowered to ensure online safety for their children, the official statement explained.
Designed to empower citizens in a rapidly growing digital economy, the rules strive to achieve the right balance between regulation and innovation, ensuring that the benefits of India’s growing innovation ecosystem are accessible to all citizens and contribute to the country’s digital economy, the statement added.
Data Fiduciaries—entities responsible for handling personal data—are required to provide clear and accessible information about how data is processed, enabling citizens to make informed decisions. The framework places citizens at the core of the data protection system.
The statement highlights that India’s model strikes a unique balance between fostering innovation and protecting personal data. Unlike restrictive global frameworks, these rules encourage economic growth while prioritizing citizen welfare. Stakeholders view this as a potential global template for data governance.
The framework also aims to reduce compliance burdens for smaller businesses and startups. An adequate transition period will be provided to ensure all stakeholders, from small enterprises to large corporations, can smoothly adapt to the new law, the statement said.
Embracing a “digital by design” philosophy, the rules focus on consent mechanisms, grievance redressal, and the functioning of the Data Protection Board, all aimed at ensuring ease of living and ease of doing business. The Board will operate as a digital office, with a platform and app enabling citizens to file complaints digitally and have them adjudicated without requiring physical presence, the statement explained.
From processing complaints to interacting with Data Fiduciaries, workflows are optimized to ensure speed and transparency, reflecting India’s forward-looking approach to governance and fostering trust between citizens and data handlers.
Graded responsibilities outlined in the rules cater to startups and MSMEs with a lower compliance burden, while Significant Data Fiduciaries have higher obligations. Sector-specific data protection measures can complement the core personal data protection framework established by the Act and its rules.
The Data Protection Board’s digital-first approach is expected to ensure quick and transparent resolution of complaints. While imposing penalties for defaults, the Board is required to consider factors such as the nature and gravity of violations and efforts made to mitigate their impact.
Additionally, Data Fiduciaries may voluntarily offer undertakings during proceedings, which, if accepted by the Board, could lead to the proceedings being dropped. This mechanism balances the need to protect citizens’ rights with a fair adjudicatory process for entities handling personal data.
The draft rules are based on extensive inputs from various stakeholders and a study of global best practices. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has invited feedback and comments from the public and stakeholders until February 18 through the MyGov platform, in line with the government’s commitment to an inclusive approach to law-making.
Meanwhile, the government is planning a comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens about their rights and responsibilities under the new framework, fostering a culture of data responsibility.

Title: TRUST Scholarship amount row: TN rural students seek raise
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:07:54 +0000
Content: The parents of students appearing for the Tamil Nadu Rural Students Talent Search (TRUST) exam have called for an increase in the scholarship amount provided to beneficiaries.
Currently, students who clear the TRUST exam receive a scholarship of ₹1,000 per year for four consecutive years, until they complete Class 12.
The exam, designed to encourage rural students in Class 9 to complete their school education, is limited to those whose parents earn less than ₹1 lakh annually.
The 2023 TRUST exam, initially scheduled for December 14, was postponed to February 1 due to heavy rain across several districts, according to a notification by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examination (DGE).
There has been widespread criticism regarding the meagre ₹1,000 annual scholarship. Rajarathinam, the father of a Class 9 student, said, “Without proper incentives, students are not motivated to study for the exam. ₹1,000 per year hardly qualifies as a scholarship.”
Similarly, M.K. Ushakumari from Erode remarked, “Students lack the enthusiasm to write the exam because the annual scholarship of ₹1,000 is too small.”
Teachers have also raised concerns about inadequate preparation resources and training for the exam.
Palaniappan Rajagopal, a mathematics teacher from a government school in Nagercoil, stated, “While algebra is introduced in Class 8, the exam asks more complex questions. Relying solely on outdated question papers is insufficient.”
Currently, Tamil-medium students rely on outdated PDF reference materials, whereas English-medium students do not have access to such resources. In addition, many students from low-income families face challenges in accessing smartphones and the Internet for exam preparation.
Stakeholders are urging the Tamil Nadu government to increase the budget allocation for the TRUST scholarship programme. Teachers have pointed out the need for modern study materials, updated syllabi, and special training sessions to better prepare students for the exam.
The TRUST exam, introduced in 1991 by the government in collaboration with the School Education Department and Rural Development, aims to support rural students in completing their schooling. The exam covers topics from the Class 8 syllabus but is administered to students from Classes 9 to 12 in government-recognised rural schools.
Subjects include mathematics, social studies, mental ability, and science, with a focus on application-based questions to assess reasoning and comprehension skills.
During the 2023-24 academic year, scholarships were awarded to 4,130 students who cleared the exam.
However, concerns have arisen over a decline in the number of students scoring above 50 marks out of 100 compared to the previous year.
While the National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship (NMMS) provides ₹1,000 per month for four years to students from families earning less than ₹3.5 lakh annually, experts argue that the TRUST programme offers better opportunities tailored specifically for Tamil Nadu’s rural students.

Title: Union Health Ministry reviews China’s respiratory illness surge, assures robust preparedness in India
Publication Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 05:15:02 +0000
Content: Amid reports of a surge in respiratory illnesses in China, the Union Health Ministry convened a Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) meeting under the chairmanship of the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) in New Delhi on Saturday.
The meeting brought together experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and prominent institutions, including AIIMS, Delhi, to discuss the evolving situation.
According to a government press release, the meeting analyzed reports suggesting that the ongoing flu season in China has caused an increase in cases attributed to common pathogens like the Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV). The experts concluded that the situation is typical of the seasonal variation and does not indicate an unusual trend.
The government emphasized that India is closely monitoring the developments through all available channels and has requested timely updates from the WHO regarding the situation in China. It also highlighted that these viruses, including Influenza, RSV, and HMPV, are already circulating globally, including in India.
India’s robust surveillance system for Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI), managed by the ICMR and IDSP networks, has detected no unusual surge in cases. Hospital physicians have also reported no significant increase in respiratory illnesses beyond the expected seasonal variation.
The ICMR network routinely tests for a range of respiratory pathogens, including Adenovirus, RSV, and HMPV, and the data shows no abnormal rise in their prevalence. However, as a precaution, ICMR will expand the number of laboratories testing for HMPV and monitor trends throughout the year.
The Ministry assured the public that India is well-prepared to handle any potential rise in respiratory illnesses. A recently conducted nationwide preparedness drill demonstrated the country’s readiness, with health systems and surveillance networks remaining vigilant to promptly respond to emerging health challenges.
The Union Health Ministry reiterated its commitment to maintaining public health and urged citizens to remain cautious but not alarmed.

Title: Goldman Sachs sees India among top emerging markets in 2025
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:12:40 +0000
Content: Goldman Sachs has projected India to be among the best-performing emerging markets in 2025, citing the country’s robust macroeconomic stability backed by improving terms of trade, effective inflation targeting, and reliable domestic risk capital.
The global investment bank has forecast earnings growth of 18-20 per cent annually over the next 4-5 years, driven by an emerging private capex cycle, corporate balance sheet re-leveraging, and a structural rise in discretionary consumption.
These factors have reduced India’s beta to emerging markets to approximately 0.4, justifying its premium valuation multiples, the report stated.
Goldman’s investment earnings estimates remain ahead of consensus and highlight a declining correlation of Indian equities with global markets. However, global factors such as policy actions in the US and China, as well as geopolitical developments, will continue to influence Indian markets, the report added.
Goldman expects macro stability to be further strengthened through fiscal consolidation, increased private investment, and a positive real growth-real rates gap. It assumes robust domestic growth, no US recession, benign oil prices, modest rate cuts, and a supportive liquidity environment. Sensex earnings are projected to compound at 17.3 per cent annually through FY27, which is 15 per cent above consensus.
In terms of portfolio strategy, Goldman favours cyclicals over defensives and SMID caps over large caps, recommending overweight positions in Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Technology.
Goldman Sachs Research stated in a report last month that it expects the Indian economy to be relatively insulated against global shocks over the coming year — including tariffs levied by the new administration of US President-elect Donald Trump. India’s GDP is expected to grow strongly in the long term, but with a speed bump next year as government spending and credit growth slow, according to the forecast.
“The structural long-term growth story for India remains intact, driven by favourable demographics and stable governance,” Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs Research, wrote in his team’s report.
The economists expect India’s economy to grow at an average of 6.5 per cent between 2025 and 2030, the report said.
Goldman Sachs also expects headline inflation in India to average 4.2 per cent year-on-year in the 2025 calendar year, with food inflation at 4.6 per cent — much lower than their analysts’ estimate of over 7 per cent for 2024, thanks to adequate rainfall and good sowing of the summer crop.
“Food supply shocks due to weather-related disruptions remain the key risk to this forecast. Thus far, elevated and volatile food inflation, mainly driven by vegetable prices due to weather shocks, has kept the RBI from easing monetary policy,” the report added.

Title: Blinken expresses confidence in South Korea democratic process as Yoon faces arrest
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:06:54 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators will seek an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed confidence in the key Asian ally’s handling of the political turmoil.
Investigators probing Yoon over his Dec. 3 martial law on Friday again failed to serve an arrest warrant, blocked by presidential security service guards who formed a human chain to prevent access to Yoon.
The arrest warrant, the first for a sitting president, expires at midnight on Monday (1500 GMT). The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) plans to request an extension of the arrest warrant in court on Monday.
Yoon, who has been impeached over his martial law declaration, is under criminal investigation for possible insurrection.
The brief six-hour martial law declaration plunged one of Asia’s strongest democracies into uncharted territory with the impeachment of not only Yoon, but also the prime minister who become acting president, and the appointment of a second acting leader.
Yoon’s actions drew a rare rebuke from officials in Washington including Blinken’s deputy, Kurt Campbell, who has said it was “badly misjudged.”
Speaking after his meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken said Washington had expressed “serious concerns” to Seoul over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration.
But the events unfolding since then has been a reflection of South Korea’s brand as a democratic success, “which is remarkably strong,” Blinken said at a news conference.
“The response that we’ve seen, and that we expect to continue to see, is one that is peaceful and fully consistent and in accordance with the constitution and the rule of law.”
Yoon was impeached by parliament on Dec. 14 and suspended from presidential duties. The Constitutional Court is trying the case to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him.
The CIO, which is leading the criminal insurrection probe into Yoon, has sent a notice to police requesting them to take over execution of the arrest warrant.
A police official said at a news briefing that police believed there was a legal dispute over such a transfer and would discuss it with the CIO.
Yonhap news cited a police official as saying the arrest warrant will now be executed under the authority of the police joint investigation team and the CIO.
Yoon’s lawyers have argued that the CIO anti-graft force has no authority under South Korean law to investigate any case involving insurrection accusations.
On Monday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, said the bid to transfer the execution of the arrest warrant is effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were “illegal”.
The unprecedented attempt to arrest an incumbent president has intensified duelling rallies by those supporting Yoon, with the “Stop the Steal” slogans popularised by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voters, and those calling for Yoon’s punishment.
On Monday, a group of hardcore Yoon supporters led by Christian pastor Jun Kwang-hoon held a news conference and described the fight for Yoon as an “international battle” for freedom.
“Sadly, there’s no Fox News in Korea,” it said in a statement, referring to the American cable news channel popular with Trump supporters.
Jun said Yoon supporters would continue rallies outside his residence until they “reap the results”.

Title: EAM Jaishankar meets US NSA Jake Sullivan, discusses bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:04:26 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Monday met US National Security Advisor (NSA) Jake Sullivan in New Delhi to discuss a wide range of strategic, regional, and bilateral issues.
The meeting took place as Sullivan, the outgoing US NSA, embarked on a two-day visit to India, concluding one of the last high-profile engagements of the Biden administration before the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States on January 20.
Sullivan’s visit is aimed at reviewing the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), a significant partnership framework to expand strategic ties between the two nations.
His itinerary includes meetings with NSA Ajit Doval and a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, where he will interact with young Indian entrepreneurs and deliver a speech on the bilateral innovation alliance under iCET.
In his discussions with Doval, Sullivan is expected to delve into the implementation of iCET initiatives. These include cooperation in areas such as space, defense, strategic technology, and shared security priorities in the Indo-Pacific region.
Both NSAs have previously stressed the transformative potential of iCET in strengthening the India-US partnership. During a roundtable in June 2024, NSA Doval had underscored the importance of staying at the forefront of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, and biotechnology, to protect shared value systems.
“iCET has achieved more than what we could imagine,” Doval remarked, highlighting progress in the defense innovation roadmap and the burgeoning semiconductor industry.
Sullivan had echoed similar sentiments, identifying innovation, production, and deployment as the three pillars of the technology partnership and emphasizing the importance of government support for private sector initiatives.
The visit follows EAM Jaishankar’s recent six-day trip to the US, during which he met several senior officials of the Biden administration, including Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The meetings reviewed the progress of the India-US partnership over the past four years.
The iCET, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden in May 2022, has been lauded as a defining element of the India-US strategic relationship, driving advancements in critical sectors such as defense, semiconductors, and Artificial Intelligence.

Title: China rolls out plan to tackle growing issue of dementia
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:59:29 +0000
Content: China has launched a national plan to address the rapidly growing prevalence of dementia, which authorities say is becoming “a widespread societal concern” and poses “significant challenges” to the well being of the elderly and their families.
Ageing has become a growing concern in the world’s second-largest economy, with China’s cohort of people 60 and older expected to rise at least 40% to more than 400 million by 2035, equal to the populations of Britain and the United States combined.
Fifteen Chinese government departments, including the National Health Commission, contributed to the plan to tackle dementia. The proposal outlines seven key tasks and targets to be in place by 2030, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.
“With an aging population and rising average life expectancy, the number of individuals with senile dementia in China continues to increase, becoming a widespread societal concern,” Xinhua said.
A continuous “prevention and control system for dementia, covering prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and care, will be established by 2030”, Xinhua said.
The growth of dementia will be controlled through widespread cognitive screenings for the elderly, with early intervention guaranteed for those most at risk, it said.
China has more than 16 million people suffering from dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type, according to a 2024 official report.
The number of dementia patients in the country accounts for nearly 30% of the global total, it said.
Care services for elderly people with dementia will be expanded, according to the plan. Dedicated care units for seniors with dementia should account for more than 50% of elderly care institutions, while the number of trained dementia care personnel should reach 15 million by 2030 under the plan.

Title: ICMR detects two cases of HMPV in Karnataka, surveillance indicates no unusual surge
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:41:14 +0000
Content: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday confirmed that two cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases have been detected in Karnataka. The cases, detected as part of ICMR’s ongoing efforts to monitor respiratory illnesses, highlight the effectiveness of the country’s robust surveillance systems, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
HMPV, a respiratory virus already in circulation worldwide, including India, has been linked to respiratory illnesses in several countries. Despite the detection of these cases, data from ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) confirm that there has been no unusual surge in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) across the nation.
The first case involved a 3-month-old female infant admitted to Baptist Hospital in Bengaluru with bronchopneumonia. She was diagnosed with HMPV and has since been discharged. The second case, an 8-month-old male infant, tested positive on January 3, 2025, after being admitted to the same hospital with a similar condition. He is currently recovering. Neither of the infants has a history of international travel, indicating localized transmission of the virus.
The health ministry is actively monitoring the situation through extensive surveillance networks, with ICMR continuing to track the virus’s circulation throughout the year. Updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the global status of HMPV, including developments in China, are being closely followed to guide preventive measures.
Authorities have assured the public that there is no immediate cause for concern, with surveillance and response mechanisms firmly in place to ensure public health safety.

Title: The Brutalist,’ ‘Emilia Perez’ triumph at Golden Globes
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 06:04:12 +0000
Content: “The Brutalist,” the story of a Holocaust survivor who chases the American dream, and musical thriller “Emilia Perez” took home the first major movie honors of Hollywood’s awards season at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
Voters for the Globes, handed out by entertainment journalists around the world, named “The Brutalist” best movie drama and star Adrien Brody the best drama film actor. The film also landed the best director prize for Brady Corbet.
Brody, who plays an architect trying to build a life in the United States, called the movie from independent studio A24 “a monument to humanity and the arts.”
“To the many people who have struggled emigrating to this country, I hope this work stands to lift you up a bit and give you a voice,” Brody said on stage at the black-tie event in Beverly Hills.
“Emilia Perez,” about a Mexican drug lord who transitions to a woman, claimed best movie musical or comedy. The Spanish-language Netflix NFLX.O movie led all films with four awards in total, including a supporting actress honor for Zoe Saldana.
“The light always wins over the darkness,” said Karla Sofía Gascón, the trans actor who plays the lead role in “Emilia Perez.” “You can never take away our soul, or existence or identity.”
The Globes kick off a marathon awards season in Hollywood that culminates with the Academy Awards in March. Winning a Globe can shine a spotlight on movies angling for the coveted best picture prize at the Oscars.
“Wicked,” the box office smash based on the popular Broadway musical, claimed the Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. Director Jon M. Chu spoke of his love for movies as he was surrounded by the cast on stage.
“When pessimism and cynicism sort of rule the planet right now, we can still make art, and still make art that is an act of optimism, that is empowerment and that is joy,” Chu said.
 
DEMI MOORE HONORED
In a surprise, Demi Moore won best actress in a musical or comedy film for her leading role in “The Substance,” the story of a fading actress seeking a fountain of youth.
Known for movies such as “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “Ghost,” Moore told the crowd that she had once been dismissed as a “popcorn actress” and feared her career was over.
“I’m just in shock right now,” Moore said as she held her trophy on stage. “I’ve been doing this a long time, over 45 years. This is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor.”
Among other awards, Brazil’s Fernanda Torres took the trophy for best actress in a movie drama for Portuguese language film “I’m Still Here.” The movie tells the story of a woman who must reinvent herself after her family is shattered by violence during the military dictatorship in Brazil in 1971.
Sebastian Stan was named best actor in a film musical or comedy for “A Different Man,” a movie about a man with facial disfigurement.
“Our ignorance and discomfort around disability and disfigurement has to end now,” Stan said. “We have to normalize it and continue to expose ourselves to it and our children.”
Kieran Culkin was named best supporting film actor for “A Real Pain,” a dramedy about cousins who travel to Poland to explore their family’s roots.
At the start of the show, first-time host Nikki Glaser welcomed the celebrity crowd to “Ozempic’s biggest night” and teased Timothee Chalamet, Harrison Ford, Selena Gomez and other power players in the audience.
“You could do anything, except tell the country who to vote for,” Glaser said, referring to widespread Hollywood support for the losing candidate in the recent U.S. presidential election.
On the red carpet ahead of the show, celebrities dazzled in black, gold and silver gowns with an occasional red or periwinkle in the mix. “Wicked” star Ariana Grande wore a yellow Givenchy gown with a beaded bodice that she said was a tribute to the yellow brick road leading to Oz in the movie musical.
Globe honorees were chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Academy Awards. The Globes voting body has been expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after being criticized for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity.
In TV categories, “Hacks” won best musical or comedy series, “Baby Reindeer” was named best limited series and “Shogun” earned best TV drama.

According to market experts, the December auto numbers indicate that the much-discussed urban demand deceleration is exaggerated.
“Buying will resume in these resilient domestic segments, supporting the market on declines,” they said, adding that given the current market setup, traders are advised to consider buying on dips as long as the index holds above 24,000, with 23,800 as a closing-basis stop-loss to manage risks effectively.
On the sectoral front, selling was seen in the PSU bank, financial services, pharma, FMCG, metal, and realty sectors.

In the Asian markets, only Seoul was trading in green, whereas Jakarta, Hong Kong, Bangkok, China, and Japan were trading in red.
“The external macro construct continues to be unfavourable with the dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62 per cent. The FIIs are likely to continue selling until the yields decline and the dollar stabilises,” said experts.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 4,227.25 crore on January 3, while domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 820.60 crore on the same day.
The market outlook for this week will be guided by Q3 results, crude oil prices, FIIs, and domestic economic data.

Title: Winter storm hits central US, barrels toward Washington
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:40:47 +0000
Content: A winter storm brought snow, ice and freezing temperatures to a broad swath of the U.S. on Sunday, with some 60 million people across more than a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey under winter weather warnings and advisories.
The storm was moving toward the mid-Atlantic, where Washington, D.C. was bracing for heavy snow and bitter cold on Monday, the same day the U.S. Congress is set to meet and formally certify Republican Donald Trump’s election as president.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News on Sunday the weather would not prevent lawmakers from carrying out their duties. But federal offices in the nation’s capital will be closed, the Office of Personnel Management announced.
Kansas and parts of northwestern Missouri were enduring blizzard conditions, the National Weather Service said. Roadways were blanketed in snow and ice, and officials urged residents to avoid travel.
Much of the main artery in Kansas, Interstate 70, was closed throughout Sunday due to heavy snow and ice.
In Missouri, the state police were sweeping a shut-down stretch of more than 50 miles on Interstate 29, searching for stranded motorists. As of late Sunday afternoon, troopers had responded to nearly 600 stranded drivers and 285 crashes, the agency said on X.
Total snowfall of between six and 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) was expected from southern Ohio to Washington. Hundreds of schools announced in advance that they would not open on Monday due to the storm, including public schools in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Washington and Philadelphia.
In northern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, freezing rain and sleet will produce “hazardous ice accumulations,” the service said. The back end of the storm system, meanwhile, was producing severe thunderstorms capable of spinning off tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
The storm forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights, including more than 275 in both Kansas City and St. Louis, according to the aviation tracking website FlightAware.
Governors in several states, including Kansas, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia and Virginia, declared states of emergency.
The storm will move offshore on Monday night, but bone-chilling arctic air is set to move in behind it, with daytime temperatures on Monday and Tuesday predicted to be 10 to 20 degrees F below average from the Great Plains to the East Coast, according to the weather service.

Title: Bangladesh cancels judicial officials’ training in India
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:40:04 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has withdrawn its judicial officials from participating in training sessions scheduled at India’s National Judicial Academy in Bhopal and a state judicial academy. The program, initially planned for February 10-20, was canceled as per directives issued by the Supreme Court.
The Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs issued a circular on Sunday announcing the cancellation. Earlier, on December 30, 50 judicial officials, including Assistant Judges, Senior Assistant Judges, and District and Sessions Judges, were granted permission to attend the program. The Indian government had agreed to bear all expenses related to the training, which was part of a bilateral agreement signed during Sheikh Hasina’s 2017 visit to India.
This initiative aimed to enhance the expertise of Bangladeshi judicial officials through training at India’s premier institutions. The abrupt cancellation raises questions about the current dynamics between Dhaka and New Delhi, as relations face new challenges.
On January 3, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reaffirmed its commitment to fostering a “democratic, stable, peaceful, and inclusive Bangladesh.” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasized the importance of mutual trust and people-centric ties, adding that India’s engagements with Bangladesh focus on areas like trade, connectivity, and capacity building to benefit its citizens.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on January 8-9, marking a major stride in sustainable development, industrial growth, and infrastructure enhancement. During his visit, PM Modi will inaugurate and lay the foundation stones for various projects worth over ₹2 lakh crore.
In Andhra Pradesh on January 8, the Prime Minister will launch the NTPC Green Energy Limited Green Hydrogen Hub Project at Pudimadaka near Visakhapatnam. This state-of-the-art hub will be the first of its kind under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, involving an investment of approximately ₹1,85,000 crore.
The project encompasses 20 GW renewable energy capacities, making it one of India’s largest integrated green hydrogen production facilities. It will produce 1,500 TPD Green Hydrogen and 7,500 TPD derivatives like Green Methanol, Green Urea, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, primarily for export. This initiative will also contribute substantially to India’s goal of achieving a 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030.
Prime Minister will launch a series of railway and road projects in Andhra Pradesh, valued at over ₹19,500 crore. These include the foundation stone for the South Coast Railway Headquarters in Visakhapatnam and other projects aimed at reducing congestion, improving connectivity, and fostering regional socio-economic development.
To advance healthcare access and economic growth, PM Modi will lay the foundation for the Bulk Drug Park at Nakkapalli in Anakapalli district. Strategically located near the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and the Visakhapatnam-Kakinada Petrochemical Investment Region, this project is expected to generate thousands of jobs.
In the Tirupati district, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation for the Krishnapatnam Industrial Area (KRIS City) under the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. Envisioned as a greenfield industrial smart city, KRIS City is expected to attract ₹10,500 crore in manufacturing investments and create nearly one lakh jobs, boosting regional development and livelihoods.
On January 9, Prime Minister Modi will inaugurate the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. This flagship event by the Indian Government connects and engages with the Indian diaspora. Organized in collaboration with the Odisha Government, the event, themed “Diaspora’s Contribution to a Viksit Bharat,” will see participation from diaspora members representing over 50 countries.
As part of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas celebrations, PM Modi will remotely flag off the inaugural Pravasi Bharatiya Express, a special tourist train for Indian diaspora members.

Title: India prepared to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges: J.P. Nadda on HMPV
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:23:05 +0000
Content: India’s surveillance network remains vigilant and the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges, Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda said on Monday, as the number of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases in the country reached five in a single day.
Five children tested positive for the virus in Karnataka (2), Gujarat (1), and Tamil Nadu (2). The affected children are recovering well, while one has been discharged, the health authorities said.
In a video message, Nadda said that the HMPV virus is not a new virus.
“It was first identified in 2001 and has been circulating in the entire world since many years, It spreads through the air by the way of respiration. This can affect persons of all age groups. The virus spreads more during the winter and the early spring months,” said the Union Minister.
The Health Ministry, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), and the National Centre for Disease Control are keeping a close watch on the situation in China, as well as in neighbouring countries, Nadda assured.
“The WHO has taken cognisance of the situation and will share its report shortly with us. The country data for respiratory viruses available with ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme has also been reviewed,” he said, adding that the country is ready to respond promptly to any health challenges.
“There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,” he added.
According to former ICMR scientist Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, HMPV is definitely not deadly, and there is, to date, no evidence of mortality or a severe transmission rate.
“We can say HMPV is definitely not deadly. Most infections are mild, and only in children who are less than five and those who are over 65. It can cause common cold-like symptoms for 4 to 5 days,” Gangakhedkar said.
“The virus may cause pneumonitis-like illness, but the mortality rates are almost unknown so far. HMPV has a global prevalence of about 4 per cent,” he added.

Title: Glad to know about Microsoft’s ambitious expansion, investment plans in India: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:02:56 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella on Monday, said he was glad to know about the tech giant’s ambitious expansion and investment plans in India.
In a post on social media platform X, PM Modi said: “It was indeed a delight to meet you, @satyanadella! Glad to know about Microsoft’s ambitious expansion and investment plans in India. It was also wonderful discussing various aspects of tech, innovation and AI in our meeting”.
“Excited to build on our commitment to making India AI-first and work together on our continued expansion in the country to ensure every Indian benefits from this AI platform shift,” said the Microsoft CEO.
Microsoft is strengthening India’s rapidly growing developer community, enabling them to create products and services not only for the domestic market but also for global audiences. The company’s AI-powered platform, GitHub, plays a central role in fostering these innovations.
According to Nadella, India, currently home to the second-largest developer community on GitHub after the United States, is poised to surpass the US by 2027. The country also ranks second globally in creating generative AI projects on the platform.
Nadella noted last year that artificial intelligence could contribute 10% to India’s $5 trillion economy target by 2025. To facilitate this, Microsoft is set to provide AI-related skilling opportunities to 2 million individuals in India by 2025.
India’s focus on AI development received a major boost with the launch of the IndiaAI Mission last year. The Union Cabinet, under the leadership of PM Modi, approved an allocation of over ₹10,300 crore to strengthen the country’s AI ecosystem.

Title: Canada PM Trudeau says he will step down after new Liberal party leader named
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 16:23:07 +0000
Content: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.
 
Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March 24.
 
That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on Jan. 20 when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada’s economy.
 
“I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process,” Trudeau said. “This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election.”
 
Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won reelection twice, becoming one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers.
 
But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.
 
Polls show the Liberals will badly lose to the official opposition Conservatives in an election that must be held by late October, regardless of who the leader is.
 
Parliament was due to resume on Jan. 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March. But if parliament does not return until March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.
 
Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year.
 
But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending.
 
Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of “political gimmicks” rather than focusing on what was best for the country.
 
The Conservatives are led by Pierre Poilievre, a career politician who rose to prominence in early 2022 when he supported truck drivers who took over the center of Ottawa as part of a protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Content: The National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC) has commenced a three-day roadshow in the UAE, running from January 6 to 8, 2024.
 
The initiative aims to strengthen industrial partnerships and explore successful infrastructure models to further India’s industrial development.
 
The 12-member delegation, led by NICDC CEO and Managing Director Rajat Kumar Saini, includes representatives from various Indian states and Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). A central focus of the roadshow is promoting investment opportunities in India’s Greenfield Industrial Smart Cities, part of the ambitious National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP).
 
The delegation will have high level meetings  with senior executives from prominent entities such as DP World, TECOM, and Meydan Free Zone, engaging in discussions on logistics, industrialization, and infrastructure.
 
A key highlight of the visit will be an in-depth study of the operations at Jebel Ali Port, particularly its port-led industrialization model, automated systems, and multi-modal connectivity. The insights gained are expected to inform NICDC’s efforts in developing world-class industrial smart cities across India.
 
The NICDP has already achieved significant milestones, with approximately 370 plots across 1,477 acres allotted to investors, attracting commitments worth ₹1.70 lakh crore (US $20.48 billion).
 
Infrastructure development in cities like Dholera (Gujarat) and Shendra-Bidkin (Maharashtra) has made notable progress, with 82 units, including major international companies like Hyosung and Haier, now operational.
 
The program also includes 12 newly approved industrial cities across India, spanning locations from Khurpia in Uttarakhand to Palakkad in Kerala.
 
These cities are designed to incorporate cutting-edge amenities, including uninterrupted power supply, advanced water treatment systems, and a “Walk to Work” concept, underscoring India’s bid to establish itself as a global manufacturing hub.
 
This UAE roadshow underscores India’s commitment to fostering international collaboration and attracting foreign investment to drive its industrial growth and modernization.

The police vehicle in which the victims were travelling was hit by a blast in the Bijapur district of the state on Monday, a police statement said.
The nine were traveling through Kutra in the Bastar region in a Scorpio SUV when the attack took place around 2.15 p.m. on Monday, sources said.
Earlier on Sunday, security forces attacked Maoists in the Abujhmad region of Chhattisgarh and killed four rebels, including two women.

The escalation in violence comes a day after four Maoists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region on Sunday, adding that a jawan also died in action.
A head constable of the District Reserve Guard (DRG), Sannu Karam, died in the encounter, which broke out on Saturday evening in a forest in south Abujhmaad.
The encounter began when a joint team of security personnel was on an anti-Maoist operation, said an official.
After the firing stopped, the bodies of four Maoists were found. The security forces recovered automatic weapons, including an AK-47 rifle and a self-loading rifle (SLR) from the spot.
A search operation is underway in the area, the officials added. More details were awaited.

Content: Republican President-elect Donald Trump has promised to grant clemency to at least some of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.
Trump has said he expects to begin doing so shortly after he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20, but has not been specific about how many of the more than 1,580 people charged in the attack could be granted clemency. Here is what you need to know.
WHICH JAN. 6 DEFENDANTS COULD BE GRANTED CLEMENCY?
Trump has sent mixed messages about who might get clemency. At times he has suggested “many” will, though he has also signaled there could be exceptions for those who “got out of control.”
“I expect he will be very quick and very broad in what he does,” said John Pierce, a defense attorney who has represented more than 50 of the Jan. 6 defendants.
“If he does not issue essentially a blanket pardon on day 1, I think he will face a lot of backlash.”
MISDEMEANOR OFFENDERS
The largest category of Jan. 6 offenders who legal experts believe are most likely to be issued pardons are the people who were charged with misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing or parading on Capitol grounds, but were not accused of any violence.
Some high-profile defendants who faced only misdemeanor charges include Cowboys for Trump founder and former Republican elected official Couy Griffin of New Mexico, and Rebecca Lavrenz, nicknamed the “J6 Praying Grandma” whom Trump has said was “unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ.”
In theory, Trump could issue a blanket pardon to cover all Jan. 6 defendants who were charged or convicted of misdemeanors.
VIOLENT OFFENDERS
More than 170 people were charged with using a deadly weapon or injuring police in the Jan. 6 attack.
That group includes Julian Khater, who was sentenced to more than six years in prison for carrying out a pepper-spray attack on Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and two others. Sicknick died the next day, and a medical examiner attributed his death to natural causes.
Legal experts say those offenders may have a harder time winning clemency.
SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY AND ALLEGED LEADERS
The murkiest category of defendants who could win clemency from Trump are those who were convicted of serious crimes such as seditious conspiracy, but were not necessarily accused of violence.
This would include defendants including Oath Keepers Founder Stewart Rhodes and former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio.
Neither Rhodes nor Tarrio entered the Capitol on the day of the attack, but they inspired their members with violent rhetoric and juries convicted them of plotting to overthrow the government.
James Lee Bright, one of Rhodes’ former defense attorneys, said he believes his ex-client should be treated as a non-violent offender when it comes to weighing potential pardons.
“He never had a weapon. He never gave an order. He never touched an officer. He never went in the Rotunda,” Bright said.
WHAT CLEMENCY ACTIONS COULD TRUMP TAKE?
Presidents have broad clemency powers. The most well-known type of clemency is a pardon, which typically restores certain civil rights to a convicted felon such as the right to vote and to bear arms.
Pardons would still be beneficial to defendants who are already out of prison after serving their sentence, such as Jacob Chansley, nicknamed “the QAnon Shaman” who became the face of the attack after entering the Capitol wearing face paint and a furry horned hat.
To date, the Justice Department said more than 700 defendants have either completed their prison terms or were never sentenced to incarceration.
Presidents can also grant amnesty, a type of pardon that is extended more broadly to an entire class of people for certain offenses.
Another option Trump could also consider is granting commutations, rather than pardons, to some of the Jan. 6 offenders.
A commutation reduces a person’s sentence, but does not forgive the crime.
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR RELEASE FROM CUSTODY AFTER A PARDON OR COMMUTATION?
While individual inmates can be released from custody on the same day a pardon is granted, larger-scale clemency actions by a president can take more time to implement.
That was the case in December, when Biden in a new single-day record issued nearly 1,500 commutations.
Biden did not fully commute their sentences, meaning those defendants will still be required to comply with other terms such as paying restitution or being monitored by a probation officer.
Knowing it would take time and manpower to process so many individuals, the White House gave the Bureau of Prisons 10 days to complete the task.
Since the Jan. 20 Inauguration Day is a federal holiday and the Bureau of Prisons offices are closed, it will not be able to start processing any of Trump’s clemency orders until the following day.

Title: Smriti to lead India as Harmanpreet rested from Women’s ODIS against Ireland
Publication Date: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 11:28:44 +0000
Content: India have rested captain Harmanpreet Kaur and fast bowler Renuka Singh Thakur for the upcoming three-match women’s ODI series against Ireland, set to begin on January 10 at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot.
In Harmanpreet’s absence, left-handed opener Smriti Mandhana will be India’s captain, while senior all-rounder Deepti Sharma will serve as the vice-captain. Smriti had a productive 2024 with the bat – making 736 runs in 21 T20I innings and amassing 747 runs in 13 ODIs.
The three-match series, starting on January 10, followed by matches on January 12 and 15, is India’s first international assignment of this year. For the first time since 2006, India will be playing Ireland in a bilateral women’s ODI series.
With Harmanpreet and Renuka rested, India have included batter Raghvi Bist, who made her T20I debut against the West Indies last month in Navi Mumbai and pacer Sayali Satghare, who was in the squad when the hosts’ beat New Zealand 2-1 in Ahmedabad last year.
Interestingly, India have not included opener Shafali Verma and pace-bowling all-rounder Arundhati Reddy for the ODI series against Ireland, with the duo currently playing in the Senior Women’s 50-over Challenger Trophy in Chennai.
So far, Smriti Mandhana has captained Team India (Women) just once against the New Zealand in October 2024, in which the host team won by a margin of 59 runs. Thus, it will be a good chance for the southpaw to prove her mantle as the successor of 36-year old regular captain of Team India Harmanpreet Kaur.
The upcoming ODI series against Ireland continues India’s quest to fine-tune their combinations and zero in on their players who will be a part of their 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup campaign, which they will host later this year. It will be the fourth time India will be hosting a Women’s ODI World Cup.
India’s squad: Smriti Mandhana (C), Deepti Sharma (VC), Pratika Rawal, Harleen Deol, Jemimah Rodrigues, Uma Chetry (wk), Richa Ghosh (wk), Tejal Hasabnis, Raghvi Bist, Minnu Mani, Priya Mishra, Tanuja Kanwer, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor, and Sayali Satghare

Title: Empowering tomorrow: The clean promise of hydrogen
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 07:21:14 +0000
Content: Hydrogen is increasingly taking centre stage as nations and industries launch action plans to reduce carbon emissions and meet urgent climate targets. This naturally occurring gas, abundant yet commonly found within other compounds, holds the potential to serve as a clean and adaptable energy source, with its cleaner version developed through renewables-driven processes.
From large-scale industrial operations to transport, hydrogen, whether liquid or gaseous, can power numerous applications. Most notably, it provides a compelling alternative to fossil fuels in decarbonising the global economy, especially in energy-intensive sectors such as steel manufacturing, oil refining, chemical production, and metallurgy. As renewable energy capacity expands, hydrogen’s role as a complementary fuel grows even more significant.
Hydrogen: Availability
Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe: approximately 90% of all atoms are hydrogen. However, on Earth, it rarely exists as a single element; instead, it is typically bound to other atoms (for instance, in water or organic compounds). Producing hydrogen thus requires releasing it from these compounds, an energy-intensive process.
At present, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency, about 75 million tonnes of hydrogen is produced in pure gaseous form, with another 45 million tonnes appearing as part of other gas compounds, equivalent to 3% of global demand.
Currently, most hydrogen is produced as “grey hydrogen,” derived from fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.
Grey, Blue, and Green Hydrogen
Different types of hydrogen — grey, blue, and green — are classified based on their production methods and related carbon emissions:

Grey Hydrogen: Created from fossil fuels (mostly coal or natural gas) through steam methane reforming (SMR) or coal gasification. This process emits substantial carbon dioxide, making it carbon-intensive.
Blue Hydrogen: Also generated from fossil fuels, but with the critical distinction that carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored, thereby cutting overall emissions. Blue hydrogen is often considered a transitional solution, as it utilises the existing grey hydrogen infrastructure alongside carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies.
Green Hydrogen: Produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis powered by renewable sources such as solar or wind. This method yields no direct carbon emissions, with water as the only by-product, making green hydrogen genuinely clean. Once economies of scale are reached, and as production, storage, and transport costs decline, green hydrogen could replace more expensive, polluting fossil fuels in many industrial sectors.

Blue hydrogen can be viewed as a stepping stone on the path to fully clean green hydrogen production, since many industries already use grey hydrogen methods. Simply adding carbon capture and storage infrastructure supports a rapid move towards blue hydrogen, cutting emissions while the global market for green hydrogen continues to develop.
According to McKinsey’s Global Energy Perspective 2023, nearly all currently used hydrogen is grey. Forecasts, however, indicate a turning point after 2025, when new hydrogen production is predicted to be predominantly clean.
By 2030, industries now relying on grey hydrogen are projected to increase their use of clean hydrogen by 30%. Throughout the following decade (2030–2040), new sectors and applications are expected to appear, pushing demand even higher. Post-2040, this demand should rise significantly as public and private commitments to carbon neutrality intensify, resulting in a projected total demand of 125–585 million tonnes per annum of clean hydrogen by 2050.
By 2050, the global hydrogen supply mix is anticipated to undergo a dramatic shift, with green hydrogen comprising 50–65% of supply and blue hydrogen accounting for 20–35%.
Meanwhile, green hydrogen production costs are set to drop by 30% by 2030, thanks to technological advancements, improved infrastructure, and economies of scale, while grey hydrogen is likely to become more expensive as carbon costs escalate. An additional round of sizeable cost reductions between 2030 and 2050 could drive production expenses as low as USD 1.5 per kg.
Growing Global Demand and Investment
Soaring demand for clean energy is prompting substantial investment in hydrogen technologies. As of December 2023, more than 1,400 green hydrogen projects are under development worldwide, drawing around USD 570 billion in direct investment, according to McKinsey. Of this, approximately USD 193 billion has been committed in Europe alone. The European Union aims to invest a further USD 430 billion in green hydrogen by 2030, underlining its dedication to a low-carbon future.
Since the pre-industrial era, global temperatures have already risen by 1.1°C, and thorough decarbonisation with net-zero emissions is the only way to restrict further temperature increases within 1.5°C. The International Renewable Energy Agency identifies clean hydrogen as a key component for mitigating the effects of climate change, alongside energy efficiency, electrification, and renewables. While these three measures could together deliver 70% of the emission reductions required, clean hydrogen could account for an additional 10%, taking a 12% share of final energy demand.
India’s Hydrogen Mission
The nation has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, ensuring that any remaining greenhouse gases are offset by carbon capture or other mitigation measures. In addition, India plans to reduce its GDP’s emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 and cut one billion tonnes from its cumulative emissions by the same year.
To boost these environmental ambitions, India intends to produce 500 gigawatts of energy, about half its total capacity, from renewable sources. By 2047, the country aims to be energy independent, cutting down its current average annual energy import bill of USD 160 billion, which could double to USD 320 billion within 15 years without suitable clean alternatives.
Under the guidance of the Government of India and NITI Aayog, the country has set its sights on becoming the world’s most economical source of green hydrogen by 2030, targeting production costs of USD 1 per kilogram, to further focus down on energy independence ambition.
Estimates suggest that India’s green hydrogen market could be valued at USD 8 billion by 2030, soaring to USD 340 billion by 2050. By mid-century, India may meet 10% of global green hydrogen demand, establishing itself as both a clean energy frontrunner and an exporter of zero-carbon products.
Challenges to Widespread Adoption
Despite hydrogen’s cosmic abundance, turning it into a widely available, cost-effective energy source remains challenging. Major strides are needed in electrolysis technology, carbon capture, hydrogen storage and transport infrastructure, and scaling up renewable power generation.
Nonetheless, international cooperation, including substantial investments from Europe, India, and elsewhere, points to a swiftly expanding role for hydrogen in the energy transition.
Notably, India has introduced a ‘National Green Hydrogen Mission’, with a budget allocation of INR 19,744 crore up to 2029–2030, aimed at supporting the research, development, and deployment of green hydrogen. Policymakers foresee a future in which India minimises its environmental impact while also becoming a major exporter of green hydrogen and related technologies.
Hydrogen Towards a Greener Future
Hydrogen, whether in gaseous or liquid form, presents a promising route to cut emissions in electricity generation, transport, and other high-emission industries.
Progressing from grey hydrogen to blue, and ultimately to green, will help curb global greenhouse gas emissions, boost energy self-sufficiency, and foster fresh economic opportunities across numerous sectors. From Europe’s large-scale investments to India’s ambition of becoming the world’s most cost-competitive green hydrogen producer, momentum behind this versatile energy resource is quickly gathering pace.
Yet, realising widespread adoption demands collective efforts from governments, industries, and research bodies. Building the necessary infrastructure, driving down production costs, and resolving technical hurdles are essential next steps. If these challenges are addressed, hydrogen energy, particularly in its clean, green form, could well become a defining pillar of a sustainable, zero-carbon future.

Title: RBI increased gold reserves by 8 tonnes in November amid safe-haven demand
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 07:07:00 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bought eight tonnes of gold in November 2024 as central banks around the world continued their buying spree with a collective purchase of 53 tonnes of the precious metal during the month, according to the latest World Gold Council (WGC) report.
The decline in gold prices during November, following the US election, may have provided some central banks with the added impetus to accumulate the precious metal, the report pointed out.
RBI has, like other central banks, been buying gold as a safe-haven asset. The strategy of holding gold is primarily aimed at hedging against inflation and reducing foreign currency risks, especially in times of uncertainty triggered by geopolitical tensions.
With the addition of eight tonnes of gold to its reserves in November, the RBI has increased its buying to 73 tonnes in the first 11 months of 2024 and its total gold holdings to 876 tonnes, maintaining its position as the second largest buyer during the year after Poland.
The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has resumed gold purchases after a six-month gap, adding five tonnes of gold to its reserves, increasing its year-to-date net purchases to 34 tonnes and its total reported gold holdings to 2,264 tonnes (5 per cent of total reserves), the report said.
Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore was the month’s largest seller, reducing its gold reserves by 5 tonnes, bringing the year-to-date net sales to 7 tonnes and overall gold holdings to 223 tonnes, it added.
The RBI’s gold purchases have shot up by five-fold over the quantity of the precious metal bought in the same period of 2023, according to WGC figures.
According to the data, the RBI’s total gold reserves have now gone up to 876 tonnes, of which 510 tonnes are held in India.
According to WGC, the central banks that bought gold during the month are those of Poland adding 21 tonnes and Uzbekistan buying nine tonnes.
These large purchases of gold by central banks have also been driving up prices of the precious metal in the global market.
More than half of the RBI’s gold reserves are held overseas in secure custody with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements, while approximately a third is stored in the RBI’s vaults in Nagpur and Mumbai.
The Reserve Bank shifted 100 metric tonnes of its gold kept in bank vaults in the United Kingdom to its own vaults in India in 2024 as there was enough domestic storage capacity in the country.
The shifting of the gold reserves is expected to result in a saving in the high fees that were paid for the use of vaults in the UK.

Title: Education minister Pradhan releases draft UGC regulations 2025 for teacher appointments and promotions
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:51:06 +0000
Content: Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan unveiled the draft UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment and Promotion of Teachers and Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2025, at a ceremony in New Delhi on Monday.
Addressing the gathering, Pradhan highlighted the transformative nature of the draft regulations, emphasizing that they would introduce flexibility, inclusivity, and dynamism to the Indian higher education system.
One of the key aspects of the draft regulations is the flexibility they offer to candidates seeking teaching careers. Under the new guidelines, individuals will have the opportunity to pursue teaching roles in subjects they qualify for, based on their NET/SET qualifications, even if those subjects are different from their previous academic degrees. Moreover, the regulations prioritize Ph.D. specialisation, enabling a more specialized approach to teaching and research.
The regulations also place a strong emphasis on promoting the use of Indian languages in academic publications and degree programs.
Another major shift is the transition from traditional score-based shortlisting methods to a more holistic evaluation system. This new approach will consider a broader range of qualifications, including ‘Notable Contributions,’ offering a fairer assessment of candidates’ qualifications beyond just numerical scores.
The draft guidelines open new avenues for a more diverse talent pool in academic institutions. Dedicated recruitment pathways will be created for experts in arts, sports, and traditional disciplines, allowing institutions to tap into a wider range of expertise. In line with the spirit of inclusivity, the regulations offer opportunities for accomplished sportspersons, including those with disabilities, to enter the teaching profession. This initiative is expected to increase representation and participation from diverse backgrounds in academia.
Pradhan also underscored the importance of enhanced governance, particularly in the selection process for Vice-Chancellors. The new guidelines propose a revision of eligibility criteria for Vice-Chancellor appointments, ensuring greater transparency and fairness. The promotion process for academic staff has also been simplified, with a focus on essential factors such as teaching quality, research output, and overall academic contributions. This streamlining is designed to make the career progression of academic staff more straightforward and merit-based.
Professional development remains a priority, which encourage continuous learning and skill enhancement for teachers through faculty development programs.
Additionally, the regulations propose enhanced transparency and accountability across the entire academic ecosystem. By instituting clearer and more open processes for recruitment, promotion, and grievance redressal, the regulations aim to ensure fairness and integrity in the academic system.
At the event, Pradhan also expressed his pride in the UGC’s decision to name the new auditorium ‘Pushpagiri,’ in honor of the ancient intellectual heritage of Odisha. He noted that Pushpagiri, once a cradle of knowledge and enlightenment in Jajpur, Odisha, was an ideal name for the auditorium, reflecting India’s rich academic and cultural history.

Title: UK politicians urge England to boycott Afghanistan match over treatment of women
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:42:12 +0000
Content: A group of British lawmakers urged England to boycott their Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan next month, saying the country’s cricket board (ECB) needed to take a stand against the Taliban’s crackdown on women.
Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 it has clamped down on the rights of women and girls, restricting their access to education and work, curbing their freedom of movement, and forcing them to cover their faces and bodies.
Women and girls have also been barred from sports and gyms, a breach of the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) rules. The Afghanistan women’s team was also disbanded, with several members fleeing the country after 2021.
England are scheduled to face Afghanistan in a group-stage match on Feb. 26 in Lahore, Pakistan.
A letter signed by more than 160 politicians on Monday called for England’s players and officials to speak out against the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan.
“We also urge the ECB to consider a boycott of the upcoming match against Afghanistan in the ICC Champions Trophy Group stage on February 26th to send a clear signal that such grotesque abuses will not be tolerated,” the letter added.
ECB chief executive Richard Gould responded by calling for a uniform approach from all member nations towards Afghanistan’s participation in international cricket.
“The ECB strongly condemns the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime,” Gould said.
“The ICC Constitution mandates that all member nations are committed to the growth and development of women’s cricket. In line with this commitment, the ECB has maintained its position of not scheduling any bilateral cricket matches against Afghanistan.
“While there has not been a consensus on further international action within the ICC, the ECB will continue to actively advocate for such measures. A coordinated, ICC-wide approach would be significantly more impactful than unilateral actions by individual members.”
England previously faced Afghanistan at the 50-overs Cricket World Cup in 2023, as well as at the Twenty20 World Cup in 2022.
Last year, Australia called off a T20 series against Afghanistan citing the deteriorating human rights situation for women.

Title: India logs 9.1% jump in automobile sales in 2024 with growth in most segments
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:35:29 +0000
Content: India’s retail automobile sales witnessed a robust 9.1% growth in 2024, reaching 2.61 crore units, overcoming hurdles such as extreme weather conditions, elections, and uneven monsoons, according to data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA).
Segment-wise, two-wheeler sales registered a notable 10.7% increase, while three-wheelers grew by 10.4%, passenger vehicles by 5.1%, and tractors by 2.5%. However, the commercial vehicle segment remained nearly flat, with a marginal growth of 0.07%.
Three-wheelers, passenger vehicles, and tractors achieved record-high sales in 2024, while two-wheelers nearly matched their 2018 peak. Commercial vehicles, however, are yet to surpass their 2018 levels.
FADA highlighted several challenges faced by the industry, including financing constraints and competition from electric vehicles affecting internal combustion engine two-wheelers. Meanwhile, commercial vehicle sales were impacted by election-related uncertainty and reduced infrastructure spending. Passenger vehicle sales faced margin pressures due to higher inventory and increased discounts.
Despite the annual growth, December 2024 saw an overall 12.4% decline in retail automobile sales compared to the previous year. Two-wheelers recorded a significant 17.6% drop, three-wheelers declined by 4.5%, passenger vehicles by 1.9%, and commercial vehicles by 5.2%. The tractor segment, however, stood out with a 25.7% year-on-year growth in December.
Looking ahead, FADA said that nearly 48% of automobile dealers expect growth in January 2025, while 41.22% anticipate flat sales, and 10.69% foresee a slowdown. The two-wheeler segment could benefit from improved minimum support prices (MSP) and better rural liquidity, though challenges like financing and the shift to electric vehicles persist.
Passenger vehicles are expected to see a boost from new launches, marriage-season demand, and promotional activities, but potential price hikes could limit growth.
In the long term, optimism prevails for 2025, with 66% of dealers projecting growth, 26.72% expecting stability, and only 6.87% anticipating a downturn.
“FADA remains optimistic that market recovery, coupled with strategic OEM support and policy-level clarity, will enable the automotive retail industry to conclude 2025 on a strong note,” the industry body said.

Title: ECI set to announce Delhi assembly election schedule
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:00:28 +0000
Content: The Election Commission of India (ECI) is set to announce the much-anticipated schedule for the 70-member Delhi Assembly elections on Tuesday.
The announcement will be made during a press conference at 2 PM in the Plenary Hall of Vigyan Bhawan, setting the stage for a highly competitive election season in the national capital.
The current term of the Delhi Assembly is set to expire on February 23, 2025, requiring the entire election process to be completed before this date.
As part of the preparations, the ECI released a revised voter list on Monday, showing a significant increase in the voter base.
The number of registered voters in Delhi has risen from 1,53,57,529 in October 2024 to 1,55,24,858 by December 2024, reflecting the addition of 1,67,329 new voters.
The ECI has also issued a caution against the submission of false or fabricated documents for obtaining voter IDs, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.
With the announcement of the election schedule imminent, the political battleground in Delhi is already heating up. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has declared candidates for all 70 seats.
Party chief and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is once again contesting from the New Delhi seat, while current Chief Minister Atishi will be running from the Kalkaji seat.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also released its first list of 29 candidates, featuring prominent names.
Former AAP ministers Kailash Gahlot and Raj Kumar Anand will contest from Bijwasan and Patel Nagar, respectively, while former Congress leader Arvind Singh Lovely is set to run from Gandhi Nagar. Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma, son of former Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma, has been fielded against Kejriwal in the high-profile New Delhi seat.
Former South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri will face a tough battle against Chief Minister Atishi in Kalkaji, with the BJP aiming to make significant inroads in this key constituency.
In the prestigious New Delhi seat, voters will witness a three-way contest between AAP, BJP, and Congress.
While Kejriwal leads AAP, the BJP has fielded Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma, and Congress has nominated Sandeep Dikshit, son of former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, to challenge Kejriwal.
The Kalkaji seat is also expected to see a closely contested fight, with BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri taking on Chief Minister Atishi. Congress has announced Alka Lamba as its candidate for the same constituency.
The Congress party, which has so far announced 48 candidates, is expected to release additional names in the coming days as the race intensifies.
With political momentum building, all eyes are now on the ECI’s announcement, which will officially kick-start the countdown to what promises to be a fierce electoral contest in Delhi.

Title: Powerful Tibet earthquake, near Nepal, kills at least 53
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 05:53:52 +0000
Content: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet’s holiest cities on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, killing at least 53 people and shaking buildings in neighbouring Nepal, Bhutan and India.
The quake hit at 9:05 a.m. (0105 GMT), with its epicentre located in Tingri, a rural Chinese county known as the northern gateway to the Everest region, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The U.S. Geological Service put the quake’s magnitude at 7.1.
At least 53 people had been killed and 62 injured on the Tibetan side, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
A magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in 2015, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in Nepal’s worst ever earthquake. Among the dead were at least 18 people killed at the Mount Everest base camp when it was smashed by an avalanche.
Tuesday’s epicentre was around 80 km (50 miles) north of Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain and a popular destination for climbers and trekkers.
Winter is not a popular season for climbers and hikers in Nepal, with a German climber the lone mountaineer with a permit to climb Mount Everest. He had already left the base camp after failing to reach the summit, Lilathar Awasthi, a Department of Tourism official, said.
Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) said the tremors were felt in seven hill districts bordering Tibet.
“So far we have not received any information of any loss of life and property,” NDRRMA spokesman Dizan Bhattarai told Reuters. “We have mobilised police, security forces and local authorities to collection information,” he said.
Many villages in the Nepalese border area, which are sparsely populated, are remote and can only be reached by foot.
AFTERSHOCKS, DAMAGE
The impact of the temblor was felt across the Shigatse region of Tibet, home to 800,000 people. The region is administered by Shigatse city, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said all-out search and rescue efforts should be carried out to minimise casualties, properly resettle the affected people, and ensure a safe and warm winter.
Villages in Tingri reported strong shaking during the quake, which was followed by dozens of aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.4.
Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video on social media showing the aftermath from the town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road.
Reuters was able to confirm the location from nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery.
There are three townships and 27 villages within 20 km (12 miles) of the epicentre, with a total population of around 6,900, Xinhua reported. Local government officials were liaising with nearby towns to gauge the impact of the quake and check for casualties, it added.
Tremors were also felt in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu some 400 km (250 miles) away, where residents ran from their houses.
The quake also jolted Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal.
So far, no reports of any damage or loss to property have been received, officials in India said.

Title: India’s GDP growth pegged at 6.4% for 2024-25
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 14:46:57 +0000
Content: India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6.4% in the financial year 2024-25, down from the 8.2% growth recorded in 2023-24, according to the first advance estimates released by the Ministry of Statistics on Tuesday.
This projection is lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) recent estimate of 6.6% for the current fiscal year. Despite this, India continues to retain its position as the fastest-growing major economy globally, while China’s growth rate is projected to fall below 5%.
The agriculture, construction, and services sectors have recorded a growth in performance compared to the previous year. Agriculture and allied sectors are estimated to grow by 3.8% in 2024-25, up from 1.4% in 2023-24. The construction sector and financial, real estate, and professional services sectors are projected to grow by 8.6% and 7.3%, respectively.
Private final consumption expenditure has increased by 7.3% during the fiscal year, up from 4% in the previous year, the official statement noted. The Government’s final consumption expenditure has also grown at a rate of 4.1% compared to 2.5% in the previous fiscal year, contributing to overall economic demand.
Releasing the first advance estimates for 2024-25, the National Statistical Office (NSO) stated, “Real GDP has been estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY2024-25 as compared to the growth rate of 8.2% in Provisional Estimate (PE) of GDP for FY2023-24.”
The estimates come ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25 and emphasize the importance of continued investments in infrastructure projects and sustained focus on agriculture.
India’s economy grew at 5.4% in the second quarter (July-September) of 2023-24, reflecting a slowdown compared to the previous quarter. This prompted the RBI to revise its annual growth projection for the year to 6.6%, down from 7.2%.

Title: Digital Personal Data Protection Rules Focus on Citizen Rights, Says PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:45:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, align with India’s objective of citizen-focused governance by aiming to protect personal data while supporting economic growth and inclusivity.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister referred to Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s explanation of the draft rules, which are designed to safeguard personal data and empower individuals.
Union Minister Vaishnaw said that the proposed rules position India as a leader in defining global data governance frameworks.
“Our approach is pragmatic and growth-focused. This ensures that citizens’ data is protected without hindering the innovation driving startups and businesses. Compliance requirements for small businesses and startups will also be reduced,” the Minister remarked.
He further referenced India’s vision of a “human-centric” future, an idea shared by Prime Minister Modi at the recent United Nations Summit of the Future.
“This vision is at the core of the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules. Once finalised, these rules will implement the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, affirming our commitment to ensuring citizens’ right to data protection,” Vaishnaw added.
The rules aim to simplify processes and make it easier for all citizens to understand their rights, regardless of technical expertise.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology published the draft rules for feedback on Friday, with input being accepted via the MyGov portal until February 18, 2025.
The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, passed in August 2023, mandates that data fiduciaries secure parental consent before processing children’s personal data. The rules specify that data fiduciaries must confirm parental identity through government-issued IDs or digital identity services like Digital Lockers.
This requirement seeks to enhance privacy protection for children using social media platforms, including Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, and X.
In case of a data breach, fiduciaries are required to promptly inform affected individuals in clear and straightforward terms.
The draft rules also outline restrictions for processing personal data outside India. Any transfer of such data must adhere to conditions specified by the government, particularly in cases involving foreign states or entities under their jurisdiction.

Title: Rajnath Singh to meet Maldivian defence minister to review bilateral defence cooperation
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:07:34 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will hold a crucial bilateral meeting with Maldives Defence Minister Mohammed Ghassan Maumoon in New Delhi on January 8, 2025. The discussions will focus on enhancing defence cooperation between India and the Maldives, specifically in areas such as training, joint exercises, defence projects, and supply of equipment to bolster the capabilities of the Maldives National Defence Forces (MNDF).
Maumoon is scheduled to visit India for a three-day trip from January 8 to 10. During his stay, he will also visit Goa and Mumbai to further strengthen ties between the two nations.
According to a press release from the Ministry of Defence, the two Ministers will review various aspects of the bilateral defence relationship, including ongoing training programs, regular military exercises, defence initiatives, and seminars aimed at enhancing MNDF’s operational readiness. Additionally, discussions will cover the supply of defence equipment and stores to the Maldives.
India and the Maldives share deep-rooted historical, cultural, and linguistic ties, with the Maldives holding a special place in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. This policy aims to foster stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Both nations play pivotal roles in ensuring the safety and security of the region, in line with India’s broader vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).
The meeting comes on the heels of a significant diplomatic development, as Maldives’ Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdulla Khaleel, wrapped up his first official visit to India earlier this week. The visit included high-level talks and the signing of critical agreements aimed at boosting bilateral development cooperation.
Among the key achievements was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP). The MoU launched the third phase of cooperation between India and the Maldives, designed to deliver tangible benefits to communities at the grassroots level and further solidify the enduring partnership between the two nations.
Khaleel’s visit also included discussions with India’s Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, where they explored new areas of collaboration, particularly in development projects, infrastructure, and socio-economic initiatives. Khaleel expressed gratitude for India’s continued support in addressing the fiscal challenges faced by the Maldives, underscoring the significance of this partnership in promoting economic stability.

Title: Delhi’s Ballot Box Battles: 70 Years of Wins and Upsets
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:33:30 +0000
Content: After Independence, Delhi, then a Part-C State, was granted an assembly that was disbanded in 1956. The assembly had 48 members. According to data sourced from the Election Commission of India, the story begins in 1951 with a handful of prominent parties vying for public endorsement.
The All-India Bhartiya Jan Sangh (BJS), contesting 31 seats, won five and earned a vote share of 21.89 per cent. The Indian National Congress (INC), contesting on 47 seats, won 39 with a 52.09 per cent vote share, establishing an early pattern of Congress dominance. Smaller contenders included the Socialist Party (SP), which contested six seats and won two, as well as the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (HMS), which got one seat. Independents also featured prominently, with 78 of them contesting but only one emerged victorious.
Delhi was given a Municipal Council in 1966. It had 56 members. The council had no legislative powers and functioned as an advisory institution with recommendatory powers. It was run by a Lieutenant Governor (or Administrator) appointed by the President of India. The council had one interim and four subsequent terms until 1990.
The 1972 Delhi election saw the BJS field 56 candidates and secure five victories, with a 38.47 per cent vote share. The INC got 44 out of 52 contested seats and with a 48.54 per cent vote share. The Communist Party of India (CPI) won three of the four seats it contested, with 3.86 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress (Organisation) captured two seats, while Independents collectively claimed two seats out of 104 contests.
The year 1977 was a watershed election for Delhi and India. The Janata Party (JNP), a coalition of political parties formed after the Emergency, entered the arena and dramatically shifted the balance of power by winning 46 of the 56 seats it contested, registering a substantial 52.5 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress, blamed for the Emergency, struggled in comparison, winning only 10 out of 52 seats and signalling a decline in its once formidable grip. This shift was a milestone in the broader trend of power alternating among key political outfits over the decades.
The year 1983 revealed further realignments. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), having evolved from the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh, fielded 50 candidates and won 19, with 36.99 per cent vote share. The INC, contesting 56 seats, came away with 34 victories and a 47.5 per cent share, indicating a measure of revived electoral strength. Meanwhile, the Janata Party struggled, winning only one of the 37 seats it contested, and the Lok Dal (LKD) picked up two wins out of six seats contested. The massive losses in the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, along with splits in the coalition, curtailed the political growth of the Janata Party in the country.
Delhi received its present legislative structure in 1992. Through Article 239AA of the Constitution of India, the National Capital Territory of Delhi was given an assembly with 70 elected members.
For Delhi, the second assembly election was organised in 1993. The BJP contested 70 seats and triumphed in 49, securing 42.82 per cent of the vote and reflecting an electoral shift towards the party. The INC, also contesting all 70 seats, won 14 and held a 34.48 per cent share. The Janata Dal (JD) got four seats with 12.65 per cent vote share, while independent candidates secured three seats.
By 1998, the power pendulum had once again moved. The BJP’s vote share of 34.02 per cent translated into 15 wins out of 67 seats it contested, whereas the INC improved its tally to 52 victories from 70 seats and earned 47.76 per cent of the vote. The Janata Dal got one and independent candidates got two seats.
In 2003, the BJP won 20 seats and with a 35.22 per cent vote share. The INC, meanwhile, won 47 seats and registered 48.13 per cent. Modest performances from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Janata Dal (Secular) also contributed to the overall contest that year.
By the next election in 2008, the BJP improved to 23 wins out of the 69 seats it contested, with a 36.34 per cent share, while the INC claimed 43 of 70 seats, with a 40.31 per cent vote share. The Bahujan Samaj Party, the Lok Jan Shakti Party, and a large number of independents also fielded many candidates, though only a handful succeeded in winning.
Another year of political change for Delhi came in 2013. Following the anti-corruption movement launched by Anna Hazare in 2011, with Delhi as its epicentre, the 2013 assembly elections saw the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
The party received a surprising welcome, winning 28 out of the 70 seats it contested with a vote share of 29.49 per cent. The BJP got 31 seats with a 33.07 per cent vote share. The INC slipped drastically to just eight wins and a 24.55 per cent share. Among smaller forces, the Janata Dal (United) and the Shiromani Akali Dal recorded single-seat victories.
The AAP formed the next government in Delhi with outside support from the INC, but it survived only for 49 days following the resignation of then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The party then chose to present itself as a national alternative, contesting 434 seats in 2014 Lok Sabha election, but could win just four seats in Punjab, and drew a blank in Delhi with Kejriwal losing against BJP’s candidate and prime-ministerial contender Narendra Modi from Varanasi.
The party again stormed back to power in the 2015 assembly elections, secuyring 67 of the 70 seats it contested with a 54.34 per cent vote share. The BJP won three seats, while other parties including the INC drew a blank. The BJP’s significant vote share, at 32.19 per cent, indicated that the INC was rapidly losing its grip on the capital city, which it had ruled for three consecutive terms under Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Before that, in 2014, the BJP had won all seven seats of the National Capital Region in the Lok Sabha polls.
The 2020 results offered a somewhat similar picture. AAP won 62 seats with 53.57 per cent of the total vote, followed by the BJP with eight seats and a 38.51 per cent vote share, while the INC repeated its previous cycle’s result of no seats and maintained a diminished 4.26 per cent share. As in 2014, the BJP also won all seven seats in Delhi in the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections while the INC and the AAP drew a blank.

Title: Bhashini-enabled e-shram portal now available in all 22 scheduled languages
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:11:31 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Labour & Employment and Youth Affairs & Sports, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, launched the multilingual functionality of the e-Shram portal on Tuesday in New Delhi, making it accessible in all 22 Scheduled Languages. This move aligns with the vision of making e-Shram a ‘One-Stop-Solution’ for unorganised workers in India, providing comprehensive social protection.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MEITY) Bhashini project was leveraged to upgrade the e-Shram portal, which previously supported only English, Hindi, Kannada, and Marathi. The portal now serves a broader perspective, ensuring that workers across the country can register and benefit from various government schemes in their native languages.
Dr. Mandaviya also highlighted the increasing trust in the e-Shram platform, with over 30,000 registrations per day by unorganised workers. He urged all unorganised workers to register on the portal to access a wide range of government schemes aimed at supporting their welfare, livelihood, and well-being.
The Minister emphasized that registering on e-Shram would unlock access to social security schemes, including twelve Government of India schemes currently available through the portal. To extend its outreach and ensure a user-friendly experience, he mentioned that the government plans to involve mediators like Common Service Centres, Bank Correspondents, Post Offices, and MY Bharat volunteers.
Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, further detailed efforts to make e-Shram a ‘One Stop Solution’ for social protection. She outlined ongoing initiatives, such as the registration of Building and Other Construction Workers (BoCW) and gig and platform workers, as well as plans to integrate State Government schemes.
The ministry is also working on launching an e-Shram Mobile App, introducing a Single Common Application Form, and integrating payment gateways to simplify access to social protection benefits.
The event marks a significant step toward strengthening the government’s commitment to enhancing social security for unorganised workers and improving their access to welfare services.

Title: Why does Trump want to end US daylight saving time?
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 11:53:12 +0000
Content: Daylight saving time, a practice affecting almost 400 million people across North America, is once again in the spotlight as debates over its necessity continue. This twice-a-year ritual of adjusting clocks forward in spring and back in autumn has been ingrained in American, Canadian and Cuban life for more than a century. However, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pushed for an end to daylight saving time, which he has called inconvenient and costly.
WHAT DID TRUMP SAY ABOUT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
Trump said his Republican Party would work to end daylight saving time after he takes office on Jan. 20.
“The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t!” Trump wrote on social media. “Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.”
Trump’s billionaire allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, whom he picked to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, have endorsed Trump’s plan.
In 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would make daylight saving time permanent. It stalled in the House of Representatives because lawmakers could not agree on whether to keep standard time or permanent daylight saving time.
Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, could revive the bill or introduce a new one.
WHEN DO THE CLOCKS CHANGE?
Any changes that Trump and the Republicans may enact probably would not take effect immediately.
Daylight saving time in the United States and some other countries is due to start on March 9 at 2 a.m. local time, meaning people will lose an hour of sleep. Mornings will be darker but it will stay light until later in the evening. Daylight saving time is scheduled to end on Nov. 2. The saying “spring forward, fall back” serves as a helpful reminder for adjusting clocks.
Daylight saving time in the United States always starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
In the UK and other European countries, daylight saving time, also known as summer time, begins on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. This year it will start on March 30 and end on Oct. 26.
WHEN IS THE SHORTEST DAY OF THE YEAR IN 2025?
The shortest day of 2025 will be on Dec. 21, which marks the winter solstice. Daylight hours vary significantly across latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Areas near the North Pole will be plunged into complete darkness while southern regions will still get more than 10 hours of sunshine.
WHY WAS DAYLIGHT SAVING CREATED IN THE US AND HOW DID IT START?
The modern idea of changing the clocks with the seasons can be traced back to at least the late 19th century, when New Zealand entomologist George Hudson proposed it to conserve energy and extend summer daylight hours, something that would have benefited his hobby of collecting insects after work. The idea was slow to gain traction until World War One, when European states sought any strategies to conserve fuel. Germany was the first country to adopt daylight saving time in 1916. The United States followed in 1918.
The practice went through many variations before the United States standardized it in 1966 in a law called the Uniform Time Act, which allows states to opt out of it but not to stay on daylight saving time permanently.
WHY IS DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CONTROVERSIAL?
A common myth is that the United States adopted daylight saving time to benefit farmers, but in reality many farmers are opposed to the practice for being disruptive to their schedules.
The original motivation to conserve fuel is also under debate, as studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the shift, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
Opponents point to other studies that have found adverse health effects linked to daylight saving time, such as a spike in fatal traffic accidents, heart attacks, strokes and sleep deprivation in the days after clocks are moved forward an hour every March.
A March 2023 YouGov poll found that 62% of Americans want to end the practice of changing clocks, though only 50% prefer to keep permanent daylight saving time.
DO ALL US STATES OBSERVE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
No. Hawaii and Arizona, with the exception of its Navajo Nation region, do not observe daylight saving time. The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also observe permanent standard time.
While daylight saving time is widespread across the United States, 19 states have passed legislation to permanently use daylight saving time if Congress were to allow it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Title: Delhi elections: JP Nadda urges people to choose govt that improves standard of living
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 10:56:22 +0000
Content: Union health minister and Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda on Tuesday welcomed the Election Commission of India’s announcement of the Delhi Assembly Elections and urged the people of Delhi to choose a government that focuses on providing quality services to make everyday life easier.
“Elections are the biggest festival of democracy and a medium to advance the country and the state on the path of development and good governance. I urge the people of Delhi to choose a government that focuses on improving the standard of living, combating corruption, reducing pollution, and providing quality services to make everyday life easier,” Nadda said in a post on X.
“Under the guidance of PM Modi ji, the BJP government has been continuously working towards the comprehensive development of Delhi and will further our efforts to turn the dream of a ‘Viksit Delhi’ into a reality,” he added.
Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva said that the people of Delhi were eagerly awaiting the election dates.
“February 5 is a date of change… The people who looted Delhi will be voted out, and the public will rid themselves of this ‘AAP-da.’ A double-engine government of the BJP will be formed on February 8,” Sachdeva said.
The Election Commission of India announced the dates for the polls to the Delhi Legislative Assembly. The elections will be held in a single phase on February 5, with the counting of votes scheduled for February 8.
The last date for filing nominations is January 17, and the scrutiny of nominations will take place on January 18. The last date for the withdrawal of candidature is January 20.
With the announcement of the election dates, the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) has come into force in the national capital and will remain in effect until the completion of the election process.
The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 consecutive years, has faced setbacks in the last two assembly elections, failing to win any seats. The AAP dominated the 2020 assembly elections by securing 62 out of 70 seats, while the BJP managed only eight seats.

Title: Union Minister Sonowal unveils ₹57,000 crore capacity to boost at Kandla Port
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:39:58 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal has announced two major initiatives aimed at enhancing the capacity of Kandla Port, involving a total investment of ₹57,000 crores. These projects include the construction of a new Mega Shipbuilding Facility and the development of a new cargo terminal outside Kandla Creek.
The Mega Shipbuilding Facility, with an investment of ₹30,000 crores, aims to create technical capabilities for manufacturing Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) or vessels of similar class with a capacity of up to 3,20,000 tonnes DWT. The facility will have the capacity to produce 32 new ships and repair 50 older ships annually. Spread over 8,000 acres, it will include a marina, fishing harbour, townships, and a marine industrial cluster.
The new cargo terminal, to be constructed near Tuna, will cost ₹27,000 crores and will add 135 MTPA capacity to Kandla Port. The terminal will utilize a six-kilometer waterfront and modern cargo-handling systems to manage dry bulk cargo. Existing cargo jetties will be converted into facilities for handling liquid cargo, which will streamline operations and reduce waiting times for liquid tanker vessels.
Minister Sonowal stated that the initiatives align with the government’s “Make in India, Make for the World” vision and contribute to achieving self-reliance in India’s maritime infrastructure.
In addition, the Deendayal Port Authority is undertaking several projects to enhance Kandla Port’s capacity. These include a mega cargo terminal with a capacity of 2.19 million TEUs under the PPP mode and a proposed multi-cargo terminal at Tuna Tekra that will add 18.33 MTPA capacity.
Three oil jetties and additional facilities for liquid cargo handling at Vadinar are also under construction, which will increase capacity by 24.5 MTPA. A ship repair facility capable of servicing 32 vessels annually is also planned at Vadinar.

Content: The Central Government has approved the establishment of a memorial dedicated to former President Pranab Mukherjee in the Rashtriya Smriti complex, situated in the Rajghat area of New Delhi.
Sharmistha Mukherjee, daughter of Pranab Mukherjee, shared a post on X, “I met PM Narendra Modi to convey my gratitude for the government’s decision to create a memorial for my father. It is especially meaningful because we did not request it. This gesture by the Prime Minister deeply moved me.”
Reflecting on her father’s views, she added, “He believed state honours should be offered, not sought. While it does not affect him now, for me as his daughter, it is heartening to see his memory being respected in this way.”
In December 2024, Sharmistha Mukherjee commented on the allocation of space for a memorial for former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. She said such matters should remain above political debate.
“It is our tradition to build memorials for former Prime Ministers. There have been exceptions, like PV Narasimha Rao, but given the contributions of Dr. Manmohan Singh, there should be no controversy. I also believe he should be awarded the Bharat Ratna,” she said.
Dr. Manmohan Singh passed away at the age of 92 at AIIMS, New Delhi, due to age-related issues. His cremation took place at Nigam Bodh Ghat in the presence of family members, colleagues, and government representatives. He was accorded full state honours during the ceremony.

Title: India’s GDP growth pegged at 6.4% for 2024-25
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 14:46:57 +0000
Content: India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6.4% in the financial year 2024-25, down from the 8.2% growth recorded in 2023-24, according to the first advance estimates released by the Ministry of Statistics on Tuesday.
This projection is lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) recent estimate of 6.6% for the current fiscal year. Despite this, India continues to retain its position as the fastest-growing major economy globally, while China’s growth rate is projected to fall below 5%.
The agriculture, construction, and services sectors have recorded a growth in performance compared to the previous year. Agriculture and allied sectors are estimated to grow by 3.8% in 2024-25, up from 1.4% in 2023-24. The construction sector and financial, real estate, and professional services sectors are projected to grow by 8.6% and 7.3%, respectively.
Private final consumption expenditure has increased by 7.3% during the fiscal year, up from 4% in the previous year, the official statement noted. The Government’s final consumption expenditure has also grown at a rate of 4.1% compared to 2.5% in the previous fiscal year, contributing to overall economic demand.
Releasing the first advance estimates for 2024-25, the National Statistical Office (NSO) stated, “Real GDP has been estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY2024-25 as compared to the growth rate of 8.2% in Provisional Estimate (PE) of GDP for FY2023-24.”
The estimates come ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25 and emphasize the importance of continued investments in infrastructure projects and sustained focus on agriculture.
India’s economy grew at 5.4% in the second quarter (July-September) of 2023-24, reflecting a slowdown compared to the previous quarter. This prompted the RBI to revise its annual growth projection for the year to 6.6%, down from 7.2%.

Title: Digital Personal Data Protection Rules Focus on Citizen Rights, Says PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:45:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, align with India’s objective of citizen-focused governance by aiming to protect personal data while supporting economic growth and inclusivity.
In a post on X, the Prime Minister referred to Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s explanation of the draft rules, which are designed to safeguard personal data and empower individuals.
Union Minister Vaishnaw said that the proposed rules position India as a leader in defining global data governance frameworks.
“Our approach is pragmatic and growth-focused. This ensures that citizens’ data is protected without hindering the innovation driving startups and businesses. Compliance requirements for small businesses and startups will also be reduced,” the Minister remarked.
He further referenced India’s vision of a “human-centric” future, an idea shared by Prime Minister Modi at the recent United Nations Summit of the Future.
“This vision is at the core of the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules. Once finalised, these rules will implement the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, affirming our commitment to ensuring citizens’ right to data protection,” Vaishnaw added.
The rules aim to simplify processes and make it easier for all citizens to understand their rights, regardless of technical expertise.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology published the draft rules for feedback on Friday, with input being accepted via the MyGov portal until February 18, 2025.
The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, passed in August 2023, mandates that data fiduciaries secure parental consent before processing children’s personal data. The rules specify that data fiduciaries must confirm parental identity through government-issued IDs or digital identity services like Digital Lockers.
This requirement seeks to enhance privacy protection for children using social media platforms, including Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, and X.
In case of a data breach, fiduciaries are required to promptly inform affected individuals in clear and straightforward terms.
The draft rules also outline restrictions for processing personal data outside India. Any transfer of such data must adhere to conditions specified by the government, particularly in cases involving foreign states or entities under their jurisdiction.

Title: Rajnath Singh to meet Maldivian defence minister to review bilateral defence cooperation
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:07:34 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will hold a crucial bilateral meeting with Maldives Defence Minister Mohammed Ghassan Maumoon in New Delhi on January 8, 2025. The discussions will focus on enhancing defence cooperation between India and the Maldives, specifically in areas such as training, joint exercises, defence projects, and supply of equipment to bolster the capabilities of the Maldives National Defence Forces (MNDF).
Maumoon is scheduled to visit India for a three-day trip from January 8 to 10. During his stay, he will also visit Goa and Mumbai to further strengthen ties between the two nations.
According to a press release from the Ministry of Defence, the two Ministers will review various aspects of the bilateral defence relationship, including ongoing training programs, regular military exercises, defence initiatives, and seminars aimed at enhancing MNDF’s operational readiness. Additionally, discussions will cover the supply of defence equipment and stores to the Maldives.
India and the Maldives share deep-rooted historical, cultural, and linguistic ties, with the Maldives holding a special place in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. This policy aims to foster stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Both nations play pivotal roles in ensuring the safety and security of the region, in line with India’s broader vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).
The meeting comes on the heels of a significant diplomatic development, as Maldives’ Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdulla Khaleel, wrapped up his first official visit to India earlier this week. The visit included high-level talks and the signing of critical agreements aimed at boosting bilateral development cooperation.
Among the key achievements was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP). The MoU launched the third phase of cooperation between India and the Maldives, designed to deliver tangible benefits to communities at the grassroots level and further solidify the enduring partnership between the two nations.
Khaleel’s visit also included discussions with India’s Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, where they explored new areas of collaboration, particularly in development projects, infrastructure, and socio-economic initiatives. Khaleel expressed gratitude for India’s continued support in addressing the fiscal challenges faced by the Maldives, underscoring the significance of this partnership in promoting economic stability.

Title: Delhi’s Ballot Box Battles: 70 Years of Wins and Upsets
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:33:30 +0000
Content: After Independence, Delhi, then a Part-C State, was granted an assembly that was disbanded in 1956. The assembly had 48 members. According to data sourced from the Election Commission of India, the story begins in 1951 with a handful of prominent parties vying for public endorsement.
The All-India Bhartiya Jan Sangh (BJS), contesting 31 seats, won five and earned a vote share of 21.89 per cent. The Indian National Congress (INC), contesting on 47 seats, won 39 with a 52.09 per cent vote share, establishing an early pattern of Congress dominance. Smaller contenders included the Socialist Party (SP), which contested six seats and won two, as well as the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (HMS), which got one seat. Independents also featured prominently, with 78 of them contesting but only one emerged victorious.
Delhi was given a Municipal Council in 1966. It had 56 members. The council had no legislative powers and functioned as an advisory institution with recommendatory powers. It was run by a Lieutenant Governor (or Administrator) appointed by the President of India. The council had one interim and four subsequent terms until 1990.
The 1972 Delhi election saw the BJS field 56 candidates and secure five victories, with a 38.47 per cent vote share. The INC got 44 out of 52 contested seats and with a 48.54 per cent vote share. The Communist Party of India (CPI) won three of the four seats it contested, with 3.86 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress (Organisation) captured two seats, while Independents collectively claimed two seats out of 104 contests.
The year 1977 was a watershed election for Delhi and India. The Janata Party (JNP), a coalition of political parties formed after the Emergency, entered the arena and dramatically shifted the balance of power by winning 46 of the 56 seats it contested, registering a substantial 52.5 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress, blamed for the Emergency, struggled in comparison, winning only 10 out of 52 seats and signalling a decline in its once formidable grip. This shift was a milestone in the broader trend of power alternating among key political outfits over the decades.
The year 1983 revealed further realignments. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), having evolved from the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh, fielded 50 candidates and won 19, with 36.99 per cent vote share. The INC, contesting 56 seats, came away with 34 victories and a 47.5 per cent share, indicating a measure of revived electoral strength. Meanwhile, the Janata Party struggled, winning only one of the 37 seats it contested, and the Lok Dal (LKD) picked up two wins out of six seats contested. The massive losses in the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, along with splits in the coalition, curtailed the political growth of the Janata Party in the country.
Delhi received its present legislative structure in 1992. Through Article 239AA of the Constitution of India, the National Capital Territory of Delhi was given an assembly with 70 elected members.
For Delhi, the second assembly election was organised in 1993. The BJP contested 70 seats and triumphed in 49, securing 42.82 per cent of the vote and reflecting an electoral shift towards the party. The INC, also contesting all 70 seats, won 14 and held a 34.48 per cent share. The Janata Dal (JD) got four seats with 12.65 per cent vote share, while independent candidates secured three seats.
By 1998, the power pendulum had once again moved. The BJP’s vote share of 34.02 per cent translated into 15 wins out of 67 seats it contested, whereas the INC improved its tally to 52 victories from 70 seats and earned 47.76 per cent of the vote. The Janata Dal got one and independent candidates got two seats.
In 2003, the BJP won 20 seats and with a 35.22 per cent vote share. The INC, meanwhile, won 47 seats and registered 48.13 per cent. Modest performances from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Janata Dal (Secular) also contributed to the overall contest that year.
By the next election in 2008, the BJP improved to 23 wins out of the 69 seats it contested, with a 36.34 per cent share, while the INC claimed 43 of 70 seats, with a 40.31 per cent vote share. The Bahujan Samaj Party, the Lok Jan Shakti Party, and a large number of independents also fielded many candidates, though only a handful succeeded in winning.
Another year of political change for Delhi came in 2013. Following the anti-corruption movement launched by Anna Hazare in 2011, with Delhi as its epicentre, the 2013 assembly elections saw the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
The party received a surprising welcome, winning 28 out of the 70 seats it contested with a vote share of 29.49 per cent. The BJP got 31 seats with a 33.07 per cent vote share. The INC slipped drastically to just eight wins and a 24.55 per cent share. Among smaller forces, the Janata Dal (United) and the Shiromani Akali Dal recorded single-seat victories.
The AAP formed the next government in Delhi with outside support from the INC, but it survived only for 49 days following the resignation of then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The party then chose to present itself as a national alternative, contesting 434 seats in 2014 Lok Sabha election, but could win just four seats in Punjab, and drew a blank in Delhi with Kejriwal losing against BJP’s candidate and prime-ministerial contender Narendra Modi from Varanasi.
The party again stormed back to power in the 2015 assembly elections, secuyring 67 of the 70 seats it contested with a 54.34 per cent vote share. The BJP won three seats, while other parties including the INC drew a blank. The BJP’s significant vote share, at 32.19 per cent, indicated that the INC was rapidly losing its grip on the capital city, which it had ruled for three consecutive terms under Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Before that, in 2014, the BJP had won all seven seats of the National Capital Region in the Lok Sabha polls.
The 2020 results offered a somewhat similar picture. AAP won 62 seats with 53.57 per cent of the total vote, followed by the BJP with eight seats and a 38.51 per cent vote share, while the INC repeated its previous cycle’s result of no seats and maintained a diminished 4.26 per cent share. As in 2014, the BJP also won all seven seats in Delhi in the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections while the INC and the AAP drew a blank.

Title: Bhashini-enabled e-shram portal now available in all 22 scheduled languages
Publication Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:11:31 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Labour & Employment and Youth Affairs & Sports, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, launched the multilingual functionality of the e-Shram portal on Tuesday in New Delhi, making it accessible in all 22 Scheduled Languages. This move aligns with the vision of making e-Shram a ‘One-Stop-Solution’ for unorganised workers in India, providing comprehensive social protection.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MEITY) Bhashini project was leveraged to upgrade the e-Shram portal, which previously supported only English, Hindi, Kannada, and Marathi. The portal now serves a broader perspective, ensuring that workers across the country can register and benefit from various government schemes in their native languages.
Dr. Mandaviya also highlighted the increasing trust in the e-Shram platform, with over 30,000 registrations per day by unorganised workers. He urged all unorganised workers to register on the portal to access a wide range of government schemes aimed at supporting their welfare, livelihood, and well-being.
The Minister emphasized that registering on e-Shram would unlock access to social security schemes, including twelve Government of India schemes currently available through the portal. To extend its outreach and ensure a user-friendly experience, he mentioned that the government plans to involve mediators like Common Service Centres, Bank Correspondents, Post Offices, and MY Bharat volunteers.
Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, further detailed efforts to make e-Shram a ‘One Stop Solution’ for social protection. She outlined ongoing initiatives, such as the registration of Building and Other Construction Workers (BoCW) and gig and platform workers, as well as plans to integrate State Government schemes.
The ministry is also working on launching an e-Shram Mobile App, introducing a Single Common Application Form, and integrating payment gateways to simplify access to social protection benefits.
The event marks a significant step toward strengthening the government’s commitment to enhancing social security for unorganised workers and improving their access to welfare services.

Title: Wildfires rage in Los Angeles, forcing tens of thousands to flee
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:30:53 +0000
Content: A rapidly growing wildfire raged across an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying numerous buildings and creating traffic jams as more than 30,000 people evacuated, while a second blaze doubled in size some 30 miles inland.
At least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal towns of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned by the Palisades Fire, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather.
A fire official told local television station KTLA that several people were injured, some with burns to faces and hands. The official added that one female firefighter had sustained a head injury.
The second blaze dubbed the Eaton Fire broke out some 30 miles (50 km) inland near Pasadena and doubled in size to 400 acres (162 hectares) in a few hours, according to Cal Fire.
Almost 100 residents from a nursing home in Pasadena were evacuated, according to CBS News. Video showed elderly residents, many in wheelchairs and on gurneys, crowded onto a smokey and windswept parking lot as fire trucks and ambulances attended.
Fire officials said a third blaze named the Hurst Fire had started in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuations of some nearby residents.
PALISADES FIRE
Witnesses reported a number of homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean.
Local media reported the fire had spread north, torching homes near Malibu.
Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley had earlier told a press conference that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened.
Firefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames. Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed.
The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said.
With only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot.
Cindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were “this close to the cars,” demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger.
“People left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees – everything is going,” Festa said from her car.
Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph (80 to 130 kph).
With low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were “about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,” the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X.
Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added.
The powerful winds changed President Joe Biden’s travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House.
“I have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire,” Biden said in a statement. A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said.
Pacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, “I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing.”
Actor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road.
“It’s really important for everybody to band together and don’t worry about your personal property. Just get out,” Guttenberg said. “Get your loved ones and get out.”

Title: Two Indian Americans elected to Virginia state legislatures
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:13:43 +0000
Content: Two Indian Americans have been elected to Virginia’s state legislatures, helping the Democratic Party maintain its slim majority despite a challenging national political landscape. Kannan Srinivasan was elected to the State Senate, while J.J. Singh secured a seat in the State House of Delegates on Wednesday.
The elections marked an interesting shift in Virginia politics, with Singh taking the seat in the House previously held by Srinivasan. In turn, Srinivasan succeeded Suhas Subramanyam, who resigned from the State Senate after being elected to Congress in November.
Another notable figure in the races was Republican candidate Ram Venkatachalam, who contested against Singh for the House seat but ultimately lost.
Srinivasan, a Tamil Nadu native who moved to the United States after building a successful career as a chartered accountant in India. Srinivasan’s win ensures that he will join fellow Indian American Ghazala Hashmi, who is also serving in the State Senate.
On the other hand, J.J. Singh, a Virginia native, made history by becoming likely the first legislator in the U.S. to wear a turban. Singh’s impressive background includes working in the White House Office of Management and Budget under former President Barack Obama, serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Bolivia, and advising on Capitol Hill as a senior U.S. Senate advisor.
These victories were crucial for the Democratic Party, which holds a slender one-seat majority in both chambers of Virginia’s legislature. This comes at a time when the state is led by a Republican governor, and with the national political landscape shaped by the ongoing Trump era, the outcome of these elections was critical to ensuring Democratic control.
Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’s victory over President-elect Donald Trump in Virginia, there were concerns among Democrats that the national Republican wave might influence the results. To counter this, the Democratic Party invested considerable resources in the campaigns to secure the wins of Srinivasan and Singh.

Title: Urgency mounts in search for survivors of powerful Tibet earthquake
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 07:07:53 +0000
Content: Over 400 people trapped by rubble in earthquake-stricken Tibet were rescued, Chinese officials said on Wednesday, with an unknown number still unaccounted for after a tremor rocked the Himalayan foothills and shifted the region’s landscape.
The epicentre of Tuesday’s magnitude 6.8 quake, one of the region’s most powerful tremors in recent years, was located in Tingri in China’s Tibet, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain. It also shook buildings in neighbouring Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and India.
The quake was so strong that part of the terrain at and around the epicentre slipped as much as 1.6m (5.2 feet) over a distance of 80 km (50 miles), according to an analysis by the United States Geological Survey.
Twenty-four hours after the temblor struck, those trapped under rubble would have endured a night in sub-zero temperatures, adding to the pressure on rescuers looking for survivors in an area the size of Cambodia.
Temperatures in the high-altitude region dropped as low as minus 18 degrees Celsius (0 degrees Fahrenheit) overnight. People trapped or those without shelter are at risk of rapid hypothermia and may only be able to live for five to 10 hours even if uninjured, experts say.
At least 126 people were known to have been killed and 188 injured on the Tibetan side, state broadcaster CCTV reported. No deaths have been reported in Nepal or elsewhere.
Chinese authorities have yet to announce how many people are still missing. In Nepal, an official told Reuters the quake destroyed a school building in a village near Mount Everest, which straddles the Nepali-Tibetan border. No one was inside at the time.
German climber Jost Kobusch said he was just above the Everest base camp on the Nepali side when the quake struck. His tent shook violently and he saw several avalanches crash down. He was unscathed.
“I’m climbing Everest in the winter by myself and…looks like basically I’m the only mountaineer there, in the base camp there’s nobody,” Kobusch told Reuters in a video call.
His expedition organising company, Satori Adventure, said Kobusch had left the base camp and was descending to Namche Bazaar on Wednesday on the way to Kathmandu.
But in Tibet, the damage was extensive.
An initial survey showed 3,609 homes had been destroyed in the Shigatse region, home to 800,000 people, state media reported late on Tuesday. Over 1,800 emergency rescue personnel and 1,600 soldiers had been deployed.
Footage broadcast on CCTV showed families huddled in rows of blue and green tents quickly erected by soldiers and aid workers in settlements surrounding the epicentre, where hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded.
State media said over 30,000 people affected by the quake had been relocated.
Home to some 60,000 people, Tingri is Tibet’s most populous county on China’s border with Nepal and is administered from the city of Shigatse, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism.
No damage has been reported to Shigatse’s Tashilhunpo monastery, state media reported, founded in 1447 by the first Dalai Lama.
The 14th and current Dalai Lama, along with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, have expressed condolences to the earthquake’s victims.
500 AFTERSHOCKS
Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are often hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which are pushing up an ancient sea that is now the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.
More than 500 aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.4 had followed the quake as of 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday, the China Earthquake Networks Centre said.
Over the past five years, there have been 29 quakes with magnitudes of 3 or above within 200 km (120 miles) of the epicentre of Tuesday’s temblor, according to local earthquake bureau data.
Tuesday’s quake was the worst in China since a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in 2023 that killed at least 149 people in a remote northwestern region.
In 2008, an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hit Sichuan, claiming the lives of at least 70,000 people, the deadliest quake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan quake that killed at least 242,000.

Title: 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention begins in Bhubaneswar
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 06:42:14 +0000
Content: The 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention is being held in Bhubaneswar from January 8 to 10, 2025, celebrating the significant contributions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and the global Indian diaspora to India’s development.
This year’s theme, ‘Diaspora’s Contribution to a Viksit Bharat,’ highlights the vital role the diaspora plays in shaping a prosperous and progressive India.
PBD is celebrated every two years to strengthen the connection between the overseas Indian community and the Government of India while providing a platform for cultural reconnection and collaboration.
The event commemorates the return of Mahatma Gandhi from South Africa to India on January 9, 1915. His return kindled the nation’s freedom struggle, marking a turning point in Indian history.
The first PBD Convention was held in 2003, and since 2015, the Ministry of External Affairs has organised the event biennially, featuring key stakeholders, experts, and policymakers.
The convention offers a forum for meaningful discussions on issues relevant to overseas Indians while creating opportunities for investments, collaborations, and partnerships that contribute to India’s growth.
In recent years, the PBD Convention has been hosted in partnership with various state governments, offering them a chance to showcase their strengths and attract investment and technology from the diaspora.
The 17th PBD Convention, held in Indore in 2023, attracted over 3,500 participants from 70 countries, making it the first physical gathering after the pandemic.
External Affairs Minister praises Indian Diaspora
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar hailed the Indian diaspora as “one of the largest and most closely connected diaspora communities in the world,” highlighting the significance of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) as “a unique occasion to renew bonds and build networks.”
In his message, Jaishankar reaffirmed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047. He said, “In 2025, the theme is ‘Diaspora’s Contribution to a Viksit Bharat.’ In response to Prime Minister Modi’s call, the entire nation is determinedly moving towards this goal, and the diaspora’s involvement is crucial. We are confident that the discussions at PBD will strengthen your commitment to this journey.”
Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards (PBSA)
A key highlight of the PBD Convention is the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards (PBSA), presented by the President of India to approximately 30 distinguished members of the Indian diaspora, including NRIs, Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), and diaspora-run organisations.
The PBSA recognizes exceptional contributions in areas such as social and humanitarian work, India’s development, and enhancing India’s global image.
By the 17th PBD Convention, 296 PBSA awards had been conferred, honouring the remarkable achievements of the diaspora across various fields.

Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 06:08:54 +0000
Content: The school building of Shree Bhimgithe Secondary School in Baglung, Gandaki Province, was constructed with the financial assistance of the Government of India under the ‘Nepal-India Development Cooperation’ initiative.
It was formally handed over to the School Management Committee on Tuesday in a ceremony jointly organized by the District Administration and the Embassy of India in Kathmandu. Political representatives, government officials, and social workers were also present on the occasion.
The Government of India’s grant under the ‘Nepal-India Development Cooperation’ initiative was utilized for constructing the school building and other allied facilities. The project was undertaken as a High Impact Community Development Project (HICDP) and implemented through the District Coordination Committee, Baglung.
The newly created infrastructure will play a pivotal role in providing quality education to students at Shree Bhimgithe Secondary School. It will also help foster an improved learning environment and contribute to the overall development of the education sector in the region.
Established in 1958 as a primary school, Shree Bhimgithe Secondary School was upgraded to a lower secondary school in 1968 and further elevated to the secondary level in 1988. The school currently offers education to students from Class 1 to Class 12, with an enrollment of approximately 700 students, 54% of whom are girls.
In Myagdi, campus and hostel buildings for Myagdi Multiple Campus were constructed with financial assistance from the Government of India at a project cost of NPR 27.93 million. These facilities were formally handed over to the Campus Management Committee in Gandaki Province. The grant was used for the construction of campus buildings, including a Humanities block, a Management block, a Girls’ Hostel block, and other allied facilities.
Myagdi Multiple Campus is a community-based institution that offers Bachelor’s and Master’s level courses. The campus currently has around 950 students, 70% of whom are girls.
As close neighbors, India and Nepal share wide-ranging and multi-sectoral cooperation. The implementation of HICDPs reflects the Government of India’s continued support for the Government of Nepal’s efforts to uplift its people by enhancing infrastructure in priority sectors.

Title: Nitin Gadkari unveils ‘cashless treatment’ scheme for road accident victims
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:54:15 +0000
Content: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced the launch of the “Cashless Treatment” scheme to provide financial aid to road accident victims. Under the scheme, the government will cover treatment costs of up to ₹1.5 lakh for seven days, provided the police are informed about the accident within 24 hours.
Speaking at a meeting with state and union territory transport ministers at Bharat Mandapam in Delhi, Gadkari also revealed an ex-gratia payment of ₹2 lakh for families of victims who lose their lives in hit-and-run cases.
“We have initiated a new scheme called Cashless Treatment. Once the police are informed of the accident within 24 hours, the government will bear treatment costs for up to seven days or a maximum of ₹1.5 lakh. Additionally, for hit-and-run cases, ₹2 lakh will be given to the families of the deceased,” Gadkari added.
The minister emphasized that road safety remains the government’s top priority, citing alarming statistics from 2024. According to Gadkari, 1.8 lakh fatalities occurred due to road accidents last year, with 30,000 deaths attributed to not wearing helmets. He highlighted that 66% of these accidents involved individuals aged between 18 and 34.
Gadkari also drew attention to the deaths of 10,000 children in accidents caused by poor safety measures near schools and colleges. “These deaths occurred due to inadequate arrangements at entry and exit points of educational institutions. We have now introduced rules for autorickshaws and minibuses transporting school children to address this issue,” he said.
The meeting served as a platform for collaborative discussions between the central and state governments on transportation policies and strategies to improve road safety across the country. Gadkari urged a collective effort to identify and address accident-prone “black spots” to minimize fatalities.

Title: South Korea’s Yoon faces second arrest attempt in fortified compound
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:47:30 +0000
Content: South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a new and potentially more robust attempt to arrest him for insurrection after a top investigator vowed to do whatever it takes to break a security blockade and take in the impeached leader.
Protesters supporting and opposing the embattled Yoon braved freezing temperatures to stage rallies on the streets around the presidential compound on Wednesday after a court re-issued a warrant on Tuesday to arrest him.
The Presidential Security Service (PSS) has been fortifying the compound this week with barbed wire and barricades using buses to block access to the residence, a hillside villa in an upscale district known as Korea’s Beverly Hills.
Yoon is under criminal investigation for insurrection over his failed attempt to impose martial law on Dec. 3, a decision that stunned South Korea and prompted the first arrest warrant for a sitting president.
He also faces an impeachment trial in the Constitutional Court.
On Wednesday, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said the president could not accept the execution of the arrest warrant because it was issued by a court in the wrong jurisdiction and the CIO had no authority to investigate the incumbent leader.
Yoon Kap-keun, the lawyer, also denied suggestions by some members of parliament that Yoon had fled the official residence, saying he had met the president there on Tuesday. He said they were “malicious” rumours intended to slander Yoon.
On Tuesday, Oh Dong-woon, head of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the investigation into Yoon, apologised for failing to arrest the president last week after a six-hour standoff with hundreds of PSS agents and military guards at the compound.
“We’ll do our best to accomplish our goal by thoroughly preparing this time with great determination that the second warrant execution will be the last,” Oh told a parliament committee.
He declined to specify how many days the court had given before the new arrest warrant expired, citing a need to keep plans for the new attempt internal.
Oh did not object when members of parliament called for tough action to overpower the presidential guards and military troops inside the compound, but he declined to discuss what options were being considered to achieve that.
Various scenarios reported in local media included mobilising police special tactical units and heavy equipment to push through the barricades, followed by more than 2,000 police to drag out presidential guards, taking as long as three days if necessary to wear down presidential security agents.
Shin Yul, a Myongji University professor who has followed the country’s political turmoil, said police had lots of experience with the tactical operations that were likely being considered.
“The second time, they should be able to arrest Yoon as I believe police will orchestrate the whole execution,” he said.
But safety should be a top priority, especially of protesters, he said, noting the risk of gunfire in a potential clash.
The CIO and police were outnumbered in the arrest attempt last week by more than 200 PSS personnel, some of whom were carrying firearms, as well as troops seconded to presidential security, a CIO official has said.

Title: PM Modi to inaugurate Z-Morh tunnel in Kashmir on January 13
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:32:37 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir on January 13 to inaugurate the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg road to make Sonamarg an all-weather tourist destination.
Official sources said that the PM will arrive on January 13 to physically inaugurate the Z-Morh tunnel that will bypass the road from Gagangir to Sonamarg allowing visitors and locals to visit the hill station throughout the year.
At present, the Gagangir-Sonamarg stretch of the road gets blocked by heavy snowfall and avalanches that hit the area every year.
The Z-Morh Tunnel is a 6.5 km long 2-lane road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonamarg in the Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir. It is named after the Z-shaped stretch of road that the tunnel has replaced (Z-Morh translates to “Z-turn” in English).
The road used before was avalanche-prone and often got blocked for several months, but the Z-Morh tunnel provides all-weather connectivity to the Sonamarg tourist town. It takes only 15 minutes to travel the 6.5 km long tunnel compared to hours over the zig-zag road up and down the hills.
Together with the adjacent Zoji-La Tunnel, this geostrategically important tunnel on the Srinagar-Leh Highway will provide year-round weather-proof connectivity to Baltal (Amarnath cave), Kargil and other places in the Ladakh region.
It will also enhance military logistics and boost tourism and the economy. In addition to providing all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg, the tunnel will help the employment of local youth and boost tourism and allied activities in the area.
It is one of the 31 road tunnels, 20 in Jammu and Kashmir and 11 in Ladakh.
The construction of the tunnel was started in 2018.
The tunnel workers came under terror attack on October 20, 2024, when two terrorists entered the workers’ camp at Gagangir and fired indiscriminately. Seven civilians, including six non-local workers of the infrastructure company building the Z-Morh tunnel, were killed. A local doctor was also killed in the attack.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open flat amid selling pressure from FIIs
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:24:32 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened on a cautious note on Wednesday, with marginal gains dampened by selling pressure from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs).
The Nifty rose by 38.75 points, or 0.16 percent, to open at 23,746.65, while the Sensex added 120.45 points, or 0.15 percent, starting at 78,319.56.
Experts suggest that the market is unlikely to see a significant recovery in the near term, although corporate earnings and the upcoming Union Budget could offer some support.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said: “Indian markets are struggling with lowered GDP growth estimates of 6.4 percent in FY2025 versus 8.2 percent in FY2024. With major financial institutions giving moderate operating updates for the Oct-Dec quarter, the markets are seeing continued FPI selling in key sectors like financials. Overall the mood stays cautious and stock markets will be dependent on individual corporate earnings and the Union Budget to lift the sentiment”.
Among sectoral indices, only Nifty Pharma and Nifty Oil and Gas opened with gains, while the remaining indices saw declines in early trade.
In the Nifty 50 list, 13 stocks advanced, 37 declined, and one remained unchanged. The top gainers included Dr. Reddy’s, ONGC, Reliance, Cipla, and Maruti, while Trent, Shri Ram Finance, Adani Ports, BEL, and Tech Mahindra were among the top losers.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said: “The Nifty’s rally in the previous session helped trace a so-called “bullish harami” pattern, but the long upper shadow meant nervousness persists. That means bulls will have to, at minimum, push the market above yesterday’s high of 23795 to validate the formation. That said, the falling 100-day and the rising 200-day averages are creating a resistance area between 23915 and 24100, which is also where the 24000-call strike for weekly expiration tomorrow is seeing high concentration.”
Broader Asian markets showed a mixed trend. South Korea’s KOSPI surged more than 1.2 percent, and Singapore’s Straits Times rose 0.5 percent. However, other markets faced downward pressure, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1.3 percent, China’s Shanghai Composite falling over 1 percent, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 declining 0.35 percent.

Title: Las Vegas Cybertruck suspect used ChatGPT to plan blast, police say
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 05:12:56 +0000
Content: The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day used popular chatbot ChatGPT to plan the blast, officials told reporters on Tuesday.
The suspect used ChatGPT to try and work out how much explosive was needed to trigger the blast, officials said.
Authorities last week identified the person found dead inside the Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, an active-duty Army soldier from Colorado Springs, and said he acted alone. The FBI says the incident appeared to be a case of suicide.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said on Tuesday the Cybertruck blast was the first incident on U.S. soil where ChatGPT had been used to build an explosive device.
Critics of artificial intelligence have warned it could be harnessed for harmful purposes, and the Las Vegas attack could add to that criticism.
KEY QUOTES
“Of particular note, we also have clear evidence in this case now that the suspect used ChatGPT artificial intelligence to help plan his attack,” Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told a press conference.
“This is the first incident that I am aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,” McMahill added.

Title: West Asia’s Largest Plastics Exhibition Spotlights India’s Green Manufacturing Push
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:05:32 +0000
Content: The 17th edition of ArabPlast, West Asia’s premier trade exhibition for plastics and petrochemicals, opened in Dubai with India emerging as a key player in sustainable manufacturing solutions. The three-day event has attracted over 750 exhibitors across 12 international pavilions, showcasing innovations in plastics, recycling, petrochemicals, packaging, and rubber industries.

India’s delegation, comprising 125 companies led by the Plastic Export Promotion Council of India (PLEXCONCIL), marks a 70% increase from the previous edition, underscoring the country’s expanding role in the global plastics sector. This robust participation aligns with India’s intensified focus on sustainable practices and circular economy initiatives, bolstered by stringent Plastic Waste Management Rules and restrictions on single-use plastics.
 
Vikram Bhaduria, Chairman of PLEXCONCIL, highlighted the growth potential in Indo-UAE trade relations, with Indian plastic exports to the UAE currently valued at $620 million. “With the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in place, there’s an opportunity to expand into a $9 billion market,” Bhaduria said, emphasizing India’s relatively modest 1.5% contribution to the global plastic industry.


In 2023, the West Asian region imported plastics worth $30 billion, of which India accounted for just $1.5 billion. The UAE, as India’s third-largest plastics export destination, serves as a strategic hub, offering advanced logistics infrastructure for seamless access to European and African markets.
 
This year’s ArabPlast places a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, with Indian companies showcasing innovative solutions in biodegradable plastics and advanced recycling technologies. The event also highlights the significance of the GCC petrochemical sector, which generates over $100 billion in annual revenues.
 
The Indian Pavilion was inaugurated by Satish Kumar Sivan, Consul General of India to Dubai and the Northern Emirates, underscoring the country’s commitment to global collaboration in sustainable manufacturing.
 
 
ArabPlast 2025 continues through January 9, solidifying Dubai’s status as a global hub for industrial innovation and sustainable development. The exhibition serves as a platform for stakeholders to explore new technologies, forge partnerships, and advance environmentally responsible manufacturing practices in the region.

The Sensex concluded at 78,148.49, a decline of 50.62 points or 0.06 percent. Meanwhile, the Nifty ended at 23,688.95, down 18.95 points or 0.08 percent.

Among sectoral indices, IT and FMCG segments posted gains, while other sectors witnessed a dip.
Market analysts attributed the session’s performance to concerns over slower economic growth forecasts and caution ahead of Q3 earnings results, which contributed to market volatility. They noted some recovery during the session, driven by buying in large-cap stocks and expectations of potential government measures in the upcoming budget.
Experts also highlighted that rising US bond yields and reduced expectations of interest rate cuts in the United States may dampen near-term investor sentiment.
In the Sensex components, stocks such as UltraTech Cement, L&T, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NTPC, SBI, Zomato, Titan, Tata Steel, and M&M were among the major decliners. Gains were seen in stocks including TCS, ITC, Asian Paints, HCL Tech, Maruti Suzuki, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Hindustan Unilever, PowerGrid, Nestle India, and Tata Motors.

Title: Winter surge in respiratory illness in China and elsewhere not unusual, WHO says
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:46:56 +0000
Content: Rising cases of common respiratory illnesses in China and elsewhere around the Northern Hemisphere are within the range expected for winter, with no unusual outbreaks reported, the World Health Organization said.
Reports of a surge of cases in China of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a common respiratory infection, have drawn headlines worldwide, with reports of overwhelmed hospitals recalling the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic just over five years ago.
However, the WHO said in a statement on Tuesday evening that it was in contact with Chinese health officials and had not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns there. The Chinese authorities have also informed the U.N. health agency that the health system is not overwhelmed and no emergency responses have been triggered.
The WHO said Chinese data up to Dec. 29 showed detections of hMPV, seasonal influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have all increased in recent weeks, particularly in northern parts of China. Influenza is currently the most commonly reported cause of disease, it said.
“The observed increases in acute respiratory infections and associated pathogen detections in many countries in the Northern hemisphere in recent weeks is expected at this time of year and is not unusual,” the WHO added.
HMPV typically causes cold-like symptoms for a few days but can in rare cases lead to hospitalization among the very young, old or medically vulnerable. Unlike the virus that caused COVID-19, which was new, hMPV was first identified in 2001 and has likely been circulating for much longer, scientists said.
A number of other countries, including India and the United Kingdom, have also reported rising cases of hMPV this winter, as well as other respiratory infections, in line with seasonal trends that can sometimes stretch hospitals.
“Almost every child will have at least one infection with hMPV by their fifth birthday,” said Paul Hunter, a medicine professor at the University of East Anglia in the UK. Countries are also getting better at diagnosing the illness, he said, which may be a factor in increasing rates.
“Overall, I don’t think there is currently any sign of a more serious global issue,” he said.

Title: PM Modi to Inaugurate 38th National Games in Uttarakhand, promising a blend of traditional and modern sports
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:32:22 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the 38th National Games in Uttarakhand, scheduled from January 28 to February 14, 2025.
Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami confirmed that PM Modi has agreed to open the event, following an invitation from the state government. Dhami also mentioned that they invited the PM to attend the winter yatra, which will coincide with the games.
The event will bring together over 10,000 athletes, coaches, and officials from across India, competing in 38 sports disciplines across multiple cities in Uttarakhand. This marks the first time the state will host the National Games, after being announced as the host in December 2023.
IOA President PT Usha expressed her excitement about the inclusion of both traditional and modern sports in the games, with demonstration sports like kalarippayattu, yogasana, mallakhambh, and rafting.
“This reflects our commitment to honoring India’s rich heritage while offering new opportunities for athletes,” she said.
The 38th edition will feature 32 competitive disciplines and four demonstration events, highlighting India’s sporting diversity. The National Games bring together athletes from all states and Union Territories to compete in an Olympic-style event.
Following the Goa 2023 edition, which saw Maharashtra top the medal tally, the Uttarakhand games are expected to strengthen the state’s position as a sports and tourism hub. The inclusion of traditional sports alongside Olympic disciplines reflects India’s growing commitment to fostering both modern and heritage sports.

Title: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh highlights strengthening India-Maldives bilateral ties
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:21:35 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a meeting with his Maldivian counterpart, reaffirmed India’s commitment to enhancing relations with the Maldives. The discussions were held as part of a delegation-level meeting to deepen cooperation between the two countries.
Reflecting on the recent visit of President Mohamed Muizzu to India, Singh said, “I recall our brief meeting with you during the state visit of President Mohamed Muizzu to India in October 2024. The visit of the President of the Maldives has provided a new orientation to our bilateral relationship, and the Joint Vision Document released during the visit acts as a guiding principle for our two countries.”
He emphasised the enduring spiritual, historical, linguistic, and ethnic ties between the nations, describing the relationship as “close, cordial, and multidimensional.”
Singh noted that the Maldives holds a special position under India’s Neighbourhood First Policy, a strategic framework aimed at ensuring regional stability and prosperity. He added, “Maldives occupied a special place under Neighbourhood’s First Policy of India, which aimed to bring stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region.”
The Defence Minister further highlighted the joint role of India and the Maldives in ensuring security in the Indian Ocean. He said that both nations contribute to the framework of Security and Growth for All (SAGAR) in the region, reflecting their shared commitment to maintaining regional stability.
India’s robust defence cooperation with the Maldives was another focal point of the talks. Singh pointed out the avenues for capacity building offered by India, which include training programs, joint exercises, workshops, and the supply of defence equipment.
He emphasised the importance of maintaining this momentum, saying, “India will continue to support the Maldives and the Maldives National Defence Force in their capacity-building efforts through projects, equipment and training. As a trusted partner and a close friend, I assure you that India will continue to support Maldives on its development needs and welfare of its people.”
The relationship between India and the Maldives is built on a foundation of longstanding cultural, religious, and commercial ties, with India being among the first nations to recognise the Maldives after its independence in 1965. Geographically, the Maldives’ proximity to India’s west coast and its location along critical maritime trade routes further underscore its strategic importance.
Tourism also remains a cornerstone of the Maldivian economy, directly contributing to about a quarter of its GDP and accounting for a significant share of employment opportunities. With indirect contributions included, the tourism sector supports nearly 70% of the nation’s employment, highlighting its pivotal role in the Maldivian economy.
The robust bilateral cooperation between India and the Maldives aims to further strengthen these economic and strategic ties. (ANI)

Title: Large delegations from 50 countries set to participate in 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:01:25 +0000
Content: The 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention is set to bring together large delegations from the Indian diaspora across 50 countries, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurating the event on Thursday. The three-day convention, began on Wednesday in Bhubaneswar, Odisha’s capital.
According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), more than 5,000 Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) from over 50 countries have registered for the PBD Convention. This flagship event serves as a vital platform for the global Indian diaspora to reconnect with their roots, engage with one another, and showcase their contributions to the development of India.
This year marks the first time the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention is being held in Odisha. The state has made extensive preparations to highlight its rich historical, cultural, and spiritual heritage. “Under the ‘Look East’ policy, Prime Minister Modi has emphasized that India’s development is closely tied to the rise of the East. Odisha’s hosting of this prestigious event is a clear reflection of this vision,” said Deputy Chief Minister K.V. Singh Deo, expressing his gratitude to Prime Minister Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar for entrusting the state with this responsibility.
The convention opened with addresses from key dignitaries, including Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Mansukh Mandaviya, and Minister of State for External Affairs Pabitra Margherita.
Chief Secretary Manoj Ahuja revealed that over 5,000 NRIs are expected to participate, with delegates scheduled to visit 21 selected sites across Bhubaneswar, Puri, and Jajpur. These visits aim to promote Odisha as a key international tourism destination.
The excitement among diaspora members is palpable. Amit Kumar, a delegate from the Bhojpuri Association of Singapore, shared his enthusiasm: “I am an Indian, and I have been living and working in Singapore for the last 16 years. It’s heartening to see the Prime Minister’s message reach us, and I am sure this message is spreading globally.”

Title: Ministry of Tribal Affairs makes significant strides in empowering Tribal communities
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:49:38 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has seen a significant budget increase over the past decade, with funding directed towards initiatives aimed at improving living conditions, promoting education, and driving socio-economic empowerment for tribal populations across India, the ministry said in a press release on Tuesday.
According to the ministry, its budget has grown from Rs 4,497.96 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 13,000 crore in 2024-25, underscoring the government’s strong commitment to the upliftment of tribal communities.
One of the major initiatives launched in 2024 was the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2, 2024.
With a budget of Rs. 79,156 crore, the program aims to address critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood development in over 63,843 tribal villages. This program reflects the government’s resolve to ensure that tribal communities have access to essential services and development opportunities.
Another important scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN), launched in November 2023, focuses on the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
This initiative, with an approved budget of Rs. 24,000 crore, is working to uplift 75 PVTGs in 18 states and one union territory by providing access to safe housing, clean water, education, healthcare, and sustainable livelihoods. As of January 2025, projects worth Rs. 7,356 crore have been sanctioned under this mission.
The Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) scheme continues to expand its impact by providing quality education to tribal students. In 2024, the Prime Minister inaugurated 40 new schools and laid the foundation for 25 more, bringing the total number of approved EMRS to 728.
These schools offer modern facilities and have seen an increase in the number of students enrolled, reflecting the growing demand for education in tribal areas. With 38,800 teaching and support staff positions set to be filled over the next three years, the government aims to provide education to 3.5 lakh tribal students.
In addition, the Pradhan Mantri Adi Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAAGY) has approved 17,616 village development plans aimed at bridging infrastructure gaps in villages with a significant tribal population.
This initiative, in conjunction with various central and state government schemes, is designed to improve living standards and promote inclusive development for tribal communities.
Through these initiatives, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is working to ensure that India’s tribal populations receive the resources, infrastructure, and support needed to thrive.
With continued investments in education, healthcare, and economic development, the Ministry remains committed to fostering an inclusive and empowered future for India’s diverse tribal communities.

Title: Los Angeles surrounded by out-of-control wildfires; at least five dead
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:58:27 +0000
Content: Raging wildfires surrounded Los Angeles on Wednesday, killing at least five people, destroying hundreds of homes and stretching firefighting resources and water supplies to the limit, as more than 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate.
Fierce winds hindered firefighting operations and fueled the fires, which have burned unimpeded since they began on Tuesday.
Five separate fires burned in Los Angeles County, all of them 0% contained according to state officials, including a pair of conflagrations that held the city in a pincer move.
On the west side, the Palisades Fire consumed 15,832 acres (6,406 hectares) and 1,000 structures in the hills between Santa Monica and Malibu, racing down Topanga Canyon until reaching the natural fire break of the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. It was already one of the most destructive fires in Los Angeles history.
To the east, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Eaton Fire claimed another 10,600 acres (4,289 hectares) and killed at least five people, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told KNX radio. Private forecaster AccuWeather estimated initial damage and economic loss at more than $50 billion.
“We’re facing a historic natural disaster. And I think that can’t be stated strong enough,” Kevin McGowan, director of emergency management for Los Angeles County, told a press conference.
The skies above Los Angeles glowed red in some areas and were blanketed by thick smoke. Nearly 1 million homes and businesses lost power in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us.
“The wind whipped up, the flames were up about 30 or 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) high, and you hear ‘pop, pop, pop’. It sounded like a warzone,” Kevin Williams, an Eaton Fire evacuee, told Reuters at an evacuation center in Pasadena, describing gas canisters at his neighbors’ homes that began exploding under the heat of the flames.
WATER WOES
Three smaller fires in the county also stretched firefighting resources that had already been exhausted, with water shortages affecting the Pacific Palisades, an upscale coastal enclave where a wildfire has consumed 15,832 acres (6,406 hectares).
“There are not enough firefighters in L.A. County to address four separate fires of this magnitude,” said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone.
Demand for water also caused some hydrants to run dry in Pacific Palisades after the last of three large water tanks in the area hit empty, officials said.
“We pushed the system to the extreme. We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water systems, and that is really challenging,” Janisse Quinones, chief executive of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, told a press conference.
Pacific Palisades relies on three tanks that hold about a million gallons (3.78 million liters) each, and the demand for water to fight fires at lower elevations was making it difficult to refill water tanks at higher elevations, she said.
Some hydrants ran dry at around 3 a.m. With winds and smoke limiting the ability to offer air support, firefighters were left without enough water to battle the flames.
Nestled in the hills with spectacular ocean views, Pacific Palisades is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country with a typical home valued at $3.7 million as of the end of 2023, according to Zillow, more than all but four other zip codes in the United States.
It is also home to many film, television and music stars including Jamie Lee Curtis, Mandy Moore and Mark Hamill, all forced to flee their homes.
The fires struck at an especially vulnerable time for Southern California, which has yet to see significant rainfall since the start of the water year in October. Then came the powerful Santa Ana winds, bringing dry desert air from the east toward the coastal mountains, fanning the flames of the wildfires while blowing over the hilltops and down through the canyons.
Scientists said the fires, erupting well outside of the traditional wildfire season, mark the latest in weather extremes that are likely to escalate further as global temperatures continue to climb in coming decades.
President Joe Biden, who stayed put in Los Angeles after Air Force One was grounded due to high winds on Tuesday, joined California Governor Gavin Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station to get a briefing firefighting efforts.
“The impacts of (the fires include) over one thousand structures already destroyed, a hundred-plus thousand people that have been evacuated, lives lost, traditions, lifestyles, places torn asunder,” said Newsom, who declared a state of emergency on Tuesday.
Biden pledged any help he could provide in his final days in office before handing off to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20.
“We’re doing anything and everything and as long as it takes to contain these fires … to make sure you get back to normal,” Biden said. “It’s going to be a hell of a long way. It’s going to take time.”
Local officials warned that the gusty winds were forecast to persist throughout the day.
“We are absolutely not out of danger yet, with the strong winds that continue to push through the city and the county today,” Los Angeles City Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said.
As the flames spread and residents began evacuating after the fires broke out on Tuesday, roads were so jammed that some people abandoned their vehicles to escape the fire. Emergency responders were going door to door to press evacuation orders.
Shaun Tate, 45, said he fled his home in Altadena, a Los Angeles suburb in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, at 4:15 a.m. when he saw flames rolling towards his house.
“I came out of the house because I heard something fly off the roof,” Tate said at an evacuation center in Pasadena.
“We packed up the SUV and drove down here,” he said. “I chose to save my laptop, my diabetic medication and a little bit of food.”
David Reed said he had no choice but to leave his Pacific Palisades home when police officers showed up at his door and “laid down the law” as he saw flames approaching his home.

Content: Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) is an event observed on January 9 every two years to honor the contributions of the Indian diaspora to the nation. Established in 2003 under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PBD serves as a platform for meaningful engagement between India and its overseas communities. It is organized by the Ministry of External Affairs and rotates between cities to showcase the cultural and regional diversity of the country.
 
Originally an annual celebration, the format was revised in 2015 to a biennial event, interspersed with theme-based conferences in alternate years. These conferences provide targeted discussions and networking opportunities for the global Indian community.
 
The event has historical significance, as it marks the day in 1915 when Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa, a moment pivotal to the country’s freedom struggle. It underscores the enduring bond between the diaspora and their ancestral homeland.
 
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2025
The 18th PBD Convention is scheduled to take place in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, from January 8 to 10, 2025, with a central focus on the diaspora’s role in a developed India. The program includes key events across three days.
 
The first day features the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, bringing together young members of the diaspora to explore their cultural and historical roots. The session will be jointly inaugurated by the External Affairs Minister, the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, and the Chief Minister of Odisha.
 
The second day marks the official inauguration of the convention by the Prime Minister of India. It will include the launch of the Pravasi Bharatiya Express, a tourist train designed for the diaspora, under the Pravasi Teertha Darshan Yojana. This train will visit religious and tourist sites in India during a three-week journey. Additionally, the Prime Minister will inaugurate exhibitions showcasing topics such as the legacy of the Ramayana, the diaspora’s contributions to technology, migration histories, and Odisha’s heritage.
 
The valedictory session on the third day will feature remarks from the President of India, alongside the presentation of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards. Various plenary sessions will take place during the second and third days, focusing on themes such as youth leadership, migrant experiences, sustainable development, women’s leadership, and cultural dialogue.
 
Goals and Impact
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas aims to recognize the role of the Indian diaspora in the nation’s development, build international understanding of India, and strengthen global networks supporting India’s causes. It provides a platform for members of the diaspora to connect with the government and people of their ancestral country, fostering collaboration across fields such as technology, education, and culture.
 
The official website for the 2025 convention was launched on November 12, 2024, enabling online registration for participants.

Title: Healing at the Maha Kumbh 2025: A Story of Medical Care and Commitment
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:57:12 +0000
Content: On a chilly morning in Prayagraj, the spiritual atmosphere of the Maha Kumbh 2025 blends seamlessly with a powerful testament to modern medical care.
In Maha Kumbh Nagar, the Central Hospital’s wards buzz with activity, serving millions of devotees who have come to this holy event not only for spiritual solace but also to benefit from unparalleled healthcare.
Among them is Rameshwar, a 55-year-old pilgrim from Madhya Pradesh, whose life was saved after he suffered severe cardiac distress. Thanks to the swift intervention of the ICU specialists and the hospital’s state-of-the-art facilities, Rameshwar’s chest pain is now a distant memory. He expresses his deep gratitude for the medical services, a reflection of the Uttar Pradesh Government’s vision of a “healthy and safe” Maha Kumbh.
This year, the Maha Kumbh 2025 is not just a religious gathering but a comprehensive hub of medical services for pilgrims from across the world. With advanced planning and cutting-edge healthcare solutions, the event is setting new standards for mass gatherings.
The key medical highlight is the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an ambitious initiative to tackle vision impairment. Aiming to distribute 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conduct 5,00,000 OPDs, the event is making its mark on a global scale, targeting the Guinness Book of World Records.
The initiative offers a ray of hope to those suffering from corneal blindness, with eye donation camps dedicated to addressing the 15 million cases of blindness in India.
The Central Hospital at Parade Ground is the heart of this medical endeavor. With 100 beds and comprehensive services including ICU care, diagnostic facilities, and a Central Pathology Lab, the hospital has already treated over 10,000 patients, including several successful deliveries.
Ajay Kumar and Puja, a couple from Fatehpur, welcomed a baby boy during their pilgrimage, a moment they consider a divine blessing. They named their son Jamuna Prasad, after the sacred Yamuna River.
In addition to the main hospital, the Sub-Central Hospital in Sector 24, Arail, adds to the robust healthcare system, offering 25 beds and essential services. Mobile diagnostic facilities, free diagnostic tests, and AI-driven translation services cater to pilgrims speaking 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring seamless communication between patients and medical staff.
To safeguard the health of pilgrims traveling by train, Medical Observation Rooms have been set up at key railway stations, including Prayagraj Junction. These rooms are fully equipped with ECG machines, defibrillators, and essential medicines, staffed round the clock by dedicated teams of doctors and nurses.
Behind the scenes, a team of 240 doctors from across India ensures the smooth operation of these healthcare services. Special accommodations have been arranged for the medical personnel, with region-specific meals and separate dormitories for women.
Volunteers and pilgrims alike benefit from these thoughtful provisions, fostering a sense of community and support.
As Maha Kumbh 2025 unfolds, it serves as a shining example of the fusion between spiritual devotion and modern healthcare. From Rameshwar’s recovery to the innovative Netra Kumbh, the event stands as a beacon of hope and healing for millions.
The Uttar Pradesh Government’s commitment to delivering world-class healthcare during this spiritual event is not just a goal but a living reality, offering comfort, safety, and care to all who attend.

Title: West Asia’s Largest Plastics Exhibition Spotlights India’s Green Manufacturing Push
Publication Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:05:32 +0000
Content: The 17th edition of ArabPlast, West Asia’s premier trade exhibition for plastics and petrochemicals, opened in Dubai with India emerging as a key player in sustainable manufacturing solutions. The three-day event has attracted over 750 exhibitors across 12 international pavilions, showcasing innovations in plastics, recycling, petrochemicals, packaging, and rubber industries.

India’s delegation, comprising 125 companies led by the Plastic Export Promotion Council of India (PLEXCONCIL), marks a 70% increase from the previous edition, underscoring the country’s expanding role in the global plastics sector. This robust participation aligns with India’s intensified focus on sustainable practices and circular economy initiatives, bolstered by stringent Plastic Waste Management Rules and restrictions on single-use plastics.
 
Vikram Bhaduria, Chairman of PLEXCONCIL, highlighted the growth potential in Indo-UAE trade relations, with Indian plastic exports to the UAE currently valued at $620 million. “With the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in place, there’s an opportunity to expand into a $9 billion market,” Bhaduria said, emphasizing India’s relatively modest 1.5% contribution to the global plastic industry.


In 2023, the West Asian region imported plastics worth $30 billion, of which India accounted for just $1.5 billion. The UAE, as India’s third-largest plastics export destination, serves as a strategic hub, offering advanced logistics infrastructure for seamless access to European and African markets.
 
This year’s ArabPlast places a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, with Indian companies showcasing innovative solutions in biodegradable plastics and advanced recycling technologies. The event also highlights the significance of the GCC petrochemical sector, which generates over $100 billion in annual revenues.
 
The Indian Pavilion was inaugurated by Satish Kumar Sivan, Consul General of India to Dubai and the Northern Emirates, underscoring the country’s commitment to global collaboration in sustainable manufacturing.
 
 
ArabPlast 2025 continues through January 9, solidifying Dubai’s status as a global hub for industrial innovation and sustainable development. The exhibition serves as a platform for stakeholders to explore new technologies, forge partnerships, and advance environmentally responsible manufacturing practices in the region.

On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,390 shares advanced, 2,582 shares declined, and 94 shares remained unchanged.
Among sectoral indices, IT and FMCG segments posted gains, while other sectors witnessed a dip.
Market analysts attributed the session’s performance to concerns over slower economic growth forecasts and caution ahead of Q3 earnings results, which contributed to market volatility.

Experts also highlighted that rising US bond yields and reduced expectations of interest rate cuts in the United States may dampen near-term investor sentiment.
In the Sensex components, stocks such as UltraTech Cement, L&T, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NTPC, SBI, Zomato, Titan, Tata Steel, and M&M were among the major decliners. Gains were seen in stocks including TCS, ITC, Asian Paints, HCL Tech, Maruti Suzuki, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Hindustan Unilever, PowerGrid, Nestle India, and Tata Motors.

Title: South Korea’s Yoon to accept court decision even if it ends presidency, lawyer says
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:27:08 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will accept the decision of the Constitutional Court that is trying parliament’s impeachment case against him, even if it decides to remove the suspended leader from office, his lawyer said on Thursday.
“So if the decision is ‘removal’, it cannot but be accepted,” Yoon Kab-keun, the lawyer for Yoon, told a news conference, when asked if Yoon would accept whatever the outcome of trial was.
Yoon has earlier defied the court’s requests to submit legal briefs before the court began its hearing on Dec. 27, but his lawyers have said he was willing to appear in person to argue his case.
The suspended president has defied repeated summons in a separate criminal investigation into allegations he masterminded insurrection with his Dec. 3 martial law bid.
Lawyer said the president is currently at his official residence and appeared healthy, amid speculation over the suspended leader’s whereabouts.
Presidential security guards resisted an initial effort to arrest Yoon last week though he faces another attempt after a top investigator vowed to do whatever it takes to break a security blockade and take in the embattled leader.
Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer advising Yoon, said Yoon viewed the attempts to arrest him as politically motivated and aimed at humiliating him by bringing him out in public wearing handcuffs.

Title: Centre writes to States, UTs to organise 100-day campaign on TB elimination in prisons
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:16:31 +0000
Content: The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has written to all states and Union Territories (UTs) to organize a 100-day intensified campaign on tuberculosis (TB) elimination in prisons and correctional institutions. This initiative is part of the central government’s commitment to eradicating the disease from India.
According to the MHA, screening camps (Nikshay Shivir) will be organized in all prisons, covering all inmates, in consultation with state health departments, state TB officers, and district TB officers. These camps are scheduled from February 3 to February 15.
Prison authorities are required to administer the Nikshay Shapath (pledge) from January 27 to February 2. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials are to be displayed in all prison offices and institutions, along with efforts to raise TB awareness among prison staff.
“The active involvement of prison authorities in this campaign is anticipated to play a crucial role in advancing TB control efforts,” the MHA said in a statement. It also urged all states and UTs to conduct comprehensive screenings of prison inmates and staff, while promoting awareness to aid in the elimination of tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis remains a significant public health concern in prisons due to the closed and crowded environment, which increases the risk of TB transmission. This poses a threat not only to incarcerated populations but also to public health through interactions with visitors and prisoners’ eventual release.

Title: Focus shifts to Tibet earthquake survivors as search called off
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:12:54 +0000
Content: Authorities moved more than 45,000 people in earthquake-hit Tibet to shelters in a massive rescue operation at the foot of the Himalayas as they wound down the search in a high-altitude environment where the odds of survival were always slim.
The epicentre of Tuesday’s 6.8 magnitude quake, one of the Chinese region’s strongest tremors in recent years, was in Tingri, a rural county with a population of about 60,000 people around 80 km (50 miles) north of Mount Everest.
The temblor shook buildings as far away as Nepal and parts of India, and destroyed more than 3,600 houses around Tingri, presenting a formidable task to rescuers in an area where the average elevation is more than 4,000 metres (13,000 feet).
Forty-eight hours after the quake, experts say those trapped under the rubble are likely to have succumbed to hypothermia, with temperatures dropping as low as minus 18 degrees Celsius (0 degrees Fahrenheit) at night.
An initial tally on Tuesday night showed at least 126 people had been killed and 188 injured, according to Chinese state media. It remained unchanged as of Thursday.
Rescue operations have focused on 27 villages within a 20-km radius of Tingri, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. The area is home to 7,000 people.
Chinese officials on Wednesday ended the search for survivors, saying the focus was shifting to relocating the displaced and treating the injured after pulling 407 people from the rubble.
Authorities have yet to say how many people remain missing.
The State Council Information Office, which handles queries from the media on behalf of the central government, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Foreign journalists need official permission to enter Tibet, which has been under Chinese rule since a failed uprising in 1959.
The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, said he was deeply saddened by the quake and would pray for the victims.
He is branded a “separatist” by Beijing.
“Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, people in disaster areas will certainly be able to overcome the catastrophe and rebuild their homes,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
“We are well aware of the Dalai Lama’s divisive nature and political designs, and we remain on high alert.”
RECONSTRUCTION
Gyaltsen Norbu, the Panchen Lama and second to the Dalai Lama in spiritual authority, chanted prayers with around 900 monks on Wednesday at Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, according to Xinhua.
Norbu, identified by Beijing in 1995 as the 11th Panchen Lama but not recognised by the Dalai Lama, has also made a donation to quake relief efforts, Xinhua reported.
China’s post-disaster response has been swift, with 11,000 rescuers deployed to the quake zone within hours of the first tremors. There have been more than 1,000 aftershocks.
Zhang Guoping, a vice premier, has led the quake-relief effort visiting the most severely affected areas.
Reconstruction must be accelerated to ensure the displaced can move into safe and warm homes as soon as possible, Xinhua cited Zhang as saying on Wednesday.
Around 46,500 people affected by the earthquake have been transferred to 187 resettlement sites in towns surrounding the epicentre in Tingri, state media said.
Rescue personnel have begun erecting prefabricated houses to replace the tents for the displaced, CCTV reported. About 1,000 of the earthquake proof and heated houses are being sent to Tingri and can be erected in about 10 minutes.
The last comparable earthquake that struck the region was in November 2017 when a magnitude 6.9 temblor hit Mainling in the east, the strongest to shake southern Tibet since 1950.
The Mainling quake triggered more than 300 aftershocks, affecting over 12,000 people and damaging nearly 3,000 houses. Three people were hurt.

Title: Sinner begins Australian Open title defence against Jarry, Sabalenka gets Stephens
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:08:06 +0000
Content: Jannik Sinner begins his Australian Open title defence against Nicolas Jarry while women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka takes on 2017 U.S. Open winner Sloane Stephens after the draw for the year’s first Grand Slam was made at Melbourne Park on Thursday.
Novak Djokovic launches his latest bid for a record-extending 11th Australian Open title and 25th Grand Slam crown against U.S. wildcard Nishesh Basavareddy but his path to the Melbourne Park final will not be an easy one.
In the third round Djokovic could face Reilly Opelka, the big-serving American who beat the Serb in Brisbane this week, while third seed Carlos Alcaraz is a potential opponent in the quarter-finals.
Spaniard Alcaraz, who added the French Open trophy to his collection in 2024, begins his campaign to capture the one Grand Slam that has eluded him when he meets Alexander Shevchenko.
World number one Sinner must hit the ground running after being paired with Chilean Jarry, who beat the Italian in their first meeting in 2019 and took him to three sets in a losing effort in Beijing last year.
Women’s second seed Iga Swiatek plays Katerina Siniakova while third seed Coco Gauff faces an early challenge against fellow American Sofia Kenin, the Australian Open champion in 2020.
Paris Olympics gold medalist Zheng Qinwen, runner-up last year, meets a qualifier first up and is on a collision course with Sabalenka in the quarter-finals.
Two-times champion Naomi Osaka meets Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in a rematch of their first round encounter last year which the Japanese player lost in straight sets shortly after her return to the tour from a long maternity break.
There are question marks over Osaka’s fitness, however, after an abdominal injury forced her to quit while leading Clara Tauson in her first WTA final in almost three years in Auckland on Sunday.
Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, who has struggled with injuries since losing to Djokovic in the 2022 Wimbledon final, is due to take on Jacob Fearnley but his return to Melbourne Park remains in doubt due to an abdominal strain.
Fellow Australian Alex de Minaur has a difficult opener against Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, who stunned Alcaraz at last year’s U.S. Open.
The main draw gets underway on Sunday.

Title: Never sold users’ Siri data to anyone for any purpose: Apple
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 06:44:58 +0000
Content: Apple has reiterated its stance on privacy, asserting that it has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, sold the data to third parties, or made it available for advertising purposes. The statement follows the tech giant’s decision to pay $95 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that Siri had recorded private conversations and disclosed them to advertisers and third parties.
“We are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private and will continue to do so,” Apple said in a statement.
According to the company, its products and features are designed with privacy as a cornerstone, employing innovative techniques to ensure user data remains protected. “Privacy is a foundational part of the design process, driven by principles that include data minimisation, on-device intelligence, transparency and control, and strong security protections that work together to provide users with incredible experiences and peace of mind,” the company emphasized.
Apple explained that Siri is designed to process as much data as possible directly on the user’s device. This approach enables personalized experiences without transferring or analyzing personal information on Apple servers. For example, requests such as reading unread messages or providing search suggestions are processed entirely on the user’s device.
However, Apple acknowledged that some features require real-time input from its servers. Even in these cases, Siri uses minimal data to deliver accurate results and ensures that searches and requests are not associated with users’ Apple Accounts.
The company also clarified that it does not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt-in to help improve Siri. Even for those who opt-in, the recordings are used solely for enhancement purposes, and users can opt-out at any time.
Apple’s emphasis on privacy comes in the wake of increasing scrutiny over tech companies’ data practices. The $95 million settlement highlights the growing demand for transparency and accountability in how user data is managed.

Title: Musk discussed ways to oust British PM Starmer before next election, FT reports
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 06:38:37 +0000
Content: Billionaire Elon Musk has held private discussions with allies about removing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer from his position before the next general election, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
Musk, the world’s richest person and a close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, last month endorsed a German anti-immigration party ahead of elections slated in February, and has repeatedly commented on British politics, demanding Prime Minister Keir Starmer resign.
Musk has been weighing how he and his allies can destabilise the Labour government and has sought information about building support for alternative British political movements to force a change in government, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
“His view is that Western civilisation itself is threatened,” one of the people was quoted as telling the FT.
Musk earlier accused Starmer of what he said was a failure to prosecute gangs of men who raped young girls when he was director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Starmer subsequently defended his work as Britain’s top prosecutor.
Separately, Musk is scheduled to host Alternative for Germany party leader Alice Weidel in a live interview on X on Thursday. The Musk-endorsed German party has been labelled as right-wing extremist by the German security services.
Earlier this week, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere expressed his concern over Musk involving himself in the political issues of countries outside of the United States.

Title: India’s global trust is the result of hard work of Indians worldwide: Om Birla lauds Indian diaspora in UK
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 06:26:29 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Wednesday lauded the Indian diaspora in the UK for their contributions, saying that the growing global trust in India is the result of the hard work and efficiency of Indians living across the world. He emphasised how Indians’ culture of service, work ethic, and contributions to their host nations have shaped India’s global image, free from political influence.
Addressing the Indian diaspora at India House, Birla said, “I wish you all a very happy new year. January is a month of festivals and celebrations in India and in places across the world where Indians live. In some regions, it is celebrated as Makar Sankranti, in others as Pongal and Lohri. India is a land of festivals, religion, spirituality, and culture. Though you are far from India, your hearts and culture remain rooted in India.”
Birla underscored that leaders from all nations he has visited believe the 21st century belongs to India. He also highlighted his meetings with leaders in the UK, emphasizing their trust in India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“I am happy that because of your hard work, efficiency, and excellence in various fields, India’s name is resonating across the world. Wherever I traveled, whether meeting Presidents, Prime Ministers, or Speakers, all of them affirmed that the 21st century belongs to India,” Birla said.
“During my discussions with high-level leaders in the UK, they expressed similar sentiments, acknowledging that solutions to global challenges in the coming years will emerge from India.”
“I am proud that the world’s trust in India is a reflection of the hard work of Indians living abroad and their service-oriented culture, work ethic, and contributions to the development of their host nations, all while staying away from political influences. This is the image of India and its people worldwide,” he added.
Birla attended a reception held in his honour at India House in London on Wednesday. India’s High Commissioner to the UK, Vikram Doraiswami, was also present.
Earlier in the day, Birla met UK House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle and highlighted India’s distinction as the “world’s largest and most vibrant democracy.” The Lok Sabha speaker congratulated Hoyle on his re-election as Speaker of the UK House of Commons.
Birla also attended a lunch hosted by Hoyle at the Palace of Westminster. He expressed confidence that ties between the two nations would be further strengthened through his visit.
The Lok Sabha speaker also met the UK’s Minister for Intergovernmental Relations, Pat McFadden, and thanked him for his appreciation of India’s robust growth under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Birla is on a five-day official visit to the United Kingdom, Scotland, and Guernsey, an official statement said. During his visit to Scotland, Birla will meet Alison Johnstone MSP, Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, and John Swinney MSP, First Minister of Scotland. He will also interact with cross-party Members of the Scottish Parliament, according to the statement.
On January 10, Birla will chair the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth (CSPOC) in Guernsey. He will preside over this meeting in his capacity as the host of the 28th CSPOC, scheduled to be held in India in 2026.
The LS speaker will also meet his counterparts from other Parliaments on the sidelines of this meeting.

Title: Modi Sarkar has your back: Jaishankar assures Indian diaspora in opening remarks at 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 06:11:15 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday delivered the opening remarks at the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, emphasizing the crucial role of the Indian diaspora in nation-building and the government’s efforts to support Indians abroad.
Jaishankar likened the event to a “family reunion,” noting that Indians living abroad are not only witnessing India’s progress but also contributing to it and taking pride in their achievements.
Highlighting the diaspora’s contributions in technology, trade, tourism, and investment, Jaishankar said, “In a globalized era, the diaspora only becomes more important with each passing year.” 
He emphasized that India’s people-centric initiatives directly benefit the diaspora, particularly in improving ease of doing business, connectivity, and travel. Additionally, he outlined enhancements in passport services, consular assistance, and grievance resolution, all aimed at safeguarding the well-being of Indians overseas.
Reassuring the diaspora of the government’s commitment, Jaishankar said, “In times of difficulties, you can be confident that the Modi Sarkar has your back.”
He also praised Odisha’s historical role in India’s external engagements, drawing a connection between the ancient Bali Yatra and modern policies like the Act East Policy.
Despite global challenges, Jaishankar emphasized that India remains confident, modernizing, and inclusive, where tradition and technology coexist. He urged the diaspora to actively contribute to the realization of Viksit Bharat (Developed India).
The 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention, themed “Diaspora’s Contribution to a Viksit Bharat,” is being held in collaboration with the state government of Odisha from January 8 to 10 in Bhubaneswar. The flagship event, which brings together representatives from over 50 countries, serves as a platform for diaspora members to connect and contribute to India’s development journey.

Title: Ashwini Vaishnaw celebrates successful trial run of train on Chenab bridge
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 13:10:22 +0000
Content: The Northern Railway recently conducted a speed trial on the Katra-Banihal railway section, supervised by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS). Residents near Sangaldan railway station expressed optimism that the development would address connectivity issues and enable them to travel more easily to different parts of the country.
This trial, part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL), is expected to enhance travel convenience for those living in the Gool tehsil of Ramban district. The train service will allow people to reach Udhampur and Jammu in less time.
Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the commencement of the final safety inspection on the newly constructed 111-kilometer Banihal-Katra railway section. The section connects Jammu with the Kashmir Valley, a key part of the USBRL project.
In a social media post on X, the minister stated, “Final stage CRS safety inspection of the USBRL Project commences for Katra-Banihal section.”
According to a press release from the Ministry of Railways, once operational, the travel time between Jammu and Srinagar will be reduced to three hours and ten minutes. The Jammu station is also undergoing redevelopment, with eight new platforms and upgraded amenities planned to accommodate the growing demand.
An 8-coach Jammu-Srinagar Vande Bharat Express is expected to be introduced soon, marking a significant milestone in achieving rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and Jammu.
The Banihal-Katra section has been recognized for its engineering achievements, which include 97 kilometers of tunnels and four major bridges spanning 7 kilometers. Key challenges included constructing the world’s highest arch bridge on the Chenab River at 359 meters using the rock bolting method with 30,000 tonnes of steel.
Other notable infrastructure includes India’s first cable-stayed bridge on the Anji River, the Reasi Bridge, and the Bakkal Bridges. Engineers also employed Himalayan tunneling techniques instead of conventional tunneling methods to enhance safety, resulting in more robust main and escape tunnels stretching 67 kilometers.
The longest tunnel in this section, T50, measures 12.77 kilometers, featuring cameras installed at 50-meter intervals for safety and operational monitoring. These systems are connected to a central control room. Additionally, 215 kilometers of access roads built during the project have benefitted local communities.
The Jammu-Srinagar Vande Bharat Express has been specially designed for cold climates and is equipped with anti-freezing systems. A dedicated snow removal train will ensure uninterrupted passenger and freight service year-round.
To address seismic risks in the zone-V earthquake-prone region, anti-vibration seismic devices have been used in the project. These dampers will absorb tremors and ensure safe and consistent travel.
The train is capable of operating at temperatures as low as -20°C, with advanced heating systems, heated windshields, and elements in plumbing and bio-toilets to prevent freezing. These features aim to ensure operational continuity and passenger comfort during extreme weather conditions.
The Banihal-Katra railway section is anticipated to significantly enhance connectivity between Jammu and the Kashmir Valley while offering improved travel experiences for commuters.

Title: Armenian government approves bill to launch EU accession bid
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 11:49:18 +0000
Content: Armenia’s government on Thursday gave approval to a bill that calls for the country, once part of the Soviet Union, to launch a bid to join the European Union.
Armenia has in recent years deepened ties with the West at the expense of its traditionally close relations with Moscow, which it has accused of failing to defend it from longtime rival Azerbaijan.
The bill was drawn up following a successful petition.
In a document seen by Reuters, the government backed its introduction to parliament, saying it would represent “the beginning of the accession process of the Republic of Armenia to the European Union”.
Three other former members of the Soviet Union – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – have joined the bloc, a years-long negotiating process requiring harmonisation with EU legislation, among other things.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan underlined to the cabinet on Thursday that the public should not expect a rapid accession, and that it would in any case require approval by referendum.
In 2023, Pashinyan told the European Parliament that Armenia was ready to move as close to the EU as possible, although he stopped short of backing full membership.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia needed to understand Brussels’ position, and that Armenia could not join the EU while remaining a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, a trading bloc of some post-Soviet countries.
Though Armenia’s relations with the EU are warm, joining will not be easy.
The landlocked, mountainous country of 2.7 million people shares no border with the EU and has been in conflict with Azerbaijan, a major gas supplier to EU countries, since the late 1980s.
Azerbaijan in 2023 mounted a lightning offensive to retake control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that had been run for more than three decades by its ethnic Armenian majority with Yerevan’s backing, prompting its population to flee.
This week, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said Armenia presented a “fascist” threat that had to be destroyed, in what Yerevan said might be a prelude to fresh conflict.

Title: Indian stock market declines as Q3 results season begins

Content: India’s domestic benchmark indices ended lower on Thursday as investors awaited Q3 FY25 earnings. Selling was observed across IT, PSU banks, financial services, pharma, and auto sectors.
The Sensex closed at 77,620.21, down by 528.28 points or 0.68%, while the Nifty settled at 23,526.50, losing 162.45 points or 0.69%.
The Nifty Bank index finished at 49,503.5, dropping 331.55 points or 0.67%. The Nifty Midcap 100 index declined by 524.70 points or 0.93% to 55,745.90, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell by 247.30 points or 1.35% to close at 18,118.35.
Market experts attributed the market’s decline to cautious investor sentiment and selling in US bonds, in line with trends observed across Asian markets.
On the domestic front, the FMCG sector was among the gainers, while other sectors faced declines due to limited optimism surrounding Q3 earnings.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,210 shares advanced, 2,750 shares declined, and 107 remained unchanged.
In the Sensex pack, companies such as Zomato, Tata Steel, NTPC, L&T, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, TCS, SBI, Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, UltraTech Cement, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki, Reliance, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Finserv, and Power Grid recorded losses. On the other hand, Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever Limited, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, and ITC registered gains.
Foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 3,362.18 crore on January 8, while domestic institutional investors purchased equities valued at Rs 2,716.28 crore on the same day.
The Nifty index closed marginally above its support level of 23,500, forming a bearish candlestick below the 200-day EMA.
Analyst Vatsal Bhuva of LKP Securities said, “A breach below 23,500 would confirm a sell-on-rise trend with further downside potential. However, holding above this level could lead to consolidation. In the near term, 23,500 serves as key support, while resistance is placed at 23,800.”

Title: Jimmy Carter honored with state funeral before burial in Georgia hometown
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 11:19:08 +0000
Content: Jimmy Carter, the former U.S. president who struggled with a bad economy and a hostage crisis but went on to a long and admired post-White House career, will be honored at a state funeral in Washington on Thursday.
Fellow Democratic President Joe Biden will eulogize the 39th president who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. Republican President-elect Donald Trump will be among the luminaries at the funeral, before Carter’s body is returned to Georgia, where Carter was raised as a peanut farmer.
Tens of thousands of Americans over the past two days filed through the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work.
Some said they admired the former Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher who played a key role in the negotiation of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty as a gentle man, rather than a partisan combatant.
“We’ve come so far from where Jimmy Carter was as a person and it’s kinda sad,” said Dorian DeHaan, 67, who traveled some 275 miles (440 km) from Sugar Loaf, New York, to pay her respects. “I hope that this will be a reminder to people of what we need to get back to — that it’s not about the power, it’s about the people.”
As she waited in the public viewing line outside the Capitol, DeHaan said her daughter married into the family of the president’s younger sister, Ruth, presenting the opportunity to meet the former president in Plains, Georgia.
“But it’s a sad moment,” DeHaan said. “It’s the end of an era and I think we kind of have lost this real belief in humanity, in our presidency.”
The public viewing hours extended overnight and will end shortly before sunrise on Thursday. After that an honor guard will transport his remains to the Washington National Cathedral, which has hosted the state funerals of Carter’s immediate predecessor, Gerald Ford, and successor, Ronald Reagan.
Carter attended both men’s funerals and gave the eulogy for Ford, joking that they shared a love of a New Yorker magazine cartoon that depicted a little boy looking up at his father, saying, “Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president.”
MAN FROM PLAINS
Following the state funeral, Carter’s remains will be returned to his native Plains where he lived in his 44 post-White House years and made the base of operations for his diplomatic work and charitable efforts including Habitat for Humanity.
Carter lived longer than any other U.S. president and had been in hospice care for nearly two years before his death. His last public appearance was at wife Rosalynn’s funeral in November 2023, where he used a wheelchair and appeared frail.
In August, his grandson Jason Carter said Carter was looking forward to casting a ballot for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election, which she lost to Trump.
Biden, during his long career in the U.S. Senate, was the first member of that chamber to endorse Carter for president.
Sarah Jolie, 59, had traveled from her home outside of Chicago to pay her respects. She carried a picture of the youth award she received in junior high from the Carter administration for “outstanding achievement in environmental protection services.”
“He just was a hero to me,” Jolie said. “He espoused things for generations that nobody else was.”

Title: Pravasi Bharatiya Divas: PM Modi urges diaspora to become force behind India’s march towards ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 11:15:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) in Bhubaneswar on Thursday, urging the Indian diaspora to contribute to India’s goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.
“India achieved independence in 1947, and our diaspora played a role in this by contributing to the freedom struggle from abroad. Now we aim to make India a developed nation by 2047,” said Prime Minister Modi.
PM Modi recognized the contributions of Indians living abroad, stating that their efforts had made India a global leader in remittances.
He emphasized that India’s growth is not confined to its metropolitan areas, pointing out that a large portion of the population resides in smaller towns and villages. The Prime Minister urged the diaspora to promote heritage tourism in their host countries.
“There’s a lot of Indian culture there. We have to connect the world with this heritage,” said PM Modi.
He encouraged members of the diaspora to visit smaller towns and villages in India, experience local attractions, and share their impressions abroad.
The Prime Minister also appealed to the diaspora to spread awareness about India’s history, including its past prosperity, colonial struggles, and cultural resilience. He said, “You have the opportunity to convey the real history of India to the younger generations in your countries of residence.”
PM Modi noted that India is following the mantra of development along with heritage. He said that the Indian government during the G-20 event organised various meetings in every nook and corner of the country so that the world could get a first-hand experience of India’s diversity. He informed the gathering that the Indian government has decided to establish Thiruvalluvar Culture Centres to propagate the thoughts of Saint Thiruvalluvar.
Referring to a historical project documenting the journey of people of Gujarati origin in Oman, PM Modi highlighted the importance of preserving and sharing the stories of the diaspora’s global legacy. He called these stories a shared heritage and underscored the need to cherish them.
PM Modi also called for the promotion of Indian products abroad. “You also have a big role in making India’s local products global. You must buy Made in India food packets, Made in India clothes and any such thing,” he urged.
Referring to the diaspora as ambassadors of India, PM Modi assured them of the government’s commitment to their welfare during crises. “Your safety and welfare are a priority. We consider it our duty to support the diaspora in challenging times, wherever they may be,” he stated.
During his speech, he also mentioned Odisha’s historical and cultural contributions, referencing sites like the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, the Konark Sun Temple, and ancient ports such as Tamralipti and Manikpatna.
The 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas concluded with a focus on the pivotal role of the diaspora in India’s progress towards 2047.

Title: Hollywood Hills burn as LA engulfed by ‘the big one’
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 11:02:27 +0000
Content: The Hollywood Hills blazed uncontrollably on Thursday morning as the worst wildfires in the history of Los Angeles raged across the city and deep into the storied heartland of the American film industry.
A crescent of flame squeezed Los Angeles in a huge pincer visible from space. More than 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate as dry, hurricane-force winds hindered firefighting operations and spread the flames. At least five people have been killed since the fires erupted on Tuesday.
The homes of movie stars and celebrities were among those consumed by flames, which tore through some of the world’s most lavish real estate and above showbiz landmarks instantly recognisable around the world.
“This firestorm is the big one,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told a press conference after rushing back to the city, cutting short an official trip to Ghana.
At least six separate wildfires were burning in Los Angeles County. Three of them were totally out of control, including a pair of huge conflagrations on the city’s eastern and western flanks and the smaller Sunset Fire raging in Hollywood Hills just above Hollywood Boulevard and its Walk of Fame.
The L.A. Fire Department issued an evacuation order for people in an area within Hollywood Boulevard to the south, Mulholland Drive to the north, the 101 Freeway to the east and Laurel Canyon Boulevard to the west – all iconic addresses for film, TV and music. The Hollywood Sign is across the freeway.
On the west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire consumed 15,832 acres (6,406 hectares) and hundreds of structures in the hills between Santa Monica and Malibu, racing down Topanga Canyon until reaching the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.
“We are heartbroken of course, but with the love of children and friends we will get through this,” said film star Billy Crystal and his wife Janice, announcing the Pacific Palisades home where they had lived since 1979 had been destroyed.
Media personality Paris Hilton said she was “heartbroken beyond words” after watching her beachfront house in Malibu “burn to the ground on live TV”.
Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis posted on Instagram: “My community and possibly my home is on fire…. Pray if you believe in it and even if you don’t, pray for those who do.”
Thousands of Los Angelenos fleeing the flames sought refuge in temporary shelters.
Foad Farid found refuge in the gym of the Westwood Recreation Center with nothing but his car and his phone. Neighbors dropped off blankets, clothing, water, pizza and pet food. Jeff Harris arrived towing his Feisty Fish Poke food truck and began serving meals. “I’m just here to help,” he said.
Kevin Williams, at an evacuation center in Pasadena, said he knew it was time to run when gas canisters at his neighbors’ homes began exploding under the heat.
“The wind whipped up, the flames were up about 30 or 40 feet high, and you hear ‘pop, pop, pop’. It sounded like a war zone.”

Aerial video by KTLA television showed block after block of smoldering homes in Pacific Palisades, the smoky grid occasionally punctuated by the orange blaze of another home still on fire.
To the east, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Eaton Fire claimed another 10,600 acres (4,289 hectares), another 1,000 structures, and killed at least five people, officials said.
“We’re facing a historic natural disaster. And I think that can’t be stated strong enough,” Kevin McGowan, director of emergency management for Los Angeles County, told a press conference.
Even though forecasters said winds would subside briefly on Wednesday night, so-called red flag conditions were expected to remain until Friday.
Large animals found shelter from the wildfires at a college equestrian center that opened its doors to horses, alpacas, llamas and even pigs.
“I think they sense the fire and so I really had to lead them in a way that they understood that they were being taken somewhere safe,” said Jaye Riedinger, 37, a creative director from Topanga, who left her home with her mustang horses.
Nearly 300,000 homes and businesses were without power in Los Angeles County, down from nearly 1 million earlier on Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us. School was canceled throughout Los Angeles County at least through Thursday.
WATER WOES
The scale and spread of the blazes stretched exhausted firefighting crews beyond their capacity.
Firefighters from six other U.S. states were being rushed to California, while an additional 250 engine companies with 1,000 personnel were being moved from Northern California to Southern California, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told a press conference.
Water shortages caused some hydrants to run dry in upscale Pacific Palisades, officials said.
“We pushed the system to the extreme. We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water systems,” Janisse Quinones, chief executive of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, told reporters.
The fires struck at an especially vulnerable time for Southern California, which has not seen significant rainfall for months. Then came the powerful Santa Ana winds, bringing dry desert air from the east toward the coastal mountains, fanning wildfires while blowing over the hilltops and down through the canyons.

Title: Indian-origin researcher identifies gene linked to autism and seizures
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 10:59:55 +0000
Content: A team of researchers, led by Indian-origin neuroscientist and researcher Viji Santhakumar, has identified a gene that contributes to the behavioural changes associated with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy.
The gene, called neuropilin2, encodes a receptor involved in cell-cell interactions in the brain and plays a crucial role in regulating the development of neural circuits.
The study, published in Nature Molecular Psychiatry, provides a pathway for future treatments aimed at alleviating the challenging symptoms of these frequently co-occurring conditions.
Previous research has linked mutations in neuropilin2 to neurological disorders like autism and epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying these conditions have remained unclear.
Santhakumar and her team at the University of California–Riverside created a mouse model to examine the effects of deleting the neuropilin2 gene. Their findings revealed that the absence of neuropilin2 disrupts the migration of inhibitory neurons, disturbing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain.
“This imbalance leads to autism-like behaviours and an increased risk of seizures,” said Santhakumar, professor of molecular, cell, and systems biology.
“The results highlight the influence of a single gene on both excitatory and inhibitory systems in the brain. We show that disrupting inhibitory circuit development is sufficient to cause autism-related behaviours and epilepsy to co-occur,” she added.
By selectively deleting neuropilin2 during a critical developmental window, researchers observed impairments in inhibitory regulation of neural circuits, leading to deficits in behavioural flexibility, social interactions, and heightened seizure susceptibility.
The findings suggest that targeting specific phases of neuronal development could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions, potentially preventing the onset of these disorders if detected early.
“By isolating the role of inhibitory circuit formation, we may develop therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with autism, particularly those who experience seizures,” Santhakumar noted.
The study included contributions from Deepak Subramanian, Andrew Huang, and Samiksha Komatireddy of UC-Riverside, along with Carol Eisenberg, Jiyeon Baek, Haniya Naveed, Michael W. Shiflett, and Tracy S. Tran of Rutgers University.

Title: SIP inflows in India cross Rs 26,000 crore mark for 1st time in December: AMFI
Publication Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2025 10:49:51 +0000
Content: Monthly systematic investment plans (SIPs) surpassed the Rs 26,000 crore mark for the first time in the month of December, showcasing that small investors continue to rely on mutual funds for long-term investments, as per the data released by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) on Thursday.
The SIP contribution during the last month stood at Rs 26,459 crore compared to 25,320 crore in November.
Along with the SIP, mutual fund (MF) folio also surged to 22.50 crore in December, from 22.02 crore in the previous month.
According to reports, net inflows into SIPs surged by a massive 233 percent year-on-year last year, despite challenging geopolitical conditions—demonstrating the resilience of the Indian economy.
Ashwini Kumar, from ICRA Analytics, said that India’s mutual fund industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years, driven by the country’s steady economic expansion.
The surge in SIP comes at a time when equity market performance was subdued last month. Both the Sensex and Nifty were down 2.08 per cent and 2.02 per cent in December.
A record 42,76,207 investors joined the Indian stock market in November, according to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) data. In the July-September period this year, a total of 1,60,06,447 (over 1.6 crore) people joined the stock market, as India’s equity markets soared to record highs.
The stock exchange also informed that till December 23 this year, the total number of registered investors stood at 21,02,25,329 (over 21.02 crore).
