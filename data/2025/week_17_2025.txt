Title: Bhutan turns to ‘green’ cryptocurrency to fuel economy
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:18:29 +0000
Content: The Himalayan nation of Bhutan is exploring ways to mine and leverage green cryptocurrencies using hydropower to boost its economy and create jobs to reduce brain drain, the chief executive of its sovereign wealth fund said.
Green cryptocurrencies are digital currencies mined using clean energy resources such as wind, hydro or solar power instead of fossil fuel.
Sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, Bhutan has earned millions of dollars in recent years by investing in some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies and used some of its profit to pay government salaries for two years, two senior officials in Thimphu, the capital said.
“We are a nation that runs 100% on hydropower, and every digital coin we mine in Bhutan using hydropower offsets that coin which gets mined using fossil fuels,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, the CEO of the fund, Druk Holding and Investments Ltd.
“So a coin mined in Bhutan will contribute to the green economy,” he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Dahal said the fund, which controls Bhutan’s only power generation utility, began adding cryptocurrencies to its portfolio in 2019, seeing virtual currencies as a tactical investment and a gamechanger for the country.
Bhutan is famed for its Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, an economic gauge that incorporates factors ignored by the usual measures of gross domestic product, such as recreation, emotional well-being and sustainability.
It uses hydropower to operate energy-guzzling supercomputers to create digital assets that can be added to the blockchain.
Officials are exploring whether large conglomerates could buy Bhutan’s “green” coins to meet their targets on environmental, social and governance (ESG) norms.
“Bitcoin has not just given more value to hydropower energy, it has also increased access to liquidity in foreign currency,” said Dahal, who added that training Bhutan’s young people in blockchain and AI techniques would fuel jobs.
The nation of about 800,000 is battling an exodus of young, educated people. The government estimates that more than a tenth of its young people sought greener pastures between 2022 and 2023, taking unemployment in that age group to 16.5% in 2024.
Analysts said Bhutan’s ambitious plan to become the capital of green digital currency depends on expanding its hydropower generation to a potential of 33 gigawatts versus existing capacity of about 3.5 gigawatts.
“We have plans to generate 15 gigawatts in the next 10 to 15 years,” Dahal added.

Title: Soccer-Saudi Arabia open to 64-team World Cup in 2034
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:50:53 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia would be ready and willing to host a 64-team World Cup in 2034 if FIFA accepts a controversial proposal to expand the tournament from 48, according to the kingdom’s sports minister.
South America’s CONMEBOL has officially suggested staging the centenary 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with 64 teams but the idea has been opposed by some other continental confederations.
Next year’s tournament hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will have 48 countries participating, up from 32 in 2022.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told a select group of reporters at the Saudi Arabian Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah that his country would have no objection to an increase in the numbers for 2034.
“We’re ready, or we will be ready, inshallah (God willing). If that’s a decision that FIFA takes and thinks that that’s a good decision for everyone, then we’re more than happy to deliver on it,” he said.
He pointed to the infrastructure already in place for Islamic pilgrims, with four million people attending Mecca for Umrah during Ramadan this year and five million expected for the Hajj.
The global soccer governing body officially announced Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 men’s World Cup in December, a bid that was uncontested but strongly criticised by rights organisations.
The Kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years but critics accuse it of ‘sportswashing’ its human rights record. The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The bid book pledged 15 stadiums, new or refurbished, by 2032 and which are expected to be completed with the help of migrant labour.
Al-Faisal said worker safety was of the highest priority and Saudi organisers were talking regularly with FIFA and 2022 hosts and neighbours Qatar, the first World Cup in the region, to learn from their experience.
He said the death, reported last month, of a worker at the Aramco Stadium construction site in Al Khobar had come after millions of hours without issue.
“Every incident we take seriously, we file an investigation, we look what went wrong,” said the minister. “Unfortunately, in construction, these things happen.”
He said Saudi Arabia was part of the International Labour Organisation and a 2021 Labour Reform Act had abolished the kafala system that binds migrant workers to one employer and prevents them from leaving without the employer’s approval.
Alcohol, prohibited for observant Muslims, is banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Faisal confirmed the World Cup would be dry.
“The law now here in Saudi is that there’s no alcohol. Will that change in the future? We don’t know. But I don’t see it really affecting our sporting events at all,” he said.
“We’ve had more than 100 international events so far. We’ve had people come from all over the world to attend these sporting events. And everyone’s happy with the hospitality, the setup, the experience that they get.
“I don’t see it as an issue, to be honest. So I hope it’s not going to be an issue”.
Alcohol was not sold at stadiums in Qatar, where drinking in public is illegal, in 2022 but beer was available at designated fan zones and in some hotels.

Title: Prime Minister’s  Jeddah visit set to marks new chapter in India-Saudi Arabia relations
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:41:20 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Jeddah this week, marking the first visit by an Indian leader to Saudi Arabia’s commercial hub in over four decades. The high-profile visit underscores the remarkable transformation of India-Saudi relations from modest beginnings to a comprehensive strategic partnership spanning economic, defense, and cultural dimensions.
The visit comes amid intensified diplomatic engagement between the two nations, with 11 ministerial-level visits from India to Saudi Arabia since the beginning of 2024 alone.
Speaking about the significance of the upcoming visit, Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Suhel Ajaz Khan said, “The Honorable Prime Minister is visiting from April 22nd to 23rd. This is his first visit to Jeddah, though on two previous occasions he has visited Saudi Arabia. This visit is very important as we are strengthening our strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia.”
The Ambassador highlighted how bilateral ties have evolved in recent years. “Our people-to-people connections and the strategic partnership have given a new direction to the relationship. Talks are expected to cover various areas including defense partnership, energy cooperation, and many other issues related to regional and global political scenarios,” he added.
Saudi Arabia is home to approximately 2.7 million Indians who continue to play a vital role in the Kingdom’s development. “The community has participated in the development of Saudi Arabia and continues to contribute towards its prosperity while maintaining a strong connection with India. In fact, the Indian community serves as a living bridge between India and Saudi Arabia,” Khan noted.
The visit is expected to result in several new agreements that will further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations, building on their shared interests in regional stability, energy security, and economic growth.

Title: Scientists create novel method to identify healthy and cancerous cells
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:24:59 +0000
Content: Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan on Saturday said they have found that the motion of unlabelled cells can be used to tell whether they are cancerous or healthy.
They observed malignant fibrosarcoma cells and healthy fibroblasts on a dish and found that tracking and analysis of their paths can be used to differentiate them with up to 94 per cent accuracy.
Beyond diagnosis, their technique may also shed light on cell motility related functions, like tissue healing, according to the study published in the journal PLOS One.
The team of researchers, led by Professor Hiromi Miyoshi, came up with a way of tracking cells using phase-contrast microscopy, one of the most common ways of observing cells.
Phase-contrast microscopy is entirely label free, allowing cells to move about on a petri dish closer to their native state, and is not affected by the optical properties of the plastic petri dishes through which cells are imaged.
Through innovative image analysis, they were able to extract trajectories of many individual cells. They focused on properties of the paths taken, like migration speed, and how curvy the paths were, all of which would encode subtle differences in deformation and movement.
As a test, they compared healthy fibroblast cells, the key component of animal tissue, and malignant fibrosarcoma cells, cancerous cells which derive from fibrous connective tissue.
They were able to show that the cells migrated in subtly different ways, as characterised by the “sum of turn angles” (how curvy the paths were), the frequency of shallow turns, and how quickly they moved. In fact, by combining both the sum of turn angles and how often they made shallow turns, they could predict whether a cell was cancerous or not with an accuracy of 94 per cent.
The team’s work not only promises a new way to discriminate cancer cells, but applications to research of any biological function based on cell motility, like the healing of wounds and tissue growth, said the study.

Title: India’s forex, money markets have doubled in last 4 years: RBI Governor
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:06:37 +0000
Content: India’s financial markets have developed into a dynamic and resilient force to fuel economic growth with an almost doubling of the foreign exchange market from $32 billion in 2020 to $60 billion in 2024 and the average daily volumes in the overnight money markets surging from about Rs 3 lakh crore to over Rs 5.4 lakh in this four-year period, according to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.
There has also been a 40 per cent surge in average daily volumes in the government securities (G-secs) markets to Rs 66,000 crore over the same period.
Addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI annual conference in Bali this weekend, Malhotra said the levels of transparency in Indian markets are at par with the best in the world.
“With recent regulatory reforms, we have seen greater product and participant diversity, and the onshore and offshore markets have become tightly integrated,” he pointed out.
Malhotra said all the financial market segments of the country, including Forex, G-sec, and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the Rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground.
The foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads. There is growing transparency in this market. All FX derivatives are reported to the Trade Repository, and reporting of cash and spot transactions has commenced. A bulk of FX spot transactions are traded on electronic trading platforms (ETPs). Authorised trading platforms are also available for forward transactions, but there appears to be a preference for such trades to take place bilaterally. Trading on ETPs enhances transparency and market efficiency. We would like to see an increasing share of transactions done on ETPs, he said..
Malhotra further stated that fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continue to engage the RBI’s attention.
“Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers is far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. FX-Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking FX transactions, has witnessed a lukewarm response, and our feedback is that this is largely due to the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers,” The RBI governor said.
He highlighted that there are regulations in place to ensure transparency in pricing for retail customers, including a mandate for disclosing the mid-market or interbank rate to customers. As an industry, there is a need for market-makers to introspect and assess in what ways they can effectively deliver on these regulatory and fiduciary mandates, he added.
Malhotra further stated that the RBI has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.
He urged all the financial market participants, including Authorised Dealers, to extend their full cooperation in ensuring that the pilot is implemented smoothly and successfully.
He red-flagged the use of banking channels for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. “This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,” the RBI Governor said.

Title: Iran, US task experts with framework for a nuclear deal after ‘progress’ in talks
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:31:43 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States agreed on Saturday to begin drawing up a framework for a potential nuclear deal, Iran’s foreign minister said, after talks that a U.S. official described as yielding “very good progress.”
U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers during his first term in 2018, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
At their second indirect meeting in a week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi negotiated for four hours in Rome with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff through an Omani official who shuttled messages between them.
Speaking on state TV after the talks, Araqchi described the engagement as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
“We were able to make some progress on a number of principles and goals, and ultimately reached a better understanding,” Araqchi said.
“It was agreed that negotiations will continue and move into the next phase, in which expert-level meetings will begin on Wednesday in Oman. The experts will have the opportunity to start designing a framework for an agreement,” he said.
The top negotiators would meet again in Oman next Saturday to “review the experts’ work and assess how closely it aligns with the principles of a potential agreement,” he added.
Echoing cautious comments last week from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, he said: “We cannot say for certain that we are optimistic. We are acting very cautiously. There is no reason either to be overly pessimistic.”
Iran, which calls its nuclear programme peaceful, says it is willing to discuss limited curbs to its atomic work in return for lifting international sanctions.
A Trump administration official confirmed that the two sides agreed to meet again next week.
“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” the official said.
Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”
Washington’s ally Israel, which opposed the 2015 agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned in 2018, has not ruled out an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.
Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.
A senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity on Friday, listed its red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:27:10 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidUP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s 1810.HK robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.
Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.
“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.
SOME ROBOTS STRUGGLE
Some robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.
Tang, the robotic centre’s CTO, said: “A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”

Title: Red notice sought from Interpol against Hasina, 11 others: Bangladesh Police
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:28:57 +0000
Content: The National Central Bureau (NCB) of Bangladesh Police has submitted a request to Interpol seeking a ‘red notice’ against 12 people, including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; former road transport and bridges minister and Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader; and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan.
Confirming the development, Enamul Haque Sagor, Assistant Inspector General (Media) at the Police Headquarters, said on Saturday that the NCB branch makes such requests to Interpol based on appeals received from courts, public prosecutors, or investigating agencies, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
“These applications are filed in connection with allegations that emerge during investigations or through ongoing case proceedings,” he said.
Interpol plays a key role in identifying the locations of fugitives residing abroad. Once the whereabouts of any absconding individual are confirmed, that information is relayed to Interpol, the AIG added.
The request for the Red Notice is currently under process, he noted.
Meanwhile, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of the International Crimes Tribunal, Dhaka in November last year formally requested the Police Headquarters to seek Interpol’s assistance in arresting Sheikh Hasina and others deemed fugitives, reports UNB.

Title: JP Nadda leads pledge for healthy liver, highlights importance of a healthy lifestyle
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 07:14:20 +0000
Content: Union Health Minister JP Nadda on Monday attended a pledge-taking ceremony for liver health at Nirman Bhawan in the national capital, where he emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy liver.
Highlighting the importance of liver health, Nadda said, “We are fortunate to be here today. We must keep certain things in mind. First, if the liver is healthy, digestion functions well. A healthy liver aids in detoxification and energy storage.”
He also pointed out that when the liver is not functioning properly, it can lead to various health issues such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and even cancer.
“But if the liver is not in good condition, our body becomes vulnerable to several diseases — heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and even cancer. That’s why it’s important to care for the liver, and the key to that is maintaining a healthy lifestyle,” he added.
Nadda stressed that people often unknowingly harm their bodies due to a lack of awareness about healthy habits. He also emphasized the need for healthcare professionals to prioritize their own health.
“The biggest issue is that, knowingly or unknowingly, we do a lot of injustice to our bodies. We don’t always know what is good or bad for us, and often assume we’re doing fine. That’s why we decided to organize this health camp — at the very least, those responsible for public health should themselves be healthy,” he said.
Speaking about liver disease prevention, Nadda noted that many liver problems are reversible with timely lifestyle changes.
“What’s encouraging is that many liver-related problems are reversible. If we adopt healthier lifestyles, these issues can be resolved. The liver can heal on its own. What’s important is to understand the condition and how to maintain it, even when it seems fine,” he said.
Earlier, on April 19, marking World Liver Day, Nadda urged people to reduce their edible oil intake by at least 10% and adopt healthier habits.
“This #WorldLiverDay, take a pledge to reduce your edible oil intake by at least 10% and embrace a healthier lifestyle. Small changes can lead to big results when we treat food as medicine,” he wrote in a post on X, responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s similar call for reducing oil consumption.
The Union Minister also launched a nationwide initiative to tackle liver disease: HEALD — Healthy Liver Education and Alcohol-associated Liver Disease Prevention. This first-of-its-kind program is envisioned as a multi-sectoral initiative combining public education, early screening, psychological and medical treatment for alcohol use disorders, and liver disease management.

Title: Civil servants’ role crucial in achieving Viksit Bharat, says PM Modi on Civil Services Day
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:57:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday addressed the 17th Civil Services Day programme in the national capital, lauding the relentless efforts of India’s civil servants and underlining their key role in realising the dream of a ‘Viksit Bharat.’
Speaking at Vigyan Bhawan, PM Modi paid rich tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, recalling his iconic 1947 address in which he called civil servants the “steel frame” of India.
“This Civil Services Day is special for several reasons. We are celebrating 75 years of our Constitution and the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. On April 21, 1947, he had described you (civil servants) as the steel frame of India,” he said.
Reflecting on Patel’s vision, the Prime Minister said, “He laid out the ideals of a civil servant — one who serves the nation with honesty, discipline, democratic spirit, and dedication. These lessons of Sardar Patel become even more relevant as we move towards the resolution of Viksit Bharat.”
PM Modi said that achieving the dream of a Viksit Bharat will require every arm of progress to work in synergy.
“Our bureaucracy and policy-making cannot function with outdated methods when the world is evolving so quickly. Our young generation is growing up with rapid technological changes, new gadgets every two to three years. We must match this pace,” he stated.
Highlighting areas where India must grow — from clean energy to sports and space — the Prime Minister stressed, “Everyone is looking towards you (civil servants). You have a big responsibility to help India become the world’s third-largest economy. We must work together to ensure this goal is achieved.”
This year’s theme for Civil Services Day is ‘Holistic Development of India,’ which the Prime Minister explained as “no village left behind, no family left behind.”
He also presented the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration, recognising top-performing officials behind initiatives like PM Vishwakarma, Poshan Tracker, Siksha Setu Axom, and Sugamya Pustakalaya.
“Good governance is not defined by the number of schemes but by the impact it creates on the ground,” he said. Citing examples, he mentioned districts where solar power and improved attendance systems have shown positive results and praised the efforts of public administrators across the country.
He added that in the last decade, India has moved beyond incremental progress to transformative change.
“Today, India’s governance model focuses on next-generation reforms. Through technology and innovation, we’re bridging the gap between government and citizens. These changes are visible not only in urban and rural areas but also in remote corners of the country,” he said.
PM Modi cited Bhagalpur in Bihar, where the registration of pregnant women in Jagdishpur block rose from 25 per cent to over 90 per cent. In Marwah block of Jammu and Kashmir, institutional deliveries increased from 30 per cent to 100 per cent, reflecting improved healthcare access.
Touching upon India’s global leadership, the Prime Minister highlighted the scale of its G20 presidency. “For the first time in G20 history, more than 200 meetings took place across over 60 cities, creating a wide and inclusive footprint. This is the holistic approach of today’s India,” he said, adding, “India is not just participating — India is leading.”
He noted that while many now talk about government efficiency, India is already ahead of other countries by a decade. “We have eliminated delays and are creating new processes. Over 40,000 compliances have been removed to boost ease of doing business,” he said.
The Prime Minister recalled early opposition to reforms, including compliance reduction and decriminalisation of business errors.
He said that the foundation laid over the past decade has greatly strengthened the path towards Viksit Bharat 2047.
“We cannot evaluate our work or performance by comparing it to previous governments…We must set our own benchmarks. We need to measure how far we still are from the goal of a ‘Viksit Bharat by 2047’. The time for tallying up what we have achieved so far is over.
“India is now the most populous country in the world. Ensuring saturation of basic facilities should be our top priority,” the Prime Minister added.
“In the last ten years, we built 4 crore (40 million) permanent houses for the poor, but now we have a target of building 3 crore more. We have provided tap water connections to 12 crore homes in 5–6 years. Now, we must ensure every household has access to tap water as soon as possible. In ten years, we have built over 11 crore toilets for the poor. Now, we need to quickly achieve new targets related to waste management,” he mentioned.
He also launched two e-books — Holistic Development of Districts and Select Innovations — and honoured top-performing districts in schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM Vishwakarma Yojana, Har Ghar Jal, and PM Awas Yojana.
Awarded districts included Rajkot in Gujarat, Gomti in Tripura, Tinsukia in Assam, Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir, and Koraput in Odisha.
Blocks recognised under the Aspirational Block Programme included Gamharia (Jharkhand), Parappa (Kerala), Narnoor (Telangana), Ganganagar (Tripura), and Rama (Madhya Pradesh).

Title: ‘Cancer’ of billion-dollar cyberscam industry spreading globally – UN
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:49:10 +0000
Content: Asian crime syndicates behind the multibillion-dollar cyberscam industry are expanding globally including to South America and Africa, as raids in Southeast Asia fail to contain their activities, the United Nations said in a report on Monday.
Criminal networks that emerged in Southeast Asia in recent years, opening sprawling compounds housing tens of thousands of workers, many trafficked and forced to scam victims around the world, have evolved into a sophisticated global industry, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.
Even as Southeast Asian governments have intensified a crackdown, syndicates have moved within and beyond the region, the agency said, adding that a “potentially irreversible spillover has taken place… leaving criminal groups free to pick, choose, and move… as needed”.
“It spreads like a cancer,” said John Wojcik, a regional analyst for UNODC. “Authorities treat it in one area, but the roots never disappear; they simply migrate.”
Conservative estimates indicate there are hundreds of large-scale scam farms around the world generating tens of billions of dollars in annual profits, the UNODC said. The agency called on countries to work together and intensify efforts to disrupt the gangs’ financing.
“The regional cyberfraud industry… has outpaced other transnational crimes, given that it is easily scalable and able to reach millions of potential victims online, with no need to move or traffic illicit goods across borders,” said Wojcik.
The United States alone reported more than $5.6 billion in losses to cryptocurrency scams in 2023, including more than $4 million in so-called pig-butchering scams or romance scams designed to extort money from often elderly and vulnerable people.
‘INFLECTION POINT’
In recent months, authorities from China, where many of the gangs originate, Thailand and Myanmar have led a crackdown on scam operations in lawless areas of the Thai-Myanmar border, with Thailand cutting power, fuel and internet supply to areas housing scam compounds.
But syndicates have adapted, shifting operations between “the most remote, vulnerable, and underprepared parts of Southeast Asia”, especially in Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia, and beyond, exploiting jurisdictions with weak governance and high rates of corruption, the UNODC said.
Raids in parts of Cambodia where the industry is most visible “led to significant expansion in more remote locations”, including the country’s western Koh Kong province, as well as areas bordering Thailand and Vietnam, the U.N. agency said.
New sites also continue to be developed in Myanmar, it added, a country in the throes of an expanding conflict since the military seized power four years ago.
Spokespeople for the Cambodian government and Myanmar junta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Syndicates have expanded into South America, the U.N. agency said, seeking to enhance money laundering and underground banking partnerships with South American drug cartels.
They are increasingly establishing operations in Africa, including in Zambia, Angola, and Namibia, and in Eastern Europe including Georgia, the agency said.
Gangs have also rapidly diversified their workforce, recruiting people from dozens of nationalities, according to the agency, reflecting how the industry scams targets across the globe and has sought to evade anti-trafficking efforts.
Citizens of more than 50 countries – from Brazil to Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan – were rescued during recent crackdowns on the Thai-Myanmar border.
The international community is at a “critical inflection point,” the UNODC said, urging that failure to address the problem would have “unprecedented consequences for Southeast Asia that reverberate globally”.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released two e-Coffee Table Books — “Holistic Development of Districts for Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration” and “Select Innovations from Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration” — highlighting exemplary governance initiatives and innovative practices recognized under the Prime Minister’s Awards.
The Prime Minister also conferred the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration for effective implementation of identified priority programmes and innovations to districts, as well as central and state government organisations.
A film showcasing the award-winning initiatives was screened before the presentation of the awards.
Jharkhand’s Gamharia block in Seraikella-Kharsawan district received the Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence in Public Administration, 2024, in the category of the Aspirational Block Programme. Ravi Shankar Shukla, Deputy Commissioner of Seraikella-Kharsawan, received the award on behalf of block Gamharia, which secured first place among 500 aspirational blocks across the country.
Civil Services Day is an occasion for civil servants across India to rededicate themselves to the service of citizens and renew their commitment to public service and excellence in governance. This date commemorates the day when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel addressed the probationers of the Administrative Service at Metcalfe House, Delhi, in 1947.
To mark Civil Services Day, the government is organising a day-long conference at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi.
The Aspirational Block Programme is a NITI Aayog initiative, launched on January 7, 2023. It focuses on improving the overall quality of life in 500 underdeveloped blocks across the country by accelerating socio-economic development through improved governance, service delivery, and monitoring of key indicators. The programme focuses on five areas: health and nutrition, education, agriculture and allied services, basic infrastructure, and social development.
The Scheme for Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration was instituted to recognise extraordinary and innovative work done by districts and organisations of the central and state governments for the welfare of the common citizen.

Title: China warns countries against striking trade deals with US at its expense
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 05:07:06 +0000
Content: China on Monday accused Washington of abusing tariffs and warned countries against striking a broader economic deal with the United States at its expense, ratcheting up its rhetoric in a spiralling trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Beijing will firmly oppose any party striking a deal at China’s expense and “will take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner,” its Commerce Ministry said.
The ministry was responding to a Bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the Trump administration is preparing to pressure nations seeking tariff reductions or exemptions from the U.S. to curb trade with China, including imposing monetary sanctions.
President Donald Trump paused the sweeping tariffs he announced on dozens of countries on April 2 except those on China, singling out the world’s second largest economy for the biggest levies.
In a series of moves, Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting Beijing to slap retaliatory duties of 125% on U.S. goods. Last week, China signalled that its own across-the-board rates would not rise further.
“The United States has abused tariffs on all trading partners under the banner of so-called ‘equivalence’, while also forcing all parties to start so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ negotiations with them,” the ministry spokesperson said.
China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests, and is willing to strengthen solidarity with all parties, the ministry said.
“The fact is, nobody wants to pick a side,” said Bo Zhengyuan, partner at China-based policy consultancy Plenum.
“If countries have high reliance on China in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, I don’t think they’ll be buying into U.S. demands. Many Southeast Asian countries belong to this category.”
Pursuing a hardline stance, Beijing will this week convene an informal United Nations Security Council meeting to accuse Washington of bullying and “casting a shadow over the global efforts for peace and development” by weaponizing tariffs.
Earlier this month, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said nearly 50 countries have approached him to discuss the steep additional tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
Several bilateral talks on tariffs have taken place since, with Japan considering raising soybean and rice imports as part of its talks with the U.S. while Indonesia is planning to increase U.S. food and commodities imports and reduce orders from other nations.
CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE
Trump’s tariff policies have rattled financial markets as investors fear a severe disruption in world trade could tip the global economy into recession.
On Monday, Chinese stocks inched higher, showing little reaction to the commerce ministry comments, though investors have generally remained cautious on Chinese assets due to the rising growth risks.
The Trump administration also has been trying to curb Beijing’s progress in developing advanced semiconductor chips which it says could be used for military purposes, and last week imposed port fees on China-built vessels to limit China’s dominance in shipbuilding.
AI chip giant Nvidia said last week it would take $5.5 billion in charges due to the administration’s curbs on AI chip exports.
China’s President Xi Jinping visited three Southeast Asian countries last week in a move to bolster regional ties, calling on trade partners to oppose unilateral bullying.
Beijing has said it is “tearing down walls” and expanding its circle of trading partners amid the trade row.
The stakes are high for Southeast Asian nations caught in the crossfire of the Sino-U.S. tariff war, particularly given the regional ASEAN bloc’s huge two-way trade with both China and the United States.
ASEAN is China’s largest trading partner, with total trade value reaching $234 billion in the first quarter of 2025 and accounting for over 16% of China’s overall foreign trade, China’s customs agency said last week.
Trade between ASEAN and the U.S. totalled around $476.8 billion in 2024, according to U.S. figures, making Washington the regional bloc’s fourth-largest trading partner.
“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” Xi said in an article published in Vietnamese media, without mentioning the United States.

Title: ISRO’s SpaDeX mission completes second docking of satellites
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 05:00:43 +0000
Content: Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh announced on Monday that ISRO’s SpaDEX mission has successfully achieved its second satellite docking.
Sharing the news on social media platform X, the minister said, “Glad to inform that the second docking of satellites has been accomplished successfully.”
He also recalled the progress of the mission, stating, “As informed earlier, the PSLV-C60 / SpaDEX mission was successfully launched on December 30, 2024. The first docking was successfully completed on January 16, 2025, at 6:20 AM, and the satellites were undocked on March 13, 2025, at 9:20 AM.”
Dr. Singh further mentioned that more experiments are planned over the next two weeks.
The successful docking of the SpaDEX satellites in January made India the fourth country in the world to achieve satellite docking in space, joining the ranks of the US, Russia, and China.
The mission involved the docking of two small spacecraft — SDX01 (the Chaser) and SDX02 (the Target) — each weighing around 220 kg. These satellites were launched aboard the PSLV-C60 rocket from Sriharikota on December 30, 2024.
The docking technology, indigenously developed by ISRO, is known as the Bharatiya Docking System. It includes a docking mechanism, a suite of four rendezvous and docking sensors, power transfer capability, an inter-satellite communication link (ISL), and a unique autonomous docking strategy with built-in intelligence that allows each spacecraft to understand the state of the other.
According to ISRO, the SpaDEX mission is a major step toward building India’s capabilities in orbital docking — a crucial technology for future human spaceflight, satellite servicing missions, and establishing a space station.
This technology will also be essential for India’s upcoming missions, such as future lunar expeditions like Chandrayaan-4, and for conducting operations without relying on Earth-based navigation systems like GNSS.

Content: The domestic benchmark indices opened higher on Monday amid positive global cues, as buying was seen in the IT, PSU bank and financial services sectors in the early trade.
At around 9.29 am, Sensex was trading 396.06 points or 0.50 per cent up at 78,949.26 while the Nifty added 98.20 points or 0.41 per cent at 23,949.85.

According to market watchers, after the positive opening, Nifty is likely to find support at 23,700, followed by 22,600 and 22,500. On the upside, 24,000 may act as the immediate resistance, followed by 24,200 and 24,500.
“Bank Nifty charts indicate potential support at 54,000, followed by 53,700 and 53,500. If the index moves higher, resistance could emerge at 54,500, with subsequent levels at 54,700 and 55,000,” said Mandar Bhojane of Choice Broking.
Large private banks took the lead, surging to new all-time highs. Their quarterly results over the weekend aligned with market expectations and will continue to drive markets higher, said experts.
According to analysts, US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India comes with hopes that both countries can secure a quick deal and a reprieve from weightier levies while maintaining a 10 per cent baseline tariff.
As earnings season progresses, market participants will scrutinise corporate commentaries for insights into how businesses adapt to the new tariff regime and what they observe throughout their supply chains and customer bases, said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities.
Meanwhile, in the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank were the top gainers. Whereas, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Titan, Sun Pharma and UltraTech Cement were the top losers.

Title: PM Modi to Make Third Visit to Saudi Arabia, Building on Strategic Partnership
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:02:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on April 22-23, 2025, on a bilateral visit. This marks Modi’s third official trip to the Kingdom, following previous visits in 2016 and 2019.
 
The upcoming visit underscores Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance to India across multiple dimensions. The Kingdom remains crucial for India’s energy security and hosts one of the world’s largest Indian expatriate communities, estimated to be the second largest such community globally.
 
Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading voice in the Islamic world and its increasing role in regional developments further elevates the significance of this diplomatic engagement. The visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the already robust relationship between the two nations.
 
For India, Saudi Arabia remains a critical partner not only in crisis response but also in ensuring the safety of its diaspora and advancing broader regional stability. The ongoing high-level  engagement signals both countries’ commitment to further strengthening their multifaceted partnership, with the Sudan crisis serving as a recent example of effective cooperation in times of emergency. 
 
India’s “Operation Kaveri” successfully evacuated over 3,500 Indian nationals from Sudan with crucial logistical support from Saudi Arabia, which facilitated the safe transit of evacuees through Jeddah. Indian officials have acknowledged that this operation’s success heavily relied on the excellent cooperation provided by Saudi officials and government organizations.
 
This practical cooperation reflects the deepening ties between India and Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the Strategic Partnership Council in 2019. The relationship has expanded across multiple sectors including defense, trade, energy, technology, and culture, said Dr. Prince Mufti Ziaul Hasan, who is part of the Indian Diaspora in Jeddah and instrumental in Operation Kaveri.
 
Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming discussions are expected to focus on regional security, humanitarian coordination, and strategies for addressing ongoing crises such as Sudan. These talks will likely reaffirm the two nations’ shared interests and growing influence in West Asian affairs as they continue to develop their strategic partnership.

Title: Meditation and International Meditation Day: The Battle for Inner Stillness in a Distracted World
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:18:06 +0000
Content: In a world where artificial intelligence suggests what to think, algorithms dictate how to feel, and screens consume human attention, meditation emerges as an act of quiet defiance. No longer confined to monks in the Himalayas or sages on the banks of the Ganges, it has become an essential tool for modern existence.
Yet, as the world marks International Meditation Day, the essence of this ancient practice is at risk of being diluted. Meditation, once a path to deep self-awareness and spiritual liberation, is now increasingly repackaged as a quick-fix solution, offered through wellness apps, corporate stress-reduction programs, and productivity tools. While these adaptations bring meditation into mainstream consciousness, they often strip away its original depth, reducing it to yet another commodity in an era of relentless distractions.
International Meditation Day was not created as a symbolic initiative — it was born out of necessity. It has become a survival tool for the modern mind, a response to the growing crisis of mental fatigue, fractured societies, and the overstimulation of the digital age.
The day is marked by global gatherings, virtual sessions, and guided meditations that unite people across cultures. From mass meditation events in cities like New York, London, and Delhi to online mindfulness workshops hosted by global wellness communities, the day serves as a reminder of the collective power of stillness.
Organizations like the Art of Living and the Mindfulness Project host special programs, while schools and workplaces incorporate meditation sessions to highlight its benefits.
The question here is not whether meditation is relevant — but whether it can serve as a counterbalance to the unprecedented mental overload of contemporary life.
Even world leaders have begun to acknowledge meditation’s significance in tackling stress and improving focus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 address, highlighted the practice as a powerful antidote to anxiety, particularly for students grappling with academic pressure.
“Meditation and breath control are extremely effective in calming the mind. When you are stressed, focus on identifying different sounds around you — it will instantly ground you in the present,” he advised. He also emphasized the power of Pranayama, adding, “Breathing exercises generate energy and stabilize the body in seconds.”
Modi’s message underscores a broader truth — meditation is not just a wellness practice; it is a tool for clarity, resilience, and self-mastery in an era of cognitive overload.
For centuries, meditation was an intimate and introspective pursuit, requiring patience, discipline, and effort. Today, ironically, it has been rebranded into five-minute guided sessions on mobile apps, squeezed in between meetings and social media scrolling.
This shift is not accidental. It reflects a larger, ongoing battle for human attention.
In the last decade, digital technology has completely reshaped human behaviour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognized stress as the epidemic of the 21st century — a reflection of the relentless pressures of modern life. Unlike physical illnesses that can be diagnosed and treated through conventional medicine, stress operates as a silent disruptor, affecting mental health, cognitive function, and even physical well-being. Chronic stress has been linked to a host of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to weakened immune responses, making it a global health crisis that transcends geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.
The toll of this crisis is perhaps most evident in the alarming rise in suicide rates worldwide. Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, have emerged as leading causes of disability, pushing individuals to the brink of emotional collapse. The increasing social isolation caused by digital engagement, economic anxieties, and the competitive pressures of modern society have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and despair. Many countries are grappling with the repercussions of a mental health crisis that remains underfunded and often overlooked, despite its devastating impact on families and communities.
Workplace stress has also reached unprecedented levels, with a 2023 global survey revealing that over 80% of workers experience stress on a daily basis. The blurring of work-life boundaries, particularly with the rise of remote work and the always-on digital culture, has created an environment where employees struggle to disconnect. The pressure to meet deadlines, the fear of job instability, and the expectation of constant availability have all contributed to rising burnout rates. This relentless cycle not only affects individual well-being but also leads to declining productivity, increased absenteeism, and a workplace culture that prioritizes output over mental health.
At the heart of this crisis is the explosive rise in digital dependency. Studies indicate that the average person now checks their phone 150 times a day — an unconscious habit that has rewired human attention spans and diminished the ability to focus for extended periods. Screen time has tripled over the past decade, fundamentally altering sleep cycles, cognitive processing, and even interpersonal relationships. What is particularly concerning is that these effects are no longer limited to adults. Children as young as eight years old are exhibiting signs of digital addiction. Excessive exposure to screens, particularly social media and online gaming, has been linked to increased anxiety, attention disorders, and emotional dysregulation in younger generations.
Meditation is often spoken about in the context of individual well-being. But what about its power to heal societies?
India’s contribution to global spirituality is undeniable — from Vedic seers to Gautama Buddha, from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras to modern meditation masters. Yet, for decades, meditation was seen in the West as an exotic practice rather than a universal human tool.
That perception has changed dramatically. Much like the global acceptance of yoga, meditation has also transcended its origins. The success of International Yoga Day (June 21) paved the way for International Meditation Day, marking the shift from viewing meditation as an Eastern tradition to recognizing it as a universal human necessity.
The global recognition of meditation marks a shift from viewing it as an ancient Eastern practice to a universal necessity. But beyond acknowledgment, there lies the big question: can it actively counter the mental and emotional chaos of modern life? Every day, billions of people are caught in a maelstrom of distractions, their consciousness shaped by digital stimuli, economic anxieties, and ideological conflicts. The world’s largest tech companies have mastered the art of keeping users perpetually engaged, while meditation offers a way to step back, unplug, and regain control over one’s own mind.
Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly emphasized the transformative power of meditation for both personal and collective well-being. He urged, “I call upon everyone to make meditation a part of their daily lives and experience its transformative potential. Meditation is a powerful way to bring peace and harmony to one’s life, as well as to our society and planet.” His words resonate far beyond India.
Harvard research confirms as well that meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, counteracting the cognitive decline caused by excessive digital exposure.
Meditation is increasingly finding its place in diplomacy, governance, and international relations as leaders recognize the power of mindfulness in conflict resolution and decision-making. High-level figures, including UN officials and global policymakers, have begun incorporating meditation practices to enhance emotional intelligence, improve focus, and cultivate patience — qualities essential for diplomacy. Philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti once remarked, “The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.”
As the world grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, meditation is emerging not just as a personal wellness tool but as a silent force shaping diplomatic engagements, promoting mindfulness-based leadership, and even de-escalating conflicts through inner stillness.
Some of the greatest figures in history — Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Dalai Lama — all viewed inner peace as a prerequisite for societal harmony.
Today, modern meditation movements are using these same principles to mediate conflicts. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living Foundation, for example, has facilitated peace-building efforts in war zones such as Colombia and Iraq. His words reflect the power of meditation in fostering global healing. He says, “Meditation is the journey from sound to silence, from movement to stillness, from a limited identity to unlimited space.”
India can protect its spiritual landscapes from the relentless march of urbanization by implementing:


Meditation Conservation Zones: Establishing legally protected meditation zones, similar to wildlife sanctuaries, could safeguard sacred forests, riverbanks, and mountain retreats from unchecked commercial exploitation.


Eco-Spiritual Tourism: Encouraging responsible tourism models can generate revenue for conservation without disrupting the ecological balance of meditation retreats. Destinations like Rishikesh, Dharamsala, and the sacred groves of Kerala must be protected not just as tourist spots but as centres of spiritual heritage.


Local Guardianship: Empowering local communities to act as stewards of meditation sites ensures preservation efforts remain culturally sensitive and sustainable. Traditional caretakers, including monks and indigenous groups, have long protected these spaces. Formalizing their role can strengthen conservation efforts.


Sacred geography is not just about aesthetics — it is about energetic and spiritual preservation. The destruction of India’s meditation landscapes is not just an environmental loss; it is a loss of humanity’s connection to stillness itself.
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The world is one family — Ancient Indian philosophy never viewed meditation as an isolated practice. The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam suggests that when individuals meditate, they uplift the collective consciousness of society.
Meditation in Historical Leadership — Indian warriors and kings practiced meditation before battle, not to suppress fear, but to cultivate clarity. Emperor Ashoka’s transformation after the Kalinga war is a testament to the power of meditation in reshaping leadership and governance.
While meditation has been embraced by the corporate world, it must be more than just a tool for stress relief. Its true purpose extends into leadership, governance, and conflict resolution. It has become a new language of diplomacy — an integration where wisdom, patience, and emotional intelligence are needed most. It must be recognized as a global movement, one that calls for a deeper shift in human consciousness.
The roots of meditation have always been intertwined with nature, yet modern life has severed this connection. The philosophy of ancient Indian traditions — from the Pancha Mahabhutas (Five Great Elements) to Buddhist mindfulness — emphasizes that human well-being is inseparable from the well-being of the planet. International Meditation Day should serve as a reminder that stillness is not passive; it is a radical, transformative act that can shift the way individuals, leaders, and societies operate in an overstimulated world.
This International Meditation Day, let us meditate in silence, let us meditate with purpose. The future of our minds, our relationships, and our planet depends on our ability to reclaim stillness — and to truly live the reality of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Title: Kremlin says U.S. position ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gives satisfaction
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:07:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that the position of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gave Moscow satisfaction, but declined to comment on Trump’s hopes for deal this week.
U.S. envoy General Keith Kellogg said on Sunday that NATO membership was “off the table” for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said previous U.S. support for Ukraine’s bid to join NATO was a cause of the war.
“We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is excluded,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.” Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position.”
Peskov said that Ukrainian membership of the U.S.-led alliance would “pose a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And, in fact, this is one of the root causes of this conflict.”
Putin has repeatedly said that Russia would be willing to end the war if Ukraine officially dropped its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.
Media reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.
Trump said on Sunday he hopes Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about those remarks, Peskov said: “I don’t want to make any comments right now, especially about the time frame.”
“President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,” Peskov said.
He refused to comment directly on a Bloomberg report that the United States is prepared to recognise Russian control of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement.
“Work on finding a peaceful settlement cannot take place, and should not take place, in public,” Peskov said. “It should take place in an absolutely discrete mode.”

Title: Sensex surges 855 points; banks, IT lead market rally
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:03:54 +0000
Content: Extending its winning streak for the fifth consecutive session, the Indian stock market closed sharply higher on Monday, driven by strong gains in banking, IT, and auto stocks.
 
The Sensex jumped 855.30 points, or 1.09%, to settle at 79,408.50, while the Nifty surged 273.90 points, or 1.15%, to end at 24,125.55.
 
Among the 30 Sensex stocks, top gainers included Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, Bajaj Finserv, and Mahindra & Mahindra, with some rising as much as 4.91%.
 
Over the last five sessions, the Sensex has gained 5,562 points or 7.5%, while the Nifty has advanced by 1,726 points or 7.7%.
 
Broader markets outperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap100 rising 2.50% and the Nifty Smallcap100 gaining 2.21%.
 
Banking stocks were in strong demand as the Bank Nifty hit a new intraday high of 55,461.65 before closing at 55,304.50, up 1.87%. Key gainers included AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Federal Bank, which rose between 3.72% and 7.32%.
 
Both the Nifty Private Bank and PSU Bank indices ended with gains of over 2%.
 
Sectoral indices on the NSE also saw broad-based gains. Nifty IT, Auto, Realty, and Oil & Gas indices rose over 2% each, while Nifty FMCG was the only index to close slightly lower.
 
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee extended its uptrend for the fifth straight day, supported by a weakening US dollar, strong equity markets, steady foreign inflows, and falling crude oil prices.
 
“This positive trend was fuelled by a weakening US dollar against major global currencies. Furthermore, robust performance in domestic equity markets, consistent inflows from foreign investment, and a decline in crude oil prices provided additional tailwinds for the rupee’s appreciation,” said Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

Title: Delhi CM’s Heat Action Plan: 3,000 water ATMs, cooling shelters, ‘Aapda Mitras’
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:48:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday unveiled the Heat Action Plan 2025, activating the disaster management machinery and proposing 3,000 cold water ATMs as part of collective measures to offer relief from the sweltering heat.
In addition to deploying 1,800 National and Delhi Disaster Response volunteers — known as ‘Aapda Mitras’ — the plan includes the establishment of shaded cooling shelters and the installation of 3,000–4,000 large RO water units attached to the boundary walls of Delhi government schools and office buildings. These will dispense cold water round-the-clock, benefiting approximately five lakh citizens.
The plan also proposes installing 3,000 water ATMs on Public Works Department (PWD) roads — particularly near bus stops and traffic intersections — to provide easy public access to drinking water.
Gupta said that the national capital’s seasons are often linked to civic challenges — water shortages in summer, pollution in winter, and waterlogging during monsoon — but her government aims to ensure that citizens can enjoy every season without difficulty.
Reiterating her government’s commitment to heatwave relief, CM Gupta said that under the Heat Action Plan, 3,000 water coolers or ATMs would be installed — 1,000 on public roads, 1,000 in government buildings, and 1,000 in rural areas.
“We will also seek support from private entities through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives,” she added.
The Chief Minister said that the Delhi government will issue regular heat alerts via SMS and social media to help the public take timely precautions.
In addition to creating special heatwave wards in hospitals, Aapda Mitras will be deployed to carry out heat-relief activities in slum areas.
“Every life is precious — for both the city and the nation — and we are committed to protecting it,” she emphasized, also suggesting steps to help animals cope with the heat.
Earlier, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma said that the Delhi government is determined to prove its commitment to public welfare through action, not just announcements.
He noted that the government has already launched GPS-linked water tankers to address the summer water crisis and begun introducing heat-resistant, cool roofing for government buildings — a pilot initiative that will be expanded gradually.

Title: Google faces trial in US bid to end search monopoly
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:18:40 +0000
Content: Alphabet’s Google faces a historic trial on Monday as U.S. antitrust enforcers in Washington seek to force the tech giant to sell off its Chrome browser as part of a bid to restore competition to the market for online search engines.
The U.S. Department of Justice is heading into trial after two major legal victories against Google, having won a ruling in August that Google monopolized search.
The trial comes on the heels of a win in a Virginia court on Thursday where a judge ruled in a separate antitrust case that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology.
The outcome of the trial could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online.
Google plans to appeal the final ruling in the case.
“When it comes to antitrust remedies, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that ‘caution is key.’ DOJ’s proposal throws that caution to the wind,” Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post on Sunday.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is scheduled to oversee the three-week trial at the same courthouse where Meta Platforms is facing its own antitrust trial over the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general have proposed far-reaching measures designed to quickly open the search market and give new competitors a leg up.
Their proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make Google the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones.
Google would also have to license search results to competitors, among other requirements. And it would be made to sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition.
Prosecutors have said they expect testimony about how Google’s agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices have hampered distribution efforts by artificial intelligence companies. Witnesses from Perplexity AI and OpenAI are expected to take the stand.
Google sees the proposals as extreme, and said the court should stick to limiting the terms of its default agreements.
The $1.9 trillion tech company has been subsidizing browser makers such as Mozilla by paying to remain the default search engine. Cutting off that financial support could threaten their existence, Google says. And ending payments to device makers would raise the cost of smartphones, the company claims.
Google plans to call witnesses from Mozilla, Verizon and Apple, which launched a failed bid to intervene in the case.
Few potential buyers of Chrome have the same incentive as Google to maintain the free open-source code that underpins it, and which others including Microsoft use as a basis for their own browsers, the company says.

Title: India’s leather, footwear exports jump 25 pc to $5.7 billion in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:14:43 +0000
Content: India’s leather and non-leather footwear exports have seen a significant rise of nearly 25 per cent in the 2024-25 financial year (FY25), reaching $5.7 billion, a new report said on Monday.
The industry is expected to surpass the $6.5 billion mark in the current fiscal year (FY26), according to the Council for Leather Exports (CLE).
The CLE, which represents footwear exporters, mentioned that demand from both developed and developing countries remains strong, contributing to the impressive growth.
R Selvam, the Executive Director of CLE, shared that India exceeded its export target by $1 billion for 2024-25, a goal set by the Department of Commerce.
“In 2024-25, we have exceeded the exports target by $1 billion set up by the department of commerce and going by this trend, our exports will cross $6.5 billion dollar in 2025-26,” Selvam mentioned.
Rajendra Kumar Jalan, the Chairman of CLE, also highlighted that exports are performing well in key markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
Despite a 10 per cent tariff hike, exporters have been offering discounts to maintain their business relationships, and there have been no order cancellations.
Jalan also noted that the situation has returned to normal by mid-April, and suggested a ‘zero-for-zero’ duty proposal to the Indian government in the ongoing bilateral trade discussions with the US.
“From April 14-15, the situation is normal. We have suggested ‘zero-for-zero’ duty to the government in the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US,” he stated.
The footwear industry is labour-intensive, providing employment to approximately 42 lakh people. With an overall turnover of 19 billion dollar, the sector includes $5 billion in exports.
The industry is optimistic about its future and projects a total turnover of $39 billion by 2030, with $25 billion in domestic production and $13.7 billion in exports, the report said.
Additionally, there is growing interest from Chinese investors looking to collaborate with Indian footwear manufacturers to set up production units in India, further boosting the sector’s potential for growth, the report added.

Title: Gold hits record ₹96,805, may soon cross ₹1 lakh
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:03:51 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India hit a new all-time high of ₹96,805 per 10 grams on Monday on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), driven by global trade tensions and a weakening US dollar.
 
By 1:30 PM, the MCX Gold June 5 contract was trading 1.65% higher at ₹96,830 per 10 grams.
 
Spot prices also saw a sharp uptick. According to the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA), 24-carat gold (999 purity) was priced at ₹9,659 per gram, while 22-carat stood at ₹9,427. Rates for 20-carat and 18-carat gold were ₹8,596 and ₹7,824 per gram, respectively.
 
The domestic rally tracked global trends, where spot gold surged to a new record of $3,384 per ounce. A weakening US dollar—hitting a three-year low—has made gold more attractive to investors worldwide.
 
In the previous session, gold had dipped 0.44% to ₹95,239 due to profit booking. However, renewed concerns over a prolonged US-China trade war triggered fresh buying.
 
“Gold continues its upward momentum, briefly crossing $3,400 an ounce. Uncertainty around tariffs, a weaker dollar, and higher US bond yields are supporting prices,” said Pranav Mer of JM Financial Services. He also pointed to ETF buying and festive demand in India as key drivers.
 
Technically, gold now holds support at ₹95,550 and ₹94,200, with resistance seen at ₹97,580 and ₹98,200, Mer added.

Title: “Our march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated,” says Amit Shah after eight Naxals killed in Jharkhand
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:56:32 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday lauded security forces for neutralising eight Naxals in Jharkhand’s Bokaro district, saying that the march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated.
“Our march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated. Today, security forces achieved another significant success in the ongoing operation to uproot Naxalism. In an encounter at Lugu Hills in Bokaro, Jharkhand, 8 Maoists were neutralised, including a top-level Naxal leader, Vivek, who carried a reward of Rs 1 crore, and two other notorious Naxalites. The operation is ongoing. Applaud our security forces,” the Home Minister’s Office posted on X.
Jharkhand Director General of Police (DGP) Anurag Gupta said that eight Naxals were killed in a joint operation conducted by Jharkhand Jaguar, the state police, and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).
“Today, our security forces have neutralised eight Maoists. We have recovered arms, including four INSAS rifles and one SLR. Three top Naxalites — Vivek alias Prayag Majhi, Arvind Yadav, and Sahebram Majhi — have been killed. The operation was carried out by Jharkhand Jaguar, the police, and the CRPF. The first exchange of fire took place at 5:30 am and continued for about 1.5 to 2 hours,” the DGP said.
He further warned active Naxalites to surrender and return to the mainstream as soon as possible.
“Today, we have every detail and location of every Naxalite in our state. This is a warning to those still roaming around with weapons. They must surrender because we are aware of their whereabouts and every detail about them. They should surrender if they want peace and to benefit from Jharkhand’s surrender policy,” he added.
Earlier in the day, security forces neutralised eight Naxals in a joint operation conducted in the early morning hours in Jharkhand’s Bokaro district.
The bodies of the Naxals were recovered following an exchange of fire between the rebels and personnel from the 209 Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) unit of the CRPF and the state police.
The encounter began around 5:30 am in the Lugu Hills under the Lalpania area of Bokaro.
“Among the eight Naxals neutralised in the operation were three high-profile individuals with bounties of Rs 1 crore, Rs 25 lakh, and Rs 10 lakh, respectively. Prayag Majhi had a bounty of Rs 1 crore, Arvind Yadav carried a reward of Rs 25 lakh, and Sahebram Majhi, also known as Rahul Majhi, had a bounty of Rs 10 lakh. The remaining Naxals have been identified as Mahesh Majhi alias Mota, Talu, Raju Majhi, Gangaram, and Mahesh,” the CRPF stated.
According to the CRPF, a cache of arms was recovered from the site, including one AK-series rifle, one Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), three INSAS rifles, one pistol, and eight country-made Bharmar rifles.
Officials said the operation is part of an intensified campaign by security forces to dismantle Naxal activities in the region.

Title: Pope Francis will always be remembered as beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:24:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that he was deeply pained by the passing of Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday at the age of 88 at his residence in the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta.
Fondly recalling his meetings with the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, PM Modi said that Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.
“Deeply pained by the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis. In this hour of grief and remembrance, my heartfelt condolences to the global Catholic community. Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world,” PM Modi said in his condolence message.
“From a young age, he devoted himself towards realising the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope. I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,” he added.
Pope Francis, who had been suffering from respiratory ailments and pneumonia for a long time, passed away at 7:35 am on Monday, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced Monday afternoon, India time.
During his meetings with the late Pope, PM Modi had always admired his commitment to serve people and had also extended an invitation to him to visit India at an early date.
“Met Pope Francis on the sidelines of the G7 Summit. I admire his commitment to serve people and make our planet better. Also invited him to visit India,” the Prime Minister posted on X after meeting the Pope at the G7 Summit’s Outreach Session in Borgo Egnazia, last year.
In October 2021, the Pope received PM Modi during a private audience at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which was also the first meeting between an Indian Prime Minister and the Pope in more than two decades.
It was in June 2000 that late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had last visited the Vatican and met the then Pope, John Paul II.
India and The Holy See have friendly relations dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1948. India is also home to the second-largest Catholic population in Asia.

Title: PM Modi set to visit Jeddah, bolster India-Saudi Arabia ties
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:49:10 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Jeddah this Tuesday, marking the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Saudi Arabia’s commercial hub in over four decades. The landmark visit is expected to further enhance the growing strategic partnership between the two nations.
During his visit, Prime Minister Modi will tour a local factory and interact with Indian workers based in Saudi Arabia, underlining the deep people-to-people ties that complement the robust economic relationship between the two countries.
India’s investment footprint in Saudi Arabia has expanded significantly in recent years, with total investments reaching approximately USD 3 billion as of August 2023. These investments span across multiple sectors including management and consultancy services, construction, telecommunications, IT, financial services, software development, and pharmaceuticals.
Several major Indian companies have established a strong presence in Saudi Arabia. These include Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Tata Group, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Air India, Go Air, IndiGo, and SpiceJet, among others.
Speaking on the growing India-Saudi partnership, Ali Mohammed Ali, Member of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Executive Director of Jeddah National Hospital and Ryan International Clinics, said, “The presence of Indian companies in Saudi Arabia is a reflection of the mutual trust and shared vision between the two countries. The Indian workforce has played a significant role in various development sectors here, contributing meaningfully to Saudi Arabia’s progress.”
Beyond economic cooperation, the relationship has also deepened on the cultural front. In line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, bilateral cultural exchanges have gained momentum. A notable milestone in this regard was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Yoga Cooperation in 2021 between the Saudi Ministry of Sports and India’s Ministry of AYUSH.
Yoga has steadily grown in popularity in Saudi Arabia and is now officially recognized as a sporting activity. The Indian Embassy continues to organize yoga-related events, including annual celebrations of the International Day of Yoga.
Nouf Marwaai, a Saudi yoga expert who has been instrumental in promoting yoga in the region, said, “Yoga has not only grown in popularity here but has become a bridge between our cultures. The Indian Embassy’s consistent support and the community’s enthusiastic participation have played a big role in this journey.”

Title: PM Modi to Make Third Visit to Saudi Arabia, Building on Strategic Partnership
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:02:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on April 22-23, 2025, on a bilateral visit. This marks Modi’s third official trip to the Kingdom, following previous visits in 2016 and 2019.
 
The upcoming visit underscores Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance to India across multiple dimensions. The Kingdom remains crucial for India’s energy security and hosts one of the world’s largest Indian expatriate communities, estimated to be the second largest such community globally.
 
Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading voice in the Islamic world and its increasing role in regional developments further elevates the significance of this diplomatic engagement. The visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the already robust relationship between the two nations.
 
For India, Saudi Arabia remains a critical partner not only in crisis response but also in ensuring the safety of its diaspora and advancing broader regional stability. The ongoing high-level  engagement signals both countries’ commitment to further strengthening their multifaceted partnership, with the Sudan crisis serving as a recent example of effective cooperation in times of emergency. 
 
India’s “Operation Kaveri” successfully evacuated over 3,500 Indian nationals from Sudan with crucial logistical support from Saudi Arabia, which facilitated the safe transit of evacuees through Jeddah. Indian officials have acknowledged that this operation’s success heavily relied on the excellent cooperation provided by Saudi officials and government organizations.
 
This practical cooperation reflects the deepening ties between India and Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the Strategic Partnership Council in 2019. The relationship has expanded across multiple sectors including defense, trade, energy, technology, and culture, said Dr. Prince Mufti Ziaul Hasan, who is part of the Indian Diaspora in Jeddah and instrumental in Operation Kaveri.
 
Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming discussions are expected to focus on regional security, humanitarian coordination, and strategies for addressing ongoing crises such as Sudan. These talks will likely reaffirm the two nations’ shared interests and growing influence in West Asian affairs as they continue to develop their strategic partnership.

Title: Meditation and International Meditation Day: The Battle for Inner Stillness in a Distracted World
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:18:06 +0000
Content: In a world where artificial intelligence suggests what to think, algorithms dictate how to feel, and screens consume human attention, meditation emerges as an act of quiet defiance. No longer confined to monks in the Himalayas or sages on the banks of the Ganges, it has become an essential tool for modern existence.
Yet, as the world marks International Meditation Day, the essence of this ancient practice is at risk of being diluted. Meditation, once a path to deep self-awareness and spiritual liberation, is now increasingly repackaged as a quick-fix solution, offered through wellness apps, corporate stress-reduction programs, and productivity tools. While these adaptations bring meditation into mainstream consciousness, they often strip away its original depth, reducing it to yet another commodity in an era of relentless distractions.
International Meditation Day was not created as a symbolic initiative — it was born out of necessity. It has become a survival tool for the modern mind, a response to the growing crisis of mental fatigue, fractured societies, and the overstimulation of the digital age.
The day is marked by global gatherings, virtual sessions, and guided meditations that unite people across cultures. From mass meditation events in cities like New York, London, and Delhi to online mindfulness workshops hosted by global wellness communities, the day serves as a reminder of the collective power of stillness.
Organizations like the Art of Living and the Mindfulness Project host special programs, while schools and workplaces incorporate meditation sessions to highlight its benefits.
The question here is not whether meditation is relevant — but whether it can serve as a counterbalance to the unprecedented mental overload of contemporary life.
Even world leaders have begun to acknowledge meditation’s significance in tackling stress and improving focus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 address, highlighted the practice as a powerful antidote to anxiety, particularly for students grappling with academic pressure.
“Meditation and breath control are extremely effective in calming the mind. When you are stressed, focus on identifying different sounds around you — it will instantly ground you in the present,” he advised. He also emphasized the power of Pranayama, adding, “Breathing exercises generate energy and stabilize the body in seconds.”
Modi’s message underscores a broader truth — meditation is not just a wellness practice; it is a tool for clarity, resilience, and self-mastery in an era of cognitive overload.
For centuries, meditation was an intimate and introspective pursuit, requiring patience, discipline, and effort. Today, ironically, it has been rebranded into five-minute guided sessions on mobile apps, squeezed in between meetings and social media scrolling.
This shift is not accidental. It reflects a larger, ongoing battle for human attention.
In the last decade, digital technology has completely reshaped human behaviour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognized stress as the epidemic of the 21st century — a reflection of the relentless pressures of modern life. Unlike physical illnesses that can be diagnosed and treated through conventional medicine, stress operates as a silent disruptor, affecting mental health, cognitive function, and even physical well-being. Chronic stress has been linked to a host of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to weakened immune responses, making it a global health crisis that transcends geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.
The toll of this crisis is perhaps most evident in the alarming rise in suicide rates worldwide. Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, have emerged as leading causes of disability, pushing individuals to the brink of emotional collapse. The increasing social isolation caused by digital engagement, economic anxieties, and the competitive pressures of modern society have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and despair. Many countries are grappling with the repercussions of a mental health crisis that remains underfunded and often overlooked, despite its devastating impact on families and communities.
Workplace stress has also reached unprecedented levels, with a 2023 global survey revealing that over 80% of workers experience stress on a daily basis. The blurring of work-life boundaries, particularly with the rise of remote work and the always-on digital culture, has created an environment where employees struggle to disconnect. The pressure to meet deadlines, the fear of job instability, and the expectation of constant availability have all contributed to rising burnout rates. This relentless cycle not only affects individual well-being but also leads to declining productivity, increased absenteeism, and a workplace culture that prioritizes output over mental health.
At the heart of this crisis is the explosive rise in digital dependency. Studies indicate that the average person now checks their phone 150 times a day — an unconscious habit that has rewired human attention spans and diminished the ability to focus for extended periods. Screen time has tripled over the past decade, fundamentally altering sleep cycles, cognitive processing, and even interpersonal relationships. What is particularly concerning is that these effects are no longer limited to adults. Children as young as eight years old are exhibiting signs of digital addiction. Excessive exposure to screens, particularly social media and online gaming, has been linked to increased anxiety, attention disorders, and emotional dysregulation in younger generations.
Meditation is often spoken about in the context of individual well-being. But what about its power to heal societies?
India’s contribution to global spirituality is undeniable — from Vedic seers to Gautama Buddha, from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras to modern meditation masters. Yet, for decades, meditation was seen in the West as an exotic practice rather than a universal human tool.
That perception has changed dramatically. Much like the global acceptance of yoga, meditation has also transcended its origins. The success of International Yoga Day (June 21) paved the way for International Meditation Day, marking the shift from viewing meditation as an Eastern tradition to recognizing it as a universal human necessity.
The global recognition of meditation marks a shift from viewing it as an ancient Eastern practice to a universal necessity. But beyond acknowledgment, there lies the big question: can it actively counter the mental and emotional chaos of modern life? Every day, billions of people are caught in a maelstrom of distractions, their consciousness shaped by digital stimuli, economic anxieties, and ideological conflicts. The world’s largest tech companies have mastered the art of keeping users perpetually engaged, while meditation offers a way to step back, unplug, and regain control over one’s own mind.
Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly emphasized the transformative power of meditation for both personal and collective well-being. He urged, “I call upon everyone to make meditation a part of their daily lives and experience its transformative potential. Meditation is a powerful way to bring peace and harmony to one’s life, as well as to our society and planet.” His words resonate far beyond India.
Harvard research confirms as well that meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, counteracting the cognitive decline caused by excessive digital exposure.
Meditation is increasingly finding its place in diplomacy, governance, and international relations as leaders recognize the power of mindfulness in conflict resolution and decision-making. High-level figures, including UN officials and global policymakers, have begun incorporating meditation practices to enhance emotional intelligence, improve focus, and cultivate patience — qualities essential for diplomacy. Philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti once remarked, “The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.”
As the world grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, meditation is emerging not just as a personal wellness tool but as a silent force shaping diplomatic engagements, promoting mindfulness-based leadership, and even de-escalating conflicts through inner stillness.
Some of the greatest figures in history — Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Dalai Lama — all viewed inner peace as a prerequisite for societal harmony.
Today, modern meditation movements are using these same principles to mediate conflicts. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living Foundation, for example, has facilitated peace-building efforts in war zones such as Colombia and Iraq. His words reflect the power of meditation in fostering global healing. He says, “Meditation is the journey from sound to silence, from movement to stillness, from a limited identity to unlimited space.”
India can protect its spiritual landscapes from the relentless march of urbanization by implementing:


Meditation Conservation Zones: Establishing legally protected meditation zones, similar to wildlife sanctuaries, could safeguard sacred forests, riverbanks, and mountain retreats from unchecked commercial exploitation.


Eco-Spiritual Tourism: Encouraging responsible tourism models can generate revenue for conservation without disrupting the ecological balance of meditation retreats. Destinations like Rishikesh, Dharamsala, and the sacred groves of Kerala must be protected not just as tourist spots but as centres of spiritual heritage.


Local Guardianship: Empowering local communities to act as stewards of meditation sites ensures preservation efforts remain culturally sensitive and sustainable. Traditional caretakers, including monks and indigenous groups, have long protected these spaces. Formalizing their role can strengthen conservation efforts.


Sacred geography is not just about aesthetics — it is about energetic and spiritual preservation. The destruction of India’s meditation landscapes is not just an environmental loss; it is a loss of humanity’s connection to stillness itself.
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The world is one family — Ancient Indian philosophy never viewed meditation as an isolated practice. The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam suggests that when individuals meditate, they uplift the collective consciousness of society.
Meditation in Historical Leadership — Indian warriors and kings practiced meditation before battle, not to suppress fear, but to cultivate clarity. Emperor Ashoka’s transformation after the Kalinga war is a testament to the power of meditation in reshaping leadership and governance.
While meditation has been embraced by the corporate world, it must be more than just a tool for stress relief. Its true purpose extends into leadership, governance, and conflict resolution. It has become a new language of diplomacy — an integration where wisdom, patience, and emotional intelligence are needed most. It must be recognized as a global movement, one that calls for a deeper shift in human consciousness.
The roots of meditation have always been intertwined with nature, yet modern life has severed this connection. The philosophy of ancient Indian traditions — from the Pancha Mahabhutas (Five Great Elements) to Buddhist mindfulness — emphasizes that human well-being is inseparable from the well-being of the planet. International Meditation Day should serve as a reminder that stillness is not passive; it is a radical, transformative act that can shift the way individuals, leaders, and societies operate in an overstimulated world.
This International Meditation Day, let us meditate in silence, let us meditate with purpose. The future of our minds, our relationships, and our planet depends on our ability to reclaim stillness — and to truly live the reality of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Title: Kremlin says U.S. position ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gives satisfaction
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:07:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that the position of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gave Moscow satisfaction, but declined to comment on Trump’s hopes for deal this week.
U.S. envoy General Keith Kellogg said on Sunday that NATO membership was “off the table” for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said previous U.S. support for Ukraine’s bid to join NATO was a cause of the war.
“We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is excluded,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.” Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position.”
Peskov said that Ukrainian membership of the U.S.-led alliance would “pose a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And, in fact, this is one of the root causes of this conflict.”
Putin has repeatedly said that Russia would be willing to end the war if Ukraine officially dropped its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.
Media reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.
Trump said on Sunday he hopes Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about those remarks, Peskov said: “I don’t want to make any comments right now, especially about the time frame.”
“President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,” Peskov said.
He refused to comment directly on a Bloomberg report that the United States is prepared to recognise Russian control of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement.
“Work on finding a peaceful settlement cannot take place, and should not take place, in public,” Peskov said. “It should take place in an absolutely discrete mode.”

Title: Sensex surges 855 points; banks, IT lead market rally
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:03:54 +0000
Content: Extending its winning streak for the fifth consecutive session, the Indian stock market closed sharply higher on Monday, driven by strong gains in banking, IT, and auto stocks.
 
The Sensex jumped 855.30 points, or 1.09%, to settle at 79,408.50, while the Nifty surged 273.90 points, or 1.15%, to end at 24,125.55.
 
Among the 30 Sensex stocks, top gainers included Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, Bajaj Finserv, and Mahindra & Mahindra, with some rising as much as 4.91%.
 
Over the last five sessions, the Sensex has gained 5,562 points or 7.5%, while the Nifty has advanced by 1,726 points or 7.7%.
 
Broader markets outperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap100 rising 2.50% and the Nifty Smallcap100 gaining 2.21%.
 
Banking stocks were in strong demand as the Bank Nifty hit a new intraday high of 55,461.65 before closing at 55,304.50, up 1.87%. Key gainers included AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Federal Bank, which rose between 3.72% and 7.32%.
 
Both the Nifty Private Bank and PSU Bank indices ended with gains of over 2%.
 
Sectoral indices on the NSE also saw broad-based gains. Nifty IT, Auto, Realty, and Oil & Gas indices rose over 2% each, while Nifty FMCG was the only index to close slightly lower.
 
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee extended its uptrend for the fifth straight day, supported by a weakening US dollar, strong equity markets, steady foreign inflows, and falling crude oil prices.
 
“This positive trend was fuelled by a weakening US dollar against major global currencies. Furthermore, robust performance in domestic equity markets, consistent inflows from foreign investment, and a decline in crude oil prices provided additional tailwinds for the rupee’s appreciation,” said Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

Title: Delhi CM’s Heat Action Plan: 3,000 water ATMs, cooling shelters, ‘Aapda Mitras’
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:48:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday unveiled the Heat Action Plan 2025, activating the disaster management machinery and proposing 3,000 cold water ATMs as part of collective measures to offer relief from the sweltering heat.
In addition to deploying 1,800 National and Delhi Disaster Response volunteers — known as ‘Aapda Mitras’ — the plan includes the establishment of shaded cooling shelters and the installation of 3,000–4,000 large RO water units attached to the boundary walls of Delhi government schools and office buildings. These will dispense cold water round-the-clock, benefiting approximately five lakh citizens.
The plan also proposes installing 3,000 water ATMs on Public Works Department (PWD) roads — particularly near bus stops and traffic intersections — to provide easy public access to drinking water.
Gupta said that the national capital’s seasons are often linked to civic challenges — water shortages in summer, pollution in winter, and waterlogging during monsoon — but her government aims to ensure that citizens can enjoy every season without difficulty.
Reiterating her government’s commitment to heatwave relief, CM Gupta said that under the Heat Action Plan, 3,000 water coolers or ATMs would be installed — 1,000 on public roads, 1,000 in government buildings, and 1,000 in rural areas.
“We will also seek support from private entities through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives,” she added.
The Chief Minister said that the Delhi government will issue regular heat alerts via SMS and social media to help the public take timely precautions.
In addition to creating special heatwave wards in hospitals, Aapda Mitras will be deployed to carry out heat-relief activities in slum areas.
“Every life is precious — for both the city and the nation — and we are committed to protecting it,” she emphasized, also suggesting steps to help animals cope with the heat.
Earlier, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma said that the Delhi government is determined to prove its commitment to public welfare through action, not just announcements.
He noted that the government has already launched GPS-linked water tankers to address the summer water crisis and begun introducing heat-resistant, cool roofing for government buildings — a pilot initiative that will be expanded gradually.

Title: Google faces trial in US bid to end search monopoly
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:18:40 +0000
Content: Alphabet’s Google faces a historic trial on Monday as U.S. antitrust enforcers in Washington seek to force the tech giant to sell off its Chrome browser as part of a bid to restore competition to the market for online search engines.
The U.S. Department of Justice is heading into trial after two major legal victories against Google, having won a ruling in August that Google monopolized search.
The trial comes on the heels of a win in a Virginia court on Thursday where a judge ruled in a separate antitrust case that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology.
The outcome of the trial could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online.
Google plans to appeal the final ruling in the case.
“When it comes to antitrust remedies, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that ‘caution is key.’ DOJ’s proposal throws that caution to the wind,” Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post on Sunday.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is scheduled to oversee the three-week trial at the same courthouse where Meta Platforms is facing its own antitrust trial over the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general have proposed far-reaching measures designed to quickly open the search market and give new competitors a leg up.
Their proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make Google the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones.
Google would also have to license search results to competitors, among other requirements. And it would be made to sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition.
Prosecutors have said they expect testimony about how Google’s agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices have hampered distribution efforts by artificial intelligence companies. Witnesses from Perplexity AI and OpenAI are expected to take the stand.
Google sees the proposals as extreme, and said the court should stick to limiting the terms of its default agreements.
The $1.9 trillion tech company has been subsidizing browser makers such as Mozilla by paying to remain the default search engine. Cutting off that financial support could threaten their existence, Google says. And ending payments to device makers would raise the cost of smartphones, the company claims.
Google plans to call witnesses from Mozilla, Verizon and Apple, which launched a failed bid to intervene in the case.
Few potential buyers of Chrome have the same incentive as Google to maintain the free open-source code that underpins it, and which others including Microsoft use as a basis for their own browsers, the company says.

Title: HD Kumaraswamy welcomes 12% safeguard duty on imported steel flat products
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:18:17 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel, H. D. Kumaraswamy, has welcomed the Finance Ministry’s decision to impose a 12% safeguard duty on imported non-alloy and alloy steel flat products, calling it a move that will bolster the domestic industry and ensure fair competition.
Taking to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Minister stated, “I welcome the 12% safeguard duty on imported steel flat products. This will protect Indian manufacturers, ensure fair competition, and boost domestic industry.”
The government announced the temporary tariff late Monday, aimed at countering a sudden surge in imports that could potentially harm local steel producers. The duty is effective immediately and will remain in place for 200 days, unless revoked or amended earlier.
According to the notification issued by the Finance Ministry, the safeguard duty applies specifically to shipments priced below the set import thresholds, ranging between USD 675 and USD 964 per tonne—across five categories of steel flat products. These include Hot Rolled Coils, Sheets and Plates; Hot Rolled Plate Mill Plates; Cold Rolled Coils and Sheets; Metallic Coated Steel Coils and Sheets; and Colour Coated Coils and Sheets, whether or not profiled.
Shipments imported at or above these specified CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) prices will be exempt from the additional duty.
The measure follows a similar move by the United States, which recently imposed a flat 25 per cent duty on steel imports from all countries. The Indian safeguard duty primarily targets dumping practices, especially from countries like China, which ranks as the second-largest exporter of steel to India, after South Korea.
In December 2024, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) launched an investigation into the sharp rise in imports of steel flat products, used extensively across the automotive, construction, and manufacturing sectors.
While large domestic steelmakers had lobbied for protectionist measures, citing threats to their market share, steel-consuming industries, especially MSME exporters in the engineering sector, raised concerns that the added duty would inflate raw material costs and impact competitiveness in global markets.
Safeguard duties are intended as temporary trade remedies, designed to shield domestic industries from sudden import surges that could threaten their viability.

Title: PM Modi’s Saudi trip aims to bolster bilateral ties and champion women’s empowerment
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:17:12 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to embark on his third official visit to Saudi Arabia from April 22 to 23, at the invitation of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. This visit highlights the growing strategic partnership between India and Saudi Arabia, marked by robust cooperation in sectors such as trade, energy, defense, and people-to-people ties.
The visit comes at a critical juncture, as Saudi Arabia intensifies its ambitious Vision 2030 agenda, a comprehensive national strategy launched in 2016. This agenda aims to diversify the Kingdom’s economy, empower its citizens, and position Saudi Arabia as a global leader in innovation, sustainability, and inclusive growth. The Prime Minister’s trip is expected to further strengthen bilateral relations and create new avenues for collaboration, particularly in areas aligned with the transformative goals of Vision 2030, including gender equality—a global advocacy championed by India.
Transformative Changes for Women in Saudi Arabia
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has implemented transformative reforms that have dismantled long-standing barriers for women, empowering them with greater personal autonomy and legal protections. Legal reforms have lifted the long-standing driving ban, reduced male guardianship requirements, and introduced anti-harassment legislation. These changes have significantly enhanced the rights and freedoms of Saudi women.
Highlighting these changes, Dr. Kavitha, an assistant professor and member of the Indian diaspora in Jeddah, said:“As an expatriate living in Saudi Arabia, I have witnessed first-hand the remarkable progress in women’s empowerment over the past few years. One of the most significant milestones was when women gained the right to drive. This single change had a profound impact—granting women freedom of movement, access to employment, and the ability to support their families more independently.”
“Saudi women have become more self-sustained and actively involved in various sectors of the economy. This progress has been strongly backed by government support, which has introduced progressive reforms and favorable policies to promote gender equality. With a growing demand for skilled professionals, Saudi Arabia today presents a wealth of opportunities for Indian women to thrive, contribute, and lead in the changing Middle East”, she added.
The economic impact of these reforms is already visible. Female workforce participation in Saudi Arabia has increased dramatically, rising from 23.2% in 2016 to over 36.2% by 2025, surpassing the government’s original Vision 2030 targets. Women now own nearly 45% of small and medium enterprises in the Kingdom, signaling a substantial shift in the business landscape and providing new opportunities for economic empowerment.
Ms. Lamha Hamsa, a marketing manager at a dates factory in Jeddah, noted: “Working as a female gives you more points, and the government itself and all the companies are now directing towards having more females”.
Women in Leadership and Previously Male-Dominated Sectors
Saudi women are also making their presence felt in sectors that were traditionally male-dominated. Over 3,500 women are now employed in the justice system as lawyers and legal representatives, marking a significant achievement for women in the legal profession. In addition, there is growing female representation in leadership positions across industries such as healthcare, hospitality, and business.
These gains are supported by a variety of government initiatives aimed at eliminating employment barriers and fostering entrepreneurship opportunities for women. The Kingdom’s efforts are designed to not only create equal opportunities in the workforce but also promote women’s leadership in traditionally male-dominated fields.
India’s Role in Advancing Gender Equality
India has played a vital role in advancing gender equality globally, and its contributions to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 are notable. During its G20 presidency, India successfully rallied member countries, including Saudi Arabia, to commit to reducing the gender gap in labor force participation by 25% by 2025. This commitment focuses on financial inclusion, education, healthcare access, and leadership development for women.
The partnership between India and Saudi Arabia is also strengthened through valuable knowledge sharing. India’s experiences in promoting women’s entrepreneurship and digital inclusion have been instrumental in supporting Saudi Arabia’s ongoing reforms in sectors like healthcare and education. This collaboration positions both nations as regional leaders in advancing gender equality, with the potential for ripple effects across South Asia and the Gulf region.

Title: CCI approves Google’s ₹20.24 crore settlement in Android TV antitrust case
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:15:40 +0000
Content: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday through a majority order, has approved a settlement proposal submitted by Google in connection with the Android TV case, marking a key resolution under the newly notified Competition Commission of India (Settlement) Regulations, 2024. The settlement amount has been finalized at ₹20.24 crore after applying a 15% discount as per regulatory provisions.
The case was initiated based on information filed under Section 19(1)(a) of the Competition Act, 2002, by two individuals, Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand. The complaint alleged that Google LLC, along with Google India Private Limited, Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited, and TCL India Holding Private Limited, had contravened several provisions of the Competition Act by abusing its dominant position in the Android TV ecosystem.
According to the allegations, Google enforced restrictive agreements on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) through the compulsory bundling of the Play Store with its Android TV operating system. Further, it allegedly restricted OEMs from using or developing rival Android versions via Anti-Fragmentation Agreements. These practices, the complainants argued, hindered market access, suppressed competition, and stifled innovation—thus violating Section 4 of the Act.
Following a preliminary assessment, the Commission formed a prima facie opinion that Google had indeed breached provisions under Sections 3(4) and 4 of the Act and subsequently directed the Director General to conduct a full investigation.
The investigation found that Google holds a dominant position in the relevant markets—namely, the “licensable Smart TV device operating system in India” and the “App Store for Android Smart TV OS in India.” It also revealed that Google’s agreements, including the Television App Distribution Agreement (TADA) and Android Compatibility Commitments (ACC), imposed unfair conditions. These included mandatory pre-installation of Google’s suite of apps and restrictions on OEMs that effectively discouraged the development of alternative Android forks, thereby reinforcing Google’s market dominance. However, the allegation of exclusive supply and refusal to deal under Section 3(4) could not be substantiated.
In response, Google filed a settlement application under Section 48A of the Act, following the 2024 Settlement Regulations. The Commission subsequently invited objections and suggestions from 45 stakeholders before evaluating the final settlement terms.
As part of its “New India Agreement,” Google committed to offering a standalone license for the Play Store and Play Services for Android Smart TVs in India. This removes previous conditions that required bundling services or default placements. Further, the waiver of the requirement for a valid ACC for devices shipped into India without Google apps now allows OEMs to develop and market incompatible Android devices without violating Google’s agreements.
After evaluating the gravity, impact, and nature of the contraventions and considering stakeholder feedback, the Commission accepted Google’s proposal under Section 48A(3) of the Act. The final penalty, settled at ₹20.24 crore, incorporates a 15% discount under the Settlement Regulations.
This decision marks a significant development in India’s digital competition landscape and underlines the increasing relevance of settlement mechanisms in resolving complex antitrust issues.

Title: Jammu-Srinagar national highway remains shut for third day; restoration to take five more days
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 06:49:36 +0000
Content: The strategic Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, a crucial lifeline connecting the Kashmir Valley to the rest of the country, remained closed for the third consecutive day on Tuesday following massive damage caused by flash floods and landslides in Ramban district.
Officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) confirmed that the highway has been damaged at 22 locations, with nearly 4 to 5 kilometers of the road completely washed away. Restoration work is underway at full pace, but authorities estimate it will take at least five more days to fully restore connectivity.
The disaster, triggered by torrential rains on Sunday, led to multiple landslides and flash floods, claiming the lives of three people and leaving over 100 stranded in the Ramban district. Rescue teams managed to evacuate the trapped individuals, while many vehicles remain buried under debris.
Hundreds of passengers are currently stranded along the highway. Relief operations are ongoing, with local authorities setting up shelters and providing food and assistance to those affected.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the worst-hit area of Kali Morh on Monday, despite challenging weather conditions, to personally supervise relief efforts and assess the extent of damage. Speaking to reporters, the Chief Minister described the damage as “huge” but stated that the event qualifies as a localized disaster and therefore does not meet the criteria to be declared a ‘national disaster’. Nevertheless, he assured full support and relief to the affected families.
Former Chief Minister Dr Farooq Abdullah has urged the central government to step in with aid and support for those impacted by the disaster.
Meanwhile, Divisional Commissioner of Kashmir, V.K. Bidhuri, has appealed to the public to avoid panic buying of essentials. He emphasized that the region has adequate supplies of foodgrains and petroleum products to last for at least two weeks.
Despite the assurances, panic buying has been reported across the Valley, particularly at petrol pumps, where long queues of motorists have been observed. “This panic buying can result in depleting the stocks as we are noticing three times more rush of motorists than usual each day,” said an attendant at a fuel station in Ganderbal district.
In a slight relief for commuters, the Mughal Road, which connects Shopian district in south Kashmir to Rajouri district in Jammu, remains open for one-way traffic for light motor vehicles (LMVs). However, due to the continuing closure of the main highway, there has been a significant spike in demand for air travel, with tourists and locals scrambling for air tickets to travel out of the Valley.
Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely as restoration and relief operations progress.

Title: FHRAI unveils plans for Harit Yoga events ahead of International Day of Yoga 2025
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:50:17 +0000
Content: In response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of spreading the benefits of yoga across the nation, the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) has announced a series of events under the theme of Harit Yoga as part of the lead-up to the International Day of Yoga (IDY) 2025.
Taking an active role in this year’s celebrations, FHRAI’s participation reflects a growing trend of private sector engagement in public wellness initiatives. According to the Ministry of AYUSH, FHRAI’s calendar of activities includes a wellness retreat, campus outreach, and an urban flagship event—all aimed at blending traditional yoga practices with sustainable living.
The celebrations will begin with a Yoga Retreat on April 22 at the Atmantan Wellness Centre in Mulshi, Maharashtra. Nestled in the Sahyadri hills, the retreat promises a deep immersion into nature and self-awareness, offering participants a tranquil environment to reconnect with their well-being.
This will be followed by a campus event on April 29 at the FHRAI Institute of Hospitality Management (FHRAI-IHM) in Greater Noida. The event is designed to inspire future hospitality professionals by integrating yoga with themes of environmental responsibility and wellness culture.
The series will culminate in a high-profile gathering on May 17 at JW Marriott, Bangalore. This flagship event in the heart of the city will celebrate urban wellness through a dynamic mix of yoga practice, interactive dialogue, and community engagement.
In their announcement, FHRAI emphasized that these events go beyond ceremonial participation. “These initiatives are a reflection of our unwavering commitment to supporting the Government of India’s vision for a greener, healthier, and more mindful nation,” the Federation stated. “We seek to elevate yoga from a daily practice to a way of life that promotes environmental consciousness and sustainable development.”
Harit Yoga is one of ten Signature Activities being spearheaded by the Ministry of AYUSH as part of the 10th anniversary of the International Day of Yoga. The program aims to combine the physical and spiritual benefits of yoga with environmental advocacy. As part of Harit Yoga, participants engage in activities such as tree planting, beach clean-ups, and community-based eco-projects. Educational components also address pressing issues like climate change, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable lifestyle practices.
Over the past two weeks, Harit Yoga initiatives have begun to attract international interest, marking the beginning of what the Ministry hopes will become a global movement of environmentally conscious yoga practitioners.
With FHRAI’s participation, the private sector continues to play a pivotal role in amplifying the message of yoga as a holistic solution to both personal wellness and planetary health.

Title: Putin says he is open to direct peace talks with Ukraine
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:38:15 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed on Monday bilateral talks with Ukraine for the first time since the early days of the war, and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv was eager to discuss a halt to attacks on civilian targets.
While Zelenskiy did not respond directly to Putin’s proposal, he emphasized in his nightly video address that Ukraine “was ready for any conversation” about a ceasefire that would stop strikes on civilians.
The two leaders face pressure from the United States, which has threatened to walk away from its peace efforts unless some progress is achieved.
Russia and Ukraine have said they are open to further ceasefires after a 30-hour Easter truce declared by Moscow at the weekend. Each side accused the other of violating it.
Ukraine will take part in talks with the U.S. and European countries on Wednesday in London, Zelenskiy said. The discussions are a follow-up to a Paris meeting last week where the U.S. and European states discussed ways to end the more than three-year-old war.
Putin, speaking to a Russian state TV reporter, said fighting had resumed after the Easter ceasefire, which he announced unilaterally on Saturday. And Moscow, he said, was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv.
“We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude towards any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,” Putin told state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted later by Interfax news agency, told reporters: “When the president said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, including bilaterally, the president had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side.”
There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
HALTING ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN TARGETS
Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address, said Ukraine stood by its proposal for an end to attacks on civilian targets and was ready for any form of discussion to achieve it. Previously, the U.S. and Ukraine had framed this as a 30-day ceasefire.
“Ukraine maintains its proposal not to strike at the very least civilian targets. And we are expecting a clear response from Moscow,” he said. “We are ready for any conversation about how to achieve this.”
He said the London talks “have a primary task: to push for an unconditional ceasefire. This must be the starting point.”
Zelenskiy had earlier on Monday said an unconditional ceasefire would be “followed by the establishment of a real and lasting peace”.
Washington has said it would welcome an extension of the weekend truce. Zelenskiy said continued Russian attacks during the Easter ceasefire showed Moscow was intent on prolonging the war.
Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine’s forces were instructed to continue to mirror the Russian army’s actions.
“The nature of Ukraine’s actions will remain symmetrical: ceasefire will be met with ceasefire, and Russian strikes will be met with our own in defence. Actions always speak louder than words,” he said on X.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said on Friday that Washington could abandon the peace talks without progress within days. Trump struck a more optimistic note Sunday, saying that “hopefully” the two sides would make a deal “this week”.
Russia’s demands include Ukraine ceding all the land Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality. Ukraine says that would amount to surrender and leave it undefended if Moscow attacks again.
“President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,” Peskov told reporters.

Title: India’s DBT system yields Rs. 3.48 lakh crore in savings, boosts welfare efficiency: report
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:29:27 +0000
Content: India’s Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system has resulted in cumulative savings of Rs. 3.48 lakh crore by plugging leakages in welfare delivery, reveals a new report by the BlueKraft Digital Foundation. The findings, endorsed by the Ministry of Finance, underscore the transformative impact of DBT on public spending efficiency, subsidy rationalisation, and social inclusion.
The report evaluates data from 2009 to 2024 and introduces a Welfare Efficiency Index (WEI), a composite metric that tracks fiscal and social outcomes. The index surged nearly threefold—from 0.32 in 2014 to 0.91 in 2023—indicating significant gains in both inclusion and financial efficiency.
The report shows that government subsidies dropped from 16% of total expenditure in 2009–2013 to 9% in 2023–24, even as beneficiary coverage rose dramatically from 11 crore to 176 crore individuals. In the food subsidy sector alone, Aadhaar-linked ration authentication helped save Rs.1.85 lakh crore. In the MGNREGS program, 98% of wages were transferred on time, generating savings of ₹42,534 crore. The PM-KISAN scheme saved ₹22,106 crore by removing 2.1 crore ineligible beneficiaries, while targeted fertilizer disbursement saved Rs. 18,699.8 crore.
The success of the JAM trinity—Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar, and mobile connectivity—has enabled transparent, direct transfers and helped eliminate ghost beneficiaries and middlemen.
The Welfare Efficiency Index gives 50% weight to DBT savings, 30% to subsidy reduction, and 20% to beneficiary growth. This multifactor approach demonstrates that India’s efficiency gains are not merely a result of budget cuts but reflect broader systemic improvements.
Although subsidy levels spiked briefly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21 due to emergency relief measures, the report notes that fiscal discipline was restored soon after, reaffirming DBT’s long-term resilience and effectiveness.
Correlation analysis in the report further supports the efficiency of DBT. There is a strong positive correlation of 0.71 between savings and beneficiary coverage, suggesting that expanding outreach did not compromise financial efficiency. Conversely, a negative correlation of -0.74 between subsidy expenditure and welfare efficiency highlights how DBT has reduced waste while enhancing impact.
The report concludes by presenting DBT as a replicable model for global policymakers aiming to achieve both fiscal prudence and inclusive growth. With governments worldwide rethinking their social protection mechanisms, India’s DBT framework offers a compelling blueprint for transparent and efficient welfare delivery.

Title: India declares three-day state mourning following Pope Francis’ death
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:24:41 +0000
Content: India has declared a three-day state mourning as a mark of respect for Pope Francis, who passed away on Monday. The mourning will be observed across the country on April 22 and 23, and again on the day of the Pope’s funeral. 
“His Holiness Pope Francis, Supreme Pontiff of the Holy See, passed away today, the 21st April, 2025. As a mark of respect, three-day State Mourning shall be observed throughout India, in the following manner: Two days’ State Mourning on Tuesday, the 22nd April, 2025 and Wednesday, the 23rd April, 2025. One day’s State Mourning on the day of the funeral,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement.
According to the MHA, during the period of state mourning, the national flag will be flown at half-mast, and there will be no official entertainment.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed deep sorrow over the Pope’s death. He said Pope Francis’ “affection for the people of India will always be cherished.” 
“Deeply pained by the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis. In this hour of grief and remembrance, my heartfelt condolences to the global Catholic community. Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world. From a young age, he devoted himself towards realising the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope,” PM Modi said a post on X. 
“I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-around development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,” the Prime Minister added. 
PM Modi had met Pope Francis during the G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy. 
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also mourned the Pope’s passing and remembered him as a kind leader who worked to build a better world. 
“Saddened at the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis,” Jaishankar said in a post on X. 
He also shared a group photo with the Pope and added, “His compassion and commitment to building a better world defined his papacy. May his soul rest in peace.” 
Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1969. After Pope Benedict XVI resigned on February 28, 2013, a papal conclave elected Cardinal Bergoglio as his successor on March 13, 2013. He chose the name Francis in honour of Saint Francis of Assisi.
Following his death, the Vatican has declared a nine-day mourning period called “Novendiale,” an old Roman tradition. After this period, the Cardinals will meet in a conclave to elect the next Pope.

Title: PM Modi hails Saudi Crown Prince as visionary leader, highlights expanding Indo-Saudi ties
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 05:15:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lauded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a “strong advocate of bilateral ties” and a leader “deeply admired” by the Indian diaspora. In an interview with Arab Times ahead of his two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, PM Modi praised the Crown Prince’s leadership, visionary reforms, and his warm support for India-Saudi relations.
“Every time I have met him, His Royal Highness has left a deep impression on me. His insights, his forward-thinking vision, and his passion for fulfilling the aspirations of his people are truly remarkable,” PM Modi said. He added that Saudi Arabia’s transformation under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s leadership, particularly through Vision 2030, has not only inspired the region but also captured global attention. “One can see the transformational changes in the country under Vision 2030 in a very short period. I value the personal warmth and trust we share. And, yes, this personal rapport has naturally translated into how both countries give priority to our partnership.”
The Prime Minister noted that the Indian diaspora in Saudi Arabia holds the Crown Prince in high esteem for his consistent support and inclusive approach. He stated, “He has been a great supporter of the Indian diaspora in Saudi Arabia and our people living in Saudi Arabia deeply admire him.”
PM Modi also congratulated Saudi Arabia on securing the bids to host two major international events—World Expo 2030 and FIFA World Cup 2034—calling them “a matter of immense pride.” He said, “As a close friend, India rejoices in Saudi Arabia’s stellar achievements. It is a matter of immense pride for any country to host two marquee global events within a span of four years. It speaks volumes of the leadership of His Royal Highness and his vision.”
He emphasized that these mega events would boost the Saudi economy and create opportunities for Indian companies. Highlighting India’s proven capabilities, Modi said Indian firms had earned a global reputation for their quality and efficiency and were already active contributors to Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure and technology sectors. “They are also creating value in various mega and giga projects as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030,” he added.
Calling for greater economic engagement, PM Modi invited Saudi companies to invest in India’s growth story. “I also invite Saudi companies to take advantage of the remarkable opportunities in India as part of our Viksit Bharat journey. They can participate in the growth of India’s next-generation infrastructure, logistics, renewable energy, healthcare, utilities, innovation, start-ups and blue economy sectors,” he said, emphasizing that deeper engagement between companies from both nations would strengthen the bilateral economic partnership.
Addressing the energy partnership between the two nations, PM Modi reiterated that Saudi Arabia remains one of India’s most reliable suppliers of crude oil and petroleum products. He said that the two countries are now exploring joint projects in refineries and petrochemicals to expand beyond traditional buyer-seller relationships. “Energy has been an important pillar of our economic partnership. As India seeks to become a developed country, our energy demands will continue to grow. And Saudi Arabia will remain a close partner in our energy security,” the Prime Minister noted.
Highlighting the global push towards sustainability, PM Modi spoke about India’s green energy ambitions, including its target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. “Even in this journey, there is immense scope for collaboration with Saudi Arabia. This includes areas such as supply chains, circular economy, energy efficiency and green hydrogen. As partners in the International Solar Alliance, both countries can work toward innovative solutions for future energy needs,” he said.
Touching on regional connectivity, PM Modi spoke about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC), a landmark project launched at the G20 Summit in 2023. He described the corridor as a transformative initiative that could shape the global trade landscape for generations. “This corridor will define the future of connectivity in all forms for centuries to come. It will become the key catalyst of commerce, connectivity and growth in the entire region. It will enhance connectivity in all its forms, be it physical or digital, and will facilitate the development of resilient and dependable supply chains.”
He further emphasized the potential of the corridor to lower trade costs, boost economic unity, generate employment, and reduce carbon emissions, calling it “the new Silk Route of the 21st century” with benefits for generations to come.

Title: Union Minister Jayant Chaudhary inaugurates NSDC-PDEU centre of excellence in Gandhinagar offering 40 skill-based courses
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 04:52:34 +0000
Content: Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Minister of State for Education, Jayant Chaudhary, inaugurated a Centre of Excellence (CoE) jointly established by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, on Monday.
The new centre will offer over 40 online and hybrid courses focused on emerging sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing, renewable and non-renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and digital technologies. These programs are designed to equip students from ITI, diploma, undergraduate, and postgraduate streams with niche technical skills, helping bridge the gap between academia and industry.
Speaking at the launch, Minister Chaudhary emphasized the transformative role of universities, stating, “Universities must become engines of innovation, not just to serve the market but to advance national growth. Gujarat has shown remarkable leadership in reshaping its higher education landscape, and this new centre strengthens that vision.”
The CoE is equipped with advanced manufacturing labs and will serve as a hub for hands-on training, research and development (R&D), and real-time industry engagement in sectors such as embedded systems, VLSI design, and smart energy solutions. The initiative aligns with the national priorities of sustainable development, energy security, and job readiness.
A Memorandum of Association (MoA) was signed earlier this month between NSDC and PDEU. Ved Mani Tiwari, CEO of NSDC and MD of NSDC International, highlighted the strategic importance of the collaboration, noting, “This partnership strengthens the skilling ecosystem with a focus on smart manufacturing and semiconductors. Our aim is to make India’s youth globally competitive through world-class training and international certifications.”
PDEU’s Director General, S. Sundar Manoharan, reaffirmed the university’s commitment to the goals of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat, under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He pointed to Gujarat’s strategic investments in semiconductor technology and renewable energy as key drivers of India’s innovation leadership.
The NSDC will oversee the centre’s operational framework and monitor the delivery of training programs to ensure quality and relevance. PDEU will contribute with its industry-grade facilities, including a 45 MW Solar PV Manufacturing Line and an ATMP Semiconductor Packaging Line.
The Centre is expected to play a vital role in preparing India’s youth to become “Energy Ambassadors for the Nation” and global leaders in emerging technologies.

Title: RBI issues revised LCR guidelines for banks, effective April 2026
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 12:43:44 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released updated guidelines for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), introducing key changes that will take effect from April 1, 2026. The revisions are aimed at strengthening the liquidity resilience of Indian banks and bringing domestic regulations in line with global standards.
 
As per the new guidelines, banks will be required to assign an additional run-off rate of 2.5 per cent to deposits made through internet and mobile banking channels by retail and small business customers.
 
In another major change, banks must now apply haircuts to the market value of Government Securities (classified as Level 1 High-Quality Liquid Assets or HQLA), in accordance with margin requirements under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF).
 
The RBI has also rationalised the run-off rates for wholesale funding sourced from “other legal entities.” Under the revised norms, funds from non-financial entities such as educational, charitable and religious trusts, as well as partnerships and LLPs, will now attract a lower run-off rate of 40 per cent, compared to the current 100 per cent.
 
“To give banks adequate time to transition their systems to the new standards for LCR computation, the revised instructions shall become applicable from April 1, 2026,” the central bank said in its statement.
 
An impact analysis based on data as of December 31, 2024, indicates that these changes are expected to improve the aggregate LCR of banks by approximately 6 percentage points. The RBI noted that all banks are projected to continue meeting the minimum regulatory LCR requirements comfortably.
 
“These measures are expected to enhance the liquidity resilience of banks in India while aligning the regulatory framework more closely with global practices in a non-disruptive manner,” the RBI said.
 
The final guidelines follow a draft circular issued on July 25, 2024, which proposed amendments to the LCR framework, including changes to haircuts on HQLA and run-off rates for specific deposit categories. The final version reflects the feedback received from banks and other stakeholders during the consultation period.
 
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio is a key regulatory requirement under the Basel III framework. It mandates that banks maintain a sufficient stock of High Quality Liquid Assets to cover their total net cash outflows for a 30-day stress period.

Title: Rafael Nadal, Armand Duplantis, Simone Biles emerge as winners at Laureus World Sports Awards 2025
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:40:00 +0000
Content: Former tennis player Rafael Nadal and Paris 2024 Olympic champions Armand Duplantis, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade were among the top winners at the 2025 Laureus World Sports Awards held in Madrid, according to Olympics.com.
The event marked the 25th edition of the prestigious awards ceremony, celebrating the world’s most outstanding athletes.
Eleven-time world surfing champion Kelly Slater received the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, while Nadal was honoured with the Laureus Sporting Icon Award to a standing ovation from a hall filled with sporting legends.
The red carpet saw a host of global sports stars, including freestyle skiing sensation Eileen Gu, football World Cup winner Paulo Dybala, gymnastics icon Nadia Comaneci, and cycling legend Chris Hoy. Alpine skiing champion Lindsey Vonn hosted the ceremony for the second time in four years.
The evening began with last year’s Sportsman of the Year, Novak Djokovic, presenting the award to Swedish pole vaulter Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis. Duplantis made history by becoming the first back-to-back Olympic men’s pole vault champion in over 50 years, while also breaking the world record for the ninth time.
“I’m proud of myself for putting in the work and grinding through it to be here among the greatest athletes in the world. This is a once-in-a-lifetime type of award, and I’m not going to take it for granted,” Duplantis said.
Simone Biles and Rebeca Andrade were named World Sportswoman of the Year and World Comeback of the Year, respectively. The American and Brazilian gymnasts shared several podiums at the Paris Games and praised each other’s resilience and achievements.
“Paris showed that camaraderie can exist between competitors. Simone and I are the only gymnasts to win a Laureus Award, and I hope our stories inspire others facing injuries and setbacks to keep going,” Andrade said.
Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock won the World Action Sportsperson of the Year Award after a dramatic mountain biking gold at Paris 2024, where he overcame a punctured tyre to defend his Tokyo title.
Chinese para-swimmer Jiang Yuyan was awarded Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability after winning seven gold medals in seven events at Paris 2024, matching a record last achieved by Mark Spitz at the 1972 Olympics.
Football was also celebrated, with Real Madrid named World Team of the Year and 17-year-old Lamine Yamal, a standout performer in Spain’s Euro 2024 campaign, named Breakthrough of the Year.
The Sport for Good Award was given to Kick4Life, a foundation in Lesotho that uses football to educate young people about HIV prevention.
Kelly Slater, widely regarded as the greatest surfer of all time, reflected on his journey: “As a kid, I wasn’t sure if someone from my area in Florida could win a world title. Now we have 22 world titles from our state. You have to believe you can achieve something for it to happen.”
Slater, previously nominated in 2006 and a multiple-time winner in the Action Sportsperson category, highlighted the value of peer recognition: “This is judged by your peers. That’s the highest honour.”
The night concluded with a standing ovation for Rafael Nadal, who retired in 2024. He became only the second recipient of the Laureus Sporting Icon Award, following Valentino Rossi in 2022.
“Tennis and sport have given me so much. I’ve always tried to give my best every time I stepped on the court,” Nadal said. “I hope my career has inspired others. As I move on to the next chapter, I aim to continue using sport to make a positive impact.”
Full list of winners at the 2025 Laureus World Sports Awards:

Title: JD Vance backs stronger India-US trade, hails PM Modi as ‘tough negotiator’
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:17:42 +0000
Content: The United States is looking to expand the sale of energy and defence equipment to India, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on Tuesday. He added that the growing ties between the two nations will play a defining role in shaping the century.
“If India and the United States work together successfully, we’re going to see a 21st century that is prosperous and peaceful,” he said in a speech in Jaipur.
“But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21st century could be a very dark time for all of humanity.”
He also repeatedly praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi following their dinner on Monday. Vance is on a mostly personal, four-day visit to India along with his wife, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, and their three children.
The trip comes at a time when India is rushing to clinch an early trade deal with the U.S. – its largest trading partner – before the end of the 90-day pause on the steep tariffs announced by President Donald Trump’s administration.
“Prime Minister Modi is a tough negotiator. He drives a hard bargain,” Vance said to a big laughter from the audience.
India hopes to “positively conclude” the first part of a trade pact by autumn, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in San Francisco on Monday.
Vance said he and PM Modi made good progress on trade talks, and confirmed that the two sides had finalised the terms of reference for the trade negotiation.
“It sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,” he said.

Content: The Indian stock market extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive trading session on Tuesday, driven by strong performances in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and private banking stocks.
 
The Sensex opened on a positive note, rising 320 points to touch 79,728. However, it briefly slipped into negative territory, hitting a low of 79,253 due to weak cues from overnight losses in the US markets. Despite the early dip, the index rebounded swiftly and traded in positive territory for the remainder of the session, eventually touching an intra-day high of 79,824. It closed at 79,596, up 187 points or 0.24%.
 
With Tuesday’s close, the Sensex has gained 5,749 points, or 7.8%, over the last six trading sessions, reflecting strong momentum in domestic equities.
 
The Nifty mirrored a similar trajectory. It fell to 24,072 in early trade but quickly recovered to reach an intra-day high of 24,243. The index ended the day 42 points or 0.2% higher at 24,167.
 
The rally coincided with a milestone for the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which marked its 29th anniversary on Tuesday.
 
Over the past six sessions, the Nifty has added 1,768 points, or 7.9%, underscoring sustained investor confidence despite global market uncertainties.
 
Market analysts attribute the ongoing uptrend to steady buying in select sectors, particularly FMCG and banking.
 
“For the Nifty, the highest open interest on the call side was observed at the 25,500 and 24,200 strike prices, while on the put side, it was concentrated at the 24,000 and 23,000 levels,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity. “The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) stood at 1.05, indicating a mildly bullish sentiment.”
 
The Bank Nifty was a key driver of the rally, buoyed by the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to relax final Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) norms, effective from April 2026.
 
Beyond banking, sectors such as Realty, Consumer Durables, and FMCG also posted notable gains. The IT sector was the only major index to close in the red.
 
“Globally, US markets remained under pressure, weighed down by continued selling,” Kewat added.

Title: PM Modi lands in Jeddah, receives rousing welcome
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:08:14 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a rousing welcome at the Jeddah airport on Tuesday afternoon as he began a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, his third to the Kingdom after his previous visits in 2016 and 2019, at the invitation of Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.
As a special gesture for the State Visit of PM Modi, his aircraft was escorted by the Royal Saudi Air Force as it entered the Saudi airspace.
​The April 22-23 visit follows the State Visit of Prince Mohammed bin Salman to New Delhi in September 2023 to attend the G20 Summit and co-chair the first meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council.
In his departure statement issued earlier in the day, PM Modi emphasised that India deeply values its long and historic ties with Saudi Arabia that have acquired strategic depth and momentum in recent years.
“Together, we have developed a mutually beneficial and substantive partnership including in the domains of defence, trade, investment, energy and people to people ties. We have shared interest and commitment to promote regional peace, prosperity, security and stability,” he stated.
This will be Prime Minister Modi’s first visit to the historic city of Jeddah where the second meeting of the Strategic Partnership Council (SPC) will also take place. The SPC was established during Prime Minister Modi’s last State visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019 to steer the bilateral relationship forward.
In the evening, India time, Prime Minister Modi will interact with members of the Indian community, highlighting once again the importance he attaches to the welfare of Indians abroad.
“I am also eager to connect with the vibrant Indian community in Saudi Arabia that continues to serve as the living bridge between our nations and making immense contribution to strengthening the cultural and human ties,” PM Modi stated in his departure statement.
The Indian community in Saudi Arabia is 2.7 million strong and acts as a living bridge between the two countries. Indian diaspora contribution to the economic development of Saudi Arabia is widely recognised. Number of Indians in Saudi Arabia is increasing steadily. Over the last year, an estimated one lakh Indians came to Saudi Arabia for employment.
India-Saudi Arabia partnership has received a major boost over the last decade, especially after PM Modi’s landmark visit to Riyadh in April 2016 that led to an enhanced and comprehensive cooperation in the political, economic, security and defence realms. During the visit, King Salman conferred the Kingdom’s highest civilian honour, the ‘King Abdulaziz Sash’, on PM Modi.
The SPC established in 2019 has two pillars – the Political-Security-Socio-Cultural (PSSC) and Economic and Investment. While the External Affairs Minister and the Saudi Foreign Minister co-chair the PSSC, the economic pillar is co-chaired by India’s Commerce and Industry Minister and the Energy Minister on the Saudi side.
There are also eight Joint Working Groups (JWGs) and sub-committees under the two pillars which conduct regular official level meetings.
The first Summit of the SPC was held in New Delhi in September 2023 and was co-chaired by PM Modi and visiting Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
Beginning 2024, there have been 11 ministerial-level visits between both nations. The Saudi Foreign Minister and Saudi Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources visited India in November 2024 and February 2025, respectively.
Riyadh is also the seat of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and India and the GCC Secretariat have maintained good relations and regular dialogues at official level. In September 2024, EAM S. Jaishankar visited Riyadh to co-chair the first India-GCC Ministerial Meeting.
On the economic front, Saudi Arabia remains India’s fifth largest trade partner while India is Saudi Arabia’s second largest trade partner. During the Financial Year 2023-24, India’s imports from Saudi Arabia reached US $31.42 billion and exports to Saudi Arabia were worth US$ 11.56 billion.
Saudi Arabia also remained India’s third largest Crude and Petroleum products sourcing destination for Financial Year (FY) 2023-24. India imported 33.35 MMT of crude oil in FY 2023-24 from Saudi Arabia, accounting for 14.3 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports. In FY 2023-24, Saudi Arabia was the third largest LPG sourcing destination for India, accounting for 18.2 per cent of the total LPG imports of India for 2023-24. Saudi Arabia is also one of India’s major suppliers of fertilizers, particularly it is the second largest source of DAP for India.
The annual Haj pilgrimage and Umrah is another important component of India-Saudi bilateral relations. India’s Haj quota stands at 175,025 pilgrims.

Title: Pope Francis’s funeral to be held on Saturday, many world leaders expected
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:06:22 +0000
Content: Pope Francis’ funeral will be held on Saturday in St. Peter’s Square, Roman Catholic cardinals decided on Tuesday, setting the stage for a solemn ceremony that will draw leaders from around the world.
Francis, 88, died unexpectedly on Monday after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest, the Vatican said, ending an often turbulent reign in which he repeatedly clashed with traditionalists and championed the poor and marginalised.
The pontiff spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year suffering from double pneumonia. But he returned to the Vatican almost a month ago and had seemed to be recovering, appearing in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday.
The Vatican on Tuesday released photographs of Francis dressed in his vestments and laid in a wooden coffin in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence, where he lived during his 12-year papacy. Swiss Guards stand on either side of the casket.
His body will be taken into the adjacent St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday morning at 9:00 a.m. (0700 GMT), in a procession led by cardinals, allowing the faithful to pay their last respects to the first Latin American pope.
His funeral service will be held in St. Peter’s Square, in the shadow of the Basilica, on Saturday at 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT).
U.S. President Donald Trump, who clashed repeatedly with the pope about immigration, said he and his wife would fly to Rome for the service.
Among other heads of state set to attend were Javier Milei, president of Francis’ native Argentina, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a source in his office.
ANCIENT RITUALS
In a break from tradition, Francis confirmed in his final testament released on Monday that he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of Saint Mary Major and not St. Peter’s, where many of his predecessors were laid to rest.
Francis’s sudden death has set in motion ancient rituals, as the 1.4-billion-member Church started the transition from one pope to another, including the breaking of the pope‘s “Fisherman’s Ring” and lead seal, used in his lifetime to seal documents, so they cannot be used by anyone else.
All cardinals in Rome were summoned to a meeting on Tuesday to decide on the sequencing of events in the coming days and review the day-to-day running of the Church in the period before a new pope is elected.
A conclave to choose a new pope normally takes place 15 to 20 days after the death of a pontiff, meaning it should not start before May 6.
Some 135 cardinals are eligible to participate in the secretive ballot, which can stretch over days before white smoke pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel tells the world that a new pope has been picked.
At present there is no clear frontrunner to succeed Francis.
PROGRESSIVE
Pope Francis inherited a Church in disarray and worked hard to overhaul the Vatican’s central administration, root out corruption and, after a slow start, confront the scourge of child abuse within the ranks of the priesthood.
He often clashed with conservatives, nostalgic for a traditional past, who saw Francis as overly liberal and too accommodating to minority groups, such as the LGBTQ community.
Francis appointed nearly 80% of the cardinal electors scattered across the world who will choose the next pope, increasing, but not guaranteeing, the possibility that his successor will continue his progressive policies.
Many of the cardinals are little known outside their own countries and they will have a chance to get to know one another at meetings known as General Congregations that take place in the days before a conclave starts and where a profile of the qualities needed for the next pope will take shape.
The Vatican said late on Monday that staff and officials within the Holy See could immediately start to pay their respects before the pope‘s body at the Santa Marta residence, where Francis set up home in 2013, shunning the grand, apostolic palace his predecessors had lived in.

Title: PLI pushes electronics exports from fifth to third-largest category: Ashwini Vaishnaw
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:03:28 +0000
Content: India’s electronics exports have risen from the fifth-largest to the third-largest export category within a single fiscal year, driven by the transformative Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Tuesday.
In a post on X, the minister said that electronics exports hit an all-time high, surpassing Rs 3.25 lakh crore in FY25.
Vaishnaw also highlighted that lakhs of new jobs have been created in the electronics ecosystem, especially for women, along with “skilling, increasing domestic value addition (DVA), and Indian MSMEs joining global supply chains.”
The electronics manufacturing industry has seen five-fold growth over the last 10 years, surpassing Rs 11 lakh crore, while the entire ecosystem has created 25 lakh jobs. 
Vaishnaw also hailed hardware brands now lining up for India, as China stands to lose amidst the ongoing trade tariff war with the US. The PLI 2.0 scheme for IT hardware saw more than Rs 10,000 crore in production and 3,900 jobs in just 18 months of its launch, the government said in January this year.
Notably, India has begun producing laptops as part of its expanding electronics manufacturing sector. Additionally, the sector has received a significant boost with the government announcing the long-awaited ‘Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme’ (ECMS).
The scheme marks a turning point for strengthening India’s component manufacturing ecosystem and increasing domestic value addition. With a financial outlay of Rs 22,919 crore over six years, ECMS aims to generate production worth Rs 4.56 lakh crore, attract investments of Rs 59,350 crore, and create nearly 91,600 direct jobs.

Title: Indian Community in Jeddah sings ‘Saare Jahan Se Achha’ ahead of PM Modi’s arrival
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:02:36 +0000
Content: A wave of patriotic enthusiasm swept through the Indian community in Jeddah as members of the diaspora gathered to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a two-day State visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from April 22-23. As they awaited his arrival, the crowd broke into a soulful rendition of ‘Saare Jahan Se Achha’, expressing pride and excitement over the Prime Minister’s visit.
Many attendees described the moment as deeply emotional and historic. “I am very excited to see PM Modi here. We are so grateful that we got this opportunity,” said one jubilant member of the Indian community. Another echoed the sentiment, adding, “We thank the Crown Prince for inviting PM Modi. Seeing all the vibrant colours and the positive energy around us, we are all very excited.”
The warmth was palpable as several attendees likened the Prime Minister’s arrival to that of a family member. “We are proud to be Indian in Saudi Arabia. It feels as if a member of our family is visiting us,” said another participant in the gathering.
In a special diplomatic gesture, PM Modi’s aircraft was escorted by F-15 fighter jets of the Royal Saudi Air Force upon entering Saudi airspace—a mark of high honour reflecting the deepening strategic ties between the two nations.
This visit marks PM Modi’s third to the Kingdom, and his first to Jeddah. He is visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. During the visit, the two leaders will co-chair the 2nd Leaders’ Meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council.
Since taking office in 2014, PM Modi has redefined India’s engagement with the Gulf region, strengthening bilateral ties through diplomacy, economic cooperation, and people-to-people engagement.

Title: In India, US has a friend: Vice President J.D. Vance
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:57:17 +0000
Content: United States Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday reflected on the economic hardships faced by American manufacturing communities in recent years and underlined the importance of fair trade partnerships. Speaking at an event in Jaipur, Vance emphasized the growing ties between the U.S. and India, saying, “In India, the U.S. has a friend.”
 
Responding to a request by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vance shared his personal journey from Middletown, Ohio—a once-thriving manufacturing town that experienced economic decline as factories closed and jobs disappeared.
 
“I come from a long-standing manufacturing town called Middletown. It’s not a massive city like Jaipur, but it’s a decent place where people have made things for generations,” he said. Vance recalled how people migrated from nearby regions like West Virginia in search of manufacturing jobs and the promise of the American dream.
 
Speaking about his family, Vance said, “My parents and grandparents raised me in Middletown with the values of hard work, education, faith in God, love for our country, and being a good person. My grandfather’s job provided a decent wage and a pension. By the time I grew up, money was tight, but we were still able to live a good life.”
 
Vance described how that generation saw the rise of America’s middle class, crediting leaders of the past for building an economy rooted in production and supported by government policies that empowered workers and encouraged international trade.
 
“Back then, governments supported the labor force and struck good deals with global partners to sell goods made in the U.S.,” he said.
 
However, he noted that over time, that focus was lost.
 
“Later, some leaders abandoned the principles that built our prosperity. They ignored the importance of maintaining a strong industrial base. As a result, factories closed, jobs vanished, and towns like mine suffered,” Vance explained.
 
He said the story of Middletown mirrors that of millions of Americans.
 
“This story is my story—but it’s not unique. Tens of millions of Americans lived through this same experience. The good news is, people are now awake to what went wrong—and we believe it’s not too late to make things right,” he said.
 
Vance expressed confidence in the current U.S. administration’s approach, led by President Donald Trump, in correcting past mistakes.
 
“Our President has been consistent on these issues for decades. President Trump is deeply committed to ensuring Americans have access to good jobs and opportunities,” he said. “We want trade deals that are fair and rooted in shared national interests. We want our heritage to be a source of pride—not self-doubt.”
 
He emphasized the importance of partnering with countries that share values such as worker respect and industrial development.
 
“Today, I bring a simple message: the U.S. seeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and mutual interest. We want relationships with countries that respect labor and are committed to building alongside us,” Vance said.
 
“We want partners who recognize the historic moment we are in—to reshape global trade into a system that is open, balanced, stable, and fair. Our partners don’t need to be exactly like America, but we must share a common goal. I believe India and the U.S. do—especially when it comes to economic cooperation and national security. That’s why I’m so excited to be here today. In India, America has a friend, and it’s time to strengthen that bond,” he added.

“Anguished by the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. My thoughts are with the families of the deceased. Those involved in this dastardly act will not be spared, and we will act decisively,” Shah posted on X.
 
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh expressed deep sorrow over the incident, calling it “an act of cowardice.”
 
“Deeply anguished by the news of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam (Jammu & Kashmir). This dastardly attack on innocent civilians is highly reprehensible. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,” he said.
 
Leaders across the political spectrum have denounced the attack, calling it not only an assault on innocent lives but also a blow to peace and tourism in the region.

Title: India eyes $25 billion export boost in hand and power tools sector by 2035
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:34:00 +0000
Content: India is aiming to increase its exports of hand and power tools to over $25 billion by 2035, according to a report jointly released by NITI Aayog and the Foundation for Economic Development. The report, “Unlocking $25+ Billion Exports: India’s Hand & Power Tools Sector,” outlines a roadmap to scale up the country’s exports from the current level of approximately $1 billion.
The hand and power tools sector is a key component of the global manufacturing ecosystem, supporting industries such as construction, automotive, infrastructure, and electronics. India’s current share in the global tools market is limited—1.8% for hand tools and 0.7% for power tools. However, the report highlights the country’s potential to emerge as a major global supplier through targeted reforms and investment.
The global tools market, valued at around $100 billion in 2022, is projected to grow to $190 billion by 2035. Of this, hand tools are expected to account for $60 billion and power tools for $134 billion. India has set an export target of $15 billion in hand tools and $12 billion in power tools by 2035, which would represent a 25% global market share for hand tools and 10% for power tools. The growth is expected to generate approximately 3.5 million direct and indirect jobs.
India’s hand tools sector is supported by a well-established MSME base, with manufacturing clusters located in Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Nagaur, Mumbai, and Nagpur. These regions produce a range of tools, including pliers, screwdrivers, and wrenches. In contrast, the power tools segment is constrained by the lack of a strong domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem, particularly for precision components such as motors and batteries.
The report identifies the United States and the European Union as key markets, accounting for nearly 60% of global imports. Additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese tools—ranging from 7.5% to 25%—have created an opportunity for India to increase its market share.
To support exporters, the government provides incentives under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme. Hand tools exporters receive a rebate of 1.1% and power tools exporters receive 0.9% of the Free on Board (FOB) value. Manufacturers are also eligible for duty drawbacks of 1.5% to 2%, subject to meeting the minimum value addition requirement under the Standard Input Output Norms (SION).
The report proposes the development of three to four large-scale manufacturing clusters across 4,000 acres by 2035. These clusters would include industrial infrastructure, research and development facilities, housing for workers, and uninterrupted utilities. The estimated investment includes ₹12,000 crore from the government and ₹45,000 crore from industry, to be implemented through a Public-Private Partnership model.
Recommendations also include structural reforms such as reducing import duties, rationalizing quality control norms, simplifying compliance under the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme, and aligning labor regulations with international standards. Additional measures include liberalizing land use norms and ensuring reliable, low-cost electricity and efficient logistics.
If implementation is delayed, the report calls for a temporary bridge support package of ₹5,800 crore over five years. This would include interest subvention, competitiveness incentives, logistics support, and capital subsidies. The report positions this package as a strategic investment, expected to generate tax revenues two to three times the initial outlay.
According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, this strategy offers a timely opportunity for India to strengthen its position as a global manufacturing hub. With supportive policies and infrastructure, India’s hand and power tools sector could become a major contributor to the country’s export economy.

Title: “Shocking and painful”: President Murmu condoles death of tourists in J-K’s Pahalgam, Amit Shah rushes to Srinagar
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 14:46:44 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday expressed deep sorrow over the terrorist attack on tourists in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, extending heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wishing a speedy recovery for the injured.
 
In a post on X, the official handle of Rashtrapati Bhavan described the attack as both “shocking and painful.”
 
“The terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, is shocking and painful. It is a dastardly and inhuman act which must be condemned unequivocally. Attacking innocent citizens, in this case tourists, is utterly appalling and unpardonable,” the post read.
 
“My heartfelt condolences to the families who have lost their dear ones and my prayers for the quick recovery of the injured,” it added.
 
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also strongly condemned the attack and assured that those responsible would be held accountable.
 
“I strongly condemn the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover soon. All possible assistance is being provided to those affected,” PM Modi said on X.
 
“Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice… they will not be spared. Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakeable and will only grow stronger,” he added.
 
The attack, which targeted a group of tourists in the Pahalgam area of Anantnag district, occurred earlier on Tuesday, prompting swift response from security forces and emergency services. Police and ambulances reached the site shortly after the incident was reported.
 
In response to the attack, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha left for Srinagar to assess the situation on the ground.
 
BJP national president JP Nadda also condemned the attack, calling it a “highly reprehensible” act of violence against innocent civilians.
 
“Deeply anguished by the news of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir. The brutal targeting of innocent civilians in this cowardly attack is highly reprehensible. The Modi Government follows a Zero-Tolerance Policy against terrorism. Those involved in this heinous act will not be spared,” Nadda posted.
 
“The Union Home Minister is visiting the affected area, and the Hon. Prime Minister is personally monitoring the situation. We are committed to supporting all the affected families and will provide all necessary assistance,” he added.
 
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also reacted strongly, stating:
 
“Deeply anguished by the news of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam (Jammu & Kashmir). This dastardly attack on innocent civilians is an act of cowardice and highly reprehensible. My thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families.”
 
Leaders across the political spectrum have denounced the attack, describing it as an assault on peace and the region’s tourism-dependent economy.

Title: Bihar Entrepreneur establishes unique ‘Modi Memento Museum’ showcasing 56 auctioned souvenirs
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 14:14:54 +0000
Content: In a remarkable blend of patriotism and innovation, a young entrepreneur from Motihari, Bihar, has launched the state’s first-ever Modi Memento Museum, featuring 56 exclusive souvenirs once gifted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The one-of-its-kind museum is drawing attention for its inspiring origin and for serving as a heartfelt tribute to the Prime Minister’s Namami Gange initiative—a nationwide mission to clean and rejuvenate the Ganga River.
Back in 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced an auction of mementos and gifts he had received at various public functions and official engagements. The proceeds from the auction were directed toward funding the Namami Gange Programme.
Motivated by this noble cause, Yamuna Sikariya, a young industrialist from Motihari, participated in the auction and acquired 56 of these symbolic items—each a token of respect and recognition bestowed upon the Prime Minister for his leadership and service.
Taking things a step further, Sikariya transformed his collection into a dedicated museum, making it accessible to the public.
“The work done by our Prime Minister deserves to be remembered and celebrated. This museum is living proof of that. It is the only place in Bihar where people can see all 56 mementos received by PM Modi in one place,” he said.
The museum has since emerged as a beacon of inspiration, attracting visitors from across Bihar and neighbouring states. Many leave not just with memories, but with a renewed sense of purpose and patriotism.
“It’s motivational to see all these mementos. They inspire us to contribute to nation-building. What people often travel far to see, we now have right here in Motihari,” said visitor Rashi Kumari.
Keshav Kumar, another visitor, added, “It is a matter of pride for Champaran. Seeing these mementos fills me with immense pride. PM Modi is taking the nation towards progress, and it is truly praiseworthy.”

Title: MP govt approves ₹145-crore plan to curb human-tiger conflict
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 13:52:36 +0000
Content: In response to the growing incidents of human-tiger conflict, the Madhya Pradesh government has approved a ₹145-crore plan to install chain-link fencing across buffer zones in nine of the state’s tiger reserves.
 
Deputy Chief Minister Rajendra Shukla announced the decision on Tuesday, stating that the initiative aims to regulate human movement in forest-adjacent areas and reduce encounters between humans and tigers. The plan will be implemented over three financial years — 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28.
 
This decision comes in the wake of a sharp rise in tiger population in the state, which has increased from 526 in 2018 to 785 in recent years. The urgency of the project is further underscored by a series of recent tiger attacks. Between March and April 2025 alone, four incidents of conflict have been reported.
 
In the latest incident, a tiger attacked a tribal man near his field close to Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. Another tragic case involved a 14-year-old boy who was killed by a tigress while collecting Mahua flowers in the forest. His body was later found near a nullah. The same tigress reportedly attacked a woman named Rita the following day in the Pipariya buffer zone. Mahua flowers bloom during March and April and are a seasonal source of income for tribal communities.
 
The state offers compensation in cases of wildlife-related injuries or deaths. Families of deceased victims receive ₹10 lakh as ex gratia, while those injured receive up to ₹2 lakh. For minor injuries, medical expenses up to ₹25,000 are covered. In cases of property damage — particularly during elephant encounters — compensation is determined as per government rules.
 
Government records show a concerning trend: tiger attacks on humans rose from 10 in 2019 to 17 in 2020. The Kanha Tiger Reserve recorded the highest number of such incidents. Between 2019 and 2023, 27 human deaths were attributed to tiger attacks, a number that rose to 46 by the end of 2024.
 
Madhya Pradesh has seen fluctuations in its tiger population over the years: 306 tigers were recorded in 2006, 257 in 2010, 308 in 2014, and 726 in the 2022 census. These tigers are spread across the state’s nine tiger reserves.
 
In addition to fencing, existing mitigation strategies include patrolling, compensation, use of deterrents, and power fencing. These are complemented by the provisions of the Forest Rights Act, 2005, which protects the rights of forest-dwelling communities to access land and natural resources.
 
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve has grown significantly, from its original 105 square km to a total of 1,526 square km, including the buffer zone and the Panpatha Wildlife Sanctuary. Located in Umaria district, the area is home to a large tribal population, with nearly 50% belonging to Scheduled Tribes. As per the 2011 census, Umaria had a population of about seven lakh, with a growth rate of 24.96% and 17.14% living in urban areas.
 
Similarly, Kanha Tiger Reserve comprises a 917 square km core area and a 1,134 square km buffer zone. When the Phen Wildlife Sanctuary is included, the total protected area increases by another 110 square km.

Title: RBI issues revised LCR guidelines for banks, effective April 2026
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 12:43:44 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released updated guidelines for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), introducing key changes that will take effect from April 1, 2026. The revisions are aimed at strengthening the liquidity resilience of Indian banks and bringing domestic regulations in line with global standards.
 
As per the new guidelines, banks will be required to assign an additional run-off rate of 2.5 per cent to deposits made through internet and mobile banking channels by retail and small business customers.
 
In another major change, banks must now apply haircuts to the market value of Government Securities (classified as Level 1 High-Quality Liquid Assets or HQLA), in accordance with margin requirements under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF).
 
The RBI has also rationalised the run-off rates for wholesale funding sourced from “other legal entities.” Under the revised norms, funds from non-financial entities such as educational, charitable and religious trusts, as well as partnerships and LLPs, will now attract a lower run-off rate of 40 per cent, compared to the current 100 per cent.
 
“To give banks adequate time to transition their systems to the new standards for LCR computation, the revised instructions shall become applicable from April 1, 2026,” the central bank said in its statement.
 
An impact analysis based on data as of December 31, 2024, indicates that these changes are expected to improve the aggregate LCR of banks by approximately 6 percentage points. The RBI noted that all banks are projected to continue meeting the minimum regulatory LCR requirements comfortably.
 
“These measures are expected to enhance the liquidity resilience of banks in India while aligning the regulatory framework more closely with global practices in a non-disruptive manner,” the RBI said.
 
The final guidelines follow a draft circular issued on July 25, 2024, which proposed amendments to the LCR framework, including changes to haircuts on HQLA and run-off rates for specific deposit categories. The final version reflects the feedback received from banks and other stakeholders during the consultation period.
 
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio is a key regulatory requirement under the Basel III framework. It mandates that banks maintain a sufficient stock of High Quality Liquid Assets to cover their total net cash outflows for a 30-day stress period.

Title: Rafael Nadal, Armand Duplantis, Simone Biles emerge as winners at Laureus World Sports Awards 2025
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:40:00 +0000
Content: Former tennis player Rafael Nadal and Paris 2024 Olympic champions Armand Duplantis, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade were among the top winners at the 2025 Laureus World Sports Awards held in Madrid, according to Olympics.com.
The event marked the 25th edition of the prestigious awards ceremony, celebrating the world’s most outstanding athletes.
Eleven-time world surfing champion Kelly Slater received the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, while Nadal was honoured with the Laureus Sporting Icon Award to a standing ovation from a hall filled with sporting legends.
The red carpet saw a host of global sports stars, including freestyle skiing sensation Eileen Gu, football World Cup winner Paulo Dybala, gymnastics icon Nadia Comaneci, and cycling legend Chris Hoy. Alpine skiing champion Lindsey Vonn hosted the ceremony for the second time in four years.
The evening began with last year’s Sportsman of the Year, Novak Djokovic, presenting the award to Swedish pole vaulter Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis. Duplantis made history by becoming the first back-to-back Olympic men’s pole vault champion in over 50 years, while also breaking the world record for the ninth time.
“I’m proud of myself for putting in the work and grinding through it to be here among the greatest athletes in the world. This is a once-in-a-lifetime type of award, and I’m not going to take it for granted,” Duplantis said.
Simone Biles and Rebeca Andrade were named World Sportswoman of the Year and World Comeback of the Year, respectively. The American and Brazilian gymnasts shared several podiums at the Paris Games and praised each other’s resilience and achievements.
“Paris showed that camaraderie can exist between competitors. Simone and I are the only gymnasts to win a Laureus Award, and I hope our stories inspire others facing injuries and setbacks to keep going,” Andrade said.
Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock won the World Action Sportsperson of the Year Award after a dramatic mountain biking gold at Paris 2024, where he overcame a punctured tyre to defend his Tokyo title.
Chinese para-swimmer Jiang Yuyan was awarded Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability after winning seven gold medals in seven events at Paris 2024, matching a record last achieved by Mark Spitz at the 1972 Olympics.
Football was also celebrated, with Real Madrid named World Team of the Year and 17-year-old Lamine Yamal, a standout performer in Spain’s Euro 2024 campaign, named Breakthrough of the Year.
The Sport for Good Award was given to Kick4Life, a foundation in Lesotho that uses football to educate young people about HIV prevention.
Kelly Slater, widely regarded as the greatest surfer of all time, reflected on his journey: “As a kid, I wasn’t sure if someone from my area in Florida could win a world title. Now we have 22 world titles from our state. You have to believe you can achieve something for it to happen.”
Slater, previously nominated in 2006 and a multiple-time winner in the Action Sportsperson category, highlighted the value of peer recognition: “This is judged by your peers. That’s the highest honour.”
The night concluded with a standing ovation for Rafael Nadal, who retired in 2024. He became only the second recipient of the Laureus Sporting Icon Award, following Valentino Rossi in 2022.
“Tennis and sport have given me so much. I’ve always tried to give my best every time I stepped on the court,” Nadal said. “I hope my career has inspired others. As I move on to the next chapter, I aim to continue using sport to make a positive impact.”

Title: JD Vance backs stronger India-US trade, hails PM Modi as ‘tough negotiator’
Publication Date: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:17:42 +0000
Content: The United States is looking to expand the sale of energy and defence equipment to India, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on Tuesday. He added that the growing ties between the two nations will play a defining role in shaping the century.
“If India and the United States work together successfully, we’re going to see a 21st century that is prosperous and peaceful,” he said in a speech in Jaipur.
“But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21st century could be a very dark time for all of humanity.”
He also repeatedly praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi following their dinner on Monday. Vance is on a mostly personal, four-day visit to India along with his wife, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, and their three children.
The trip comes at a time when India is rushing to clinch an early trade deal with the U.S. – its largest trading partner – before the end of the 90-day pause on the steep tariffs announced by President Donald Trump’s administration.
“Prime Minister Modi is a tough negotiator. He drives a hard bargain,” Vance said to a big laughter from the audience.
India hopes to “positively conclude” the first part of a trade pact by autumn, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in San Francisco on Monday.
Vance said he and PM Modi made good progress on trade talks, and confirmed that the two sides had finalised the terms of reference for the trade negotiation.
“It sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,” he said.

Arriving by helicopter, Shah landed at the serene yet scarred Baisaran meadow, now marked by the violence that unfolded a day earlier.
Security was significantly intensified in the area, with army personnel deployed across the meadow and adjoining regions to secure the Home Minister’s visit and facilitate ongoing search operations to locate the attackers.
Earlier in the day, Shah paid his respects to the victims at a solemn wreath-laying ceremony held outside the Police Control Room in Srinagar. The emotional ceremony was attended by senior officials and political leaders, including Congress MP KC Venugopal and Jammu and Kashmir Congress President Tariq Hameed Karra, who also paid tributes.
Following the tribute, Shah met with grieving family members of the victims. Overcome with emotion, the relatives shared their pain with the Union Minister, pleading for justice and expressing the devastating impact of the tragedy on their lives.
In response to the attack, which has drawn widespread condemnation, political parties and traders’ unions across the Kashmir Valley called for a complete shutdown on Wednesday. Shops, schools, and businesses remained closed in a powerful show of solidarity with the victims and their families.
Shah had chaired a high-level security review meeting on Tuesday evening shortly after arriving in Srinagar. During the meeting, he directed all security agencies to intensify efforts to track down those responsible and assured that the culprits of this “dastardly act of terror” would not be spared.

Title: US Vice President J.D. Vance visits Taj Mahal with family
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:24:40 +0000
Content: United States Vice President J.D. Vance, accompanied by his wife Usha Vance and their three children, Ivan, Vivek, and Mirabel, arrived in Agra on Wednesday as part of his ongoing official visit to India. The Vance family was warmly received by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath upon their arrival in the historic city.
Shortly after landing, the Vice President and his family visited the iconic Taj Mahal, one of India’s most celebrated monuments. Sharing images from the visit on social media, CM Yogi welcomed the dignitary, stating, “A warm welcome to Hon’ble US Vice President J.D. Vance and his family to Uttar Pradesh, the sacred heartland of India, renowned for its timeless devotion, vibrant culture, and spiritual legacy.”
Security in Agra was significantly heightened ahead of the high-profile visit, with personnel deployed at key locations and tourist routes to ensure smooth arrangements during the family’s tour.
Vance’s trip to Agra comes after an eventful leg of his India tour, which began with his arrival in New Delhi on Monday. His visit to the national capital included a spiritual stop at the Akshardham Temple, followed by a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Later that evening, the Vice President and his family traveled to Jaipur.
In Jaipur, the Vance family visited the majestic Amer Fort, traveling in an open jeep from the Hathi Stand and exploring prominent attractions including Mavtha Sarovar and Kesar Kyari Bagh.

He described Modi as “a very tough negotiator” who “fights fiercely for India’s commercial interests.”
Reflecting on the growing India-US relationship, Vance said, “The US and India will move forward together through mutual cooperation across many sectors.” He reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and underscored the strategic relevance of the India-US partnership, declaring, “The 21st century will be shaped by the strength of this relationship.”

Title: Global condemnation pours after Pahalgam terror attack, terming it vile, senseless act
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:23:35 +0000
Content: Condolences poured in from across the globe following the ghastly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir that left 16 dead and dozens injured. The attack, which occurred on Tuesday in the picturesque Baisaran Valley, saw terrorists emerge from surrounding forests and indiscriminately open fire on a group of tourists, leaving dozens injured in addition to the fatalities.
Unequivocally condemning the barbaric attack on innocent tourists, Nepal said that it stands in steadfast solidarity with the Government and people of India in this time of sorrow.
In a statement on X, the Foreign Ministry of Nepal stated, “We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families and express our sincere wishes for the swift and full recovery of those injured.”
“In line with our firm and principled position, Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believes that such heinous acts of terrorism cannot and should not be justified on any ground,” the ministry added.
Meanwhile, Nepal’s Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba took to her social media and expressed deep shock and sadness at the heinous terrorist attack that took place in Pahalgam, Kashmir.
“We strongly condemn this act of terrorism and the senseless violence that has claimed innocent lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time, and we wish a swift and full recovery to those who have been injured. Nepal stands in steadfast solidarity with the Government and people of India in this time of sorrow,” she posted

Title: IMF slashes global outlook as White House says trade talks pick up pace
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 05:43:12 +0000
Content: Worldwide economic output will slow in the months ahead as U.S. President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs on virtually all trading partners begin to bite, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, as global finance chiefs swarmed Washington seeking deals with Trump’s team to lower the levies.
Indeed, the pace of negotiations was brisk, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, with 18 different countries offering proposals so far and Trump’s trade negotiating team set to meet with 34 countries this week to discuss tariffs. Trump himself expressed optimism that a trade deal with China could “substantially” cut tariffs, lifting markets.
After setting a baseline import tax of 10% and much higher on dozens of countries earlier this month, Trump abruptly put the steeper levies on hold for 90 days for countries to try to negotiate less stringent rates.
The talks blitz is occurring after hundreds of finance and trade delegates arrived for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank Group, almost all with the singular mission of inking a deal to ease the hefty tariffs burden, Trump has imposed on U.S. goods imports since beginning his second stint in the White House in January.
With tariffs on goods coming into the world’s No. 1 economy now at their highest in a century, the IMF projects global growth in 2025 will slow to 2.8% – its poorest showing since the COVID-19 pandemic – from 3.3% in 2024.
And it is not just a pain being visited upon others: U.S. gross domestic product growth will drop by a full percentage point to just 1.8% in 2025 from 2.8% last year, the IMF forecast, with “notable” upward revisions to inflation as the cost of imports climbs.
Another big victim of the fallout is China, with the IMF slashing its growth outlook to 4.0% for this year and next under the weight of crushing import taxes of 145% now levied against imports to the U.S. from the world’s largest goods producer.
China has retaliated with 125% tariffs of its own on goods from the U.S., effectively resulting in a trade embargo between the largest two economies, a standstill that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said neither sees as sustainable.
According to a person who heard Bessent’s closed-door presentation on Tuesday to investors at a JP Morgan conference in Washington, Bessent believes there will be a de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions but described future negotiations with Beijing as a “slog” that has not started yet.
TRUMP ON CHINA
Later on Tuesday, Trump expressed optimism that he would make progress with China that would substantially lower tariffs on their imports but also warned that “if they don’t make a deal, we’ll set the deal.”
Trump said a deal would result in “substantially” lower tariffs on Chinese goods.
“It won’t be that high,” Trump said when asked about the current rates. “It won’t be anywhere near that.”
He added that “it won’t be zero.”
U.S. stocks jumped in extended trade following Trump’s comments, with Amazon and Nvidia gaining 3% each and Apple rising 2%. 
While talks have been slow to start with China, Bessent and other members of Trump’s trade team have been pressing on with other key trading partners, though details are scant and no firm deals have been reached so far.
The U.S. and Japan, for one, are moving closer to an interim arrangement on trade, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, but many of the biggest issues are being put off. Such an interim framework will not tackle the thorniest issues facing the two countries in their trade relationship, and it was still possible that no final deal could be reached, the person said on condition of anonymity.
That movement comes after the U.S. and India said during a visit there by Vice President JD Vance that they had agreed to the broad scope of negotiations. While the two sides touted it as significant progress, agreeing to the so-called “Terms of Reference” mostly provides a roadmap for more extensive talks ahead.
Meanwhile, a number of U.S. companies reporting first-quarter results said tariffs are having an effect on business.
Consumer giant Kimberly-Clark said tariffs would cost it about $300 million this year, with CEO Michael Hsu noting “the breadth and degree of tariffs and also the countries involved have changed significantly since maybe where we were at the end of the last quarter.”
GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp told Reuters he recently met with Trump and urged him to restore a tariff-free regime for the aerospace industry that existed under a 1979 agreement. Culp said the company’s position was “understood” by the administration, but, added “it’s not the only item they’re solving for.”
GE Aerospace hung onto its outlook for the year, despite the cost of tariffs. “We’ll continue to press this point respectfully in the hopes that we can re-establish in effect what we had prior to the recent tariff moves,” he said in the interview.
The affirmation of its outlook helped lift GE Aerospace shares by more than 5%. Indeed, investors rattled over the past two months by Trump’s harsh tariffs and erratic approach to imposing them seemed to find some solace among the earnings being reported. The S&P 500, on the heels of another steep-down day on Monday, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday.

Title: HM Shah, J&K leaders pay tribute to Pahalgam terror attack victims in Srinagar
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 05:28:35 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, and Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha visited the Police Control Room (PCR) in Srinagar on Wednesday to pay their respects to the tourists who lost their lives in the brutal terror attack in Pahalgam. The bodies of the deceased, who were killed in Tuesday’s ambush, were brought to the PCR earlier in the day as part of official arrangements to ensure their dignified return to their native states.
Following the tribute ceremony, Amit Shah is scheduled to visit the Government Medical College (GMC) in Anantnag to meet those injured in the attack. He is also expected to conduct an aerial survey of the site in Baisaran, Pahalgam, where the deadly attack unfolded.
In a coordinated effort to facilitate the repatriation of the victims’ bodies, the Civil Aviation Ministry has arranged four additional flights from Srinagar—two to Mumbai and two to Delhi. The ministry is also working to regulate airfares to prevent price surges amid the high demand for travel, as the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway remains closed for the fourth consecutive day.
Meanwhile, a team from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrived in Srinagar on Wednesday. The NIA is set to visit Pahalgam to gather forensic evidence and leads on the perpetrators responsible for the heinous attack on unarmed civilians.
A massive search operation has been underway in the Pahalgam area since Tuesday evening, as security forces intensify efforts to track down the terrorists. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation from across the country and beyond, sparking candlelight vigils, protests, and calls for unity against terrorism.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while expressing his deep sorrow over the incident, stated that the attack has strengthened the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from Indian soil.
In response to the tragedy, a total protest shutdown was observed across the Kashmir Valley on Wednesday. The bandh, called by traders’ unions, industrialists, political parties, and various social and religious organisations, brought normal life to a standstill. Commercial establishments, public transport, and educational institutions remained closed, and only sparse vehicular movement was seen on roads and highways.

Title: Ukraine presses for ceasefire as Russia reported to offer concession
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 05:21:54 +0000
Content: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday Ukraine was ready for talks with Russia “in any format” once a ceasefire is set, while the Financial Times reported President Vladimir Putin had offered to halt Russia’s invasion at the current front lines.
Both sides are trying to demonstrate progress towards ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, now well into its fourth year, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could walk away from efforts to make peace if there is no breakthrough.
“We are ready to record that after a ceasefire, we are ready to sit down in any format so that there are no dead ends,” Zelenskiy told reporters in the presidential office in Kyiv.
He stressed that any discussions regarding the terms of a peace deal should only happen once the fighting has stopped and that it would be impossible to agree on everything quickly.
The Ukrainian president said his delegation would have a mandate to discuss a full or partial ceasefire at talks with European and U.S. officials in London on Wednesday in a follow-up to last week’s Paris meeting.
At the same time, the White House said Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff will again travel to Russia later this week to hold talks with Putin.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Financial Times reported that Putin offered at a meeting with Witkoff in St. Petersburg this month to halt Russia’s invasion across the front line and relinquish its claims to full control of four Ukrainian regions.
Russia only partially controls Ukraine’s Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions it claimed as its own during the full-scale invasion. Putin has publicly demanded that Ukraine withdraw its forces from Kyiv-held areas in the regions.
The FT said the proposal was the first formal indication Putin has given since the war’s early months that Russia could step back from some of its maximalist demands. It cited European officials briefed on U.S. efforts as saying Russia’s apparent concession could be a negotiating tactic.
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the deliberations, that Washington had proposed recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea and freezing the war’s front lines as part of a settlement.
The Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, is not one of the four regions in Putin’s offer reported by the FT.
Zelenskiy has long said Ukraine will not recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea and other territories as that would violate the country’s constitution. However, he has also suggested that Ukraine could win back control over the areas diplomatically over time, rather than by military force.
The U.S. presented the proposals to Kyiv at a meeting with Western countries in Paris last week, the Washington Post said.
Other thorny issues that complicate the peace process include the Kremlin’s insistence that Ukraine become formally neutral and not join the NATO military alliance.
Ukraine also hopes a foreign contingent will be deployed to ensure the peace settlement is enforced, serving as a security guarantee against any further Russian aggression. Moscow has repeatedly said it would not accept that.
In an apparent change of plan, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will not attend the talks in London, a State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday, adding that Washington’s Ukraine envoy General Keith Kellogg would attend.
Trump and Rubio said last week that Washington could abandon its peace effort unless there was progress within days. Trump on Sunday said that “hopefully” there would be a deal “this week”.
Separately, Zelenskiy said he would be ready to meet Trump when they attend the funeral of Pope Francis along with other world leaders this week.

Title: J&K: Two terrorists killed as army foils infiltration bid in Baramulla’s Uri Nala
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 05:06:02 +0000
Content: The Indian Army foiled an infiltration attempt along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday, killing two terrorists in the Sarjeevan area of Uri Nala. According to an official statement by the Chinar Corps, the incident occurred during “Operation Tikka” when troops detected movement of approximately 2–3 unidentified terrorists attempting to cross the LoC.
The army personnel challenged the infiltrators, resulting in a fierce gunfight. Two terrorists were neutralized during the exchange of fire. The operation remains ongoing, with security forces continuing combing operations in the area.
The Chinar Corps confirmed the development on X, stating, “On 23 Apr 2025, approximately 2-3 UI terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area Sarjeevan at Uri Nala, Baramulla. The alert troops on LC challenged and intercepted them resulting in a firefight. Operation is in progress.”
In a subsequent update, the Army added, “Heavy exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists, two terrorists have been eliminated, infiltration bid foiled by the security forces in the ongoing Operation. A large quantity of weapons, ammunition and other war-like stores have been recovered from the terrorists.”
This encounter comes just a day after the brutal terror attack in Pahalgam, Anantnag, where terrorists targeted tourists, killing and injuring several civilians. The attack has triggered widespread anger and condemnation across the country and has prompted heightened security measures in sensitive areas of Jammu and Kashmir.
In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, security forces launched search operations across various parts of the region. Streets in once-busy tourist zones have fallen silent, with several tourists deciding to cut their visits short due to the tense atmosphere. Authorities have intensified surveillance and movement checks in vulnerable areas.
Simultaneously, a complete shutdown was observed in the Kashmir valley on Wednesday, following calls by political parties, traders’ unions, and civil society groups to express solidarity with the victims and to strongly denounce the attack. Residents and political leaders alike have condemned the assault, calling it an attack on humanity.
In addition to the shutdown, residents across multiple districts including Baramulla, Srinagar, Poonch, and Kupwara organized candlelight marches to honor the victims of the Pahalgam attack. Similar protests were held in Khod village of Akhnoor, where locals lit candles in memory of the deceased. In Jammu, Bajrang Dal activists held demonstrations, demanding strict action against the perpetrators.

Title: Expert-level Iran-US talks rescheduled for Saturday
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 04:54:39 +0000
Content: Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Tuesday that expert-level technical talks with U.S. counterparts, initially set for Wednesday in Oman, have been postponed to Saturday.
“Following Oman’s suggestion and with mutual agreement between the Iranian and U.S. delegations, the expert-level meeting—originally planned for Wednesday as part of the ongoing indirect negotiations—will now take place on Saturday,” Baghaei told reporters, according to a ministry statement.
The upcoming talks mark the third round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington, focused on Iran’s nuclear program and the lifting of U.S. sanctions. The first round was held in Muscat on April 12, followed by a second session in Rome on April 19, with Oman acting as mediator.
After the Rome discussions, Iran’s Foreign Ministry indicated that technical negotiations at the expert level would be crucial in outlining the framework of a potential agreement. Saturday’s meeting is expected to review the outcome of those expert consultations.
Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi cautioned via social media that unnamed special interest groups were attempting to derail the talks by maligning negotiators and pressuring the U.S. administration into adopting a hardline stance. He dismissed claims that any forthcoming agreement would simply replicate the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stating, “Many in Iran believe the JCPOA no longer serves our interests. What’s needed is a new agreement that both protects Iran’s rights and addresses the concerns of all parties.”
On the same day, Araghchi also held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), during which he reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to a diplomatic resolution and updated Grossi on the progress of the indirect talks. Grossi commended Iran’s “responsible approach” and reiterated the IAEA’s readiness to support the diplomatic process within the scope of its mandate.
The JCPOA, signed in 2015 by Iran and six world powers—including the United States—aimed to curb Iran’s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. However, the U.S. withdrew from the accord in 2018 under President Donald Trump and reinstated sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually scale back its commitments. Attempts to revive the deal have so far seen limited progress.

Title: Providing whatever assistance we can to the government, says US VP JD Vance on Pahalgam attack

Content: United States Vice President JD Vance, currently on an official visit to India with his family, strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam that took place on Tuesday. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Vance extended condolences to the victims and affirmed that the US would provide all possible assistance to India.
 
In a video shared by Russia Today, Vice President Vance stated, “I want to issue our condolences to the people of Kashmir who were affected by this terrible terrorist attack.”
 
He also referred to the conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump regarding the attack. “The President’s already spoken with Prime Minister Modi. I believe I’ll be speaking with him later this afternoon, and obviously, we’re providing whatever assistance and help we can provide to the government, to the people of India,” Vance said.
 
Earlier, in a post on X, Vance said, “Usha and I extend our condolences to the victims of the devastating terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India. Over the past few days, we have been overcome with the beauty of this country and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.”
 
US President Donald Trump had earlier called Prime Minister Modi to offer condolences for what he termed an “Islamist terror attack” in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Modi expressed gratitude for the support and reiterated India’s commitment to bringing the perpetrators and their backers to justice, calling the attack “cowardly and heinous.”
 
Trump condemned the attack and assured Modi that the United States stands firmly with India in its fight against terrorism, offering full support.
 
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also expressed solidarity with India, posting on X, “The United States stands with India.”
 
National Security Advisor Mike Waltz described the incident as a “terrible tragedy” in response to President Trump’s statement on the attack.
 
The Pahalgam terror attack is being regarded as one of the most serious incidents of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. Following the attack, security forces launched intensive search operations on Wednesday to locate and neutralize the terrorists responsible.
 
Security has been tightened in the region, with visuals showing deserted streets in the usually busy tourist town. Several organisations have also called for a bandh in Jammu in response to the attack.

Title: PM Modi’s Saudi visit strengthens strategic partnership; boosts defence, energy, and trade cooperation
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:12:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Saudi Arabia has given a strong push to bilateral ties, with significant strides in defence, energy, trade, and cultural cooperation. As part of the visit, India and Saudi Arabia expanded the Strategic Partnership Council by adding two new ministerial committees—on defence cooperation and on tourism and culture—signifying a maturing and multidimensional relationship.
This marked PM Modi’s third visit to the Kingdom, undertaken at the invitation of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. However, the visit was cut short following the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Despite this, the two leaders co-chaired the second meeting of the Strategic Partnership Council and reviewed the progress of bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
The Council now includes four ministerial committees, reflecting the growing depth of engagement. Both leaders agreed to convene the next council meeting at a mutually convenient time.
India and Saudi Arabia welcomed the steady growth in bilateral trade. India is now Saudi Arabia’s second-largest trading partner, while Saudi Arabia ranks as India’s fifth-largest. Both countries agreed to expedite negotiations on the India-GCC Free Trade Agreement and fast-track the Bilateral Investment Treaty. Several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were also signed, covering areas such as healthcare, postal services, space cooperation, and anti-doping.
In line with their respective national goals—Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia and Viksit Bharat 2047 for India—the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to working together for shared prosperity.
Defence emerged as a key area of collaboration, with the launch of a dedicated ministerial committee. The leaders highlighted the success of recent joint military exercises such as SADA TANSEEQ and AL MOHED AL HINDI, and welcomed the initiation of tri-service staff-level talks. The two nations also pledged to strengthen defence industrial partnerships.
They jointly condemned terrorism in all its forms, including the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and rejected any link between terrorism and religion, race, or culture. The leaders called for dismantling terrorism infrastructure globally and bringing perpetrators to justice.
The two nations agreed to deepen cooperation in conventional and clean energy sectors, including oil, renewables, and green hydrogen. A joint study on an electricity interconnection project is currently underway. They also plan to collaborate on crude oil supply, refining, grid security, and energy efficiency.
Both sides reiterated their commitment to climate action under the Paris Agreement, focusing on reducing emissions. India appreciated Saudi Arabia’s initiatives such as the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative.
PM Modi praised the Saudi government for ensuring the welfare of the 2.7 million Indian nationals living in the Kingdom, calling it a testament to strong people-to-people ties. Cultural and academic collaboration was another key highlight, with a renewed focus on literature, film, heritage, sports, and higher education. Saudi Arabia welcomed Indian universities’ presence and committed to expanding media and tourism cooperation.
The two countries reaffirmed their joint commitment to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, envisioned during the Crown Prince’s visit to India in 2023. They also agreed to strengthen coordination in multilateral forums including the G20, IMF, and World Bank, especially on economic and regional security challenges.
Meanwhile, the existing MoU between the Saudi Food and Drug Authority and India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization was extended for another five years, further cementing ties in the health sector.

Content: The Centre has accelerated work on 17 major infrastructure projects worth over ₹14,096 crore across Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttarakhand, as part of its ongoing efforts to boost development and streamline project execution.
 
The projects were reviewed in a high-level meeting chaired by Amardeep Bhatia, Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), under the Project Monitoring Group (PMG) framework. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the meeting brought together senior officials from central ministries, state governments, and project developers to assess and address key implementation challenges.
 
A total of 19 issues affecting these 17 projects were taken up during the review. The discussion focused on resolving delays through stronger inter-ministerial and inter-state coordination. One of the significant projects reviewed was the four-laning of the Jaunpur-Akbarpur road, estimated at ₹3,164.72 crore. The project, which faces hurdles in two work packages, is expected to improve regional connectivity and enhance road infrastructure.
 
The meeting also focused on the development of new Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Hospitals at various locations, aiming to strengthen healthcare infrastructure in high-demand and underserved regions. These hospitals are intended to improve access to quality medical care and promote the well-being of the workforce and their families.
 
Another key project under review was the construction of a permanent campus for the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Uttarakhand at Sumari in Pauri Garhwal district. The project is designed to boost technical education and research facilities in the state. Once completed, the campus is expected to provide a modern academic environment and contribute to regional socio-economic development.
 
During the meeting, Bhatia reaffirmed the Centre’s commitment to enhancing the institutional mechanisms supporting infrastructure projects. He urged stakeholders to take a proactive role in resolving bottlenecks and encouraged private players to engage with the Project Monitoring Group platform to expedite implementation.

The wreath-laying ceremony took place at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, where the officer’s mortal remains arrived before being transported to his hometown in Karnal, Haryana.
Lieutenant Narwal, a native of Haryana, had been posted in Kochi and was on leave when tragedy struck.

His recent marriage had been a cause for celebration, with his wedding reception held just six days prior, on April 16.
The loss has left his family and community in shock. Speaking through tears, his grandfather Hawa Singh made an emotional appeal to the government to take strict action against terrorism. “We request that the government give such people (attackers) strict punishment and end terrorism by any means necessary,” he said.

Title: Pahalgam terror attack: Sketches of suspected attackers released, NIA joins probe
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 11:15:44 +0000
Content: Security agencies on Wednesday released sketches of three suspected terrorists believed to be involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam a day earlier.
The assailants—identified as Asif Fuji, Suleman Shah, and Abu Talha—are believed to be operatives of The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
According to officials, five to six terrorists wearing camouflage uniforms ambushed tourists at the scenic Baisaran meadow, a popular destination located about six kilometers from Pahalgam town. Investigators believe the attackers accessed the area through the surrounding dense pine forests.
Preliminary forensic reports and survivor testimonies suggest the terrorists used military-grade weapons and sophisticated communication equipment, pointing to external logistical support.
The attackers were dressed in traditional long shirts and loose trousers and one of them was wearing a bodycam, one security source told Reuters.
Meanwhile, a National Investigation Agency (NIA) team led by a Deputy Inspector General (DIG)-rank officer visited the attack site on Wednesday. The team is assisting the Jammu and Kashmir Police in what is being termed one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in the region in recent years.
Official sources confirmed to ANI that the NIA team will help with forensic analysis, gather critical evidence from the scene, and aid in identifying those behind the massacre.

Title: Tur procurement crosses 3.92 LMT, benefits over 2.5 lakh farmers across major producing states
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:49:12 +0000
Content: In a major boost to domestic pulse production and farmer welfare, the Government of India has procured over 3.92 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of Tur (Arhar) from key producing states under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) during the ongoing Kharif 2024-25 season. The initiative has so far benefited 2,56,517 farmers across Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana.
The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, in a statement released on Wednesday, confirmed that procurement operations are being carried out through the central nodal agencies—NAFED and NCCF—at Minimum Support Prices (MSP). The move aims to incentivize pulse production and reduce India’s dependence on imports.
To further empower farmers and ensure long-term stability in the pulse sector, the government announced in Budget 2025 that the 100% procurement policy for Tur, Urad, and Masur will continue for the next four years, until 2028-29.
Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has approved procurement of a total of 13.22 LMT of Tur in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh, the procurement period has been extended by an additional 30 days beyond the usual 90-day window, up to May 22.
Farmers are registering for procurement through the e-Samridhi portal of NAFED and the e-Samyukti portal of NCCF, allowing for a transparent and streamlined process.

Title: Sensex, Nifty extend winning streak to seventh consecutive session
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:30:27 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets extended their rally for the seventh straight session on Wednesday, driven largely by strong gains in IT stocks.
The Sensex opened on a firm note, surging 548 points to reach 80,142 and later touched an intraday high of 80,255. However, selling pressure in banking stocks dragged the index into negative territory briefly, hitting a low of 79,507. Eventually, it recovered and ended the day with a gain of 521 points at 80,116 — marking a new calendar year high. Over the past seven sessions, the Sensex has gained 8.5 per cent or 6,269 points.
Similarly, the Nifty opened strong at 24,359, dropped to a low of 24,120 during the day, and closed 162 points higher at 24,329. The benchmark index has now added 8.6 per cent or 1,930 points in the last seven trading days.
The highlight of the session was a sharp rally in IT stocks. HCL Technologies surged nearly 8 per cent after the company reported an 8.1 per cent rise in net profit and a 6.1 per cent increase in revenue for the fourth quarter, marking its best single-day gain since September 2019. Other IT majors also rallied — Tech Mahindra rose 5 per cent, Infosys gained 4 per cent, and TCS added 2.5 per cent.
Beyond IT, several heavyweights ended in the green, including Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Maruti, Nestle India, and Larsen & Toubro.
On the flip side, banking stocks witnessed profit booking. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, and Axis Bank declined between 1 to 2 per cent.
In the broader market, the BSE MidCap index advanced 1 per cent, while the SmallCap index edged up by 0.2 per cent.
Among sectoral indices, the Nifty IT index was the top performer, rising 4.3 per cent. The auto index gained 2.5 per cent, while the pharma and realty sectors rose 1.4 per cent each.
Analysts attributed the market optimism to strong global cues and robust corporate earnings.
“The positive undertone was largely driven by strong quarterly results and a rally on Wall Street, where US indices surged following reassuring remarks from President Donald Trump regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the ongoing trade negotiations with China,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity.

Title: Iran says new US energy sanctions show ‘lack of goodwill’ in Iran-US talks
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:28:36 +0000
Content: New U.S. sanctions against Iran’s energy sector point to Washington’s “lack of goodwill and seriousness” over dialogue with Tehran, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday ahead of Iran-U.S. nuclear talks this weekend.
On Tuesday, Washington targeted an Iranian liquified petroleum gas magnate with sanctions, which fall within the scope of President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and its objective to drive Iranian oil exports to zero.
“The continued imposition of sanctions against various economic sectors of Iran is in clear contradiction with the U.S. claim for dialogue and negotiation and indicates the lack of goodwill and seriousness of the U.S. in this regard,” Esmaeil Baghaei said in a statement shared on Telegram.
Both high-level and expert-level talks are to take place this Saturday in Oman to begin drawing up a framework for a potential deal over Iran’s disputed nuclear programme.
On a visit to Beijing where he met Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iran’s state media it was too early to judge the outcome of Iran-U.S. talks, which he said were going in the right direction.
“We are cautiously optimistic and if the Americans continue to stay in a constructive way and avoid any unrealistic, undoable demands, I am confident we can conclude a good deal at the end,” Iran’s top diplomat added.

Title: India, Saudi Arabia seek to conclude bilateral investment treaty negotiations soon
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:27:15 +0000
Content: India and Saudi Arabia have reaffirmed their intention to expedite negotiations for a Bilateral Investment Treaty, underscoring the growing economic cooperation between the two countries. The announcement came during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s State Visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on April 22, at the invitation of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.
 
This visit marked Prime Minister Modi’s third trip to Saudi Arabia and followed the Crown Prince’s visit to India in September 2023 for the G20 Summit and the inaugural meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council (SPC). During the latest visit, both leaders co-chaired the second meeting of the SPC, where they reviewed the progress made since the council’s launch.
 
The discussions covered a wide spectrum of bilateral relations, including defense, security, trade, energy, health, education, technology, and cultural cooperation. A key outcome of the meeting was the mutual desire to swiftly finalize a Bilateral Investment Treaty to facilitate increased investment flows between the two nations.
 
Both leaders welcomed the momentum gained through the High-Level Task Force (HLTF), established in 2024, which has played a pivotal role in enhancing cooperation in areas such as taxation, infrastructure, petrochemicals, digital infrastructure, and healthcare. The HLTF also reached understandings on collaborative projects, including plans to establish two refineries.
 
India lauded the launch of an India Desk at the Public Investment Fund (PIF), aimed at facilitating Saudi investments in India. Both sides acknowledged the contributions of the Saudi-India Investment Forum, held in New Delhi in 2023, and emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships in advancing bilateral economic interests.
 
Energy cooperation was another focal point, with both countries agreeing to work together to ensure the stability of global oil markets and expand collaboration across sectors such as crude oil supply, petrochemicals, and renewables. A joint study on electrical interconnection and collaboration in clean and green hydrogen, energy storage, and energy efficiency were among the areas discussed.
 
On the climate front, India expressed support for Saudi initiatives including the Saudi Green Initiative and Middle East Green Initiative. In return, Saudi Arabia appreciated India’s leadership in global climate action, including efforts like the International Solar Alliance and the Mission Lifestyle for Environment.
 
In addition to economic ties, both countries acknowledged the growing depth of their defense relationship. They highlighted the creation of a Ministerial Committee on Defence Cooperation and ongoing joint military exercises and training exchanges. The two leaders also emphasized their shared commitment to counter-terrorism and condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22.
 
Further cooperation was agreed upon in the fields of cybersecurity, border security, and efforts to combat transnational crime. Health cooperation was enhanced with the signing of new MoUs, including one on antimicrobial resistance and another extending the partnership on medical product regulation for five more years.
 
The two sides also signed agreements in the areas of space cooperation, postal services, and anti-doping. They acknowledged growing collaboration in education, technology, and the cultural sector, including initiatives to promote literature, performing arts, tourism, and sports.
 
Both sides reiterated their support for the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and committed to enhancing connectivity through infrastructure, port linkages, and energy interconnectivity. They also agreed to deepen coordination at international forums such as the G20, IMF, and World Bank.
 
India stands as the second-largest trading partner of Saudi Arabia, while the Kingdom ranks as India’s fifth-largest. In the financial year 2023-24, bilateral trade between the two nations reached USD 42.98 billion, with Indian exports accounting for USD 11.56 billion and imports from Saudi Arabia totaling USD 31.42 billion.

Title: India vows to bring Pahalgam attack perpetrators to justice, announces five major measures against Pakistan
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:43:23 +0000
Content: India on Wednesday vowed to bring to justice those responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack and hold their sponsors accountable, announcing a series of strong measures against Pakistan, which it accused of continuing to support terrorism in the Kashmir Valley.
 
Following a two-hour meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addressed the media and outlined several decisive steps taken in response to the attack. He said that these measures reflect the seriousness of the situation and India’s zero-tolerance approach to terrorism.
 
One of the most significant steps announced was the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. India said the treaty would remain on hold until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”
 
India also decided to close the Attari Integrated Checkpost—a key land crossing point between the two countries—effective immediately. However, Pakistani nationals who entered India with valid endorsements through this route will be allowed to return before May 1, Misri said.
 
In addition, Pakistani nationals will no longer be permitted to travel to India under the SAARC visa exemption scheme. All previously issued Specific Purpose Work Visas (SPES) to Pakistani citizens have been cancelled, and those currently in India under such visas must leave the country within 48 hours.
 
India also announced that defence, naval, and air advisors at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi have been declared persona non grata and must leave the country within a week. In a reciprocal move, India will withdraw its own defence, naval, and air advisors from its High Commission in Islamabad. These posts will be annulled in both missions.
 
Further, five support staff associated with the defence advisors in both High Commissions will also be withdrawn. The total diplomatic strength of each High Commission will be reduced from 55 to 30 by May 1.
 
The CCS was briefed in detail about the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national, and left several others injured. The Committee strongly condemned the attack and extended its deepest condolences to the families of the victims while wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.
 
It also appreciated the unity and sentiments expressed across the country in the aftermath of the attack, reflecting a collective zero-tolerance stance against terrorism.
 
Reviewing the broader security situation, the CCS directed all security forces to maintain high levels of vigilance. “The CCS resolved that the perpetrators of this attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account,” said Misri.
 
He added that, as with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India would remain relentless in its efforts to pursue individuals involved in terrorism or its planning.

Title: 25 Indians, one Nepali citizen killed in Pahalgam terror attack
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:28:13 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, held a detailed review on Wednesday of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national.
Addressing a special press conference, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that the CCS unequivocally condemned the attack and extended its deepest condolences to the families of the victims, while also wishing a speedy recovery to those injured.
“The CCS was briefed in detail on the terrorist attack that took place on April 22, 2025, in Pahalgam, in which 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen were killed. Several others sustained injuries,” Misri said.
He added that strong expressions of support and solidarity have been received from many governments across the world, all of which condemned the attack in the strongest terms. “The CCS acknowledged and appreciated these sentiments, which reflect the global resolve of zero tolerance for terrorism,” he said.
According to Misri, the CCS was also briefed on the cross-border linkages of the attack. It was noted that the incident came shortly after the peaceful conduct of elections in the Union Territory and amid its steady progress toward economic growth and development.
In response, the CCS decided on a series of retaliatory measures to send a firm message to Pakistan for its continued support of cross-border terrorism.
As part of these decisions, India will immediately suspend the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support” for terrorism. Additionally, the integrated checkpost at Attari will be closed with immediate effect. Those who have entered India through Attari with valid endorsements may return through the same route by May 1, 2025.
The government has also announced that Pakistani nationals will no longer be allowed to travel to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. Any Special Permission to Enter and Stay (SPES) visas previously issued to Pakistani nationals have been cancelled. Pakistani nationals currently in India under SPES visas have 48 hours to leave the country.
Further, the Defence, Military, Naval, and Air Advisors at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi have been declared persona non grata and must leave India within a week. The total strength of the Pakistani High Commission will be reduced from the current 55 to 30 personnel by May 1, 2025.
“These decisions underscore the seriousness with which the Government of India views this terror attack,” Misri said.

Title: Encounter Breaks Out in J&K’s Kulgam District
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:27:49 +0000
Content: A gunfight broke out between security forces and terrorists in the Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday, just hours after the Indian Army foiled an infiltration attempt along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Uri sector of Baramulla district, killing two terrorists.
 
Officials said that security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in the Tangmarg area of Kulgam following intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the region.
 
“As the security forces approached the location where the terrorists were hiding, they opened fire, triggering an encounter. The gunfight is currently underway, and additional reinforcements have been rushed to the area to prevent any escape,” a senior official said.
 
Earlier in the day, the Army’s Srinagar-based Chinar Corps posted on X that “approximately 2–3 terrorists attempted to infiltrate through the general area of Sarjeevan at Uri Nala, Baramulla,” and that “alert troops on the Line of Control (LC) challenged and intercepted them, leading to a firefight.”
 
The encounter in Kulgam and the infiltration bid in Baramulla come a day after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a brutal attack in a meadow near Pahalgam in Anantnag district, killing 26 civilians.
 
Among the victims were a Navy officer, who had recently married on April 16, and an Intelligence Bureau officer.
 
Eyewitnesses reported that a local resident, identified as Adil, attempted to confront the terrorists in a courageous effort to save the tourists. He tried to snatch a weapon from one of the attackers and was shot dead in the process.
 
A massive anti-terror operation is currently underway in the Baisaran meadow area, where the massacre took place. The operation is being supported by drones, helicopters, and other advanced electronic surveillance tools to trace and neutralize the terrorists.
 
Security forces have also released sketches of the suspects believed to be involved in the attack.
 
Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited the Baisaran meadow to assess the ongoing counter-terror operation. His visit to the site was seen as a strong message that the country is resolute in seeking justice for the victims.
 
Shah also met with the families of the slain and injured tourists, assuring them that the perpetrators, as well as those who orchestrated the attack, would be brought to justice.
 
Later, the Home Minister returned to New Delhi to brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attend a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by the Prime Minister.

Title: Cricket Australia mourns death of test opener Stackpole
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:57:21 +0000
Content: Former test opener Keith Stackpole, a key member of the Australia teams captained by Bill Lawry and Ian Chappell in the 1960s-70s, died of a suspected heart attack on Tuesday at the age of 84.
Stackpole played 43 tests and scored seven centuries from 1966-1974, forming one of Australia’s top opening combinations with Victoria teammate Lawry.
An aggressive shot-maker with a love for hooking fast bowlers, Stackpole topped the runs list during Australia’s successful tour of India in 1969 – the nation’s last series win in the subcontinent until 2004.
He made a career-best 207 against England at the Gabba in 1970 and often proved a thorn in the side of Australia’s Ashes rivals.
A handy leg-spin bowler, Stackpole played in the first-ever one-day international against England in 1971, taking 3-40 in the 40-over match to guide Australia to a five-wicket win at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Named one of Wisden’s ‘Cricketers of the Year’ in 1973, Stackpole became a successful broadcaster after retiring from the game in 1974.
His death triggered tributes from former players and broadcasters on Wednesday.
“Very sad news indeed. Stacky was a fantastic cricketer but more so a great bloke and one hell of a cricket coach,” former Australia test bowler Merv Hughes wrote on X.
Cricket Australia Chairman Mike Baird said Stackpole would be sorely missed.
“Keith was one of the great contributors to the game of cricket and his legacy will live long into the future,” Baird said in a statement.
“Not only was he an outstanding player for Australia and Victoria, his work in the media, radio and TV commentary and as a mentor to many players who followed in his footsteps demonstrated his enduring passion and influence in the game.”

Title: PM Modi’s Saudi visit strengthens strategic partnership; boosts defence, energy, and trade cooperation
Publication Date: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:12:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Saudi Arabia has given a strong push to bilateral ties, with significant strides in defence, energy, trade, and cultural cooperation. As part of the visit, India and Saudi Arabia expanded the Strategic Partnership Council by adding two new ministerial committees—on defence cooperation and on tourism and culture—signifying a maturing and multidimensional relationship.
This marked PM Modi’s third visit to the Kingdom, undertaken at the invitation of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. However, the visit was cut short following the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Despite this, the two leaders co-chaired the second meeting of the Strategic Partnership Council and reviewed the progress of bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
The Council now includes four ministerial committees, reflecting the growing depth of engagement. Both leaders agreed to convene the next council meeting at a mutually convenient time.
India and Saudi Arabia welcomed the steady growth in bilateral trade. India is now Saudi Arabia’s second-largest trading partner, while Saudi Arabia ranks as India’s fifth-largest. Both countries agreed to expedite negotiations on the India-GCC Free Trade Agreement and fast-track the Bilateral Investment Treaty. Several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were also signed, covering areas such as healthcare, postal services, space cooperation, and anti-doping.
In line with their respective national goals—Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia and Viksit Bharat 2047 for India—the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to working together for shared prosperity.
Defence emerged as a key area of collaboration, with the launch of a dedicated ministerial committee. The leaders highlighted the success of recent joint military exercises such as SADA TANSEEQ and AL MOHED AL HINDI, and welcomed the initiation of tri-service staff-level talks. The two nations also pledged to strengthen defence industrial partnerships.
They jointly condemned terrorism in all its forms, including the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and rejected any link between terrorism and religion, race, or culture. The leaders called for dismantling terrorism infrastructure globally and bringing perpetrators to justice.
The two nations agreed to deepen cooperation in conventional and clean energy sectors, including oil, renewables, and green hydrogen. A joint study on an electricity interconnection project is currently underway. They also plan to collaborate on crude oil supply, refining, grid security, and energy efficiency.
Both sides reiterated their commitment to climate action under the Paris Agreement, focusing on reducing emissions. India appreciated Saudi Arabia’s initiatives such as the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative.
PM Modi praised the Saudi government for ensuring the welfare of the 2.7 million Indian nationals living in the Kingdom, calling it a testament to strong people-to-people ties. Cultural and academic collaboration was another key highlight, with a renewed focus on literature, film, heritage, sports, and higher education. Saudi Arabia welcomed Indian universities’ presence and committed to expanding media and tourism cooperation.
The two countries reaffirmed their joint commitment to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, envisioned during the Crown Prince’s visit to India in 2023. They also agreed to strengthen coordination in multilateral forums including the G20, IMF, and World Bank, especially on economic and regional security challenges.
Meanwhile, the existing MoU between the Saudi Food and Drug Authority and India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization was extended for another five years, further cementing ties in the health sector.

Content: India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) following the recent terror attack in Pahalgam marks a significant diplomatic escalation in its response to cross-border terrorism. On Tuesday, terrorists killed 26 tourists at the Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir—a brutal strike that has become one of the deadliest in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama attack. In response, the Ministry of External Affairs announced strong retaliatory measures, including putting the IWT in abeyance “with immediate effect” until Pakistan “credibly and irreversibly abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”
Signed in 1960, the Indus Waters Treaty is considered a landmark international agreement between India and Pakistan. It was negotiated with the help of the World Bank and allocates the eastern rivers of the Indus system (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India, and the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) to Pakistan. Although Pakistan receives roughly 80% of the total water from the system, India is permitted limited use of the western rivers for non-consumptive needs such as irrigation, transport, and hydropower. The treaty includes dispute resolution mechanisms ranging from a bilateral Permanent Indus Commission to international arbitration.
Despite multiple conflicts between India and Pakistan, the IWT has endured and is widely regarded as a rare and successful example of sustained cooperation in South Asia. Former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower even described the treaty as “one bright spot” in a troubled region. However, the treaty has not been immune to strain. India has long expressed dissatisfaction with the pact, especially during periods of heightened terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the 2016 Uri attack, famously stated, “Rakt aur paani ek saath nahin beh sakta” (blood and water cannot flow together).
India’s grievances with Pakistan include repeated objections raised by Islamabad over hydropower projects such as Kishanganga and Ratle in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan has argued that these projects violate treaty terms, while India maintains they are fully compliant. In September 2024, India formally notified Pakistan of its intent to amend the treaty, indicating a shift in its long-standing posture.
Following the Pahalgam attack, India’s move to suspend the treaty adds a new dimension to this strained water-sharing relationship. Additionally, India expelled Pakistan’s military, naval, and air advisors from the High Commission in New Delhi, declaring them persona non grata. India will also withdraw its corresponding advisors from Islamabad, and five support staff members from each side will also return home. The Integrated Check Post at Attari has been closed with immediate effect.
Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif accused India of exploiting a terror incident to dismantle a treaty it has long sought to evade. He posted portions of the treaty on social media, arguing that India’s action violates its binding legal obligations. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had convened the National Security Committee to respond to India’s decisions. Other Pakistani leaders, including National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and former Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, condemned the suspension as politically motivated and a breach of international law, claiming it would disproportionately harm Pakistani farmers.
International experts have expressed concern as well. Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that the treaty has served as a valuable confidence-building measure between the two countries. Its suspension, he said, is unprecedented and represents a major setback for regional water diplomacy.

Title: AIIMS Raipur becomes first among newer AIIMS and government hospitals in Chhattisgarh to perform first swap kidney transplant
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 07:17:34 +0000
Content: AIIMS Raipur has successfully conducted its first Swap Kidney Transplant, also known as Kidney Paired Donation (KPD), becoming the first among the newer AIIMS institutions and the first government hospital in Chhattisgarh to perform this advanced and life-saving procedure.
The transplant, conducted under the guidance of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, marks a significant milestone in expanding access to advanced medical care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
A life-saving exchange
Swap Kidney Transplant is a procedure where two incompatible patient-donor pairs exchange kidneys to ensure compatibility. In this case, two ESRD patients from Bilaspur, aged 39 and 41, had been undergoing dialysis for three years. Their wives volunteered as donors, but blood group incompatibilities (B+ with O+, and O+ with B+) made direct donations impossible.
To overcome this, the AIIMS Raipur transplant team coordinated a successful donor swap between the two couples. The surgeries were performed on March 15, and all four individuals—both donors and recipients—are currently recovering well in the Transplant ICU.
Leading the Way in Transplant Innovation
The surgery was led by a multidisciplinary team comprising Transplant Physician Dr. Vinay Rathore; Transplant Surgeons Dr. Amit R. Sharma, Dr. Deepak Biswal, and Dr. Satyadeo Sharma; Anaesthesiologists Dr. Subrat Singha, Dr. Mayank, Dr. Jitendra, and Dr. Sarita Ramchandani; along with dedicated transplant coordinators, OT staff, and transplant nursing teams.
This milestone highlights AIIMS Raipur’s growing role in the development of organ transplantation in the region. The institute was also the first among newer AIIMS to start Deceased Donor Organ Donation and Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation. Furthermore, it is the first in Chhattisgarh to carry out Deceased Donor Paediatric Kidney Transplants.
To date, AIIMS Raipur has performed 54 kidney transplants with a graft survival rate of 95% and patient survival rate of 97%, showcasing its excellence in renal care and transplantation.
National Implications
Swap transplants are known to boost the total number of kidney transplants by nearly 15%, a potential recognized by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). The organisation has recommended implementing swap donation programmes across all states and Union Territories. It also plans to launch a “One Nation, One Swap Transplant” policy to streamline and scale this life-saving initiative nationwide.

Title: India summons Pakistan envoy, expels military attachés after Pahalgam attack
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:53:03 +0000
Content: In a decisive diplomatic response to the brutal terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir’s Pahalgam, India on Wednesday summoned Pakistan’s top diplomat in New Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, and formally declared all Pakistani military attachés posted in India Persona Non Grata, sources confirmed.
The move follows the killing of 26 civilians in an attack widely attributed to the Pakistan-based terror group, The Resistance Front—an incident Prime Minister Narendra Modi described as a “cowardly assault on innocent lives.”
High-level security meeting triggers strong measures
Following a two-hour meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by Prime Minister Modi and attended by key ministers including Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, and S. Jaishankar, the government announced a series of sweeping retaliatory actions targeting Pakistan’s diplomatic, military, and economic ties with India.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed that Pakistan’s Defence, Military, Naval, and Air advisors at its High Commission in Delhi must leave the country within a week. India will also withdraw its corresponding military attachés and supporting staff from Islamabad.
Suspension of Indus waters treaty, border closures
In a historic first, India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, citing Pakistan’s failure to curb cross-border terrorism. The MEA said the suspension will remain until Islamabad takes “verifiable and irreversible steps” to end terror support.
Further tightening its stance, India has ordered the closure of the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari, a crucial land link. Pakistani nationals currently in India with valid documents have until May 1 to exit the country. After that, all land travel between the two nations will be indefinitely suspended.
Visa scheme revoked, diplomatic staff cut
In another major move, India has withdrawn Pakistan’s access to the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). All existing SVES visas issued to Pakistani citizens stand cancelled, with a 48-hour deadline given to those currently in India to leave.
Additionally, both countries will reduce the strength of their High Commissions from 55 to 30 personnel by May 1, as part of a reciprocal drawdown in diplomatic engagement.
Heightened Security, Global Accountability Push
The CCS has instructed Indian armed forces and intelligence agencies to maintain maximum vigilance in the wake of continuing threats. A new National Investigation Agency (NIA) team has been deployed to Pahalgam as part of the intensified search for those responsible.
Reiterating its zero-tolerance policy on terrorism, India pledged to hold not only the perpetrators but also their backers accountable. Officials pointed to recent extradition efforts, including that of Tahawwur Rana, as examples of India’s determination to bring global terror operatives to justice.

Title: Aid funding disrupts child vaccinations almost as much as pandemic, says UN
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:45:35 +0000
Content: Global aid funding cuts, led by the United States, are disrupting efforts to vaccinate children against deadly diseases almost as much as the COVID-19 pandemic did, the United Nations said on Thursday.
Outbreaks of infectious diseases, including measles, meningitis and yellow fever, have been increasing globally.
Emergency and routine vaccinations meanwhile were significantly affected in nearly half of countries at the start of April due to the funding cuts, according to reports from World Health Organization offices in 108 largely low and lower-middle income countries.
Cuts to funding also reduced vaccine supplies and hampered disease surveillance, the WHO and UNICEF said in a joint release with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“Setbacks (are) at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19. We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable disease,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director.
COVID-19 caused what was called the largest backslide in childhood vaccination in a generation, and aid funding cuts, led by the U.S. – formerly the world’s largest donor – risked the same outcome, the joint release said.
They called for funding for childhood immunisation to be maintained ahead of Gavi’s funding round, which will be launched in June. The group is seeking $9 billion for its work from 2026-2030.
Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s chief executive officer, said it was possible to fight the rise of infectious diseases but only if the group is fully funded.
Measles cases have increased year-on-year since 2021, while meningitis surged in Africa last year and yellow fever cases also rose after declines in the last decade, the agencies said.
Last month, an internal U.S. government document showed it would follow its cuts to UNICEF and the WHO, part of wider plans to streamline and focus foreign aid to align with the “America First” policy, by cancelling its contribution of around $300 million annually to Gavi.
Last week, the U.S. State Department told Reuters it had nominated Mark Lloyd, assistant administrator for global health, to Gavi’s 28-person board. The U.S. seat had previously been vacant.
Both the U.S. State Department and Gavi declined to comment about what this could mean for U.S. funding.

Title: U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent calls China tariffs unsustainable as Washington eyes de-escalation
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:28:39 +0000
Content: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that high tariffs between the United States and China are not sustainable, as President Donald Trump’s administration signaled openness to de-escalating a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has raised fears of recession.
U.S. stocks rallied on hopes that the two countries might lower the steep trade barriers they have erected over the past month, though there was no sign that negotiations might start anytime soon.
Bessent said the tariffs – 145% on Chinese products and 125% on U.S. products – would have to come down before trade talks can proceed, but said Trump would not make that move unilaterally.
“Neither side believes that these are sustainable levels. As I said yesterday, this is the equivalent of an embargo and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone’s interest,” Bessent told reporters.
The White House is open to discussing a significant rate cut on Chinese imports in order to advance negotiations with Beijing but will not do so alone, according to a person familiar with the conversations. That person would not say how low the White House might be willing to go, but the Wall Street Journal reported the figure could be as low as 50%.
A White House spokesperson dismissed any reports as “pure speculation,” and said news on tariffs would come from Trump himself.
“We are going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters, but did not outline any specifics.
The tariff levels outlined in the Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world’s two largest economies. German shipper Hapag-Lloyd said Wednesday that 30% of its U.S.-bound shipments from China have been canceled.
Separate talks between the two countries over tackling the fentanyl epidemic have not yielded results so far, sources say.
The apparent U.S. softening on China tariffs was a welcome sign for markets battered by Trump’s erratic trade policies. The benchmark S&P 500 finished the day 1.67% higher at 5,375.86, but is still more than 12% below its February record close.
“It’s about all of the political and policy uncertainty and what it could mean for the economy in the near term,” said Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
SEEKING CLARITY
Bessent said the third quarter of this year is a “reasonable estimate” for achieving clarity on the ultimate level of Trump’s tariffs.
In addition to the steep tariffs on China, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all other U.S. imports and higher duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That has roiled financial markets and raised fears of recession.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration said in a Federal Register post that it had launched a probe into whether imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts for them pose a national security risk, a precursor to imposing tariffs on them.
At the same time, Trump is planning to spare carmakers from some tariffs, The Financial Times reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The move would exempt car parts from the tariffs Trump is imposing on China over fentanyl and also from tariffs on steel and aluminum, the report said.
The European Union, which Trump has threatened with 20% tariffs, would respond with countertariffs if it cannot reach a deal with the United States before the July 9 deadline, economy minister Valdis Dombrovskis said on Wednesday. He said the 27-member trade bloc has offered to buy more liquefied natural gas from the United States and reduce tariffs on certain goods.
Other countries are looking to negotiate as well. Vietnam’s trade minister spoke to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday, state media reported.
Twelve states, including New York, Arizona and Illinois, filed suit against the Trump administration on Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade claiming that tariffs established through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. The states joined California, which filed a separate suit against the government last week, in challenging the tariffs.
The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday the tariffs will slow growth and push debt higher across the globe. S&P Global found that U.S. business activity slowed to a 16-month low in April while prices charged for goods and services soared.
The Federal Reserve said it found economic activity in the United States to be steady over the past month, despite “pervasive” uncertainty around trade. The central bank’s survey found a drop in international visitors in some areas, and the outlook in several of the Fed’s 12 regional districts “worsened considerably.”
A Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans souring on Trump’s economic performance. Just 37% of respondents approve of his handling of the economy, down from 42% when he took office in January.

Title: Soldier killed in encounter with terrorists in J-K’s Udhampur
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:23:23 +0000
Content: An Indian Army soldier was killed in a gunfight with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir’s Udhampur district, police said on Thursday.
According to a statement from the Indian Army’s White Knight Corps, a joint operation was initiated with local Jammu and Kashmir security units. “Contact was established, and a fierce firefight ensued. One of our Bravehearts sustained grievous injuries in the initial exchange and later succumbed despite the best medical efforts,” the Corps posted on X (formerly Twitter).
The exchange of fire between the security forces and terrorists is still underway in the dense forested terrain of Basantgarh. Further details are awaited as the operation continues to unfold.
In a separate but related operation, joint security forces—comprising the Indian Army’s Romeo Force and the Jammu and Kashmir Police’s Special Operations Group (SOG)—have been engaged in a counter-terror operation for the 10th consecutive day in the forested region of Lasana in Poonch district.
The operation in Lasana was launched on April 15, a day after an initial gunfight erupted on April 14. Security personnel have cordoned off the area and are conducting extensive searches across the dense forests, where terrorists are believed to be hiding. One security personnel sustained injuries during an exchange of fire near Lasana village, located on the National Highway connecting Poonch to Jammu.
These heightened operations come in the wake of a brutal terrorist attack on April 22 in the Baisaran meadow area of Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of 26 tourists. This attack is considered one of the deadliest in the Kashmir Valley since the 2019 Pulwama bombing that killed 40 CRPF personnel.

Title: Pahalgam terror attack: Woman holds on to bloodstained jacket – the only memory of slain husband
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 06:10:21 +0000
Content: In the aftermath of the horrific Pahalgam terror attack, BJP Yuva Morcha National President and Member of Parliament Tejasvi Surya recounted the tragic stories of the victims’ families, whom he accompanied on the flight carrying the mortal remains from Srinagar to Bengaluru.
Speaking to the media at Bengaluru International Airport, Surya shared the poignant moment involving Pallavi, the wife of Manjunath Rao, one of the three victims from Karnataka. Manjunath was shot dead in front of his wife during the attack. Clutching onto her husband’s bloodstained jacket, Pallavi told Surya she would never wash it—it was the last tangible memory of the man she lost.
He recalled how Manjunath’s son, Abhi, had recently scored 96% in his Class 12 exams and was celebrating his success with the family’s first vacation. “He told me with tears in his eyes that it was also the first and last flight his father ever took,” Surya said.
Surya also spoke of the three-year-old son of Bharat Bhushan, another victim of the attack, who remains unaware that his father is never coming home. “The child, too young to grasp the tragedy, kept pointing at airplanes outside the window and showing them to his newly widowed mother. She handed him a mobile phone to distract him,” he said.
Calling the attack “one of the most barbaric and cowardly in recent memory,” Surya described the anguish of families trying to shield elderly members from the devastating news.
“The Government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has already initiated steps in response. We ensured the safe return of the mortal remains and family members with support from the Union Home Ministry, local authorities, and the Karnataka government,” he stated.
Surya reaffirmed his faith in the Indian Army and security forces, saying, “Our forces will respond in a language the enemy understands—at a time and place of their choosing. As citizens, we must trust and stand by them.”
He added: “In this moment of grief, the nation stands united with the bereaved families. Their pain is our pain, and justice will be delivered.”

Title: A new era for Indian sports: nurturing talent, honouring heroes
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 05:18:12 +0000
Content: India’s sporting ambitions continue to soar as the government ramps up support for athletes with a significant budgetary push and a comprehensive framework of welfare initiatives. For FY 2025–26, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has been allocated a record Rs. 3,794 crore—marking a 17% increase from the revised estimates of the previous fiscal year. This includes Rs. 1,000 crore earmarked for the flagship Khelo India programme, Rs. 830 crore for the Sports Authority of India (SAI), and Rs. 400 crore to strengthen National Sports Federations (NSFs), according to an official statement from the Ministry.
These allocations come on the back of what has been hailed as a golden decade for Indian sports. From podium finishes at the Olympics and Paralympics to rising dominance in disciplines such as wrestling, boxing, badminton, and athletics, India’s athletes have made their mark globally.
A framework built for every stage of an athlete’s journey
India’s approach to sports development is increasingly structured and inclusive. At its heart is the Khelo India – National Programme for Development of Sports, launched in 2016-17, aimed at reviving sports culture at the grassroots and creating a strong talent pipeline across the country. The programme is designed to establish India as a global sporting powerhouse.
For athletes who retire from active competition, the Retired Sportsperson Empowerment Training (RESET) Programme, launched in 2024, offers education, internships, and reskilling opportunities in areas such as coaching, sports administration, and mentoring.
The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons (PDUNWFS) provides crucial financial support, including: one-time ex-gratia aid up to Rs. 5 lakh, a monthly pension of Rs. 5,000, medical assistance up to Rs. 10 lakh, financial relief of up to Rs. 10 lakh for training or competition-related injuries and aid to families of deceased sportspersons and support personnel.
To further bolster India’s sporting human capital, the Human Resources Development in Sports (HRDS) scheme promotes training, research, and global exposure in sports sciences, coaching, and medicine. This initiative also supports expert visits, the development of sports literature, and digital resources.
Inclusivity at the Core
The government’s vision for sports includes everyone. The Sports and Games for the Disabled scheme ensures that persons with disabilities have access to participative sports opportunities, especially at the grassroots level. While elite para-athletes receive separate support under the NSFs, this scheme aims to broaden the base of participation across schools and communities.
Similarly, the Panchayat Yuva Krida aur Khel Abhiyan (PYKKA) focuses on building sports infrastructure and organizing competitions at village, block, and state levels—especially in rural India. It promotes mass participation and supports operational costs, equipment procurement, and honorariums for volunteers.
Athlete Support and Recognition
The Assistance to National Sports Federations (ANSF) ensures funding for athlete training, international participation, foreign coaching staff, and scientific support. Complementing this is the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF), which draws from both public and private resources to address infrastructure gaps and provide elite athletes with world-class training and exposure.
For those who have brought glory to the nation, the Pension Scheme for Meritorious Sportspersons provides long-term financial security. The pension structure includes: Rs. 20,000/month for Olympic, Paralympic, and Deaflympic medallists, Rs. 16,000/month for gold medallists in world championships and Rs. 14,000–Rs. 12,000/month for other international achievements.
India also honours its sporting icons through the National Sports Awards, the country’s highest sporting recognition across six categories. These awards celebrate outstanding achievements, sportsmanship, and the indomitable spirit of athletes representing India on global platforms.

Title: Trump and Zelenskiy clash again and US warns it could abandon Ukraine talks
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 05:14:18 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy clashed again on Wednesday on efforts to end the three-year-old war in Ukraine, with the U.S. leader chiding Zelenskiy for refusing to recognize Russia’s occupation of Crimea.
Trump’s Vice President JD Vance said it was time for Russia and Ukraine to either agree to a U.S. peace proposal “or for the United States to walk away from this process,” echoing a warning from Trump last week.
Speaking to reporters in India, Vance said the proposal called for freezing territorial lines “at some level close to where they are today” and a “long-term diplomatic settlement that hopefully will lead to long-term peace.”
“The only way to really stop the killing is for the armies to both put down their weapons, to freeze this thing,” he said.
A former Western official familiar with the U.S. proposal said it also called for the recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Since taking office in January, Trump has upended U.S. policy toward the war in Ukraine, pressing Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire while easing pressure on Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022.
Zelenskiy on Tuesday reiterated that Ukraine would never cede Crimea to Russia, which seized control of the peninsula in 2014 in a move that was condemned internationally. “There’s nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution,” he said.
Trump, who argued with Zelenskiy in a disastrous Oval Office meeting in March, called this an inflammatory statement that made peace harder to achieve. He said in a social media post that Crimea was lost years ago “and is not even a point of discussion.”
Zelenskiy acknowledged later in an X post that the London talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials were marked by high emotions but expressed hope that future joint work would lead to peace.
He pledged again that Ukraine would abide by its constitution and said he was sure Kyiv’s partners, in particular the United States, “will act in line with its strong decisions.”
He attached to his post a 2018 Crimea Declaration from Mike Pompeo, Trump’s secretary of state during his first term, which said: “The United States rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.”
Trump, who promised during his election campaign to end the war within his first 24 hours back in the White House, scolded Zelenskiy and said on Truth Social the U.S. was trying to stop the killing in Ukraine and that they were “very close to a deal” for peace.
Trump told reporters later he thought the London talks had gone “pretty well,” although he also said, in apparent reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy: “We’ve got to get two people, two strong people, two smart people, to agree. And as soon as they agree, the killing will stop.”
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cancelled his trip to attend the London talks, prompting cancellation of a broader meeting with foreign ministers from Ukraine, Britain, France and Germany and underscoring the gaps between Washington, Kyiv and its European allies over how to end the war.
TRUMP’S ‘PATIENCE IS RUNNING VERY THIN’
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters Trump is “frustrated” with the pace of talks and that Zelenskiy “seems to be moving in the wrong direction.”
Several sources have said proposals from Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff include not only recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea, but accepting Russia’s control of the 20% of Ukraine’s territory it has gained in the war, ruling out Ukrainian membership of NATO and lifting of Western sanctions.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg said on X that there were positive talks in London with Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and added: “It’s time to move forward on President Trump’s UKR-RU war directive: stop the killing, achieve peace, and put America First.”
Trump raised the pressure on Sunday when he said he hoped Moscow and Kyiv would make a deal this week to end the conflict.
At the heart of Wednesday’s talks was an attempt to establish what Kyiv could possibly accept after Witkoff presented proposals to a similar session in Paris last week. Three diplomats said those proposals appeared to demand more concessions from Ukraine than Russia.
TRUMP ENVOY EXPECTED TO MEET PUTIN ON FRIDAY
Witkoff is expected to meet Putin again on Friday, a U.S. official told Reuters.
Witkoff has already met Putin three times to discuss prospects for an end to the war and will visit Moscow this week for a new round of talks, the White House said earlier.
Since Trump expressed his desire to broker peace in Ukraine and made a surprise call to Putin in February, European nations have scrambled to find ways to support Kyiv against Moscow while keeping the U.S. onside.
A joint statement from Britain, France and Germany after the London talks said all parties had reiterated strong support for Trump’s “commitment to stopping the killing and achieving a just and lasting peace.”
It said “significant progress was made on reaching a common position on next steps” and “all agreed to continue their close coordination and looked forward to further talks soon.”

Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday briefed President Droupadi Murmu on the incident and the government’s immediate response. The high-level update coincided with a flurry of diplomatic activity at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) headquarters in South Block, where top foreign envoys were given detailed briefings on the situation.
The government has launched a coordinated diplomatic outreach to inform key international partners about the attack, which claimed several civilian lives, including that of a foreign national. The incident has drawn strong condemnation from Indian leadership and the global community.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri led the diplomatic briefings, engaging ambassadors and senior diplomats from major nations including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Norway. These sessions were aimed at conveying India’s assessment of the situation on the ground and the steps being taken to counter the terror threat.
Among the early attendees was EU envoy Herve Delphin, who met with Misri for a 30-minute session. Russian Ambassador Denis Alipov and diplomats from Gulf nations, including the UAE, Qatar, and Oman, also participated. Diplomats from Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, were similarly briefed.
In a significant development, Chinese Ambassador Xu Feihong attended a dedicated briefing at the MEA. His presence underscored India’s intent to rally regional and global support against cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.
External Affairs Minister Jaishankar also visited the MEA headquarters during the briefings, highlighting the importance India attaches to this diplomatic exercise. Officials stated that each session lasted around 30 minutes and covered India’s security posture, intelligence assessments, and ongoing counter-terror operations.
According to government sources, the objective was not only to update foreign missions on the attack but also to ensure international alignment on counterterrorism efforts—especially with nations that share intelligence and security cooperation frameworks with India.
The Pahalgam terror attack has prompted widespread condemnation worldwide. India’s swift and coordinated diplomatic response is being viewed as an effort to isolate terror sponsors and reinforce its zero-tolerance stance on terrorism.

Content: The Indian telecom sector witnessed stable financial performance with marginal subscriber decline in the quarter ending December 31, 2024, according to the “Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicator Report” released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Thursday.
As per the report, the total number of internet subscribers in the country stood at 970.16 million at the end of December, registering a slight dip from 971.50 million in the previous quarter—a decline of 0.14%. Of these, 928.96 million were wireless internet users, while 41.21 million were wired subscribers. Despite the overall fall in internet subscribers, the broadband segment continued to grow, reaching 944.96 million users, up by 0.06% from the previous quarter. Narrowband subscribers, however, dropped to 25.20 million.
The report showed strong growth in wireline connections, which rose by 6.32% over the previous quarter to 39.27 million. This represents a year-on-year growth of 23.32%. Wireline tele-density also increased from 2.63% in September 2024 to 2.79% by December.
The sector’s revenue indicators demonstrated a steady upward trajectory. Gross Revenue (GR) for the quarter stood at ₹96,390 crore, while the Applicable Gross Revenue (ApGR) and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) were ₹92,342 crore and ₹77,934 crore respectively. These figures reflect quarterly increases of 5.43%, 4.65%, and 3.48%, respectively. Compared to the same quarter the previous year, GR, ApGR, and AGR grew by 14.07%, 13.86%, and 14.89%.
The Monthly Average Revenue per User (ARPU) for wireless services also saw a rise, increasing by 5.34% to ₹181.80 from ₹172.57 in the previous quarter. Prepaid ARPU was reported at ₹180.91 and postpaid at ₹191.51. Meanwhile, the average Minutes of Usage (MOU) per subscriber per month rose by 3.62%, reaching 1,009 minutes.
Access services remained the largest contributor to AGR, accounting for 84.35% of the sector’s total. Within this category, the revenue indicators—Gross Revenue, ApGR, and AGR—along with License Fee, Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), and Pass-Through Charges, all posted quarter-on-quarter increases, ranging from 4.28% to 5.96%. The License Fee collected during the quarter stood at ₹6,234 crore, up 3.50% from the previous quarter and 14.75% higher year-on-year.

Title: Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya launches sports certificate issuance via DigiLocker; inaugurates NCSSR
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:52:50 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports and Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, on Thursday launched the issuance of sports certificates through DigiLocker, marking a major step towards digital empowerment of athletes. The launch event was held at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi.
Earlier in the day, the Minister also inaugurated the National Centre for Sports Science and Research (NCSSR) at the same venue, which is poised to become a hub for high-level research and innovation aimed at improving elite athlete performance.
Highlighting the government’s athlete-first approach, Dr. Mandaviya said, “Every initiative under the Modi Government is centered around the welfare of sportspersons.” He cited the Draft National Sports Governance Bill 2024, the Draft National Sports Policy 2024, and the Draft National Code Against Age Fraud in Sports (NCAAFS) 2025 as recent examples of efforts to bring transparency and good governance in Indian sports.
The DigiLocker-based certificate issuance will soon be integrated with the National Sports Repository System (NSRS), enabling automatic disbursal of cash rewards directly into athletes’ bank accounts via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). “When the world has witnessed an athlete win a medal, they shouldn’t have to apply for their reward. This system ensures they receive what they deserve without delay or paperwork,” he added.
Dr. Mandaviya also shared key highlights of India’s future sporting ambitions, including a bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games and the 2030 Commonwealth Games. He urged National Sports Federations (NSFs) to ensure athlete welfare and emphasized the need for collective responsibility between federations, athletes, and the government to create a robust sporting ecosystem.
As part of this effort, he announced that office space at IG Stadium would be made available to interested NSFs. He also revealed plans for a ‘One Sport–One Corporate’ policy to enhance private sector support for Indian sports and proposed Olympic training centres for priority disciplines under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.
On the newly inaugurated NCSSR, Dr. Mandaviya stated that the facility would play a vital role in fulfilling India’s long-term sporting vision under “Viksit Bharat by 2047.”
Olympic silver medallist and Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna awardee Mirabai Chanu praised the DigiLocker initiative, calling it a “stress-reliever” for athletes. “Often, we don’t carry all documents with us while traveling for competitions. With certificates available digitally, it’ll save us time and trouble. I thank the Minister on behalf of all athletes,” she said.

Title: Golf: Inaugural India Championship joins 2025 race to Dubai
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:32:19 +0000
Content: The India Championship, a new addition to the DP World Tour calendar, will debut at the historic Delhi Golf Club from October 16 to 19, 2025. Co-sanctioned with the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), the tournament becomes part of the ‘Back 9’ series on the 2025 Race to Dubai—the second phase of the season following the ‘Global Swings’.
With a record purse of USD 4 million, the India Championship becomes the richest golf tournament ever held in the country, underscoring India’s growing stature as a destination for elite global golf.
This announcement follows the success of the 2025 Indian Open—won by Spain’s Eugenio Chacarra—and further cements the DP World Tour’s momentum in the region. The event also marks the Tour’s return to Delhi Golf Club for the first time since 2016.
Steeped in history, the Lodhi Course at Delhi Golf Club was established in the 1930s and hosted the inaugural Indian Open in 1964. It was redesigned by five-time Open Champion Peter Thomson in 1977, with further enhancements by Gary Player Design in 2019.
DP World, the Tour’s title partner since 2022, is reaffirming its commitment to the sport through this tournament. The India Championship complements DP World’s broader sporting engagement in India, including its partnership with the Delhi Capitals and grassroots initiatives such as the ‘Second Life’ container programme and ‘Balls for Birdies’ campaign.
Rizwan Soomar, CEO and Managing Director, Middle East, North Africa & India Subcontinent at DP World, said:
“As a long-term partner of the Tour, we are thrilled to announce the DP World India Championship. We are committed to growing golf in India, and with our global network and expertise, we aim to elevate the sport while driving community impact.”
Ben Cowen, Chief Tournament and Operations Officer of the DP World Tour, added:
“We are excited to deepen our relationship with Indian golf through the launch of the DP World India Championship. Our thanks to DP World and the Delhi Golf Club for making this possible. We look forward to showcasing world-class golf at such an iconic venue.”
Kapil Dev, President of PGTI, hailed the tournament as a milestone for Indian golf:
“The DP World India Championship is a landmark moment. It offers Indian professionals a chance to compete with some of the world’s best, helping raise the standard of the sport nationally and globally.”
Raj Khosla, President of the Delhi Golf Club, highlighted the uniqueness of the venue:
“We are proud to host this world-class tournament at a course that blends sporting excellence with historical grandeur. The Lodhi-era monuments surrounding the course create a magical setting unlike any other.”
The DP World India Championship will be the eighth of nine tournaments in the ‘Back 9’ phase, leading to the DP World Tour Play-Offs and culminating at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai at Jumeirah Golf Estates.

Title: If villages are strong, India will develop faster: PM Modi on launching Rs 13,480-crore projects in Bihar
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:23:08 +0000
Content: On the occasion of National Panchayati Raj Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a massive public gathering in Bihar’s Madhubani district and inaugurated a series of development projects spanning railways, infrastructure, LPG, and rural empowerment—collectively worth over ₹13,480 crore.
The event began on a solemn note, with the Prime Minister urging the crowd to observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the April 22 Pahalgam attack. He also paid tribute to national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar on his death anniversary.
“Before we speak of development, let us remember those who were taken from us. Let’s pay our respects with silence,” he said.
Emphasising the importance of self-governance at the village level, PM Modi reflected on Mahatma Gandhi’s vision that strong villages are the cornerstone of national progress.
“If the villages of India are strong, the country will develop faster. This is the soul of Panchayati Raj,” he stated.
Highlighting his government’s rural initiatives over the past decade, Modi said more than two lakh Gram Panchayats have been connected to the Internet, 5.5 lakh Common Service Centres set up in rural areas, 30,000 Panchayat Bhawans constructed, and ₹2 lakh crore allocated to Panchayat funds.
“Today, Panchayats can issue certificates such as birth, death, and land records digitally. Technology has brought transparency and efficiency to grassroots governance,” the Prime Minister added.
He praised Bihar for being the first state to provide 50% reservation to women in Panchayats, calling it a powerful example of real social justice.
“Thousands of our sisters and daughters from marginalised communities are now decision-makers. This is the true strength of democracy,” he said.
Modi also highlighted the success of the ‘Jeevika Didi’ self-help group movement and announced fresh financial assistance of ₹1,000 crore for women-led SHGs in Bihar.
He laid the foundation stone and inaugurated various projects in rail connectivity, including new lines and express services such as the Amrit Bharat and NaMo Bharat trains.
Among key initiatives, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for an LPG bottling plant at Hathua block in Gopalganj district, a ₹340 crore project aimed at enhancing bulk LPG transportation and streamlining the supply chain.
He also launched projects worth ₹1,170 crore in the power sector, and ₹5,030 crore under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme to strengthen power infrastructure.
Modi flagged off several new trains, including the Amrit Bharat Express between Saharsa and Mumbai and the Namo Bharat Rapid Rail between Jaynagar and Patna. He also launched regional rail connections such as Pipra–Saharsa–Samastipur, Supaul–Pipra, and Hasanpur–Bithan rail lines, along with rail overbridges in Chapra and Bagaha, and dedicated the Khagaria–Alauli rail line to the nation.
Under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), the Prime Minister distributed ₹930 crore under the Community Investment Fund to over two lakh SHGs in Bihar.
Connecting the day’s initiatives to Bihar’s rich legacy, he said, “The entire country is connected to the soil of Mithila. The work launched today will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the region.”
As part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), 1.5 lakh families in Bihar received new pucca homes. Approval letters for new houses were handed over to 15 lakh families nationwide, including 3.5 lakh from Bihar. Financial assistance was disbursed to 10 lakh poor families across the country, including 80,000 rural and one lakh urban families from Bihar.
“Houses of the poor have been built in villages, roads paved, gas and water connections reached every doorstep. This is modern infrastructure building the foundation of a developed India,” PM Modi stated.
He shared that over 12 crore rural families now have tap water connections, 2.5 crore homes have been electrified, and LPG cylinders have replaced firewood in countless households.
He also highlighted the cultural and economic significance of Makhana, a crop native to Mithila. “Makhana has received the GI (Geographical Indication) tag, officially recognising its origin in Bihar. The Makhana Research Centre has been given national status. A dedicated Makhana Board, announced in the Union Budget, is expected to empower local farmers and boost exports,” he said.
“Makhana is not just food, it’s culture. Now, it will also be a source of prosperity,” the Prime Minister emphasised.
PM Modi also previewed the upcoming India Steel 2025 summit, which will focus on strengthening India’s strategic and high-grade steel production, particularly for defence and aerospace.
“India was once dependent on imported steel. Today, the steel used in our first indigenous aircraft carrier is made in India. Our Chandrayaan Mission too rode on the strength of Indian steel,” he said proudly.

Title: India revokes visas for Pakistanis, suspends new visa service
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: In a sweeping response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, Central govt on Thursday announced the suspension of all visa services for Pakistani nationals, among a series of stringent diplomatic and security measures aimed at isolating Islamabad over its alleged support for terrorism.
Following a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of External Affairs released a detailed directive outlining the new restrictions. All valid visas previously issued by India to Pakistani citizens stand revoked effective April 27. However, medical visas will remain valid only until April 29, offering a short grace period for humanitarian considerations.
The government further stated that all Pakistani nationals currently in India must exit the country before their visas expire under the revised rules. Indian citizens have been strongly advised against traveling to Pakistan, and those already in the country have been urged to return at the earliest.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, addressing a press briefing after the CCS meeting, emphasized that these measures represent India’s zero-tolerance stance toward terrorism. “These actions reflect the gravity of the situation and India’s commitment to hold both the perpetrators and their sponsors accountable,” Misri said.
One of the most consequential announcements was the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs water-sharing between the two countries. The treaty, which has survived multiple wars and political tensions, will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism,” Misri said.
Additionally, the Attari Integrated Check Post—one of the most active land crossings between India and Pakistan—has been closed with immediate effect. Pakistani nationals who entered India through this route with valid endorsements will be permitted to return home before May 1.
On the diplomatic front, India has declared defence, naval, and air advisors at Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi as persona non grata, requiring them to leave the country within seven days. India will also withdraw its own corresponding military advisors from the High Commission in Islamabad. The decision extends to support staff, with five members from each side set to be recalled.
The diplomatic downsizing will significantly reduce the staffing strength of both High Commissions—from 55 to 30—by May 1.

Title: PM Modi calls steel industry the backbone of India’s growth at India Steel 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:08:42 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the India Steel 2025 programme virtually on Wednesday, highlighting the sector’s role in shaping the future of a developed India. Organized in Mumbai, the event brought together stakeholders from across the industry for a two-day dialogue on opportunities and innovation in India’s steel sector.
PM Modi described steel as “the backbone of modern economies” and compared its role to that of a skeleton, supporting critical sectors such as infrastructure, construction, and manufacturing. “Whether it is skyscrapers, shipping, highways, high-speed rail, smart cities, or industrial corridors, steel is the strength behind every success story,” he said.
“India is moving forward with the goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy, with the steel sector playing a central role in achieving this mission” he added. He expressed pride in India being the world’s second-largest steel producer and stated that the country aims to produce 300 million tons of steel by 2030 under the National Steel Policy. He also noted that per capita steel consumption, currently at 98 kilograms, is projected to rise to 160 kilograms by 2030.
PM Modi underscored the importance of initiatives such as the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan and the National Infrastructure Pipeline in expanding the steel sector’s footprint. He highlighted infrastructure development projects in eastern India, where much of the steel industry is concentrated, and mentioned government welfare schemes like PM Awas Yojana and Jal Jeevan Mission as additional drivers of demand.
He said the government has mandated the use of ‘Made in India’ steel in public projects and that public sector initiatives remain the largest consumers of steel in the country. He also said policies targeting the steel industry are helping boost competitiveness in sectors like construction, manufacturing, machinery, and automotive.
Touching on India’s journey towards self-reliance in high-grade steel, PM Modi said he was proud that the steel used in the country’s first indigenous aircraft carrier and in the Chandrayaan mission was made domestically. He credited the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for supporting high-grade steel manufacturing and called the transformation a “beginning of a long journey.” With the reclassification of shipbuilding as infrastructure, the Prime Minister said India aims to produce modern ships for both domestic use and export.
PM Modi said the country is working to boost steel exports to 25 million tons and increase production capacity to 500 million tons by 2047. He urged the industry to adopt a future-ready approach by embracing new processes, grades, and digital technologies. “The future of the steel industry will be shaped by AI, automation, recycling, and by-product utilization,” he said.
He also acknowledged the challenges facing the industry, particularly in securing raw materials like coking coal, nickel, and manganese. Emphasizing the need to reduce dependence on imports, he called for the exploration of alternatives such as the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) route and coal gasification technologies. PM Modi encouraged stakeholders to accelerate efforts in utilizing greenfield mines, stating that delays could adversely affect the sector’s growth.

Title: Congress blames Pakistan for Pahalgam terror attack, calls for unity in strongly worded resolution
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:01:44 +0000
Content: The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Thursday strongly condemned the brutal terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, and squarely blamed Pakistan for orchestrating the assault.
In a strongly worded resolution, the CWC described the deliberate targeting of Hindu tourists as a calculated attempt to inflame communal tensions across India. “This is a direct assault on the values of our Republic,” the statement declared, urging citizens to maintain calm and unity in the face of such provocation.
Reaffirming its long-standing stand against terrorism, the Congress reiterated its resolve to combat cross-border terror with firmness and national solidarity. The party also demanded a thorough investigation into the intelligence and security lapses that allowed the attack to take place.
“These lapses must be scrutinized in the public interest. Only then can justice be seen to be done—for the victims and their grieving families,” the CWC said.
The Committee expressed shock and deep sorrow over the heinous attack that took place on April 22, offering heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. A two-minute silence was observed in memory of those who lost their lives.
The Congress also paid tribute to local pony handlers and tourist guides, including one who was martyred while attempting to protect the victims. “Their selfless act stands as a shining example of the enduring spirit of India,” the statement read.
Looking ahead, the CWC flagged serious security concerns surrounding the upcoming Amarnath Yatra, which draws lakhs of pilgrims each year. It urged the government to immediately implement robust, transparent, and proactive security arrangements to ensure the safety of pilgrims and local residents alike.
While acknowledging the broad condemnation of the massacre by political parties and civil society in Jammu and Kashmir, the CWC criticized the BJP for allegedly using the tragedy for political gain. “It is deeply disturbing that the BJP, through its official and proxy social media handles, is exploiting a national tragedy to deepen discord and polarization—at a time when unity is more critical than ever,” the party said.

Title: Nadda launches national ‘Zero Measles-Rubella’ elimination campaign on World Immunization Week
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 10:38:05 +0000
Content: Marking the start of World Immunization Week 2025 (April 24–30), Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Jagat Prakash Nadda, on Thursday virtually launched the National Zero Measles-Rubella (MR) Elimination Campaign 2025–26. The campaign reinforces India’s commitment to eliminate Measles and Rubella by 2026.
During the launch, J.P. Nadda unveiled multilingual IEC materials—including posters, radio jingles, and official campaign films—which will be distributed across all States and Union Territories to raise awareness and promote public participation in the campaign.
Calling the day a “momentous occasion,” Nadda underscored the importance of achieving 100% immunization coverage. He said that Measles and Rubella are highly contagious diseases that severely impact children’s health and bring distress to families, and it is vital that no child is left behind.
He highlighted India’s progress in this regard, stating that 332 districts have reported zero measles cases and 487 districts have reported zero rubella cases between January and March 2025. India’s efforts have also received global recognition with the prestigious Measles and Rubella Champion Award from the Measles and Rubella Partnership, presented in March 2024.
The Minister called for enhanced surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and urged States and Union Territories to adopt an ‘ACT NOW’ approach. He encouraged state leaders and Chief Medical Officers to engage with the public and media, and involve elected representatives, local panchayat heads, and civil society to ensure widespread awareness and participation.
India’s strategy to eliminate Measles and Rubella focuses on achieving and maintaining over 95% vaccination coverage with two doses of the MR vaccine in every district, maintaining a sensitive and timely case-based surveillance system, ensuring preparedness and swift outbreak responses, and building strong inter-departmental linkages. Public awareness remains a central pillar, with targeted campaigns to dispel myths and reduce vaccine hesitancy.
According to 2024–25 HMIS data, India currently stands at 93.7% coverage for the first dose of the MR vaccine and 92.2% for the second dose. In 2024, the country saw a significant decline in measles and rubella cases, with measles dropping by 73% and rubella by 17% compared to 2023.
India’s Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), the largest in the world, vaccinates approximately 2.9 crore pregnant women and 2.6 crore newborns annually against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and hepatitis B. The U-WIN digital platform, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is streamlining vaccination services across the country by enabling online registration, appointment booking, and digital certification.
He also appealed to frontline workers to reach remote regions, urban slums, and areas with migratory populations and frequent disease outbreaks. Stressing the importance of last-mile delivery, he urged collaborative efforts from all departments and ministries to meet the campaign’s ambitious goals.

“Pakistan has been violating this for many years,” he said.
The meeting, which lasted for around two hours, concluded with a collective reaffirmation of national security and unity. The Central government informed attendees that strict measures had been taken against Pakistan the day after the attack to prevent any recurrence.
This meeting comes amid widespread public outrage across the country over the attack. The unified stance of the government and the opposition sends a strong message: India stands united against terrorism.

“I cannot help but feel great shock and anger regarding the large number of casualties caused by the terrorist attack in Kashmir. I resolutely condemn such a vicious attack. On behalf of the Japanese government and people, I extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and express heartfelt sympathy to the injured.”
He stressed that terrorism cannot be justified under any circumstances and reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to work with India and the international community to combat terrorism.

Title: Air India, IndiGo reroute international flights after Pakistan closes airspace for India
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:32:00 +0000
Content: Major Indian carriers Air India and IndiGo announced on Thursday that several of their international flights will be rerouted following Pakistan’s decision to close its airspace to Indian airlines. The move comes amid escalating diplomatic tensions between the two countries in the aftermath of the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.
Air India stated that due to the closure of Pakistani airspace for Indian carriers, several of its flights to and from North America, the UK, Europe, and the Middle East will now operate on extended alternative routes.
“We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen airspace restriction, which is beyond our control,” the airline said in a statement posted on social media platform X. “At Air India, the safety of our customers and crew remains our highest priority.”
IndiGo also confirmed disruptions to some of its international flights, attributing them to the sudden airspace closure by Pakistan.
“A few of our international flights are being impacted,” the airline posted on X. “We understand the inconvenience this may cause, and our teams are working diligently to help passengers reach their destinations as quickly as possible. We encourage customers to check the latest flight status, and in case of disruptions, flexible rebooking options and refunds are available through our website.”
The decision to close airspace was taken during a high-level emergency meeting of Pakistan’s National Security Committee (NSC), chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday. The committee endorsed recommendations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take immediate action in response to what it described as India’s “unilateral moves.”

Title: Pahalgam terror attack: Shah and Jaishankar update President Murmu, foreign envoys briefed at MEA headquarters
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:13:00 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday briefed President Droupadi Murmu on the incident and the government’s immediate response. The high-level update coincided with a flurry of diplomatic activity at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) headquarters in South Block, where top foreign envoys were given detailed briefings on the situation.
The government has launched a coordinated diplomatic outreach to inform key international partners about the attack, which claimed several civilian lives, including that of a foreign national. The incident has drawn strong condemnation from Indian leadership and the global community.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri led the diplomatic briefings, engaging ambassadors and senior diplomats from major nations including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Norway. These sessions were aimed at conveying India’s assessment of the situation on the ground and the steps being taken to counter the terror threat.
Among the early attendees was EU envoy Herve Delphin, who met with Misri for a 30-minute session. Russian Ambassador Denis Alipov and diplomats from Gulf nations, including the UAE, Qatar, and Oman, also participated. Diplomats from Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, were similarly briefed.
In a significant development, Chinese Ambassador Xu Feihong attended a dedicated briefing at the MEA. His presence underscored India’s intent to rally regional and global support against cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.
External Affairs Minister Jaishankar also visited the MEA headquarters during the briefings, highlighting the importance India attaches to this diplomatic exercise. Officials stated that each session lasted around 30 minutes and covered India’s security posture, intelligence assessments, and ongoing counter-terror operations.
According to government sources, the objective was not only to update foreign missions on the attack but also to ensure international alignment on counterterrorism efforts—especially with nations that share intelligence and security cooperation frameworks with India.
The Pahalgam terror attack has prompted widespread condemnation worldwide. India’s swift and coordinated diplomatic response is being viewed as an effort to isolate terror sponsors and reinforce its zero-tolerance stance on terrorism.

Title: India’s telecom sector sees marginal subscriber dip, steady revenue growth in Q3 FY24: TRAI report
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:08:22 +0000
Content: The Indian telecom sector witnessed stable financial performance with marginal subscriber decline in the quarter ending December 31, 2024, according to the “Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicator Report” released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Thursday.
As per the report, the total number of internet subscribers in the country stood at 970.16 million at the end of December, registering a slight dip from 971.50 million in the previous quarter—a decline of 0.14%. Of these, 928.96 million were wireless internet users, while 41.21 million were wired subscribers. Despite the overall fall in internet subscribers, the broadband segment continued to grow, reaching 944.96 million users, up by 0.06% from the previous quarter. Narrowband subscribers, however, dropped to 25.20 million.
The report showed strong growth in wireline connections, which rose by 6.32% over the previous quarter to 39.27 million. This represents a year-on-year growth of 23.32%. Wireline tele-density also increased from 2.63% in September 2024 to 2.79% by December.
The sector’s revenue indicators demonstrated a steady upward trajectory. Gross Revenue (GR) for the quarter stood at ₹96,390 crore, while the Applicable Gross Revenue (ApGR) and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) were ₹92,342 crore and ₹77,934 crore respectively. These figures reflect quarterly increases of 5.43%, 4.65%, and 3.48%, respectively. Compared to the same quarter the previous year, GR, ApGR, and AGR grew by 14.07%, 13.86%, and 14.89%.
The Monthly Average Revenue per User (ARPU) for wireless services also saw a rise, increasing by 5.34% to ₹181.80 from ₹172.57 in the previous quarter. Prepaid ARPU was reported at ₹180.91 and postpaid at ₹191.51. Meanwhile, the average Minutes of Usage (MOU) per subscriber per month rose by 3.62%, reaching 1,009 minutes.
Access services remained the largest contributor to AGR, accounting for 84.35% of the sector’s total. Within this category, the revenue indicators—Gross Revenue, ApGR, and AGR—along with License Fee, Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), and Pass-Through Charges, all posted quarter-on-quarter increases, ranging from 4.28% to 5.96%. The License Fee collected during the quarter stood at ₹6,234 crore, up 3.50% from the previous quarter and 14.75% higher year-on-year. Pass-Through Charges rose by 11.48% quarter-on-quarter to ₹14,410 crore, reflecting a 7.12% increase compared to the same period last year.
On the subscriber front, the total number of telephone connections in the country saw a marginal fall to 1,189.92 million, down from 1,190.66 million in September 2024. Consequently, overall tele-density declined slightly from 84.69% to 84.45%.

Title: Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya launches sports certificate issuance via DigiLocker; inaugurates NCSSR
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:52:50 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports and Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, on Thursday launched the issuance of sports certificates through DigiLocker, marking a major step towards digital empowerment of athletes. The launch event was held at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi.
Earlier in the day, the Minister also inaugurated the National Centre for Sports Science and Research (NCSSR) at the same venue, which is poised to become a hub for high-level research and innovation aimed at improving elite athlete performance.
Highlighting the government’s athlete-first approach, Dr. Mandaviya said, “Every initiative under the Modi Government is centered around the welfare of sportspersons.” He cited the Draft National Sports Governance Bill 2024, the Draft National Sports Policy 2024, and the Draft National Code Against Age Fraud in Sports (NCAAFS) 2025 as recent examples of efforts to bring transparency and good governance in Indian sports.
The DigiLocker-based certificate issuance will soon be integrated with the National Sports Repository System (NSRS), enabling automatic disbursal of cash rewards directly into athletes’ bank accounts via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). “When the world has witnessed an athlete win a medal, they shouldn’t have to apply for their reward. This system ensures they receive what they deserve without delay or paperwork,” he added.
Dr. Mandaviya also shared key highlights of India’s future sporting ambitions, including a bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games and the 2030 Commonwealth Games. He urged National Sports Federations (NSFs) to ensure athlete welfare and emphasized the need for collective responsibility between federations, athletes, and the government to create a robust sporting ecosystem.
As part of this effort, he announced that office space at IG Stadium would be made available to interested NSFs. He also revealed plans for a ‘One Sport–One Corporate’ policy to enhance private sector support for Indian sports and proposed Olympic training centres for priority disciplines under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.
On the newly inaugurated NCSSR, Dr. Mandaviya stated that the facility would play a vital role in fulfilling India’s long-term sporting vision under “Viksit Bharat by 2047.”
Olympic silver medallist and Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna awardee Mirabai Chanu praised the DigiLocker initiative, calling it a “stress-reliever” for athletes. “Often, we don’t carry all documents with us while traveling for competitions. With certificates available digitally, it’ll save us time and trouble. I thank the Minister on behalf of all athletes,” she said.

Title: Golf: Inaugural India Championship joins 2025 race to Dubai
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:32:19 +0000
Content: The India Championship, a new addition to the DP World Tour calendar, will debut at the historic Delhi Golf Club from October 16 to 19, 2025. Co-sanctioned with the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), the tournament becomes part of the ‘Back 9’ series on the 2025 Race to Dubai—the second phase of the season following the ‘Global Swings’.
With a record purse of USD 4 million, the India Championship becomes the richest golf tournament ever held in the country, underscoring India’s growing stature as a destination for elite global golf.
This announcement follows the success of the 2025 Indian Open—won by Spain’s Eugenio Chacarra—and further cements the DP World Tour’s momentum in the region. The event also marks the Tour’s return to Delhi Golf Club for the first time since 2016.
Steeped in history, the Lodhi Course at Delhi Golf Club was established in the 1930s and hosted the inaugural Indian Open in 1964. It was redesigned by five-time Open Champion Peter Thomson in 1977, with further enhancements by Gary Player Design in 2019.
DP World, the Tour’s title partner since 2022, is reaffirming its commitment to the sport through this tournament. The India Championship complements DP World’s broader sporting engagement in India, including its partnership with the Delhi Capitals and grassroots initiatives such as the ‘Second Life’ container programme and ‘Balls for Birdies’ campaign.
Rizwan Soomar, CEO and Managing Director, Middle East, North Africa & India Subcontinent at DP World, said:
“As a long-term partner of the Tour, we are thrilled to announce the DP World India Championship. We are committed to growing golf in India, and with our global network and expertise, we aim to elevate the sport while driving community impact.”
Ben Cowen, Chief Tournament and Operations Officer of the DP World Tour, added:
“We are excited to deepen our relationship with Indian golf through the launch of the DP World India Championship. Our thanks to DP World and the Delhi Golf Club for making this possible. We look forward to showcasing world-class golf at such an iconic venue.”
Kapil Dev, President of PGTI, hailed the tournament as a milestone for Indian golf:
“The DP World India Championship is a landmark moment. It offers Indian professionals a chance to compete with some of the world’s best, helping raise the standard of the sport nationally and globally.”
Raj Khosla, President of the Delhi Golf Club, highlighted the uniqueness of the venue:
“We are proud to host this world-class tournament at a course that blends sporting excellence with historical grandeur. The Lodhi-era monuments surrounding the course create a magical setting unlike any other.”
The DP World India Championship will be the eighth of nine tournaments in the ‘Back 9’ phase, leading to the DP World Tour Play-Offs and culminating at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai at Jumeirah Golf Estates.

Title: If villages are strong, India will develop faster: PM Modi on launching Rs 13,480-crore projects in Bihar
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:23:08 +0000
Content: On the occasion of National Panchayati Raj Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a massive public gathering in Bihar’s Madhubani district and inaugurated a series of development projects spanning railways, infrastructure, LPG, and rural empowerment—collectively worth over ₹13,480 crore.
The event began on a solemn note, with the Prime Minister urging the crowd to observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the April 22 Pahalgam attack. He also paid tribute to national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar on his death anniversary.
“Before we speak of development, let us remember those who were taken from us. Let’s pay our respects with silence,” he said.
Emphasising the importance of self-governance at the village level, PM Modi reflected on Mahatma Gandhi’s vision that strong villages are the cornerstone of national progress.
“If the villages of India are strong, the country will develop faster. This is the soul of Panchayati Raj,” he stated.
Highlighting his government’s rural initiatives over the past decade, Modi said more than two lakh Gram Panchayats have been connected to the Internet, 5.5 lakh Common Service Centres set up in rural areas, 30,000 Panchayat Bhawans constructed, and ₹2 lakh crore allocated to Panchayat funds.
“Today, Panchayats can issue certificates such as birth, death, and land records digitally. Technology has brought transparency and efficiency to grassroots governance,” the Prime Minister added.
He praised Bihar for being the first state to provide 50% reservation to women in Panchayats, calling it a powerful example of real social justice.
“Thousands of our sisters and daughters from marginalised communities are now decision-makers. This is the true strength of democracy,” he said.
Modi also highlighted the success of the ‘Jeevika Didi’ self-help group movement and announced fresh financial assistance of ₹1,000 crore for women-led SHGs in Bihar.
He laid the foundation stone and inaugurated various projects in rail connectivity, including new lines and express services such as the Amrit Bharat and NaMo Bharat trains.
Among key initiatives, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for an LPG bottling plant at Hathua block in Gopalganj district, a ₹340 crore project aimed at enhancing bulk LPG transportation and streamlining the supply chain.
He also launched projects worth ₹1,170 crore in the power sector, and ₹5,030 crore under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme to strengthen power infrastructure.
Modi flagged off several new trains, including the Amrit Bharat Express between Saharsa and Mumbai and the Namo Bharat Rapid Rail between Jaynagar and Patna. He also launched regional rail connections such as Pipra–Saharsa–Samastipur, Supaul–Pipra, and Hasanpur–Bithan rail lines, along with rail overbridges in Chapra and Bagaha, and dedicated the Khagaria–Alauli rail line to the nation.
Under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), the Prime Minister distributed ₹930 crore under the Community Investment Fund to over two lakh SHGs in Bihar.
Connecting the day’s initiatives to Bihar’s rich legacy, he said, “The entire country is connected to the soil of Mithila. The work launched today will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the region.”
As part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), 1.5 lakh families in Bihar received new pucca homes. Approval letters for new houses were handed over to 15 lakh families nationwide, including 3.5 lakh from Bihar. Financial assistance was disbursed to 10 lakh poor families across the country, including 80,000 rural and one lakh urban families from Bihar.
“Houses of the poor have been built in villages, roads paved, gas and water connections reached every doorstep. This is modern infrastructure building the foundation of a developed India,” PM Modi stated.
He shared that over 12 crore rural families now have tap water connections, 2.5 crore homes have been electrified, and LPG cylinders have replaced firewood in countless households.
He also highlighted the cultural and economic significance of Makhana, a crop native to Mithila. “Makhana has received the GI (Geographical Indication) tag, officially recognising its origin in Bihar. The Makhana Research Centre has been given national status. A dedicated Makhana Board, announced in the Union Budget, is expected to empower local farmers and boost exports,” he said.
“Makhana is not just food, it’s culture. Now, it will also be a source of prosperity,” the Prime Minister emphasised.
PM Modi also previewed the upcoming India Steel 2025 summit, which will focus on strengthening India’s strategic and high-grade steel production, particularly for defence and aerospace.
“India was once dependent on imported steel. Today, the steel used in our first indigenous aircraft carrier is made in India. Our Chandrayaan Mission too rode on the strength of Indian steel,” he said proudly.

Title: India revokes visas for Pakistanis, suspends new visa service
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:23:06 +0000
Content: In a sweeping response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, Central govt on Thursday announced the suspension of all visa services for Pakistani nationals, among a series of stringent diplomatic and security measures aimed at isolating Islamabad over its alleged support for terrorism.
Following a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of External Affairs released a detailed directive outlining the new restrictions. All valid visas previously issued by India to Pakistani citizens stand revoked effective April 27. However, medical visas will remain valid only until April 29, offering a short grace period for humanitarian considerations.
The government further stated that all Pakistani nationals currently in India must exit the country before their visas expire under the revised rules. Indian citizens have been strongly advised against traveling to Pakistan, and those already in the country have been urged to return at the earliest.
Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, addressing a press briefing after the CCS meeting, emphasized that these measures represent India’s zero-tolerance stance toward terrorism. “These actions reflect the gravity of the situation and India’s commitment to hold both the perpetrators and their sponsors accountable,” Misri said.
One of the most consequential announcements was the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank that governs water-sharing between the two countries. The treaty, which has survived multiple wars and political tensions, will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism,” Misri said.
Additionally, the Attari Integrated Check Post—one of the most active land crossings between India and Pakistan—has been closed with immediate effect. Pakistani nationals who entered India through this route with valid endorsements will be permitted to return home before May 1.
On the diplomatic front, India has declared defence, naval, and air advisors at Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi as persona non grata, requiring them to leave the country within seven days. India will also withdraw its own corresponding military advisors from the High Commission in Islamabad. The decision extends to support staff, with five members from each side set to be recalled.
The diplomatic downsizing will significantly reduce the staffing strength of both High Commissions—from 55 to 30—by May 1.

Title: PM Modi calls steel industry the backbone of India’s growth at India Steel 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:08:42 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the India Steel 2025 programme virtually on Wednesday, highlighting the sector’s role in shaping the future of a developed India. Organized in Mumbai, the event brought together stakeholders from across the industry for a two-day dialogue on opportunities and innovation in India’s steel sector.
PM Modi described steel as “the backbone of modern economies” and compared its role to that of a skeleton, supporting critical sectors such as infrastructure, construction, and manufacturing. “Whether it is skyscrapers, shipping, highways, high-speed rail, smart cities, or industrial corridors, steel is the strength behind every success story,” he said.
“India is moving forward with the goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy, with the steel sector playing a central role in achieving this mission” he added. He expressed pride in India being the world’s second-largest steel producer and stated that the country aims to produce 300 million tons of steel by 2030 under the National Steel Policy. He also noted that per capita steel consumption, currently at 98 kilograms, is projected to rise to 160 kilograms by 2030.
PM Modi underscored the importance of initiatives such as the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan and the National Infrastructure Pipeline in expanding the steel sector’s footprint. He highlighted infrastructure development projects in eastern India, where much of the steel industry is concentrated, and mentioned government welfare schemes like PM Awas Yojana and Jal Jeevan Mission as additional drivers of demand.
He said the government has mandated the use of ‘Made in India’ steel in public projects and that public sector initiatives remain the largest consumers of steel in the country. He also said policies targeting the steel industry are helping boost competitiveness in sectors like construction, manufacturing, machinery, and automotive.
Touching on India’s journey towards self-reliance in high-grade steel, PM Modi said he was proud that the steel used in the country’s first indigenous aircraft carrier and in the Chandrayaan mission was made domestically. He credited the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for supporting high-grade steel manufacturing and called the transformation a “beginning of a long journey.” With the reclassification of shipbuilding as infrastructure, the Prime Minister said India aims to produce modern ships for both domestic use and export.
PM Modi said the country is working to boost steel exports to 25 million tons and increase production capacity to 500 million tons by 2047. He urged the industry to adopt a future-ready approach by embracing new processes, grades, and digital technologies. “The future of the steel industry will be shaped by AI, automation, recycling, and by-product utilization,” he said.
He also acknowledged the challenges facing the industry, particularly in securing raw materials like coking coal, nickel, and manganese. Emphasizing the need to reduce dependence on imports, he called for the exploration of alternatives such as the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) route and coal gasification technologies. PM Modi encouraged stakeholders to accelerate efforts in utilizing greenfield mines, stating that delays could adversely affect the sector’s growth.

Title: India reaffirms commitment to malaria elimination by 2030 on World Malaria Day
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 07:28:00 +0000
Content: The government is steadfast in its commitment to achieving a “malaria-free India,” Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Anupriya Patel, said on Friday while marking World Malaria Day.
Observed annually on April 25 to raise awareness about the disease, this year’s theme—“Malaria Ends with Us: Reinvest, Reimagine, Reignite”—aims to re-energize efforts at every level, from global policymaking to grassroots action, to accelerate progress toward malaria elimination.
“On the occasion of World Malaria Day, it is our collective responsibility to spread awareness about a deadly disease like malaria and make concerted efforts to eradicate it,” Patel said in a post on X.
“The Government of India is continuously working towards the goal of ‘Malaria-Free India.’ Let us all come together to make this campaign a success,” she added.
Malaria is a life-threatening disease transmitted to humans by female Anopheles mosquitoes. However, it is both preventable and curable. India is working towards eliminating malaria by 2030, with a specific goal of achieving zero indigenous cases by 2027.
The latest World Malaria Report 2024, released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in December last year, shows that India has made major progress in malaria elimination, with a 69 percent drop in cases and a 68 percent reduction in deaths between 2017 and 2023. Contributing just 0.8 percent of global cases in 2023, India also exited the WHO’s High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) group in 2024, marking a significant public health achievement.
“Every year, millions of people are affected by malaria, even though it is a preventable and curable disease,” Patel said.
To prevent the disease, she urged people to “maintain cleanliness, protect yourself from mosquitoes, wear full-sleeve clothes, use mosquito nets and repellents, and get yourself checked immediately if you have a fever.”
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2.2 billion cases of malaria and 12.7 million deaths from the disease have been prevented globally since 2000. To date, 45 countries and one territory have been declared malaria-free, while several countries with a low malaria burden are steadily moving closer to elimination. Of the 83 malaria-endemic countries still in the fight, 25 reported fewer than 10 cases of malaria in 2023.
Despite significant gains, malaria remains a major public health challenge, with nearly 600,000 lives lost to the disease in 2023 alone. The African Region is hardest hit, shouldering an estimated 95 percent of the malaria burden each year.

Title: Pakistan Hockey Team’s Asia Cup tour to India in doubt after Pahalgam terror attack
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 07:06:52 +0000
Content: The Pakistan men’s hockey team’s scheduled visit to India for the upcoming Asia Cup in Rajgir is under serious doubt following the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.
The attack, perpetrated by terrorists with “cross-border linkages,” has sparked outrage across India. In response, the Indian government has revoked visas issued to all Pakistani nationals, casting uncertainty over Pakistan’s participation in the Asia Cup, set to take place in Bihar’s Rajgir from August 27 to September 7, according to a report by Telecom Asia Sport.
The tournament, featuring eight teams, serves as a crucial qualifier for the 2026 Hockey World Cup, to be co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands.
Amid heightened tensions, several prominent voices in India have called for a complete severance of ties with Pakistan — including sporting connections. This sentiment has fuelled speculation in Pakistani media about whether the Indian government will allow the Pakistan hockey team to compete in the Asia Cup.
Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) General Secretary Rana Mujahid expressed doubts about the tour materializing.
“We have good relations with Hockey India, but participation in the Asia Cup is a government-to-government matter. We will approach our government for permission. If they grant approval, we will go; if not, there is no possibility,” Mujahid told Telecom Asia Sport from Lahore.
“Given the current situation — with India revoking all Pakistani visas — how can our team visit? That’s the reality. We will wait for our government’s direction,” he added.
On the Indian side, Hockey India General Secretary Bhola Nath Singh adopted a cautious approach, saying the federation will wait for instructions from the central government.
“We haven’t had any discussions about the tournament yet. We’ll wait to hear from the government and decide accordingly,” Singh told Telecom Asia Sport.
Pakistan’s hockey teams have participated in FIH-sanctioned tournaments in India on three occasions in the past decade — the 2016 Junior World Cup in Lucknow, the 2018 Men’s World Cup, and the 2021 Junior World Cup, both held in Bhubaneswar.

Title: Lalan Singh highlights sevenfold rise in fund devolution to PRIs, digital push on Panchayati Raj Diwas
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:59:05 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Panchayati Raj, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, also known as Lalan Singh, on Thursday praised the significant transformation in local self-governance under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership.
Speaking at the National Panchayati Raj Day celebration at Lohna Uttar Gram Panchayat in Bihar’s Madhubani district, Singh highlighted major strides made in empowering Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
He said that fund devolution to PRIs has increased nearly sevenfold over the past decade compared to allocations made during the 13th Finance Commission period. This, he said, reflects the Centre’s unwavering focus on strengthening grassroots democracy.
Singh also emphasized the role of digital governance in driving this change. Tools such as the eGramSwaraj portal have, according to him, improved efficiency, transparency, and the quality of life in rural India. He also cited innovations like Panchayat-level weather forecasting, leadership training programs in collaboration with IIMs, and women-centric initiatives aimed at bolstering female leadership in rural governance.
“A truly developed India cannot be imagined until its villages and Panchayats are fully developed,” Singh said, reiterating the government’s vision for inclusive and rural-led growth.
The event saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi launch and lay the foundation stone for development projects worth over Rs 13,480 crore. These span multiple sectors including housing, rural infrastructure, electricity, roads, and digital connectivity.
Also present at the event were Bihar Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Singh noted that the Prime Minister’s decision to address the nation from a Gram Panchayat underscores the government’s deep-rooted commitment to rural empowerment.
A highlight of the celebration was the distribution of national awards for excellence in rural governance. These included the Climate Action Special Panchayat Award (CASPA), Atma Nirbhar Panchayat Special Award (ANPSA), and the Panchayat Kshamta Nirman Sarvottam Sansthan Puraskar (PKNSSP).
Six Gram Panchayats and three institutions from eight states were felicitated, including three Panchayats—Motipur (Bihar), Dawwa S (Maharashtra), and Hatbadra (Odisha)—led by women Sarpanches, highlighting the increasing role of women in grassroots leadership.

Title: US reiterates support for India after Pahalgam attack
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:33:50 +0000
Content: The US on Thursday condemned the “heinous” terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, and reiterated its support for India.
“The US stands with India and strongly condemns all acts of terrorism,” Tammy Bruce, the US State Department Spokesperson, said at a news briefing, echoing statements by President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“We pray for the lives of those lost and for the recovery of the injured, and we call for the perpetrators of this heinous act to be brought to justice.”
When asked if the US believed Pakistan was behind the attacks, Bruce said, “It was a horrible situation, but at the same time, that’s basically going to be the extent of the comments at this point. What I can tell you is, of course, as we all know, it’s a rapidly changing situation, and we are monitoring it closely, as you might imagine. And we, of course, are not taking a position on the status of Kashmir or Jammu at this time.”
The US expressed support for India after the attack on Tuesday, with President Donald Trump calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi later that day.
Earlier on Thursday, US Vice President J.D. Vance spoke about the attack while departing India after a four-day trip.
“I want to just, of course, issue our condolences to the people of Kashmir who were affected by this terrible terrorist attack. The President has already spoken with Prime Minister Modi. I believe I’ll be speaking with him later this afternoon. And obviously, we’re providing whatever assistance and help we can offer to the government and people of India,” Vance said.
The US has been strongly supportive of India’s fight against terrorism. The American leader had personally announced the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, who was sought by India for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the White House in February.

Title: Trump re-emerges as a factor in Canada election as polls tighten
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:30:32 +0000
Content: Donald Trump re-emerged as a factor in Canada’s election campaign on Thursday, days before a vote that Prime Minister Mark Carney says will determine how Ottawa can best stand up to the U.S. President.
Carney launched the race last month, calling for a strong mandate to deal with Trump’s tariffs and his stated desire to turn Canada into the 51st state. The ruling Liberals had a healthy lead but polls showed the advantage gradually shrinking in recent days as Trump kept silent on Canada and voters’ focus appeared to shift back towards concerns about high living costs.
On Wednesday, however, Trump declared the United States did not need Canadian-made autos and said he might increase tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada.
“President Trump repeated his attacks on Canada. He said he doesn’t want Canada to play any part in the North American auto industry,” Carney told a campaign event in Port Moody, British Columbia.
“So, I will be equally clear: this is Canada – we decide what happens here. Yesterday was more proof that the old relationship with the United States is over,” he said.
Carney is promising to spend tens of billions of dollars to help reduce the country’s reliance on the United States, which takes 75% of all Canadian exports.
The Liberals are still in the lead ahead of Monday’s election but the gap with the opposition Conservatives is tightening, a rolling three-day poll showed on Thursday.
The Liberals hold 42.9% support, followed by Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives at 39.3% and the New Democratic Party at 7.2%, according to the CTV News-Globe and Mail-Nanos poll.
The 3.6-point gap between the two leading parties as of Wednesday compares with a 5.6-point Liberal lead over the Conservatives in the same poll a day earlier.
Such a result on Election Day would produce a fourth consecutive Liberal mandate but Carney might only win a minority of seats, leaving him reliant on smaller parties to govern.
Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba, said voters’ focus might be shifting back to high prices, crime, and a housing crisis, which have been the centre pieces of the Conservative campaign.
“We can’t afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime,” Poilievre told reporters in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Thursday, pledging to scrap electric-vehicle sales mandates.
Liberal support is typically more efficiently distributed across Canada, resulting in more parliamentary seats. The Conservatives tend to win by large margins in rural areas with fewer seats.
Carney remains the preferred choice as prime minister, but Poilievre is narrowing that gap, Nanos said.
It surveyed 1,307 Canadians from April 21 to 23, and the poll is considered accurate plus or minus 2.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
An Abacus Data poll on Wednesday placed the Liberals at 40% support among decided voters, with the Conservatives at 37%. Abacus said Liberals’ share of support was unchanged from last week, while the Conservatives were down one point.
The poll was conducted among 2,000 eligible voters from April 18 to 21 and the margin of error is 2.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Title: My country’s interests will always come first: Neeraj Chopra breaks silence on criticism for inviting Arshad Nadeem to ‘NC Classic’
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 05:15:05 +0000
Content: India’s ace javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has hit back at critics and trolls who targeted him and his family for inviting Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem to participate in the Neeraj Chopra Classic 2025, set to be held at Bengaluru’s Kanteerava Stadium on May 24.
During a press conference on Monday, Chopra said that he had sent an invitation to Paris 2024 Olympics gold medalist Arshad for the NC Classic, a one-day javelin throw event.
In the comments section, the 27-year-old faced heavy backlash for inviting the Pakistani javelin spearhead to India for the event. After days of criticism, Chopra broke his silence and claimed that the invitation he sent to Nadeem was “from one athlete to another,” and there was “nothing more” to it.
“I am usually a man of few words, but that doesn’t mean I will not speak up against what I think is wrong, especially when it comes to questioning my love for our country and the respect and honor of my family. There has been so much talk about my decision to invite Arshad Nadeem to compete in the Neeraj Chopra Classic, and most of it has been filled with hate and abuse. They haven’t even left my family out of it. The invitation I extended to Arshad was from one athlete to another — nothing more, nothing less,” Chopra said in a post on X.
Chopra clarified that the invitations were sent out on Monday, a day before the tragic incident occurred. “The aim of the NC Classic was to bring the best athletes to India and for our country to be the home of world-class sporting events. Invites had gone out to all athletes on Monday, two days before the terrorist attacks in Pahalgam”, he stressed.
“After everything that has happened in the last 48 hours, Arshad’s presence at the NC Classic is completely out of the question. My country and its interests will always come first. To those going through the loss of their loved ones, my thoughts and prayers are with you. Along with the entire nation, I am both hurt and angry at what has taken place,” he added.
Chopra addressed the criticism directed at him and his family for inviting Nadeem to the competition. Feeling “hurt” by the false narratives being spread about him and the questioning of his integrity, Chopra said that he believes he and his family are being unfairly targeted without cause.
“I am confident that our country’s response will show our strength as a nation and justice will be served. I have carried my country with pride for so many years now, and it hurts to see my integrity being questioned. It pains me that I have to explain myself to people who are targeting me and my family without any valid reason. We are simple people, please don’t make us out to be anything else. There are so many false narratives that certain sections of the media have created around me, but just because I don’t speak up, it doesn’t make them true,” he said.

Indian businesses have invested over USD 1.3 billion in South Africa since April 2000, spanning diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, information technology, automotive, banking, and mining.

Title: Army Chief General Dwivedi heads to Srinagar to assess security after Pahalgam terror attack
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:39:25 +0000
Content: Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi is set to visit Jammu and Kashmir’s Srinagar on Friday to assess the security situation in the region following the recent terror attack in Pahalgam. “Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi will depart for Srinagar and Udhampur shortly,” defence officials said on Friday.
According to the officials, the Army Chief is scheduled to meet senior army commanders deployed in the Kashmir Valley, along with officials from other security agencies.
He will review the ongoing security situation in the valley and the attempts by the Pakistan Army to violate the ceasefire along the Line of Control.
As many as 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22.
The incident has sparked nationwide outrage, with widespread protests erupting across the country, demanding stricter action against Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack.
Following the terror attack, the central government announced several diplomatic measures, including the closure of the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari, the suspension of the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) for Pakistani nationals—giving them 40 hours to return to their country—and a reduction in the number of officers in the High Commissions on both sides.
India has also suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960, in response to the Pahalgam attack.

Title: MEA clarifies long term visas for Hindu Pakistani nationals remain valid despite visa suspension
Publication Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:11:12 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday clarified that Long Term Visas (LTVs) already issued to Hindu Pakistani nationals will remain valid, despite the recent suspension of visa services to Pakistani nationals.
In an official press release, the MEA stated, “With reference to the Government of India’s decision dated 24 April to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals, it is clarified that the revocation of visas mentioned in the said decision does not apply to Long Term Visas (LTVs) already issued to Hindu Pakistani nationals. These LTVs remain valid.”
This clarification follows India’s decision to suspend all visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect in the wake of the devastating terrorist attack in Pahalgam on Tuesday, which claimed 26 lives — 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen — and left several others injured. The attack, which took place at the Baisaran meadow, is being described as one of the deadliest in the valley since the Pulwama attack in 2019.
“In continuation of the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) following the Pahalgam terror attack, the Government of India has decided to suspend all visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,” the MEA said in its statement.
It further noted, “All existing valid visas issued by India to Pakistani nationals stand revoked with effect from 27 April. However, medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will remain valid until 29 April.”
The MEA also advised Pakistani nationals currently in India to leave the country before the expiry of their amended visas. Indian citizens have been strongly advised to avoid travelling to Pakistan. Those currently in Pakistan are urged to return to India at the earliest opportunity.
In a strong diplomatic response to Pakistan’s alleged continued support for cross-border terrorism, India has announced a series of additional countermeasures. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 has been put in abeyance and the integrated Attari Check Post has been closed. All officials of the Pakistani High Commission have been declared persona non grata and instructed to leave India within a week. Additionally, visas issued under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) have been cancelled, with Pakistani recipients ordered to exit the country within 48 hours.
These measures were decided during a CCS meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by Home Minister Amit Shah and senior security officials.
