Title: Bhutan turns to ‘green’ cryptocurrency to fuel economy
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:18:29 +0000
Content: The Himalayan nation of Bhutan is exploring ways to mine and leverage green cryptocurrencies using hydropower to boost its economy and create jobs to reduce brain drain, the chief executive of its sovereign wealth fund said.
Green cryptocurrencies are digital currencies mined using clean energy resources such as wind, hydro or solar power instead of fossil fuel.
Sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, Bhutan has earned millions of dollars in recent years by investing in some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies and used some of its profit to pay government salaries for two years, two senior officials in Thimphu, the capital said.
“We are a nation that runs 100% on hydropower, and every digital coin we mine in Bhutan using hydropower offsets that coin which gets mined using fossil fuels,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, the CEO of the fund, Druk Holding and Investments Ltd.
“So a coin mined in Bhutan will contribute to the green economy,” he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Dahal said the fund, which controls Bhutan’s only power generation utility, began adding cryptocurrencies to its portfolio in 2019, seeing virtual currencies as a tactical investment and a gamechanger for the country.
Bhutan is famed for its Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, an economic gauge that incorporates factors ignored by the usual measures of gross domestic product, such as recreation, emotional well-being and sustainability.
It uses hydropower to operate energy-guzzling supercomputers to create digital assets that can be added to the blockchain.
Officials are exploring whether large conglomerates could buy Bhutan’s “green” coins to meet their targets on environmental, social and governance (ESG) norms.
“Bitcoin has not just given more value to hydropower energy, it has also increased access to liquidity in foreign currency,” said Dahal, who added that training Bhutan’s young people in blockchain and AI techniques would fuel jobs.
The nation of about 800,000 is battling an exodus of young, educated people. The government estimates that more than a tenth of its young people sought greener pastures between 2022 and 2023, taking unemployment in that age group to 16.5% in 2024.
Analysts said Bhutan’s ambitious plan to become the capital of green digital currency depends on expanding its hydropower generation to a potential of 33 gigawatts versus existing capacity of about 3.5 gigawatts.
“We have plans to generate 15 gigawatts in the next 10 to 15 years,” Dahal added.

Title: Soccer-Saudi Arabia open to 64-team World Cup in 2034
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:50:53 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia would be ready and willing to host a 64-team World Cup in 2034 if FIFA accepts a controversial proposal to expand the tournament from 48, according to the kingdom’s sports minister.
South America’s CONMEBOL has officially suggested staging the centenary 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with 64 teams but the idea has been opposed by some other continental confederations.
Next year’s tournament hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will have 48 countries participating, up from 32 in 2022.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told a select group of reporters at the Saudi Arabian Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah that his country would have no objection to an increase in the numbers for 2034.
“We’re ready, or we will be ready, inshallah (God willing). If that’s a decision that FIFA takes and thinks that that’s a good decision for everyone, then we’re more than happy to deliver on it,” he said.
He pointed to the infrastructure already in place for Islamic pilgrims, with four million people attending Mecca for Umrah during Ramadan this year and five million expected for the Hajj.
The global soccer governing body officially announced Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 men’s World Cup in December, a bid that was uncontested but strongly criticised by rights organisations.
The Kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years but critics accuse it of ‘sportswashing’ its human rights record. The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The bid book pledged 15 stadiums, new or refurbished, by 2032 and which are expected to be completed with the help of migrant labour.
Al-Faisal said worker safety was of the highest priority and Saudi organisers were talking regularly with FIFA and 2022 hosts and neighbours Qatar, the first World Cup in the region, to learn from their experience.
He said the death, reported last month, of a worker at the Aramco Stadium construction site in Al Khobar had come after millions of hours without issue.
“Every incident we take seriously, we file an investigation, we look what went wrong,” said the minister. “Unfortunately, in construction, these things happen.”
He said Saudi Arabia was part of the International Labour Organisation and a 2021 Labour Reform Act had abolished the kafala system that binds migrant workers to one employer and prevents them from leaving without the employer’s approval.
Alcohol, prohibited for observant Muslims, is banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Faisal confirmed the World Cup would be dry.
“The law now here in Saudi is that there’s no alcohol. Will that change in the future? We don’t know. But I don’t see it really affecting our sporting events at all,” he said.
“We’ve had more than 100 international events so far. We’ve had people come from all over the world to attend these sporting events. And everyone’s happy with the hospitality, the setup, the experience that they get.
“I don’t see it as an issue, to be honest. So I hope it’s not going to be an issue”.
Alcohol was not sold at stadiums in Qatar, where drinking in public is illegal, in 2022 but beer was available at designated fan zones and in some hotels.

Title: Prime Minister’s  Jeddah visit set to marks new chapter in India-Saudi Arabia relations
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:41:20 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Jeddah this week, marking the first visit by an Indian leader to Saudi Arabia’s commercial hub in over four decades. The high-profile visit underscores the remarkable transformation of India-Saudi relations from modest beginnings to a comprehensive strategic partnership spanning economic, defense, and cultural dimensions.
The visit comes amid intensified diplomatic engagement between the two nations, with 11 ministerial-level visits from India to Saudi Arabia since the beginning of 2024 alone.
Speaking about the significance of the upcoming visit, Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Suhel Ajaz Khan said, “The Honorable Prime Minister is visiting from April 22nd to 23rd. This is his first visit to Jeddah, though on two previous occasions he has visited Saudi Arabia. This visit is very important as we are strengthening our strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia.”
The Ambassador highlighted how bilateral ties have evolved in recent years. “Our people-to-people connections and the strategic partnership have given a new direction to the relationship. Talks are expected to cover various areas including defense partnership, energy cooperation, and many other issues related to regional and global political scenarios,” he added.
Saudi Arabia is home to approximately 2.7 million Indians who continue to play a vital role in the Kingdom’s development. “The community has participated in the development of Saudi Arabia and continues to contribute towards its prosperity while maintaining a strong connection with India. In fact, the Indian community serves as a living bridge between India and Saudi Arabia,” Khan noted.
The visit is expected to result in several new agreements that will further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations, building on their shared interests in regional stability, energy security, and economic growth.

Title: Scientists create novel method to identify healthy and cancerous cells
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:24:59 +0000
Content: Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan on Saturday said they have found that the motion of unlabelled cells can be used to tell whether they are cancerous or healthy.
They observed malignant fibrosarcoma cells and healthy fibroblasts on a dish and found that tracking and analysis of their paths can be used to differentiate them with up to 94 per cent accuracy.
Beyond diagnosis, their technique may also shed light on cell motility related functions, like tissue healing, according to the study published in the journal PLOS One.
The team of researchers, led by Professor Hiromi Miyoshi, came up with a way of tracking cells using phase-contrast microscopy, one of the most common ways of observing cells.
Phase-contrast microscopy is entirely label free, allowing cells to move about on a petri dish closer to their native state, and is not affected by the optical properties of the plastic petri dishes through which cells are imaged.
Through innovative image analysis, they were able to extract trajectories of many individual cells. They focused on properties of the paths taken, like migration speed, and how curvy the paths were, all of which would encode subtle differences in deformation and movement.
As a test, they compared healthy fibroblast cells, the key component of animal tissue, and malignant fibrosarcoma cells, cancerous cells which derive from fibrous connective tissue.
They were able to show that the cells migrated in subtly different ways, as characterised by the “sum of turn angles” (how curvy the paths were), the frequency of shallow turns, and how quickly they moved. In fact, by combining both the sum of turn angles and how often they made shallow turns, they could predict whether a cell was cancerous or not with an accuracy of 94 per cent.
The team’s work not only promises a new way to discriminate cancer cells, but applications to research of any biological function based on cell motility, like the healing of wounds and tissue growth, said the study.

Title: India’s forex, money markets have doubled in last 4 years: RBI Governor
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:06:37 +0000
Content: India’s financial markets have developed into a dynamic and resilient force to fuel economic growth with an almost doubling of the foreign exchange market from $32 billion in 2020 to $60 billion in 2024 and the average daily volumes in the overnight money markets surging from about Rs 3 lakh crore to over Rs 5.4 lakh in this four-year period, according to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.
There has also been a 40 per cent surge in average daily volumes in the government securities (G-secs) markets to Rs 66,000 crore over the same period.
Addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI annual conference in Bali this weekend, Malhotra said the levels of transparency in Indian markets are at par with the best in the world.
“With recent regulatory reforms, we have seen greater product and participant diversity, and the onshore and offshore markets have become tightly integrated,” he pointed out.
Malhotra said all the financial market segments of the country, including Forex, G-sec, and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the Rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground.
The foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads. There is growing transparency in this market. All FX derivatives are reported to the Trade Repository, and reporting of cash and spot transactions has commenced. A bulk of FX spot transactions are traded on electronic trading platforms (ETPs). Authorised trading platforms are also available for forward transactions, but there appears to be a preference for such trades to take place bilaterally. Trading on ETPs enhances transparency and market efficiency. We would like to see an increasing share of transactions done on ETPs, he said..
Malhotra further stated that fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continue to engage the RBI’s attention.
“Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers is far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. FX-Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking FX transactions, has witnessed a lukewarm response, and our feedback is that this is largely due to the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers,” The RBI governor said.
He highlighted that there are regulations in place to ensure transparency in pricing for retail customers, including a mandate for disclosing the mid-market or interbank rate to customers. As an industry, there is a need for market-makers to introspect and assess in what ways they can effectively deliver on these regulatory and fiduciary mandates, he added.
Malhotra further stated that the RBI has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.
He urged all the financial market participants, including Authorised Dealers, to extend their full cooperation in ensuring that the pilot is implemented smoothly and successfully.
He red-flagged the use of banking channels for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. “This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,” the RBI Governor said.

Title: Iran, US task experts with framework for a nuclear deal after ‘progress’ in talks
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:31:43 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States agreed on Saturday to begin drawing up a framework for a potential nuclear deal, Iran’s foreign minister said, after talks that a U.S. official described as yielding “very good progress.”
U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers during his first term in 2018, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
At their second indirect meeting in a week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi negotiated for four hours in Rome with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff through an Omani official who shuttled messages between them.
Speaking on state TV after the talks, Araqchi described the engagement as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
“We were able to make some progress on a number of principles and goals, and ultimately reached a better understanding,” Araqchi said.
“It was agreed that negotiations will continue and move into the next phase, in which expert-level meetings will begin on Wednesday in Oman. The experts will have the opportunity to start designing a framework for an agreement,” he said.
The top negotiators would meet again in Oman next Saturday to “review the experts’ work and assess how closely it aligns with the principles of a potential agreement,” he added.
Echoing cautious comments last week from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, he said: “We cannot say for certain that we are optimistic. We are acting very cautiously. There is no reason either to be overly pessimistic.”
Iran, which calls its nuclear programme peaceful, says it is willing to discuss limited curbs to its atomic work in return for lifting international sanctions.
A Trump administration official confirmed that the two sides agreed to meet again next week.
“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” the official said.
Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”
Washington’s ally Israel, which opposed the 2015 agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned in 2018, has not ruled out an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.
Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.
A senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity on Friday, listed its red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:27:10 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidUP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s 1810.HK robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.
Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.
“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.
SOME ROBOTS STRUGGLE
Some robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.
Tang, the robotic centre’s CTO, said: “A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”

Title: Red notice sought from Interpol against Hasina, 11 others: Bangladesh Police
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:28:57 +0000
Content: The National Central Bureau (NCB) of Bangladesh Police has submitted a request to Interpol seeking a ‘red notice’ against 12 people, including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; former road transport and bridges minister and Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader; and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan.
Confirming the development, Enamul Haque Sagor, Assistant Inspector General (Media) at the Police Headquarters, said on Saturday that the NCB branch makes such requests to Interpol based on appeals received from courts, public prosecutors, or investigating agencies, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
“These applications are filed in connection with allegations that emerge during investigations or through ongoing case proceedings,” he said.
Interpol plays a key role in identifying the locations of fugitives residing abroad. Once the whereabouts of any absconding individual are confirmed, that information is relayed to Interpol, the AIG added.
The request for the Red Notice is currently under process, he noted.
Meanwhile, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of the International Crimes Tribunal, Dhaka in November last year formally requested the Police Headquarters to seek Interpol’s assistance in arresting Sheikh Hasina and others deemed fugitives, reports UNB.
