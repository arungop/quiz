Title: Bhutan turns to ‘green’ cryptocurrency to fuel economy
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:18:29 +0000
Content: The Himalayan nation of Bhutan is exploring ways to mine and leverage green cryptocurrencies using hydropower to boost its economy and create jobs to reduce brain drain, the chief executive of its sovereign wealth fund said.
Green cryptocurrencies are digital currencies mined using clean energy resources such as wind, hydro or solar power instead of fossil fuel.
Sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, Bhutan has earned millions of dollars in recent years by investing in some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies and used some of its profit to pay government salaries for two years, two senior officials in Thimphu, the capital said.
“We are a nation that runs 100% on hydropower, and every digital coin we mine in Bhutan using hydropower offsets that coin which gets mined using fossil fuels,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, the CEO of the fund, Druk Holding and Investments Ltd.
“So a coin mined in Bhutan will contribute to the green economy,” he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Dahal said the fund, which controls Bhutan’s only power generation utility, began adding cryptocurrencies to its portfolio in 2019, seeing virtual currencies as a tactical investment and a gamechanger for the country.
Bhutan is famed for its Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, an economic gauge that incorporates factors ignored by the usual measures of gross domestic product, such as recreation, emotional well-being and sustainability.
It uses hydropower to operate energy-guzzling supercomputers to create digital assets that can be added to the blockchain.
Officials are exploring whether large conglomerates could buy Bhutan’s “green” coins to meet their targets on environmental, social and governance (ESG) norms.
“Bitcoin has not just given more value to hydropower energy, it has also increased access to liquidity in foreign currency,” said Dahal, who added that training Bhutan’s young people in blockchain and AI techniques would fuel jobs.
The nation of about 800,000 is battling an exodus of young, educated people. The government estimates that more than a tenth of its young people sought greener pastures between 2022 and 2023, taking unemployment in that age group to 16.5% in 2024.
Analysts said Bhutan’s ambitious plan to become the capital of green digital currency depends on expanding its hydropower generation to a potential of 33 gigawatts versus existing capacity of about 3.5 gigawatts.
“We have plans to generate 15 gigawatts in the next 10 to 15 years,” Dahal added.

Title: Soccer-Saudi Arabia open to 64-team World Cup in 2034
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:50:53 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia would be ready and willing to host a 64-team World Cup in 2034 if FIFA accepts a controversial proposal to expand the tournament from 48, according to the kingdom’s sports minister.
South America’s CONMEBOL has officially suggested staging the centenary 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with 64 teams but the idea has been opposed by some other continental confederations.
Next year’s tournament hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will have 48 countries participating, up from 32 in 2022.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told a select group of reporters at the Saudi Arabian Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah that his country would have no objection to an increase in the numbers for 2034.
“We’re ready, or we will be ready, inshallah (God willing). If that’s a decision that FIFA takes and thinks that that’s a good decision for everyone, then we’re more than happy to deliver on it,” he said.
He pointed to the infrastructure already in place for Islamic pilgrims, with four million people attending Mecca for Umrah during Ramadan this year and five million expected for the Hajj.
The global soccer governing body officially announced Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 men’s World Cup in December, a bid that was uncontested but strongly criticised by rights organisations.
The Kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years but critics accuse it of ‘sportswashing’ its human rights record. The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The bid book pledged 15 stadiums, new or refurbished, by 2032 and which are expected to be completed with the help of migrant labour.
Al-Faisal said worker safety was of the highest priority and Saudi organisers were talking regularly with FIFA and 2022 hosts and neighbours Qatar, the first World Cup in the region, to learn from their experience.
He said the death, reported last month, of a worker at the Aramco Stadium construction site in Al Khobar had come after millions of hours without issue.
“Every incident we take seriously, we file an investigation, we look what went wrong,” said the minister. “Unfortunately, in construction, these things happen.”
He said Saudi Arabia was part of the International Labour Organisation and a 2021 Labour Reform Act had abolished the kafala system that binds migrant workers to one employer and prevents them from leaving without the employer’s approval.
Alcohol, prohibited for observant Muslims, is banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Faisal confirmed the World Cup would be dry.
“The law now here in Saudi is that there’s no alcohol. Will that change in the future? We don’t know. But I don’t see it really affecting our sporting events at all,” he said.
“We’ve had more than 100 international events so far. We’ve had people come from all over the world to attend these sporting events. And everyone’s happy with the hospitality, the setup, the experience that they get.
“I don’t see it as an issue, to be honest. So I hope it’s not going to be an issue”.
Alcohol was not sold at stadiums in Qatar, where drinking in public is illegal, in 2022 but beer was available at designated fan zones and in some hotels.

Title: Prime Minister’s  Jeddah visit set to marks new chapter in India-Saudi Arabia relations
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:41:20 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Jeddah this week, marking the first visit by an Indian leader to Saudi Arabia’s commercial hub in over four decades. The high-profile visit underscores the remarkable transformation of India-Saudi relations from modest beginnings to a comprehensive strategic partnership spanning economic, defense, and cultural dimensions.
The visit comes amid intensified diplomatic engagement between the two nations, with 11 ministerial-level visits from India to Saudi Arabia since the beginning of 2024 alone.
Speaking about the significance of the upcoming visit, Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Suhel Ajaz Khan said, “The Honorable Prime Minister is visiting from April 22nd to 23rd. This is his first visit to Jeddah, though on two previous occasions he has visited Saudi Arabia. This visit is very important as we are strengthening our strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia.”
The Ambassador highlighted how bilateral ties have evolved in recent years. “Our people-to-people connections and the strategic partnership have given a new direction to the relationship. Talks are expected to cover various areas including defense partnership, energy cooperation, and many other issues related to regional and global political scenarios,” he added.
Saudi Arabia is home to approximately 2.7 million Indians who continue to play a vital role in the Kingdom’s development. “The community has participated in the development of Saudi Arabia and continues to contribute towards its prosperity while maintaining a strong connection with India. In fact, the Indian community serves as a living bridge between India and Saudi Arabia,” Khan noted.
The visit is expected to result in several new agreements that will further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations, building on their shared interests in regional stability, energy security, and economic growth.

Title: Scientists create novel method to identify healthy and cancerous cells
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:24:59 +0000
Content: Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan on Saturday said they have found that the motion of unlabelled cells can be used to tell whether they are cancerous or healthy.
They observed malignant fibrosarcoma cells and healthy fibroblasts on a dish and found that tracking and analysis of their paths can be used to differentiate them with up to 94 per cent accuracy.
Beyond diagnosis, their technique may also shed light on cell motility related functions, like tissue healing, according to the study published in the journal PLOS One.
The team of researchers, led by Professor Hiromi Miyoshi, came up with a way of tracking cells using phase-contrast microscopy, one of the most common ways of observing cells.
Phase-contrast microscopy is entirely label free, allowing cells to move about on a petri dish closer to their native state, and is not affected by the optical properties of the plastic petri dishes through which cells are imaged.
Through innovative image analysis, they were able to extract trajectories of many individual cells. They focused on properties of the paths taken, like migration speed, and how curvy the paths were, all of which would encode subtle differences in deformation and movement.
As a test, they compared healthy fibroblast cells, the key component of animal tissue, and malignant fibrosarcoma cells, cancerous cells which derive from fibrous connective tissue.
They were able to show that the cells migrated in subtly different ways, as characterised by the “sum of turn angles” (how curvy the paths were), the frequency of shallow turns, and how quickly they moved. In fact, by combining both the sum of turn angles and how often they made shallow turns, they could predict whether a cell was cancerous or not with an accuracy of 94 per cent.
The team’s work not only promises a new way to discriminate cancer cells, but applications to research of any biological function based on cell motility, like the healing of wounds and tissue growth, said the study.

Title: India’s forex, money markets have doubled in last 4 years: RBI Governor
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:06:37 +0000
Content: India’s financial markets have developed into a dynamic and resilient force to fuel economic growth with an almost doubling of the foreign exchange market from $32 billion in 2020 to $60 billion in 2024 and the average daily volumes in the overnight money markets surging from about Rs 3 lakh crore to over Rs 5.4 lakh in this four-year period, according to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.
There has also been a 40 per cent surge in average daily volumes in the government securities (G-secs) markets to Rs 66,000 crore over the same period.
Addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI annual conference in Bali this weekend, Malhotra said the levels of transparency in Indian markets are at par with the best in the world.
“With recent regulatory reforms, we have seen greater product and participant diversity, and the onshore and offshore markets have become tightly integrated,” he pointed out.
Malhotra said all the financial market segments of the country, including Forex, G-sec, and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the Rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground.
The foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads. There is growing transparency in this market. All FX derivatives are reported to the Trade Repository, and reporting of cash and spot transactions has commenced. A bulk of FX spot transactions are traded on electronic trading platforms (ETPs). Authorised trading platforms are also available for forward transactions, but there appears to be a preference for such trades to take place bilaterally. Trading on ETPs enhances transparency and market efficiency. We would like to see an increasing share of transactions done on ETPs, he said..
Malhotra further stated that fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continue to engage the RBI’s attention.
“Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers is far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. FX-Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking FX transactions, has witnessed a lukewarm response, and our feedback is that this is largely due to the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers,” The RBI governor said.
He highlighted that there are regulations in place to ensure transparency in pricing for retail customers, including a mandate for disclosing the mid-market or interbank rate to customers. As an industry, there is a need for market-makers to introspect and assess in what ways they can effectively deliver on these regulatory and fiduciary mandates, he added.
Malhotra further stated that the RBI has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.
He urged all the financial market participants, including Authorised Dealers, to extend their full cooperation in ensuring that the pilot is implemented smoothly and successfully.
He red-flagged the use of banking channels for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. “This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,” the RBI Governor said.

Title: Iran, US task experts with framework for a nuclear deal after ‘progress’ in talks
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:31:43 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States agreed on Saturday to begin drawing up a framework for a potential nuclear deal, Iran’s foreign minister said, after talks that a U.S. official described as yielding “very good progress.”
U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers during his first term in 2018, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
At their second indirect meeting in a week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi negotiated for four hours in Rome with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff through an Omani official who shuttled messages between them.
Speaking on state TV after the talks, Araqchi described the engagement as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
“We were able to make some progress on a number of principles and goals, and ultimately reached a better understanding,” Araqchi said.
“It was agreed that negotiations will continue and move into the next phase, in which expert-level meetings will begin on Wednesday in Oman. The experts will have the opportunity to start designing a framework for an agreement,” he said.
The top negotiators would meet again in Oman next Saturday to “review the experts’ work and assess how closely it aligns with the principles of a potential agreement,” he added.
Echoing cautious comments last week from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, he said: “We cannot say for certain that we are optimistic. We are acting very cautiously. There is no reason either to be overly pessimistic.”
Iran, which calls its nuclear programme peaceful, says it is willing to discuss limited curbs to its atomic work in return for lifting international sanctions.
A Trump administration official confirmed that the two sides agreed to meet again next week.
“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” the official said.
Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”
Washington’s ally Israel, which opposed the 2015 agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned in 2018, has not ruled out an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.
Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.
A senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity on Friday, listed its red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:27:10 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidUP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s 1810.HK robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.
Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.
“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.
SOME ROBOTS STRUGGLE
Some robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.
Tang, the robotic centre’s CTO, said: “A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”

Title: Red notice sought from Interpol against Hasina, 11 others: Bangladesh Police
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:28:57 +0000
Content: The National Central Bureau (NCB) of Bangladesh Police has submitted a request to Interpol seeking a ‘red notice’ against 12 people, including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; former road transport and bridges minister and Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader; and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan.
Confirming the development, Enamul Haque Sagor, Assistant Inspector General (Media) at the Police Headquarters, said on Saturday that the NCB branch makes such requests to Interpol based on appeals received from courts, public prosecutors, or investigating agencies, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
“These applications are filed in connection with allegations that emerge during investigations or through ongoing case proceedings,” he said.
Interpol plays a key role in identifying the locations of fugitives residing abroad. Once the whereabouts of any absconding individual are confirmed, that information is relayed to Interpol, the AIG added.
The request for the Red Notice is currently under process, he noted.
Meanwhile, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of the International Crimes Tribunal, Dhaka in November last year formally requested the Police Headquarters to seek Interpol’s assistance in arresting Sheikh Hasina and others deemed fugitives, reports UNB.

Title: JP Nadda leads pledge for healthy liver, highlights importance of a healthy lifestyle
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 07:14:20 +0000
Content: Union Health Minister JP Nadda on Monday attended a pledge-taking ceremony for liver health at Nirman Bhawan in the national capital, where he emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy liver.
Highlighting the importance of liver health, Nadda said, “We are fortunate to be here today. We must keep certain things in mind. First, if the liver is healthy, digestion functions well. A healthy liver aids in detoxification and energy storage.”
He also pointed out that when the liver is not functioning properly, it can lead to various health issues such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and even cancer.
“But if the liver is not in good condition, our body becomes vulnerable to several diseases — heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and even cancer. That’s why it’s important to care for the liver, and the key to that is maintaining a healthy lifestyle,” he added.
Nadda stressed that people often unknowingly harm their bodies due to a lack of awareness about healthy habits. He also emphasized the need for healthcare professionals to prioritize their own health.
“The biggest issue is that, knowingly or unknowingly, we do a lot of injustice to our bodies. We don’t always know what is good or bad for us, and often assume we’re doing fine. That’s why we decided to organize this health camp — at the very least, those responsible for public health should themselves be healthy,” he said.
Speaking about liver disease prevention, Nadda noted that many liver problems are reversible with timely lifestyle changes.
“What’s encouraging is that many liver-related problems are reversible. If we adopt healthier lifestyles, these issues can be resolved. The liver can heal on its own. What’s important is to understand the condition and how to maintain it, even when it seems fine,” he said.
Earlier, on April 19, marking World Liver Day, Nadda urged people to reduce their edible oil intake by at least 10% and adopt healthier habits.
“This #WorldLiverDay, take a pledge to reduce your edible oil intake by at least 10% and embrace a healthier lifestyle. Small changes can lead to big results when we treat food as medicine,” he wrote in a post on X, responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s similar call for reducing oil consumption.
The Union Minister also launched a nationwide initiative to tackle liver disease: HEALD — Healthy Liver Education and Alcohol-associated Liver Disease Prevention. This first-of-its-kind program is envisioned as a multi-sectoral initiative combining public education, early screening, psychological and medical treatment for alcohol use disorders, and liver disease management.

Title: Civil servants’ role crucial in achieving Viksit Bharat, says PM Modi on Civil Services Day
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:57:50 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday addressed the 17th Civil Services Day programme in the national capital, lauding the relentless efforts of India’s civil servants and underlining their key role in realising the dream of a ‘Viksit Bharat.’
Speaking at Vigyan Bhawan, PM Modi paid rich tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, recalling his iconic 1947 address in which he called civil servants the “steel frame” of India.
“This Civil Services Day is special for several reasons. We are celebrating 75 years of our Constitution and the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. On April 21, 1947, he had described you (civil servants) as the steel frame of India,” he said.
Reflecting on Patel’s vision, the Prime Minister said, “He laid out the ideals of a civil servant — one who serves the nation with honesty, discipline, democratic spirit, and dedication. These lessons of Sardar Patel become even more relevant as we move towards the resolution of Viksit Bharat.”
PM Modi said that achieving the dream of a Viksit Bharat will require every arm of progress to work in synergy.
“Our bureaucracy and policy-making cannot function with outdated methods when the world is evolving so quickly. Our young generation is growing up with rapid technological changes, new gadgets every two to three years. We must match this pace,” he stated.
Highlighting areas where India must grow — from clean energy to sports and space — the Prime Minister stressed, “Everyone is looking towards you (civil servants). You have a big responsibility to help India become the world’s third-largest economy. We must work together to ensure this goal is achieved.”
This year’s theme for Civil Services Day is ‘Holistic Development of India,’ which the Prime Minister explained as “no village left behind, no family left behind.”
He also presented the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration, recognising top-performing officials behind initiatives like PM Vishwakarma, Poshan Tracker, Siksha Setu Axom, and Sugamya Pustakalaya.
“Good governance is not defined by the number of schemes but by the impact it creates on the ground,” he said. Citing examples, he mentioned districts where solar power and improved attendance systems have shown positive results and praised the efforts of public administrators across the country.
He added that in the last decade, India has moved beyond incremental progress to transformative change.
“Today, India’s governance model focuses on next-generation reforms. Through technology and innovation, we’re bridging the gap between government and citizens. These changes are visible not only in urban and rural areas but also in remote corners of the country,” he said.
PM Modi cited Bhagalpur in Bihar, where the registration of pregnant women in Jagdishpur block rose from 25 per cent to over 90 per cent. In Marwah block of Jammu and Kashmir, institutional deliveries increased from 30 per cent to 100 per cent, reflecting improved healthcare access.
Touching upon India’s global leadership, the Prime Minister highlighted the scale of its G20 presidency. “For the first time in G20 history, more than 200 meetings took place across over 60 cities, creating a wide and inclusive footprint. This is the holistic approach of today’s India,” he said, adding, “India is not just participating — India is leading.”
He noted that while many now talk about government efficiency, India is already ahead of other countries by a decade. “We have eliminated delays and are creating new processes. Over 40,000 compliances have been removed to boost ease of doing business,” he said.
The Prime Minister recalled early opposition to reforms, including compliance reduction and decriminalisation of business errors.
He said that the foundation laid over the past decade has greatly strengthened the path towards Viksit Bharat 2047.
“We cannot evaluate our work or performance by comparing it to previous governments…We must set our own benchmarks. We need to measure how far we still are from the goal of a ‘Viksit Bharat by 2047’. The time for tallying up what we have achieved so far is over.
“India is now the most populous country in the world. Ensuring saturation of basic facilities should be our top priority,” the Prime Minister added.
“In the last ten years, we built 4 crore (40 million) permanent houses for the poor, but now we have a target of building 3 crore more. We have provided tap water connections to 12 crore homes in 5–6 years. Now, we must ensure every household has access to tap water as soon as possible. In ten years, we have built over 11 crore toilets for the poor. Now, we need to quickly achieve new targets related to waste management,” he mentioned.
He also launched two e-books — Holistic Development of Districts and Select Innovations — and honoured top-performing districts in schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM Vishwakarma Yojana, Har Ghar Jal, and PM Awas Yojana.
Awarded districts included Rajkot in Gujarat, Gomti in Tripura, Tinsukia in Assam, Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir, and Koraput in Odisha.
Blocks recognised under the Aspirational Block Programme included Gamharia (Jharkhand), Parappa (Kerala), Narnoor (Telangana), Ganganagar (Tripura), and Rama (Madhya Pradesh).

Title: ‘Cancer’ of billion-dollar cyberscam industry spreading globally – UN
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:49:10 +0000
Content: Asian crime syndicates behind the multibillion-dollar cyberscam industry are expanding globally including to South America and Africa, as raids in Southeast Asia fail to contain their activities, the United Nations said in a report on Monday.
Criminal networks that emerged in Southeast Asia in recent years, opening sprawling compounds housing tens of thousands of workers, many trafficked and forced to scam victims around the world, have evolved into a sophisticated global industry, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.
Even as Southeast Asian governments have intensified a crackdown, syndicates have moved within and beyond the region, the agency said, adding that a “potentially irreversible spillover has taken place… leaving criminal groups free to pick, choose, and move… as needed”.
“It spreads like a cancer,” said John Wojcik, a regional analyst for UNODC. “Authorities treat it in one area, but the roots never disappear; they simply migrate.”
Conservative estimates indicate there are hundreds of large-scale scam farms around the world generating tens of billions of dollars in annual profits, the UNODC said. The agency called on countries to work together and intensify efforts to disrupt the gangs’ financing.
“The regional cyberfraud industry… has outpaced other transnational crimes, given that it is easily scalable and able to reach millions of potential victims online, with no need to move or traffic illicit goods across borders,” said Wojcik.
The United States alone reported more than $5.6 billion in losses to cryptocurrency scams in 2023, including more than $4 million in so-called pig-butchering scams or romance scams designed to extort money from often elderly and vulnerable people.
‘INFLECTION POINT’
In recent months, authorities from China, where many of the gangs originate, Thailand and Myanmar have led a crackdown on scam operations in lawless areas of the Thai-Myanmar border, with Thailand cutting power, fuel and internet supply to areas housing scam compounds.
But syndicates have adapted, shifting operations between “the most remote, vulnerable, and underprepared parts of Southeast Asia”, especially in Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia, and beyond, exploiting jurisdictions with weak governance and high rates of corruption, the UNODC said.
Raids in parts of Cambodia where the industry is most visible “led to significant expansion in more remote locations”, including the country’s western Koh Kong province, as well as areas bordering Thailand and Vietnam, the U.N. agency said.
New sites also continue to be developed in Myanmar, it added, a country in the throes of an expanding conflict since the military seized power four years ago.
Spokespeople for the Cambodian government and Myanmar junta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Syndicates have expanded into South America, the U.N. agency said, seeking to enhance money laundering and underground banking partnerships with South American drug cartels.
They are increasingly establishing operations in Africa, including in Zambia, Angola, and Namibia, and in Eastern Europe including Georgia, the agency said.
Gangs have also rapidly diversified their workforce, recruiting people from dozens of nationalities, according to the agency, reflecting how the industry scams targets across the globe and has sought to evade anti-trafficking efforts.
Citizens of more than 50 countries – from Brazil to Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan – were rescued during recent crackdowns on the Thai-Myanmar border.
The international community is at a “critical inflection point,” the UNODC said, urging that failure to address the problem would have “unprecedented consequences for Southeast Asia that reverberate globally”.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released two e-Coffee Table Books — “Holistic Development of Districts for Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration” and “Select Innovations from Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration” — highlighting exemplary governance initiatives and innovative practices recognized under the Prime Minister’s Awards.
The Prime Minister also conferred the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration for effective implementation of identified priority programmes and innovations to districts, as well as central and state government organisations.
A film showcasing the award-winning initiatives was screened before the presentation of the awards.
Jharkhand’s Gamharia block in Seraikella-Kharsawan district received the Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence in Public Administration, 2024, in the category of the Aspirational Block Programme. Ravi Shankar Shukla, Deputy Commissioner of Seraikella-Kharsawan, received the award on behalf of block Gamharia, which secured first place among 500 aspirational blocks across the country.
Civil Services Day is an occasion for civil servants across India to rededicate themselves to the service of citizens and renew their commitment to public service and excellence in governance. This date commemorates the day when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel addressed the probationers of the Administrative Service at Metcalfe House, Delhi, in 1947.
To mark Civil Services Day, the government is organising a day-long conference at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi.
The Aspirational Block Programme is a NITI Aayog initiative, launched on January 7, 2023. It focuses on improving the overall quality of life in 500 underdeveloped blocks across the country by accelerating socio-economic development through improved governance, service delivery, and monitoring of key indicators. The programme focuses on five areas: health and nutrition, education, agriculture and allied services, basic infrastructure, and social development.
The Scheme for Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration was instituted to recognise extraordinary and innovative work done by districts and organisations of the central and state governments for the welfare of the common citizen.

Title: China warns countries against striking trade deals with US at its expense
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 05:07:06 +0000
Content: China on Monday accused Washington of abusing tariffs and warned countries against striking a broader economic deal with the United States at its expense, ratcheting up its rhetoric in a spiralling trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Beijing will firmly oppose any party striking a deal at China’s expense and “will take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner,” its Commerce Ministry said.
The ministry was responding to a Bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the Trump administration is preparing to pressure nations seeking tariff reductions or exemptions from the U.S. to curb trade with China, including imposing monetary sanctions.
President Donald Trump paused the sweeping tariffs he announced on dozens of countries on April 2 except those on China, singling out the world’s second largest economy for the biggest levies.
In a series of moves, Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting Beijing to slap retaliatory duties of 125% on U.S. goods. Last week, China signalled that its own across-the-board rates would not rise further.
“The United States has abused tariffs on all trading partners under the banner of so-called ‘equivalence’, while also forcing all parties to start so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ negotiations with them,” the ministry spokesperson said.
China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests, and is willing to strengthen solidarity with all parties, the ministry said.
“The fact is, nobody wants to pick a side,” said Bo Zhengyuan, partner at China-based policy consultancy Plenum.
“If countries have high reliance on China in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, I don’t think they’ll be buying into U.S. demands. Many Southeast Asian countries belong to this category.”
Pursuing a hardline stance, Beijing will this week convene an informal United Nations Security Council meeting to accuse Washington of bullying and “casting a shadow over the global efforts for peace and development” by weaponizing tariffs.
Earlier this month, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said nearly 50 countries have approached him to discuss the steep additional tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
Several bilateral talks on tariffs have taken place since, with Japan considering raising soybean and rice imports as part of its talks with the U.S. while Indonesia is planning to increase U.S. food and commodities imports and reduce orders from other nations.
CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE
Trump’s tariff policies have rattled financial markets as investors fear a severe disruption in world trade could tip the global economy into recession.
On Monday, Chinese stocks inched higher, showing little reaction to the commerce ministry comments, though investors have generally remained cautious on Chinese assets due to the rising growth risks.
The Trump administration also has been trying to curb Beijing’s progress in developing advanced semiconductor chips which it says could be used for military purposes, and last week imposed port fees on China-built vessels to limit China’s dominance in shipbuilding.
AI chip giant Nvidia said last week it would take $5.5 billion in charges due to the administration’s curbs on AI chip exports.
China’s President Xi Jinping visited three Southeast Asian countries last week in a move to bolster regional ties, calling on trade partners to oppose unilateral bullying.
Beijing has said it is “tearing down walls” and expanding its circle of trading partners amid the trade row.
The stakes are high for Southeast Asian nations caught in the crossfire of the Sino-U.S. tariff war, particularly given the regional ASEAN bloc’s huge two-way trade with both China and the United States.
ASEAN is China’s largest trading partner, with total trade value reaching $234 billion in the first quarter of 2025 and accounting for over 16% of China’s overall foreign trade, China’s customs agency said last week.
Trade between ASEAN and the U.S. totalled around $476.8 billion in 2024, according to U.S. figures, making Washington the regional bloc’s fourth-largest trading partner.
“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” Xi said in an article published in Vietnamese media, without mentioning the United States.

Title: ISRO’s SpaDeX mission completes second docking of satellites
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 05:00:43 +0000
Content: Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh announced on Monday that ISRO’s SpaDEX mission has successfully achieved its second satellite docking.
Sharing the news on social media platform X, the minister said, “Glad to inform that the second docking of satellites has been accomplished successfully.”
He also recalled the progress of the mission, stating, “As informed earlier, the PSLV-C60 / SpaDEX mission was successfully launched on December 30, 2024. The first docking was successfully completed on January 16, 2025, at 6:20 AM, and the satellites were undocked on March 13, 2025, at 9:20 AM.”
Dr. Singh further mentioned that more experiments are planned over the next two weeks.
The successful docking of the SpaDEX satellites in January made India the fourth country in the world to achieve satellite docking in space, joining the ranks of the US, Russia, and China.
The mission involved the docking of two small spacecraft — SDX01 (the Chaser) and SDX02 (the Target) — each weighing around 220 kg. These satellites were launched aboard the PSLV-C60 rocket from Sriharikota on December 30, 2024.
The docking technology, indigenously developed by ISRO, is known as the Bharatiya Docking System. It includes a docking mechanism, a suite of four rendezvous and docking sensors, power transfer capability, an inter-satellite communication link (ISL), and a unique autonomous docking strategy with built-in intelligence that allows each spacecraft to understand the state of the other.
According to ISRO, the SpaDEX mission is a major step toward building India’s capabilities in orbital docking — a crucial technology for future human spaceflight, satellite servicing missions, and establishing a space station.
This technology will also be essential for India’s upcoming missions, such as future lunar expeditions like Chandrayaan-4, and for conducting operations without relying on Earth-based navigation systems like GNSS.

Content: The domestic benchmark indices opened higher on Monday amid positive global cues, as buying was seen in the IT, PSU bank and financial services sectors in the early trade.
At around 9.29 am, Sensex was trading 396.06 points or 0.50 per cent up at 78,949.26 while the Nifty added 98.20 points or 0.41 per cent at 23,949.85.

According to market watchers, after the positive opening, Nifty is likely to find support at 23,700, followed by 22,600 and 22,500. On the upside, 24,000 may act as the immediate resistance, followed by 24,200 and 24,500.
“Bank Nifty charts indicate potential support at 54,000, followed by 53,700 and 53,500. If the index moves higher, resistance could emerge at 54,500, with subsequent levels at 54,700 and 55,000,” said Mandar Bhojane of Choice Broking.
Large private banks took the lead, surging to new all-time highs. Their quarterly results over the weekend aligned with market expectations and will continue to drive markets higher, said experts.
According to analysts, US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India comes with hopes that both countries can secure a quick deal and a reprieve from weightier levies while maintaining a 10 per cent baseline tariff.
As earnings season progresses, market participants will scrutinise corporate commentaries for insights into how businesses adapt to the new tariff regime and what they observe throughout their supply chains and customer bases, said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities.
Meanwhile, in the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank were the top gainers. Whereas, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Titan, Sun Pharma and UltraTech Cement were the top losers.

Title: PM Modi to Make Third Visit to Saudi Arabia, Building on Strategic Partnership
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:02:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on April 22-23, 2025, on a bilateral visit. This marks Modi’s third official trip to the Kingdom, following previous visits in 2016 and 2019.
 
The upcoming visit underscores Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance to India across multiple dimensions. The Kingdom remains crucial for India’s energy security and hosts one of the world’s largest Indian expatriate communities, estimated to be the second largest such community globally.
 
Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading voice in the Islamic world and its increasing role in regional developments further elevates the significance of this diplomatic engagement. The visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the already robust relationship between the two nations.
 
For India, Saudi Arabia remains a critical partner not only in crisis response but also in ensuring the safety of its diaspora and advancing broader regional stability. The ongoing high-level  engagement signals both countries’ commitment to further strengthening their multifaceted partnership, with the Sudan crisis serving as a recent example of effective cooperation in times of emergency. 
 
India’s “Operation Kaveri” successfully evacuated over 3,500 Indian nationals from Sudan with crucial logistical support from Saudi Arabia, which facilitated the safe transit of evacuees through Jeddah. Indian officials have acknowledged that this operation’s success heavily relied on the excellent cooperation provided by Saudi officials and government organizations.
 
This practical cooperation reflects the deepening ties between India and Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the Strategic Partnership Council in 2019. The relationship has expanded across multiple sectors including defense, trade, energy, technology, and culture, said Dr. Prince Mufti Ziaul Hasan, who is part of the Indian Diaspora in Jeddah and instrumental in Operation Kaveri.
 
Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming discussions are expected to focus on regional security, humanitarian coordination, and strategies for addressing ongoing crises such as Sudan. These talks will likely reaffirm the two nations’ shared interests and growing influence in West Asian affairs as they continue to develop their strategic partnership.

Title: Meditation and International Meditation Day: The Battle for Inner Stillness in a Distracted World
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:18:06 +0000
Content: In a world where artificial intelligence suggests what to think, algorithms dictate how to feel, and screens consume human attention, meditation emerges as an act of quiet defiance. No longer confined to monks in the Himalayas or sages on the banks of the Ganges, it has become an essential tool for modern existence.
Yet, as the world marks International Meditation Day, the essence of this ancient practice is at risk of being diluted. Meditation, once a path to deep self-awareness and spiritual liberation, is now increasingly repackaged as a quick-fix solution, offered through wellness apps, corporate stress-reduction programs, and productivity tools. While these adaptations bring meditation into mainstream consciousness, they often strip away its original depth, reducing it to yet another commodity in an era of relentless distractions.
International Meditation Day was not created as a symbolic initiative — it was born out of necessity. It has become a survival tool for the modern mind, a response to the growing crisis of mental fatigue, fractured societies, and the overstimulation of the digital age.
The day is marked by global gatherings, virtual sessions, and guided meditations that unite people across cultures. From mass meditation events in cities like New York, London, and Delhi to online mindfulness workshops hosted by global wellness communities, the day serves as a reminder of the collective power of stillness.
Organizations like the Art of Living and the Mindfulness Project host special programs, while schools and workplaces incorporate meditation sessions to highlight its benefits.
The question here is not whether meditation is relevant — but whether it can serve as a counterbalance to the unprecedented mental overload of contemporary life.
Even world leaders have begun to acknowledge meditation’s significance in tackling stress and improving focus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 address, highlighted the practice as a powerful antidote to anxiety, particularly for students grappling with academic pressure.
“Meditation and breath control are extremely effective in calming the mind. When you are stressed, focus on identifying different sounds around you — it will instantly ground you in the present,” he advised. He also emphasized the power of Pranayama, adding, “Breathing exercises generate energy and stabilize the body in seconds.”
Modi’s message underscores a broader truth — meditation is not just a wellness practice; it is a tool for clarity, resilience, and self-mastery in an era of cognitive overload.
For centuries, meditation was an intimate and introspective pursuit, requiring patience, discipline, and effort. Today, ironically, it has been rebranded into five-minute guided sessions on mobile apps, squeezed in between meetings and social media scrolling.
This shift is not accidental. It reflects a larger, ongoing battle for human attention.
In the last decade, digital technology has completely reshaped human behaviour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognized stress as the epidemic of the 21st century — a reflection of the relentless pressures of modern life. Unlike physical illnesses that can be diagnosed and treated through conventional medicine, stress operates as a silent disruptor, affecting mental health, cognitive function, and even physical well-being. Chronic stress has been linked to a host of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to weakened immune responses, making it a global health crisis that transcends geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.
The toll of this crisis is perhaps most evident in the alarming rise in suicide rates worldwide. Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, have emerged as leading causes of disability, pushing individuals to the brink of emotional collapse. The increasing social isolation caused by digital engagement, economic anxieties, and the competitive pressures of modern society have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and despair. Many countries are grappling with the repercussions of a mental health crisis that remains underfunded and often overlooked, despite its devastating impact on families and communities.
Workplace stress has also reached unprecedented levels, with a 2023 global survey revealing that over 80% of workers experience stress on a daily basis. The blurring of work-life boundaries, particularly with the rise of remote work and the always-on digital culture, has created an environment where employees struggle to disconnect. The pressure to meet deadlines, the fear of job instability, and the expectation of constant availability have all contributed to rising burnout rates. This relentless cycle not only affects individual well-being but also leads to declining productivity, increased absenteeism, and a workplace culture that prioritizes output over mental health.
At the heart of this crisis is the explosive rise in digital dependency. Studies indicate that the average person now checks their phone 150 times a day — an unconscious habit that has rewired human attention spans and diminished the ability to focus for extended periods. Screen time has tripled over the past decade, fundamentally altering sleep cycles, cognitive processing, and even interpersonal relationships. What is particularly concerning is that these effects are no longer limited to adults. Children as young as eight years old are exhibiting signs of digital addiction. Excessive exposure to screens, particularly social media and online gaming, has been linked to increased anxiety, attention disorders, and emotional dysregulation in younger generations.
Meditation is often spoken about in the context of individual well-being. But what about its power to heal societies?
India’s contribution to global spirituality is undeniable — from Vedic seers to Gautama Buddha, from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras to modern meditation masters. Yet, for decades, meditation was seen in the West as an exotic practice rather than a universal human tool.
That perception has changed dramatically. Much like the global acceptance of yoga, meditation has also transcended its origins. The success of International Yoga Day (June 21) paved the way for International Meditation Day, marking the shift from viewing meditation as an Eastern tradition to recognizing it as a universal human necessity.
The global recognition of meditation marks a shift from viewing it as an ancient Eastern practice to a universal necessity. But beyond acknowledgment, there lies the big question: can it actively counter the mental and emotional chaos of modern life? Every day, billions of people are caught in a maelstrom of distractions, their consciousness shaped by digital stimuli, economic anxieties, and ideological conflicts. The world’s largest tech companies have mastered the art of keeping users perpetually engaged, while meditation offers a way to step back, unplug, and regain control over one’s own mind.
Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly emphasized the transformative power of meditation for both personal and collective well-being. He urged, “I call upon everyone to make meditation a part of their daily lives and experience its transformative potential. Meditation is a powerful way to bring peace and harmony to one’s life, as well as to our society and planet.” His words resonate far beyond India.
Harvard research confirms as well that meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, counteracting the cognitive decline caused by excessive digital exposure.
Meditation is increasingly finding its place in diplomacy, governance, and international relations as leaders recognize the power of mindfulness in conflict resolution and decision-making. High-level figures, including UN officials and global policymakers, have begun incorporating meditation practices to enhance emotional intelligence, improve focus, and cultivate patience — qualities essential for diplomacy. Philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti once remarked, “The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.”
As the world grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, meditation is emerging not just as a personal wellness tool but as a silent force shaping diplomatic engagements, promoting mindfulness-based leadership, and even de-escalating conflicts through inner stillness.
Some of the greatest figures in history — Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Dalai Lama — all viewed inner peace as a prerequisite for societal harmony.
Today, modern meditation movements are using these same principles to mediate conflicts. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living Foundation, for example, has facilitated peace-building efforts in war zones such as Colombia and Iraq. His words reflect the power of meditation in fostering global healing. He says, “Meditation is the journey from sound to silence, from movement to stillness, from a limited identity to unlimited space.”
India can protect its spiritual landscapes from the relentless march of urbanization by implementing:


Meditation Conservation Zones: Establishing legally protected meditation zones, similar to wildlife sanctuaries, could safeguard sacred forests, riverbanks, and mountain retreats from unchecked commercial exploitation.


Eco-Spiritual Tourism: Encouraging responsible tourism models can generate revenue for conservation without disrupting the ecological balance of meditation retreats. Destinations like Rishikesh, Dharamsala, and the sacred groves of Kerala must be protected not just as tourist spots but as centres of spiritual heritage.


Local Guardianship: Empowering local communities to act as stewards of meditation sites ensures preservation efforts remain culturally sensitive and sustainable. Traditional caretakers, including monks and indigenous groups, have long protected these spaces. Formalizing their role can strengthen conservation efforts.


Sacred geography is not just about aesthetics — it is about energetic and spiritual preservation. The destruction of India’s meditation landscapes is not just an environmental loss; it is a loss of humanity’s connection to stillness itself.
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The world is one family — Ancient Indian philosophy never viewed meditation as an isolated practice. The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam suggests that when individuals meditate, they uplift the collective consciousness of society.
Meditation in Historical Leadership — Indian warriors and kings practiced meditation before battle, not to suppress fear, but to cultivate clarity. Emperor Ashoka’s transformation after the Kalinga war is a testament to the power of meditation in reshaping leadership and governance.
While meditation has been embraced by the corporate world, it must be more than just a tool for stress relief. Its true purpose extends into leadership, governance, and conflict resolution. It has become a new language of diplomacy — an integration where wisdom, patience, and emotional intelligence are needed most. It must be recognized as a global movement, one that calls for a deeper shift in human consciousness.
The roots of meditation have always been intertwined with nature, yet modern life has severed this connection. The philosophy of ancient Indian traditions — from the Pancha Mahabhutas (Five Great Elements) to Buddhist mindfulness — emphasizes that human well-being is inseparable from the well-being of the planet. International Meditation Day should serve as a reminder that stillness is not passive; it is a radical, transformative act that can shift the way individuals, leaders, and societies operate in an overstimulated world.
This International Meditation Day, let us meditate in silence, let us meditate with purpose. The future of our minds, our relationships, and our planet depends on our ability to reclaim stillness — and to truly live the reality of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Title: Kremlin says U.S. position ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gives satisfaction
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:07:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that the position of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gave Moscow satisfaction, but declined to comment on Trump’s hopes for deal this week.
U.S. envoy General Keith Kellogg said on Sunday that NATO membership was “off the table” for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said previous U.S. support for Ukraine’s bid to join NATO was a cause of the war.
“We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is excluded,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.” Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position.”
Peskov said that Ukrainian membership of the U.S.-led alliance would “pose a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And, in fact, this is one of the root causes of this conflict.”
Putin has repeatedly said that Russia would be willing to end the war if Ukraine officially dropped its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.
Media reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.
Trump said on Sunday he hopes Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about those remarks, Peskov said: “I don’t want to make any comments right now, especially about the time frame.”
“President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,” Peskov said.
He refused to comment directly on a Bloomberg report that the United States is prepared to recognise Russian control of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement.
“Work on finding a peaceful settlement cannot take place, and should not take place, in public,” Peskov said. “It should take place in an absolutely discrete mode.”

Title: Sensex surges 855 points; banks, IT lead market rally
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:03:54 +0000
Content: Extending its winning streak for the fifth consecutive session, the Indian stock market closed sharply higher on Monday, driven by strong gains in banking, IT, and auto stocks.
 
The Sensex jumped 855.30 points, or 1.09%, to settle at 79,408.50, while the Nifty surged 273.90 points, or 1.15%, to end at 24,125.55.
 
Among the 30 Sensex stocks, top gainers included Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, Bajaj Finserv, and Mahindra & Mahindra, with some rising as much as 4.91%.
 
Over the last five sessions, the Sensex has gained 5,562 points or 7.5%, while the Nifty has advanced by 1,726 points or 7.7%.
 
Broader markets outperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap100 rising 2.50% and the Nifty Smallcap100 gaining 2.21%.
 
Banking stocks were in strong demand as the Bank Nifty hit a new intraday high of 55,461.65 before closing at 55,304.50, up 1.87%. Key gainers included AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Federal Bank, which rose between 3.72% and 7.32%.
 
Both the Nifty Private Bank and PSU Bank indices ended with gains of over 2%.
 
Sectoral indices on the NSE also saw broad-based gains. Nifty IT, Auto, Realty, and Oil & Gas indices rose over 2% each, while Nifty FMCG was the only index to close slightly lower.
 
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee extended its uptrend for the fifth straight day, supported by a weakening US dollar, strong equity markets, steady foreign inflows, and falling crude oil prices.
 
“This positive trend was fuelled by a weakening US dollar against major global currencies. Furthermore, robust performance in domestic equity markets, consistent inflows from foreign investment, and a decline in crude oil prices provided additional tailwinds for the rupee’s appreciation,” said Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

Title: Delhi CM’s Heat Action Plan: 3,000 water ATMs, cooling shelters, ‘Aapda Mitras’
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:48:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday unveiled the Heat Action Plan 2025, activating the disaster management machinery and proposing 3,000 cold water ATMs as part of collective measures to offer relief from the sweltering heat.
In addition to deploying 1,800 National and Delhi Disaster Response volunteers — known as ‘Aapda Mitras’ — the plan includes the establishment of shaded cooling shelters and the installation of 3,000–4,000 large RO water units attached to the boundary walls of Delhi government schools and office buildings. These will dispense cold water round-the-clock, benefiting approximately five lakh citizens.
The plan also proposes installing 3,000 water ATMs on Public Works Department (PWD) roads — particularly near bus stops and traffic intersections — to provide easy public access to drinking water.
Gupta said that the national capital’s seasons are often linked to civic challenges — water shortages in summer, pollution in winter, and waterlogging during monsoon — but her government aims to ensure that citizens can enjoy every season without difficulty.
Reiterating her government’s commitment to heatwave relief, CM Gupta said that under the Heat Action Plan, 3,000 water coolers or ATMs would be installed — 1,000 on public roads, 1,000 in government buildings, and 1,000 in rural areas.
“We will also seek support from private entities through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives,” she added.
The Chief Minister said that the Delhi government will issue regular heat alerts via SMS and social media to help the public take timely precautions.
In addition to creating special heatwave wards in hospitals, Aapda Mitras will be deployed to carry out heat-relief activities in slum areas.
“Every life is precious — for both the city and the nation — and we are committed to protecting it,” she emphasized, also suggesting steps to help animals cope with the heat.
Earlier, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma said that the Delhi government is determined to prove its commitment to public welfare through action, not just announcements.
He noted that the government has already launched GPS-linked water tankers to address the summer water crisis and begun introducing heat-resistant, cool roofing for government buildings — a pilot initiative that will be expanded gradually.

Title: Google faces trial in US bid to end search monopoly
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:18:40 +0000
Content: Alphabet’s Google faces a historic trial on Monday as U.S. antitrust enforcers in Washington seek to force the tech giant to sell off its Chrome browser as part of a bid to restore competition to the market for online search engines.
The U.S. Department of Justice is heading into trial after two major legal victories against Google, having won a ruling in August that Google monopolized search.
The trial comes on the heels of a win in a Virginia court on Thursday where a judge ruled in a separate antitrust case that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology.
The outcome of the trial could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online.
Google plans to appeal the final ruling in the case.
“When it comes to antitrust remedies, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that ‘caution is key.’ DOJ’s proposal throws that caution to the wind,” Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post on Sunday.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is scheduled to oversee the three-week trial at the same courthouse where Meta Platforms is facing its own antitrust trial over the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general have proposed far-reaching measures designed to quickly open the search market and give new competitors a leg up.
Their proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make Google the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones.
Google would also have to license search results to competitors, among other requirements. And it would be made to sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition.
Prosecutors have said they expect testimony about how Google’s agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices have hampered distribution efforts by artificial intelligence companies. Witnesses from Perplexity AI and OpenAI are expected to take the stand.
Google sees the proposals as extreme, and said the court should stick to limiting the terms of its default agreements.
The $1.9 trillion tech company has been subsidizing browser makers such as Mozilla by paying to remain the default search engine. Cutting off that financial support could threaten their existence, Google says. And ending payments to device makers would raise the cost of smartphones, the company claims.
Google plans to call witnesses from Mozilla, Verizon and Apple, which launched a failed bid to intervene in the case.
Few potential buyers of Chrome have the same incentive as Google to maintain the free open-source code that underpins it, and which others including Microsoft use as a basis for their own browsers, the company says.

Title: India’s leather, footwear exports jump 25 pc to $5.7 billion in FY25
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:14:43 +0000
Content: India’s leather and non-leather footwear exports have seen a significant rise of nearly 25 per cent in the 2024-25 financial year (FY25), reaching $5.7 billion, a new report said on Monday.
The industry is expected to surpass the $6.5 billion mark in the current fiscal year (FY26), according to the Council for Leather Exports (CLE).
The CLE, which represents footwear exporters, mentioned that demand from both developed and developing countries remains strong, contributing to the impressive growth.
R Selvam, the Executive Director of CLE, shared that India exceeded its export target by $1 billion for 2024-25, a goal set by the Department of Commerce.
“In 2024-25, we have exceeded the exports target by $1 billion set up by the department of commerce and going by this trend, our exports will cross $6.5 billion dollar in 2025-26,” Selvam mentioned.
Rajendra Kumar Jalan, the Chairman of CLE, also highlighted that exports are performing well in key markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
Despite a 10 per cent tariff hike, exporters have been offering discounts to maintain their business relationships, and there have been no order cancellations.
Jalan also noted that the situation has returned to normal by mid-April, and suggested a ‘zero-for-zero’ duty proposal to the Indian government in the ongoing bilateral trade discussions with the US.
“From April 14-15, the situation is normal. We have suggested ‘zero-for-zero’ duty to the government in the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US,” he stated.
The footwear industry is labour-intensive, providing employment to approximately 42 lakh people. With an overall turnover of 19 billion dollar, the sector includes $5 billion in exports.
The industry is optimistic about its future and projects a total turnover of $39 billion by 2030, with $25 billion in domestic production and $13.7 billion in exports, the report said.
Additionally, there is growing interest from Chinese investors looking to collaborate with Indian footwear manufacturers to set up production units in India, further boosting the sector’s potential for growth, the report added.

Title: Gold hits record ₹96,805, may soon cross ₹1 lakh
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:03:51 +0000
Content: Gold prices in India hit a new all-time high of ₹96,805 per 10 grams on Monday on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), driven by global trade tensions and a weakening US dollar.
 
By 1:30 PM, the MCX Gold June 5 contract was trading 1.65% higher at ₹96,830 per 10 grams.
 
Spot prices also saw a sharp uptick. According to the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA), 24-carat gold (999 purity) was priced at ₹9,659 per gram, while 22-carat stood at ₹9,427. Rates for 20-carat and 18-carat gold were ₹8,596 and ₹7,824 per gram, respectively.
 
The domestic rally tracked global trends, where spot gold surged to a new record of $3,384 per ounce. A weakening US dollar—hitting a three-year low—has made gold more attractive to investors worldwide.
 
In the previous session, gold had dipped 0.44% to ₹95,239 due to profit booking. However, renewed concerns over a prolonged US-China trade war triggered fresh buying.
 
“Gold continues its upward momentum, briefly crossing $3,400 an ounce. Uncertainty around tariffs, a weaker dollar, and higher US bond yields are supporting prices,” said Pranav Mer of JM Financial Services. He also pointed to ETF buying and festive demand in India as key drivers.
 
Technically, gold now holds support at ₹95,550 and ₹94,200, with resistance seen at ₹97,580 and ₹98,200, Mer added.

Title: “Our march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated,” says Amit Shah after eight Naxals killed in Jharkhand
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:56:32 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday lauded security forces for neutralising eight Naxals in Jharkhand’s Bokaro district, saying that the march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated.
“Our march to eliminate Naxalism continues unabated. Today, security forces achieved another significant success in the ongoing operation to uproot Naxalism. In an encounter at Lugu Hills in Bokaro, Jharkhand, 8 Maoists were neutralised, including a top-level Naxal leader, Vivek, who carried a reward of Rs 1 crore, and two other notorious Naxalites. The operation is ongoing. Applaud our security forces,” the Home Minister’s Office posted on X.
Jharkhand Director General of Police (DGP) Anurag Gupta said that eight Naxals were killed in a joint operation conducted by Jharkhand Jaguar, the state police, and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).
“Today, our security forces have neutralised eight Maoists. We have recovered arms, including four INSAS rifles and one SLR. Three top Naxalites — Vivek alias Prayag Majhi, Arvind Yadav, and Sahebram Majhi — have been killed. The operation was carried out by Jharkhand Jaguar, the police, and the CRPF. The first exchange of fire took place at 5:30 am and continued for about 1.5 to 2 hours,” the DGP said.
He further warned active Naxalites to surrender and return to the mainstream as soon as possible.
“Today, we have every detail and location of every Naxalite in our state. This is a warning to those still roaming around with weapons. They must surrender because we are aware of their whereabouts and every detail about them. They should surrender if they want peace and to benefit from Jharkhand’s surrender policy,” he added.
Earlier in the day, security forces neutralised eight Naxals in a joint operation conducted in the early morning hours in Jharkhand’s Bokaro district.
The bodies of the Naxals were recovered following an exchange of fire between the rebels and personnel from the 209 Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) unit of the CRPF and the state police.
The encounter began around 5:30 am in the Lugu Hills under the Lalpania area of Bokaro.
“Among the eight Naxals neutralised in the operation were three high-profile individuals with bounties of Rs 1 crore, Rs 25 lakh, and Rs 10 lakh, respectively. Prayag Majhi had a bounty of Rs 1 crore, Arvind Yadav carried a reward of Rs 25 lakh, and Sahebram Majhi, also known as Rahul Majhi, had a bounty of Rs 10 lakh. The remaining Naxals have been identified as Mahesh Majhi alias Mota, Talu, Raju Majhi, Gangaram, and Mahesh,” the CRPF stated.
According to the CRPF, a cache of arms was recovered from the site, including one AK-series rifle, one Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), three INSAS rifles, one pistol, and eight country-made Bharmar rifles.
Officials said the operation is part of an intensified campaign by security forces to dismantle Naxal activities in the region.

Title: Pope Francis will always be remembered as beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:24:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that he was deeply pained by the passing of Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday at the age of 88 at his residence in the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta.
Fondly recalling his meetings with the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, PM Modi said that Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.
“Deeply pained by the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis. In this hour of grief and remembrance, my heartfelt condolences to the global Catholic community. Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world,” PM Modi said in his condolence message.
“From a young age, he devoted himself towards realising the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope. I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,” he added.
Pope Francis, who had been suffering from respiratory ailments and pneumonia for a long time, passed away at 7:35 am on Monday, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced Monday afternoon, India time.
During his meetings with the late Pope, PM Modi had always admired his commitment to serve people and had also extended an invitation to him to visit India at an early date.
“Met Pope Francis on the sidelines of the G7 Summit. I admire his commitment to serve people and make our planet better. Also invited him to visit India,” the Prime Minister posted on X after meeting the Pope at the G7 Summit’s Outreach Session in Borgo Egnazia, last year.
In October 2021, the Pope received PM Modi during a private audience at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which was also the first meeting between an Indian Prime Minister and the Pope in more than two decades.
It was in June 2000 that late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had last visited the Vatican and met the then Pope, John Paul II.
India and The Holy See have friendly relations dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1948. India is also home to the second-largest Catholic population in Asia.

Title: PM Modi set to visit Jeddah, bolster India-Saudi Arabia ties
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:49:10 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Jeddah this Tuesday, marking the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Saudi Arabia’s commercial hub in over four decades. The landmark visit is expected to further enhance the growing strategic partnership between the two nations.
During his visit, Prime Minister Modi will tour a local factory and interact with Indian workers based in Saudi Arabia, underlining the deep people-to-people ties that complement the robust economic relationship between the two countries.
India’s investment footprint in Saudi Arabia has expanded significantly in recent years, with total investments reaching approximately USD 3 billion as of August 2023. These investments span across multiple sectors including management and consultancy services, construction, telecommunications, IT, financial services, software development, and pharmaceuticals.
Several major Indian companies have established a strong presence in Saudi Arabia. These include Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Tata Group, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Air India, Go Air, IndiGo, and SpiceJet, among others.
Speaking on the growing India-Saudi partnership, Ali Mohammed Ali, Member of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Executive Director of Jeddah National Hospital and Ryan International Clinics, said, “The presence of Indian companies in Saudi Arabia is a reflection of the mutual trust and shared vision between the two countries. The Indian workforce has played a significant role in various development sectors here, contributing meaningfully to Saudi Arabia’s progress.”
Beyond economic cooperation, the relationship has also deepened on the cultural front. In line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, bilateral cultural exchanges have gained momentum. A notable milestone in this regard was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Yoga Cooperation in 2021 between the Saudi Ministry of Sports and India’s Ministry of AYUSH.
Yoga has steadily grown in popularity in Saudi Arabia and is now officially recognized as a sporting activity. The Indian Embassy continues to organize yoga-related events, including annual celebrations of the International Day of Yoga.
Nouf Marwaai, a Saudi yoga expert who has been instrumental in promoting yoga in the region, said, “Yoga has not only grown in popularity here but has become a bridge between our cultures. The Indian Embassy’s consistent support and the community’s enthusiastic participation have played a big role in this journey.”

Title: PM Modi to Make Third Visit to Saudi Arabia, Building on Strategic Partnership
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:02:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on April 22-23, 2025, on a bilateral visit. This marks Modi’s third official trip to the Kingdom, following previous visits in 2016 and 2019.
 
The upcoming visit underscores Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance to India across multiple dimensions. The Kingdom remains crucial for India’s energy security and hosts one of the world’s largest Indian expatriate communities, estimated to be the second largest such community globally.
 
Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading voice in the Islamic world and its increasing role in regional developments further elevates the significance of this diplomatic engagement. The visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the already robust relationship between the two nations.
 
For India, Saudi Arabia remains a critical partner not only in crisis response but also in ensuring the safety of its diaspora and advancing broader regional stability. The ongoing high-level  engagement signals both countries’ commitment to further strengthening their multifaceted partnership, with the Sudan crisis serving as a recent example of effective cooperation in times of emergency. 
 
India’s “Operation Kaveri” successfully evacuated over 3,500 Indian nationals from Sudan with crucial logistical support from Saudi Arabia, which facilitated the safe transit of evacuees through Jeddah. Indian officials have acknowledged that this operation’s success heavily relied on the excellent cooperation provided by Saudi officials and government organizations.
 
This practical cooperation reflects the deepening ties between India and Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the Strategic Partnership Council in 2019. The relationship has expanded across multiple sectors including defense, trade, energy, technology, and culture, said Dr. Prince Mufti Ziaul Hasan, who is part of the Indian Diaspora in Jeddah and instrumental in Operation Kaveri.
 
Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming discussions are expected to focus on regional security, humanitarian coordination, and strategies for addressing ongoing crises such as Sudan. These talks will likely reaffirm the two nations’ shared interests and growing influence in West Asian affairs as they continue to develop their strategic partnership.

Title: Meditation and International Meditation Day: The Battle for Inner Stillness in a Distracted World
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:18:06 +0000
Content: In a world where artificial intelligence suggests what to think, algorithms dictate how to feel, and screens consume human attention, meditation emerges as an act of quiet defiance. No longer confined to monks in the Himalayas or sages on the banks of the Ganges, it has become an essential tool for modern existence.
Yet, as the world marks International Meditation Day, the essence of this ancient practice is at risk of being diluted. Meditation, once a path to deep self-awareness and spiritual liberation, is now increasingly repackaged as a quick-fix solution, offered through wellness apps, corporate stress-reduction programs, and productivity tools. While these adaptations bring meditation into mainstream consciousness, they often strip away its original depth, reducing it to yet another commodity in an era of relentless distractions.
International Meditation Day was not created as a symbolic initiative — it was born out of necessity. It has become a survival tool for the modern mind, a response to the growing crisis of mental fatigue, fractured societies, and the overstimulation of the digital age.
The day is marked by global gatherings, virtual sessions, and guided meditations that unite people across cultures. From mass meditation events in cities like New York, London, and Delhi to online mindfulness workshops hosted by global wellness communities, the day serves as a reminder of the collective power of stillness.
Organizations like the Art of Living and the Mindfulness Project host special programs, while schools and workplaces incorporate meditation sessions to highlight its benefits.
The question here is not whether meditation is relevant — but whether it can serve as a counterbalance to the unprecedented mental overload of contemporary life.
Even world leaders have begun to acknowledge meditation’s significance in tackling stress and improving focus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 address, highlighted the practice as a powerful antidote to anxiety, particularly for students grappling with academic pressure.
“Meditation and breath control are extremely effective in calming the mind. When you are stressed, focus on identifying different sounds around you — it will instantly ground you in the present,” he advised. He also emphasized the power of Pranayama, adding, “Breathing exercises generate energy and stabilize the body in seconds.”
Modi’s message underscores a broader truth — meditation is not just a wellness practice; it is a tool for clarity, resilience, and self-mastery in an era of cognitive overload.
For centuries, meditation was an intimate and introspective pursuit, requiring patience, discipline, and effort. Today, ironically, it has been rebranded into five-minute guided sessions on mobile apps, squeezed in between meetings and social media scrolling.
This shift is not accidental. It reflects a larger, ongoing battle for human attention.
In the last decade, digital technology has completely reshaped human behaviour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognized stress as the epidemic of the 21st century — a reflection of the relentless pressures of modern life. Unlike physical illnesses that can be diagnosed and treated through conventional medicine, stress operates as a silent disruptor, affecting mental health, cognitive function, and even physical well-being. Chronic stress has been linked to a host of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to weakened immune responses, making it a global health crisis that transcends geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.
The toll of this crisis is perhaps most evident in the alarming rise in suicide rates worldwide. Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, have emerged as leading causes of disability, pushing individuals to the brink of emotional collapse. The increasing social isolation caused by digital engagement, economic anxieties, and the competitive pressures of modern society have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and despair. Many countries are grappling with the repercussions of a mental health crisis that remains underfunded and often overlooked, despite its devastating impact on families and communities.
Workplace stress has also reached unprecedented levels, with a 2023 global survey revealing that over 80% of workers experience stress on a daily basis. The blurring of work-life boundaries, particularly with the rise of remote work and the always-on digital culture, has created an environment where employees struggle to disconnect. The pressure to meet deadlines, the fear of job instability, and the expectation of constant availability have all contributed to rising burnout rates. This relentless cycle not only affects individual well-being but also leads to declining productivity, increased absenteeism, and a workplace culture that prioritizes output over mental health.
At the heart of this crisis is the explosive rise in digital dependency. Studies indicate that the average person now checks their phone 150 times a day — an unconscious habit that has rewired human attention spans and diminished the ability to focus for extended periods. Screen time has tripled over the past decade, fundamentally altering sleep cycles, cognitive processing, and even interpersonal relationships. What is particularly concerning is that these effects are no longer limited to adults. Children as young as eight years old are exhibiting signs of digital addiction. Excessive exposure to screens, particularly social media and online gaming, has been linked to increased anxiety, attention disorders, and emotional dysregulation in younger generations.
Meditation is often spoken about in the context of individual well-being. But what about its power to heal societies?
India’s contribution to global spirituality is undeniable — from Vedic seers to Gautama Buddha, from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras to modern meditation masters. Yet, for decades, meditation was seen in the West as an exotic practice rather than a universal human tool.
That perception has changed dramatically. Much like the global acceptance of yoga, meditation has also transcended its origins. The success of International Yoga Day (June 21) paved the way for International Meditation Day, marking the shift from viewing meditation as an Eastern tradition to recognizing it as a universal human necessity.
The global recognition of meditation marks a shift from viewing it as an ancient Eastern practice to a universal necessity. But beyond acknowledgment, there lies the big question: can it actively counter the mental and emotional chaos of modern life? Every day, billions of people are caught in a maelstrom of distractions, their consciousness shaped by digital stimuli, economic anxieties, and ideological conflicts. The world’s largest tech companies have mastered the art of keeping users perpetually engaged, while meditation offers a way to step back, unplug, and regain control over one’s own mind.
Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly emphasized the transformative power of meditation for both personal and collective well-being. He urged, “I call upon everyone to make meditation a part of their daily lives and experience its transformative potential. Meditation is a powerful way to bring peace and harmony to one’s life, as well as to our society and planet.” His words resonate far beyond India.
Harvard research confirms as well that meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, counteracting the cognitive decline caused by excessive digital exposure.
Meditation is increasingly finding its place in diplomacy, governance, and international relations as leaders recognize the power of mindfulness in conflict resolution and decision-making. High-level figures, including UN officials and global policymakers, have begun incorporating meditation practices to enhance emotional intelligence, improve focus, and cultivate patience — qualities essential for diplomacy. Philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti once remarked, “The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.”
As the world grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, meditation is emerging not just as a personal wellness tool but as a silent force shaping diplomatic engagements, promoting mindfulness-based leadership, and even de-escalating conflicts through inner stillness.
Some of the greatest figures in history — Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Dalai Lama — all viewed inner peace as a prerequisite for societal harmony.
Today, modern meditation movements are using these same principles to mediate conflicts. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living Foundation, for example, has facilitated peace-building efforts in war zones such as Colombia and Iraq. His words reflect the power of meditation in fostering global healing. He says, “Meditation is the journey from sound to silence, from movement to stillness, from a limited identity to unlimited space.”
India can protect its spiritual landscapes from the relentless march of urbanization by implementing:


Meditation Conservation Zones: Establishing legally protected meditation zones, similar to wildlife sanctuaries, could safeguard sacred forests, riverbanks, and mountain retreats from unchecked commercial exploitation.


Eco-Spiritual Tourism: Encouraging responsible tourism models can generate revenue for conservation without disrupting the ecological balance of meditation retreats. Destinations like Rishikesh, Dharamsala, and the sacred groves of Kerala must be protected not just as tourist spots but as centres of spiritual heritage.


Local Guardianship: Empowering local communities to act as stewards of meditation sites ensures preservation efforts remain culturally sensitive and sustainable. Traditional caretakers, including monks and indigenous groups, have long protected these spaces. Formalizing their role can strengthen conservation efforts.


Sacred geography is not just about aesthetics — it is about energetic and spiritual preservation. The destruction of India’s meditation landscapes is not just an environmental loss; it is a loss of humanity’s connection to stillness itself.
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The world is one family — Ancient Indian philosophy never viewed meditation as an isolated practice. The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam suggests that when individuals meditate, they uplift the collective consciousness of society.
Meditation in Historical Leadership — Indian warriors and kings practiced meditation before battle, not to suppress fear, but to cultivate clarity. Emperor Ashoka’s transformation after the Kalinga war is a testament to the power of meditation in reshaping leadership and governance.
While meditation has been embraced by the corporate world, it must be more than just a tool for stress relief. Its true purpose extends into leadership, governance, and conflict resolution. It has become a new language of diplomacy — an integration where wisdom, patience, and emotional intelligence are needed most. It must be recognized as a global movement, one that calls for a deeper shift in human consciousness.
The roots of meditation have always been intertwined with nature, yet modern life has severed this connection. The philosophy of ancient Indian traditions — from the Pancha Mahabhutas (Five Great Elements) to Buddhist mindfulness — emphasizes that human well-being is inseparable from the well-being of the planet. International Meditation Day should serve as a reminder that stillness is not passive; it is a radical, transformative act that can shift the way individuals, leaders, and societies operate in an overstimulated world.
This International Meditation Day, let us meditate in silence, let us meditate with purpose. The future of our minds, our relationships, and our planet depends on our ability to reclaim stillness — and to truly live the reality of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.

Title: Kremlin says U.S. position ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gives satisfaction
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:07:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that the position of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine gave Moscow satisfaction, but declined to comment on Trump’s hopes for deal this week.
U.S. envoy General Keith Kellogg said on Sunday that NATO membership was “off the table” for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said previous U.S. support for Ukraine’s bid to join NATO was a cause of the war.
“We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is excluded,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.” Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position.”
Peskov said that Ukrainian membership of the U.S.-led alliance would “pose a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And, in fact, this is one of the root causes of this conflict.”
Putin has repeatedly said that Russia would be willing to end the war if Ukraine officially dropped its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.
Media reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.
Trump said on Sunday he hopes Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about those remarks, Peskov said: “I don’t want to make any comments right now, especially about the time frame.”
“President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,” Peskov said.
He refused to comment directly on a Bloomberg report that the United States is prepared to recognise Russian control of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement.
“Work on finding a peaceful settlement cannot take place, and should not take place, in public,” Peskov said. “It should take place in an absolutely discrete mode.”

Title: Sensex surges 855 points; banks, IT lead market rally
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:03:54 +0000
Content: Extending its winning streak for the fifth consecutive session, the Indian stock market closed sharply higher on Monday, driven by strong gains in banking, IT, and auto stocks.
 
The Sensex jumped 855.30 points, or 1.09%, to settle at 79,408.50, while the Nifty surged 273.90 points, or 1.15%, to end at 24,125.55.
 
Among the 30 Sensex stocks, top gainers included Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, Bajaj Finserv, and Mahindra & Mahindra, with some rising as much as 4.91%.
 
Over the last five sessions, the Sensex has gained 5,562 points or 7.5%, while the Nifty has advanced by 1,726 points or 7.7%.
 
Broader markets outperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap100 rising 2.50% and the Nifty Smallcap100 gaining 2.21%.
 
Banking stocks were in strong demand as the Bank Nifty hit a new intraday high of 55,461.65 before closing at 55,304.50, up 1.87%. Key gainers included AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Federal Bank, which rose between 3.72% and 7.32%.
 
Both the Nifty Private Bank and PSU Bank indices ended with gains of over 2%.
 
Sectoral indices on the NSE also saw broad-based gains. Nifty IT, Auto, Realty, and Oil & Gas indices rose over 2% each, while Nifty FMCG was the only index to close slightly lower.
 
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee extended its uptrend for the fifth straight day, supported by a weakening US dollar, strong equity markets, steady foreign inflows, and falling crude oil prices.
 
“This positive trend was fuelled by a weakening US dollar against major global currencies. Furthermore, robust performance in domestic equity markets, consistent inflows from foreign investment, and a decline in crude oil prices provided additional tailwinds for the rupee’s appreciation,” said Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

Title: Delhi CM’s Heat Action Plan: 3,000 water ATMs, cooling shelters, ‘Aapda Mitras’
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:48:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday unveiled the Heat Action Plan 2025, activating the disaster management machinery and proposing 3,000 cold water ATMs as part of collective measures to offer relief from the sweltering heat.
In addition to deploying 1,800 National and Delhi Disaster Response volunteers — known as ‘Aapda Mitras’ — the plan includes the establishment of shaded cooling shelters and the installation of 3,000–4,000 large RO water units attached to the boundary walls of Delhi government schools and office buildings. These will dispense cold water round-the-clock, benefiting approximately five lakh citizens.
The plan also proposes installing 3,000 water ATMs on Public Works Department (PWD) roads — particularly near bus stops and traffic intersections — to provide easy public access to drinking water.
Gupta said that the national capital’s seasons are often linked to civic challenges — water shortages in summer, pollution in winter, and waterlogging during monsoon — but her government aims to ensure that citizens can enjoy every season without difficulty.
Reiterating her government’s commitment to heatwave relief, CM Gupta said that under the Heat Action Plan, 3,000 water coolers or ATMs would be installed — 1,000 on public roads, 1,000 in government buildings, and 1,000 in rural areas.
“We will also seek support from private entities through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives,” she added.
The Chief Minister said that the Delhi government will issue regular heat alerts via SMS and social media to help the public take timely precautions.
In addition to creating special heatwave wards in hospitals, Aapda Mitras will be deployed to carry out heat-relief activities in slum areas.
“Every life is precious — for both the city and the nation — and we are committed to protecting it,” she emphasized, also suggesting steps to help animals cope with the heat.
Earlier, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma said that the Delhi government is determined to prove its commitment to public welfare through action, not just announcements.
He noted that the government has already launched GPS-linked water tankers to address the summer water crisis and begun introducing heat-resistant, cool roofing for government buildings — a pilot initiative that will be expanded gradually.

Title: Google faces trial in US bid to end search monopoly
Publication Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:18:40 +0000
Content: Alphabet’s Google faces a historic trial on Monday as U.S. antitrust enforcers in Washington seek to force the tech giant to sell off its Chrome browser as part of a bid to restore competition to the market for online search engines.
The U.S. Department of Justice is heading into trial after two major legal victories against Google, having won a ruling in August that Google monopolized search.
The trial comes on the heels of a win in a Virginia court on Thursday where a judge ruled in a separate antitrust case that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology.
The outcome of the trial could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online.
Google plans to appeal the final ruling in the case.
“When it comes to antitrust remedies, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that ‘caution is key.’ DOJ’s proposal throws that caution to the wind,” Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post on Sunday.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is scheduled to oversee the three-week trial at the same courthouse where Meta Platforms is facing its own antitrust trial over the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general have proposed far-reaching measures designed to quickly open the search market and give new competitors a leg up.
Their proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make Google the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones.
Google would also have to license search results to competitors, among other requirements. And it would be made to sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition.
Prosecutors have said they expect testimony about how Google’s agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices have hampered distribution efforts by artificial intelligence companies. Witnesses from Perplexity AI and OpenAI are expected to take the stand.
Google sees the proposals as extreme, and said the court should stick to limiting the terms of its default agreements.
The $1.9 trillion tech company has been subsidizing browser makers such as Mozilla by paying to remain the default search engine. Cutting off that financial support could threaten their existence, Google says. And ending payments to device makers would raise the cost of smartphones, the company claims.
Google plans to call witnesses from Mozilla, Verizon and Apple, which launched a failed bid to intervene in the case.
Few potential buyers of Chrome have the same incentive as Google to maintain the free open-source code that underpins it, and which others including Microsoft use as a basis for their own browsers, the company says.
