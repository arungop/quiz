Title: Youth key to India’s vision of becoming a developed nation: PM Modi at Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:21:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday highlighted the pivotal role of India’s youth in nation-building, expressing confidence that ‘Yuva Shakti’ would soon transform the country into a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed nation).
Addressing a gathering of around 3,000 participants at the ‘Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue’ held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, the Prime Minister remarked, “Mera vishwas kehta hai ki yuva shakti ka samarth, Bharat ko jald se jald Viksit Rashtra banayega” (I believe the power of youth will make India a developed nation very soon).
Emphasizing his connection with the younger generation, he described their bond as one of ‘Param Mitra’ (ultimate friendship), adding, “The strongest bond in a friendship is that of ‘Vishwas’ (trust). I have immense faith in you, and this trust inspired the creation of initiatives like ‘MYBharat.com’ and the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue.”
‘MY Bharat’ Initiative
The ‘MY Bharat’ platform, launched under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, aims to empower the nation’s youth through opportunities in social mobility, educational equity, and skill development.
The prime minister acknowledged the energy and enthusiasm of young participants at the venue, paying homage to Swami Vivekananda, whose ideals continue to inspire the nation. “Today, with the energy of India’s youth, this Bharat Mandapam is brimming with enthusiasm. The entire country is remembering and paying tribute to Swami Vivekananda,” he said.
Recalling India’s struggle for independence, PM Modi noted, “The people of India united to achieve freedom despite the British Empire’s immense strength. They lived the dream of independence and turned it into reality.”
Program Highlights
Earlier, the prime minister visited an exhibition at the event and interacted with several participants.
The two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue, hosted at Bharat Mandapam, began with a grand inaugural session attended by dignitaries including Union Ministers Mansukh Mandaviya and Raksha Khadse, alongside Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S Somnath, Pawan Goenka, Amitabh Kant, and Ronnie Screwvala.
The event opened with the traditional lighting of the lamp and a floral tribute to Swami Vivekananda. Departing from the 25-year tradition of hosting the National Youth Festival conventionally, the program seeks to engage 1 lakh youth in nation-building, as envisioned by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day address.
As part of the initiative, PM Modi also released a compilation of essays written by participants on ten themes, encompassing topics such as technology, sustainability, women empowerment, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Title: Devajit Saikia appointed as BCCI Secretary; Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected Treasurer
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:20:49 +0000
Content: Former first-class cricketer Devajit Saikia has been announced as the new secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), replacing Jay Shah, who assumed the role of ICC Chairman last year. The announcement was made during the BCCI Special General Meeting (SGM) on Sunday. 
IPrabhtej Singh Bhatia was elected as the Treasurer of the Indian Cricket Board. Confirming the appointments, BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla said, “Devajit Saikia elected new BCCI secretary, and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected as BCCI treasurer.” 
Saikia, who represented Assam in the 1990-91 first-class cricket season, scored 53 runs in four matches. He also has significant experience in cricket administration, having served as the BCCI joint secretary and the secretary of the Assam Cricket Association (ACA). Following Jay Shah’s election as ICC Chairman, Saikia had been serving as the acting interim secretary of the BCCI. 
The Special General Meeting also marked Jay Shah’s transition to his role as ICC Chairman, which began on December 1. Shah’s extensive administrative experience includes his tenure with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), where he oversaw the development of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the world’s largest cricket stadium. Under his leadership, India successfully hosted the 2023 Cricket World Cup in its entirety for the first time. 
In a key decision during Shah’s chairmanship, the ICC recently resolved the issue of hosting rights for the 2025 Champions Trophy. The tournament will be held in Pakistan, with an additional neutral venue included. The ICC has also adopted a hybrid model for its events in the 2024-27 cycle, with tournaments to be hosted in India or Pakistan. 
Meanwhile, former BCCI treasurer Ashish Shelar was recently elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in Maharashtra. He contested as part of the Mahayuti alliance, which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena.

Title: Fibre-rich diet may strengthen the body against infections: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:08:45 +0000
Content: A new study has found that the composition of the gut microbiome can help predict an individual’s susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections caused by bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Dietary changes, particularly increasing fibre intake, may alter the gut microbiome to reduce the risk of these infections.  
Enterobacteriaceae, a group of bacteria that includes Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella, and E. coli, is typically present in small amounts in a healthy gut microbiome. However, factors such as inflammation or consuming contaminated food can increase their numbers, leading to illness. In severe cases, an overgrowth of these bacteria can be life-threatening.  
Researchers used computational tools, including AI, to analyze the gut microbiome compositions of over 12,000 individuals across 45 countries through stool samples. They discovered that specific microbiome signatures can predict the likelihood of Enterobacteriaceae colonization, regardless of geographic location or health status.  
The study identified 135 gut microbe species commonly found in the absence of Enterobacteriaceae. Among these, Faecalibacterium was notable for producing short-chain fatty acids by breaking down dietary fibre, offering protection against harmful pathogens.  
The findings, published in the journal Nature Microbiology, suggest that increasing dietary fibre from vegetables, beans, and whole grains can support the growth of protective gut bacteria, crowding out harmful ones and lowering the risk of illness. The researchers noted that probiotics, which do not directly alter the gut environment, may have less impact on preventing infections.  
“Our results indicate that dietary habits are crucial in controlling susceptibility to infections caused by bacteria like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae,” said Dr Alexandre Almeida, senior author of the study and researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Veterinary Medicine. “By consuming fibre-rich foods, we provide the raw materials for our gut bacteria to produce protective short-chain fatty acids.”  
Klebsiella pneumoniae is known to cause severe infections, including pneumonia and meningitis.

Title: California wildfires claim 16 lives; Donald Trump calls it “one of the worst catastrophes” in US history
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:25:23 +0000
Content: US President-elect Donald Trump has voiced his frustration as the southern California wildfires continue to rage. Describing the disaster as “one of the worst catastrophes” in the country’s history, he criticized the authorities for their inability to extinguish the fires.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the fires in Los Angeles are still raging and lamented the lack of effective action. He expressed concern over the destruction of thousands of homes and the loss of lives, calling it a devastating event for the nation.
Reports indicate that at least 16 people have died in the wildfires, with nearly 200,000 displaced and around 10,000 structures, including entire neighborhoods, destroyed. While the Sunset fire has been contained, other fires remain active. The Hurst fire has burned 771 acres, the Kenneth fire has consumed 959 acres, and the Eaton fire has devastated 13,690 acres. The Palisades fire, the most destructive of all, has scorched 19,978 acres, bringing the total area affected to over 35,000 acres.
California Governor Gavin Newsom addressed the public, warning against misinformation about the fires. He reassured citizens that the state’s firefighting efforts have been significantly enhanced, with increased forest management and the world’s largest aerial firefighting fleet in operation. Newsom also emphasized that California remains committed to preventing looting and protecting affected communities.
A report by AccuWeather, cited by the New York Post, estimates that the wildfires could cause damages exceeding USD 50 billion, potentially making this disaster the most expensive in California’s history.

Title: Maha Kumbh likely to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, boost India’s economy
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:13:40 +0000
Content: The Maha Kumbh, set to begin in Prayagraj at the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers on Monday, is anticipated to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, providing a significant boost to India’s economy.
According to industry estimates, the Maha Kumbh is expected to increase both nominal and real GDP by over 1%.
The Uttar Pradesh government anticipates approximately 40 crore visitors, including domestic and international attendees, for the event.
Government estimates suggest that the Maha Kumbh could generate ₹2 lakh crore in trade if each of the 40 crore visitors spends an average of ₹5,000. Industry experts further project that average expenditure per person might rise to ₹10,000, potentially increasing the total economic impact to ₹4 lakh crore.
Meanwhile, companies from India and abroad are competing for space to showcase their presence during the 45-day event.
From fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) to pharmaceutical sectors, and mobility providers to digital payment platforms, businesses are loosening their marketing budgets, with anticipated spending exceeding ₹3,000 crore on branding and marketing at the Maha Kumbh, as per industry experts.
Public sector giant Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has supplied approximately 45,000 tonnes of steel for constructing various structures at the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025.
The steel provided by SAIL includes chequered plates, hot strip mill plates, mild steel plates, angles, and joists, according to a statement issued by the Maharatna company.
Prayagraj has undergone a significant transformation ahead of this grand congregation of Sanatan Dharma followers. Over 200 roads have been constructed and upgraded to ensure seamless connectivity for the millions of devotees expected to attend. The roads have been beautified with over 3 lakh plants and 1 lakh horticultural saplings, enhancing their visual appeal.

Title: PM Modi visits exhibition at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:57:51 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday visited the exhibition at the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025 held at Bharat Mandapam. During his visit, he interacted with participants and reviewed their projects.
The Department of Youth Affairs successfully inaugurated the two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue on Saturday at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi.
The event began with a grand inaugural session attended by Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports Raksha Khadse, Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S.

Title: Rain wreaks havoc on opening day of Australian Open
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:02:54 +0000
Content: Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour’s play was possible outside by early evening.
Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
“Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn’t get any tennis,” said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
“We’ve paid 60 bucks and haven’t seen anything.”
The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na’s Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
The 22-year-old’s last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
“The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes,” Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
“There’s more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let’s keep going playing with pressure.”
FIRST THROUGH TO SECOND ROUND
Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men’s second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
“It’s pretty nice, man. First time in my life I’m playing on a good court,” the 20th seed said.
“To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it’s much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain.”
Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France’s Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
Women’s favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena.

Title: ISRO SpaDeX docking mission: Satellites come within three metres in trial attempt
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:16:20 +0000
Content: Two satellites came as close as three metres during a trial attempt for space docking and are now moving back to a safe distance, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced on Sunday.
Providing an update on the SpaDeX Docking Mission, ISRO took to X, saying, “A trial attempt to reach up to 15 m and further to 3 m is done. Moving back spacecraft to safe distance. The docking process will be done after analysing data further.”
Earlier, the space agency said that the SpaDeX satellites were holding position at 15 metres and “capturing stunning photos and videos of each other!” The agency also shared images taken by the satellites at various distances.
This trial precedes the main docking experiment. During the attempt, the SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) — approached each other up to a distance of three metres before being moved apart for safety. ISRO emphasized that the docking process would only proceed after detailed analysis of the collected data.
Docking is a complex process, requiring precise maneuvers as the satellites move back and forth to achieve what ISRO has described as an “exciting handshake” in space.
India is employing its indigenously developed Bhartiya Docking System for this mission.
The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30, with the satellites SDX01 and SDX02 lifted onboard a PSLV C60 rocket and placed in a 475-km circular orbit.
If successful, India will become the fourth nation in the world — after the US, Russia, and China — to master the intricate technologies crucial for advanced space missions.
The achievement would also pave the way for future explorations, such as the Bharatiya Antariksh Station and Chandrayaan-4.
ISRO has postponed the historic docking of the two satellites twice, with its chief, Dr. S. Somnath, emphasizing that it is India’s first attempt at docking, and every first attempt comes with challenges. 
“The docking exercise will be done only when all sensors are fully calibrated and tested to satisfaction. All algorithms and scenarios are also tested on the ground before commands are sent to the spacecraft for autonomous docking,” Dr. Somnath had said earlier.
Post-docking, the two satellites will operate as a single spacecraft. Electrical power will be transferred from one satellite to the other to confirm the success of the docking. The mission will be declared successful only after the satellites are undocked and resume functioning independently, ISRO had said.

Title: Fog disrupts flight, train services in Delhi
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:07:17 +0000
Content: Dense fog disrupted flight and train services in Delhi on Sunday morning. According to the Indian Railways, 25 trains bound for Delhi were running late due to foggy conditions in the national capital and parts of northern India.
Some of the delayed trains included the Purushottam Superfast Express, Farakka Express, Anvt Humsafar, and S Kranti Superfast Express.
Amid the ongoing cold wave in Delhi, several flights were also delayed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a minimum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius in the city.
The air quality in the national capital was recorded as ‘poor,’ with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reporting an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 284 at 9 am. The IMD also issued a warning of a wet spell in the city, with thunderstorms and hail expected later in the day.
Visuals from India Gate showed near-zero visibility, while many people sought refuge in night shelters in Safdarjung to escape the harsh weather. Vegpal Singh, a local, stated that the shelters provided two meals daily, along with proper bedding and blankets. He added, “If medical treatment is needed, we take them to AIIMS, which is nearby.”
On January 11, light rain was recorded in Delhi, bringing the temperature down to 7.7 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Meanwhile, dense fog also blanketed other parts of North India. Morning visuals from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, showed the city shrouded in thick fog.
In Agra, Uttar Pradesh, the Taj Mahal appeared enveloped in a thin layer of fog as the cold wave intensified in the city. In Kanpur, a group of elderly people was seen huddled around a bonfire. Raj Kumar, an auto driver, said, “We face difficulties getting to work because of the cold. Bonfires should at least be set up at roundabouts.”
Cold waves continued to grip Jammu and Kashmir’s winter capital, Srinagar, as the chill intensified across northern India. Light rain was also reported in parts of Chandigarh.
Unexpectedly, a dense layer of fog enveloped Mumbai as well.

Title: India achieves 7.93% drop in greenhouse gas emissions: a milestone in climate resilience
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:32:11 +0000
Content: India is making significant strides in its journey toward climate resilience, reporting a 7.93% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2020 compared to 2019, according to its 4th Biennial Update Report (BUR-4) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The reduction underscores India’s commitment to a sustainable and low-carbon future, aligning with its pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, made during the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed India’s dedication to sustainable development, inspired by the principles of Mahatma Gandhi.
In a statement, he said, “India is the land of Mahatma Gandhi, whose vision for sustainable development inspires us greatly. We have shown what it is to realize key principles like Green Future and Net Zero.”
India’s Commitment to Global Climate Action
As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, India has committed to stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations and limiting global temperature increases to below 2°C, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. India continues to submit its Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to the UNFCCC, which provide updates on national GHG inventories, mitigation actions, and support received.
In 2020, India’s total GHG emissions, excluding Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF), stood at 2,959 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). Including LULUCF, net emissions were reduced to 2,437 million tonnes of CO2e, reflecting the country’s progress in emissions reduction.
The energy sector was the largest contributor, accounting for 75.66% of emissions, while forest lands sequestered around 522 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to reducing 22% of the nation’s total emissions.

Title: Zelenskiy says he’s ready to exchange North Korean soldiers for Ukrainians held in Russia
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:29:21 +0000
Content: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday Kyiv is ready to hand over captured North Korean soldiers to their leader Kim Jong Un if he can facilitate their exchange for Ukrainians held captive in Russia.
“In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It’s only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others,” Zelenskiy said on the social media platform X.
Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine had taken two North Koreans prisoner in Russia’s Kursk region, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the nearly three-year-old war last autumn.
Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia’s ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow’s forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence.
Zelenskiy has said Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses.
“Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,” Zelenskiy said.
He posted a short video showing the interrogation of two men who are presented as North Korean soldiers. One of them was shown lying on a bed with bandaged hands, the other was sitting with a bandage on his jaw.
One of the men said through an interpreter that he did not know he was fighting against Ukraine and had been told he was on a training exercise.
He said he hid in a shelter during the offensive and was found a couple of days later. He said that if he was ordered to return to North Korea, he would, but that he was ready to stay in Ukraine if given the chance.
Reuters could not verify the video.
“One of them (soldiers) expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine, the other to return to Korea,” Zelenskiy said in a televised statement.
Zelenskiy said that for North Korean soldiers who did not wish to return home, there may be other options available and “those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in the Korean (language) will be given that opportunity.”
Zelenskiy provided no specific details.
About 300 North Korean troops deployed to Russia have been killed with another 2,700 injured in combat against Ukrainian forces, with their rising number of casualties attributed to a lack of understanding of modern warfare and “the way Russia used the North Korean military”, a South Korean lawmaker briefed by the country’s spy agency said on Monday.
North Korean authorities appear to have called for its troops to commit suicide by blowing themselves up to evade capture, Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker on the South Korean parliament intelligence committee said citing the National Intelligence Service (NIS).
“It was also found in the memos carried by those killed that North Korean authorities emphasized self-destruction and suicide before capture, and that soldiers vaguely expect to join the Workers’ Party (of North Korea) or be pardoned,” Lee said.
Captured North Korean soldiers had not shown an intention to come to South Korea, though South Korea would cooperate with Ukraine if there was a request, Yonhap news agency also reported citing NIS.

Title: Surge in arrival of migratory birds in TN’s Pallikaranai after removal of encroachments
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:23:01 +0000
Content: Following the removal of encroachments, the Pallikaranai marshland in Tamil Nadu’s Mettukuppam has witnessed the arrival of more than 10,000 birds from 100 different species, including 70 migratory ones.
According to Gopikannan, an avid bird watcher with years of experience, several rare migratory birds have been spotted in the marshland this season. These include the Garganey, Northern Shoveler, Eurasian Teal, Eurasian Wigeon, Ruff, and Western Marsh Harrier. He attributed their presence to the marshland’s abundant food supply and favourable conditions. 
“The availability of food and a rich habitat makes Pallikaranai the preferred site for migratory birds during the season,” he said.
Tamil Nadu forest department officials confirmed that 52 encroachments were removed under the supervision of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and the affected families were relocated to designated areas. This intervention allowed the marshland to reclaim its natural state, creating a haven for both migratory and local bird species.
Officials reported that over 10,000 birds were observed in the Pallikaranai wetland this season. Continuous monitoring efforts by bird watchers and the forest department have significantly enriched their understanding of the ecosystem.
Heavy rainfall during the monsoon season brought ample water into the marshland, fostering a thriving habitat. As water levels gradually receded, a variety of waders joined the migratory species, further enhancing the marshland’s biodiversity.
The Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu has also reported a notable increase in migratory bird arrivals this season compared to previous years. Located in the Kollukudipatti and Vettangudipatti villages along the Madurai-Karaikudi Highway, the sanctuary spans 36 hectares.
Officials revealed that approximately 3,500 to 4,000 migratory birds visited the sanctuary in 2024, a remarkable rise from just 800 recorded in 2023. This surge is attributed to improved conservation measures and favourable weather conditions.
The Tamil Nadu forest department noted that around 20 species of birds visit the Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary annually, including the Egret, Indian Spot-Billed Duck, Darter, Asian Openbill Stork, and Black-Headed Ibis.
A senior forest department official explained that many of these birds travel thousands of kilometres from regions such as Australia, Europe, and Southeast Asia to roost and breed in the sanctuary.
Manikantan Thevar, a local villager and bird watcher, highlighted how migratory birds’ nesting behaviour often correlates with rainfall patterns, providing valuable information to farmers and locals. He explained, “If these birds nest in low-lying areas, it signals lighter rainfall, whereas nesting in higher terrains indicates heavy rain.”
The arrival of migratory birds in large numbers has brought cheer to villagers and bird watchers alike.

Title: PM Modi arrives in Kashmir to inaugurate Sonamarg tunnel, address rally
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:55:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kashmir on Monday to inaugurate the Z-Morh tunnel, rechristened as the Sonamarg tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ganderbal district.
After the special aircraft carrying the PM Modi, landed at the technical area of Srinagar international airport, the Prime Minister took an Air Force helicopter for Neelgrad in the Sonamarg area.
PM Modi will land at the Neelgrad helipad and drive in a cavalcade to the Gagangir area, where he will inaugurate the Sonamarg tunnel that provides all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg making it a round-the-year tourist destination.
Union Minister of SurfaceTransport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Chief Minister Omar Abdullah will be present during the inauguration of the tunnel.
PM Modi will later address a public rally at the truck yard in Sonamarg. Hundreds of people, braving extreme cold, have already gathered at the Sonamarg public rally venue to listen to the PM.
This is PM Modi’s first visit to the union territory after an elected government took office here.
Sonamarg tunnel will bypass the stretch of the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway that is prone to avalanches and heavy snowfall during the winter months.
The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) oversaw the Z-Morh tunnel constructed by APCO Infratech Private Limited for Rs 2,700 crore. The construction of the tunnel was started in 2018.
This tunnel will make Sonamarg an all-weather tourist destination, thereby helping employment for local youth, and boosting trade, tourism, and traffic to the Ladakh region, Amarnath Yatra and businesses.
The Tunnel is a 6.5 km long 2-lane road tunnel between Gagangair and Sonamarg in Ganderbal of Jammu and Kashmir. It was called the Z-Morh tunnel because of the Z-shaped stretch of road that the tunnel has replaced (Z-Morh translates to “Z-turn” in English). It takes only 15 minutes to travel the 6.5 km long tunnel compared to hours over the zig-zag road up and down the hills.
The Zojila Tunnel being constructed across the Zojila Pass together with the Z-Morh tunnel will make the journey to the Ladakh region safer and possibly throughout the year.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the Gagangir area of Ganderbal district on Saturday to oversee the arrangements being made for PM Modi’s arrival on Monday.
“Visited Sonmarg today to review preparations for PM @narendramodi ji’s visit on Monday. The inauguration of the Z-morh tunnel will open Sonmarg to tourism all-year-round, Sonmarg will now be developed as a great ski resort. The local population will not have to leave in winter &amp; the travel time to Kargil/Leh from Srinagar will also reduce,” he wrote on X on January 11.

Title: Maha Kumbh 2025: Brands flood market with Rs 2,000-crore ad surge as 45 crore devotees gather
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:49:52 +0000
Content: The Maha Kumbh 2025, poised to be the largest mass gathering in the world, is set to attract a staggering 45 crore devotees. This monumental event has caught the attention of brands across industries, eager to capitalise on the unprecedented scale by pouring thousands of crores into marketing and on-ground activities.
Running from 13 January to 26 February, this religious spectacle provides companies, particularly in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, and electronics, a rare opportunity to engage millions of consumers in one place.
Industry projections suggest that brands will invest between Rs 1,800 crore and Rs 2,000 crore in advertising campaigns, employing cutting-edge technologies like AI-driven themes, LED outdoor screens, virtual assistants, and mobile apps to capture the audience’s attention.
Luxury tents costing up to Rs 1 lakh per night, alongside budget homestays, cater to the wide spectrum of visitors. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that the event will generate Rs 1.2 lakh crore in revenue for Uttar Pradesh alone.
In addition to direct spending, trade associated with Maha Kumbh is expected to exceed Rs 4 lakh crore, giving a significant boost to both nominal and real GDP.
If each of the estimated 40 crore visitors spends an average of Rs 5,000, government figures predict trade revenues of Rs 2 lakh crore. However, industry experts believe the average spend could rise to Rs 10,000, pushing the economic impact to an impressive Rs 4 lakh crore.
With such vast economic potential, companies from around the world are vying for visibility at the 45-day event. Indian public sector giant Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has already supplied approximately 45,000 tonnes of steel for the construction of various structures, further underscoring the massive scale of preparation.
Prayagraj, the host city, has undergone a remarkable transformation in anticipation of this historic event. Over 200 roads have been constructed or upgraded, ensuring smooth transportation for millions of devotees. These roads are now lined with more than three lakh plants and one lakh horticultural saplings, adding to the city’s aesthetic appeal.
To ensure the safety of devotees along the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, particularly in the sacred Sangam area, the Uttar Pradesh government has deployed a substantial contingent of Water Police personnel, equipped with state-of-the-art technology.
This large-scale effort underscores the careful planning and security measures in place for the grand gathering of Sanatan Dharma followers.

Title: Thailand’s cabinet approves draft law to legalise casinos and gambling
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:36:32 +0000
Content: Thailand’s cabinet has approved a draft law that would legalise gambling and casinos, a move aimed at boosting tourism, jobs and investment, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Monday.
Under the government’s plan, the law, which will be sent to parliament for deliberation, would see gambling take place in large-scale entertainment complexes.
Casinos and most forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand but soccer betting and underground gaming activities and lotteries are rife, with vast sums of money changing hands.
Only some gambling is permitted, such as state-controlled horse races and on an official lottery.
Neighbours, Cambodia, Singapore, the Philippines, Laos and Myanmar have benefited from large casino complexes and Thailand’s government has argued the absence of legal casinos means it is turning its back on revenue and not reaching its tourism potential.
Tourism is a key driver of Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy and Thailand is forecasting record visitor numbers in the next few years.
“Legalisation will protect the public and would also generate more state revenue,” Paetongtarn told reporters.
Successive Thai governments have sought to legalise and regulate gambling to boost the economy but each attempt has faced pushback from conservatives in the Buddhist majority country.
The latest move could see foreign visitor numbers grow 5% to 10% and tourism revenue increase by about 120 billion baht to 220 billion baht ($3.45 billion to $6.32 billion), said Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat.
About 9,000 to 15,000 new jobs would be created, he added.
A key advocate of legalising gambling has been billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn’s father, an influential figure in the ruling party.

Title: Northern India Celebrates Lohri honoring tradition and community spirit
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:32:38 +0000
Content: As Northern India, particularly the states of Haryana and Punjab, experiences a cold wave, the region is celebrating the harvest festival of Lohri on Monday. Lohri, a festival of gratitude, is observed to honoUr Lord Surya, the Sun God, for providing light and warmth to help crops grow.
The President of India extended her warm wishes on this auspicious occasion. In a message shared on her X account, she said:
On the auspicious occasion of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Magh Bihu, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all Indian people living in the country and abroad.
These festivals are a symbol of our rich cultural heritage and unity in diversity. These festivals celebrated in different regions of India express respect for nature.
These festivals related to agriculture are also opportunities to express gratitude to our farmers for their tireless hard work.
I wish that this holy festival brings happiness and prosperity in the life of every person.”
Farmers, grateful for the fruits of their labor, gather around bonfires to celebrate with song, dance, and community joy. Popular Lohri songs such as “Sundari Mundari Ho…” fill the air as people dance the traditional Bhangra and Gidda. The festivities are marked by the sharing of sweets and snacks like peanuts, rewari, and other seasonal delicacies.
One of the stories closely associated with Lohri is that of Punjabi folk hero Rai Abdullah Khan Bhatti, also known as Dulla Bhatti. During Emperor Akbar’s reign, Dulla Bhatti led a revolt against Mughal rule. He became a symbol of protection when he saved two girls, Sundari and Mundri, from a corrupt landlord by adopting them and arranging their marriages. This story serves as a reminder of duty and loyalty, inspiring people to protect women and girls at all costs.
Lohri holds special significance for Punjabi families celebrating their first Lohri after marriage or the birth of a son. Friends and relatives gather to mark the occasion with joy and festivity. The festival embodies values of unity, love, and integrity, encouraging people to come together and share in the spirit of community.

Title: The dangers of Pakistan – North Korea nexus
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:29:16 +0000
Content: On 6 January, North Korea tested a hypersonic missile. A hypersonic missile is one that can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, which makes it more difficult to track and shoot down. The test coincided with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to South Korea.
 
North Korea released photographs that showed its leader Kim Jong-un watching the missile-test along with his daughter. Pyongyang said the missile reached a top speed of Mach 12 — that is 12 times the speed of sound.


Now, North Korea already possesses missiles that can reach the U.S. military base at Guam. It is developing missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland. However, what’s new is that Pyongyang is combining its missiles with a hypersonic warhead to make them potent. Two, it’s using carbon fibre composite materials in the missile’s engine section. Carbon fibre is lighter but stronger than other materials. And three, similar tests conducted last year featured a new, solid-fuel design. Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fuelled immediately before launch. They are easier and safer to operate and require less logistical support. This makes them harder to detect and more durable than liquid-fuel weapons. Also, they fly at a low altitude, and, therefore, evade detection by changing direction mid-flight. 
 
Kim hailed the missile test as a response to threats from hostile forces, a reference to the U.S. and its allies. He said the test showed the West that North Korea is ready to use any means to defend itself.
 
The U.S. and its allies reacted predictably. South Korea’s acting president Choi Sang-mok said it posed a threat to security on the Korean peninsula. Japan’s Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru said North Korea might be improving its missile technology with every test. And Blinken said the test underscored the importance of collaboration among the U.S., South Korea and Japan.
 
That’s half the story told. What the U.S. said about North Korea in the U.N. Security Council on 8 January, which, by the way, was Kim’s birthday, is what should worry the world, including India. A U.S. diplomat said : “The D.P.R.K. is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbours. In turn, the D.P.R.K. will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.”
 
That last bit is significant. India only knows too well about it.
 
A recent report published by The Tribune newspaper said New Delhi would want to ensure that Pyongyang’s new and bigger arsenal of hypersonic and short-range weapons does not have any place in Pakistan’s offensive military thinking. The report said developments on the Korean peninsula are of greater strategic importance to India today than they were four years ago because North Korea is a more emboldened military factor in East Asia now than it’s ever been.
 
The questions confronting India and the world are two-fold. One, will North Korea take to arms exports in a big way? And two, will it sell to Pakistan?
 
Let’s rewind a little. According to the late B. Raman, who worked for India’s spy agency, Pakistan’s ties with North Korea date back to 1971 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then foreign minister, visited Pyongyang and sought North Korean weapons to strengthen the Pakistani Military in the face of a looming war with India. Bhutto also visited North Korea in 1976, this time as Pakistan’s prime minister. In 1993, his daughter Benazir visited Pyongyang when she became prime minister. Benazir expanded the scope of the agreement signed by her father to include co-operation in nuclear and missile technologies including the training of Pakistani scientists and engineers in North Korea, the training of North Korean scientists and engineers at the Pakistani uranium enrichment plant at Kahuta and the supply of missiles and related technology to Pakistan. A former U.S. journalist, Mike Chinoy described Benazir Bhutto’s visit as the critical first step in an accelerating pattern of co-operation between Pakistan and North Korea.
 
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan made at least 13 visits to North Korea. Khan arranged a barter deal to exchange nuclear and missile technologies with North Korea. In 2004, Khan publicly confessed to transferring nuclear technology to North Korea between 1989 and 2000.
 
According to The New York Times, North Korea obtained many of the designs for gas centrifuges and much of the machinery required to make Highly Enriched Uranium, from Pakistan. Highly Enriched Uranium is used for producing nuclear weapons. In return, North Korea gave ballistic-missile parts to Pakistan in July 2002.
 
It’s important that you understand this timeline because it ties in perfectly with the development of North Korea’s own nuclear weapons programme. Remember, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. So, the Pakistani Nuclear Black Market has had a role in North Korea turning nuclear. What you also need to understand and appreciate is why Pakistan behaves the way it does. Husain Haqqani, a former adviser to Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, has said that the way Pakistan is governed could explain its nexus with North Korea. Haqqani wrote: “Pakistan is governed in a secretive manner, with its intelligence services and military running affairs in spheres of international concern. Even when the civilians are in charge of government, security policy remains largely in the military’s hands.”
 
So, Pakistan and North Korea go back a long way. What’s the guarantee then that Pakistan will not turn to North Korea again? If reports are to be believed, Pakistan may want to tap North Korea for Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile technology and hypersonic missiles. Pakistan has neither but North Korea has both. Will it be back to the future for Pakistan and North Korea? Watch this space.

Title: India set to redefine global trade at 6.4% CAGR over next decade: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:28:44 +0000
Content: India is poised to redefine its role in global trade, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4 per cent in trade over the next decade, roughly in line with its high GDP growth, according to a report on Monday.
The ASEAN region and especially India, are among the greatest beneficiaries of production shifts spurred by geopolitics, such as trade tensions between the US and China.
“We project 6.4 per cent CAGR in India’s total trade through 2033, to $1.8 trillion annually, roughly in line with its high GDP growth,” according to the report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
As the world increasingly pivots toward resilient and diversified supply chains, India’s ‘China+1’ strategy, backed by its large domestic market, skilled workforce, and forward-looking policies, positions it as a preferred global manufacturing hub.
“Strengthening partnerships with the US, EU, and emerging regions like Africa and ASEAN will be pivotal for India to capitalise on this momentum and drive inclusive, sustainable growth in global trade,” said Nishant Gupta, Managing Director Partner, BCG India.
India is emerging as the other big Global South trade story as it pursues favourable relations with most of the world’s major economies.
Among the drivers will be India’s growing popularity as a production base for companies seeking to diversify supply chains concentrated in China, hefty government incentives for manufacturing, a huge low-cost workforce, and rapidly improving infrastructure, said the report.
The analysis by BCG’s Center for Geopolitics estimates that global trade is set to top $29 trillion by 2033, but the routes these goods will travel is changing at a remarkable pace. The Global South, which accounts for around 30 per cent of global trade, is likely to see several major shifts over the coming decade.
Geopolitical rivalries, alliances, and aspirations are rewiring the global economy — and will continue to do so in the years ahead, accelerated by the imposition of tariffs by the US on foreign imports, the report mentioned.
Without a broad increase in tariffs, world trade in goods will keep growing at an average of 2.9 per cent annually for the next eight years, but the routes goods travel will change markedly as North America reduces its dependence on China and China builds up its links with the Global South, which is cementing its power in the global trade map.
“Trade lanes were already shifting from historical patterns and looming US tariffs will accelerate this. Navigating these new dynamics will be critical for any global business,” said Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director and partner at BCG, global leader of the Global Advantage practice.
In terms of product categories imported by the US, the greatest impact would be on imported auto parts and automotive vehicles, which would primarily affect trade with Mexico, the EU, and Japan.
Consumer electronics, electrical machinery, and fashion goods would be most affected by higher tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We estimate that a 60 per cent tariff rate would add $61 billion to cost of importing consumer electronics products from China into the US,” said the report.

Title: Study shows tumour DNA in blood may help predict lung cancer outcomes
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:57:27 +0000
Content: A team of British scientists has found that a blood test to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) may help predict lung cancer outcomes.
Circulating tumour DNA, which consists of fragments of DNA released into the blood by tumours, is known to play an important role in disease prognosis but is challenging to measure accurately.
In a study, researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London used a whole-genome sequencing platform called NeXT Personal, which can detect very small amounts—1 part per million—of ctDNA.
The researchers analyzed blood plasma samples from 171 individuals with early-stage lung cancer using the platform.
The findings, published on Monday in Nature Medicine, revealed that individuals with a low level of ctDNA before surgery were less likely to experience a relapse and had better overall survival rates compared to those with high levels of ctDNA.
The high sensitivity of the test enabled the detection of smaller amounts of ctDNA, preventing misclassification of patients with low levels of ctDNA as ctDNA-negative.
“We’ve shown that the presence or absence of tumour DNA in the blood was strongly predictive of prognosis. ctDNA testing, especially using ultrasensitive platforms, could help clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment and provide patients with a clearer understanding of how their disease might progress,” said James Black, Postdoctoral Clinical Fellow at the Francis Crick Institute.
Currently, treatment for early-stage lung cancer involves surgical removal of the tumour, often combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, depending on the stage of the disease. These approaches aim to maximize the chances of a cure.
The team noted that the test will next be evaluated on samples from patients who have undergone surgery for the earliest stages of lung cancer. This assessment will help determine whether the presence of post-operative ctDNA in blood can predict the risk of future relapse.
If successful, the approach could enable doctors to offer additional therapy after surgery, improving patients’ chances of being cured, the scientists added.

Title: India’s retail inflation falls to 4-month low of 5.22% in December
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:46:20 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a 4-month low of 5.22 per cent in December as prices of vegetables, pulses and sugar eased during the month bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Monday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after having touched a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October. CPI inflation had declined to 5.48 per cent in November.
The decline in retail inflation in December was attributed to the easing of the price spiral in key food items.
“During the month of December, a significant decline in inflation is observed in vegetables, pulses, sugar and confectionary, cereals and personal care &amp; effects,” according to a Ministry statement.
The year-on-year housing inflation rate for the month of December is 2.71 per cent, down from 2.87 per cent in November. The housing index is compiled for the urban sector only.
The top five items showing the highest year on year Inflation at the All India level in December 2024 are Peas (Vegetables) (89.12 per cent), Potato (68.23 per cent), Garlic (58.17 per cent), coconut oil (45.41 per cent) and Cauliflower (39.42 per cent). The key items having the lowest year-on-year inflation in December 2024 are jeera (-34.69), ginger (-22.93 per cent), dry chillies (-10.32 per cent), LPG (excl. conveyance) (-9.29 per cent), official data show.
The easing in inflation is a welcome sign as it was the first time that the rate of retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 per cent in October. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent on a durable basis before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth.
The RBI during its last policy review slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth but kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent with an eye on inflation.
The CRR has been reduced from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent which will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and bring down market interest rates.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
In his last monetary policy view, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “India’s growth story is still intact. Inflation is on the declining path, but we cannot overlook the significant risks in the outlook. This risk cannot be underestimated.”
He was optimistic about the outlook for the economy, observing that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.”

Title: A war room inaugurated at Rail Bhavan to monitor Mahakumbh Mela arrangements
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:22:04 +0000
Content: In preparation for the grand Mahakumbh 2025, Union Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, inaugurated a dedicated ‘war room’ at Rail Bhavan to monitor nine key railway stations in the Prayagraj region through 1,186 CCTV cameras.
The initiative is part of a comprehensive plan to ensure smooth operations and enhanced security during the Mahakumbh Mela, which is expected to attract over 40 crore devotees.
The war room, set up by the Railway Board, will provide real-time surveillance through 764 newly installed cameras, with 116 of these equipped for facial recognition.
A five-tier system has been put in place to analyze the camera feeds, track platform activities, and oversee passenger flow. Centralized control rooms at each station will coordinate with the war room for round-the-clock supervision.
Passenger Convenience at the Forefront
During the inauguration, Vaishnaw also launched a multilingual passenger guide booklet, available in 22 Indian languages and English, and announced the commencement of announcements in 12 Indian languages at Prayagraj station.
Highlighting the cultural significance of the Mahakumbh, the minister emphasized that Indian Railways has made extensive arrangements to facilitate the travel of devotees to Prayagraj for the sacred bathing at the Sangam.
To manage the increased influx of passengers, Indian Railways has bolstered its infrastructure, including the construction of 21 new Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and Road Under Bridges (RUBs), and the closure of all level crossing gates in the region.
A color-coded ticketing system has been introduced to streamline unreserved passengers’ entry at Prayagraj Junction and other stations.
Enhanced Facilities and Infrastructure

Title: Climate activists deface Darwin’s grave at London’s Westminster Abbey
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:17:46 +0000
Content: Climate activists from Just Stop Oil painted over the grave of British naturalist Charles Darwin at London’s Westminster Abbey on Monday.
Two activists entered Westminster Abbey – Britain’s site for royal weddings, coronations, burials and a major tourist attraction – on Monday morning and used spray chalk on Darwin’s grave, the campaign group said in a statement.
The activists wrote “1.5 is dead” in orange over the surface of the white marble gravestone – a reference to recent news that global temperatures in 2024 had exceeded 1.5 Celsius above the pre-industrial era for the first time.
“We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe,” one of the activists said. “Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.”
Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, died in 1882. He is buried in Westminster Abbey’s Scientists’ Corner, where Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking are also buried.
The church confirmed the incident in a statement.
“The Abbey’s conservators are taking immediate action to clean the memorial and do not anticipate that there will be any permanent damage,” a spokeswoman said.
“The police were called to the scene and dealt with the incident. The Abbey remains open for visiting and worshipping.”
London’s Metropolitan Police said two women had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at Westminster Abbey and taken to a central London police station.
Just Stop Oil activists have staged a number of high-profile protests in Britain including by disrupting sports and theatre events, painting over the U.S. embassy building in London and throwing soup at Van Gogh paintings.

Title: Indian Stock Market Plunges Over 1% Amid Mixed Cues
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:25:11 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market witnessed a sharp downturn on Monday, with both the Sensex and Nifty indexes plummeting over 1% amid a mix of global and domestic pressures. Strong employment data from the United States suggested fewer rate cuts in 2025, adding to concerns about tighter monetary policies.
Adding to the challenges, rising crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, and significant foreign capital outflows further dampened investor sentiment. The market sell-off resulted in a staggering loss of approximately ₹12 lakh crore for investors.
The Sensex closed at 76,330.01, falling by 1,048.90 points, or 1.36%, while the Nifty ended at 23,085.95, marking a decline of 345.55 points, or 1.47%. Heavy selling pressure was observed across sectors, particularly in real estate, public sector banks, metals, auto, and pharma. Realty stocks took a significant hit, with the sector declining over 6%.
Market experts attributed the decline to a ripple effect from global markets, which faced a broad sell-off. The robust US payroll data fueled concerns about prolonged monetary tightening, strengthening the dollar, raising bond yields, and reducing the appeal of emerging markets.
Rupak De of LKP Securities noted the growing bearish sentiment, saying, “Bears remained at the helm as the Nifty continued to breach crucial levels. The index slipped below its previous swing low on the daily chart, indicating increasing bearishness. However, it held the 23,000 mark, which remains a key level to watch. If the Nifty sustains above 23,000 over the next few days, it could signal a potential recovery. Conversely, a decisive fall below this level might trigger a deeper correction.”
Among the broader indices, the Nifty Bank fell by 692.90 points, or 1.42%, to settle at 48,041.25. The Nifty Midcap 100 plunged 2,195.35 points, or 4.02%, closing at 52,390.4. Meanwhile, the Nifty Smallcap 100 dropped 723.45 points, or 4.10%, to end at 16,922.10.
In terms of individual performances, companies like Zomato, Power Grid, Tata Steel, NTPC, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, and Sun Pharma were among the major losers in the Sensex pack. However, a few stocks, including Axis Bank, TCS, IndusInd Bank, and Hindustan Unilever Limited, bucked the trend to emerge as the top gainers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling streak for the sixth consecutive trading day, offloading equities worth ₹2,254.68 crore on January 10. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹3,961.92 crore, offering some respite to the market.
The mixed cues, coupled with escalating challenges from both global and domestic factors, signal continued volatility in the near term, with market participants closely watching the 23,000 level on the Nifty for further direction.

Title: My heart says PM Modi will very soon fulfil promise of restoring statehood: CM Omar Abdullah
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:11:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday highlighted the transformation of Jammu and Kashmir into a hub of engineering marvels, including tunnels, bridges, and ropeways. He said that the world’s highest tunnel, railroad bridge, and rail lines are being constructed in the region.
Speaking after inaugurating the newly constructed Z-Morh tunnel in Sonamarg, Jammu and Kashmir, the PM Highlighed the impressive engineering of the Chenab Bridge, PM Modi said, “Our Jammu and Kashmir is becoming a hub of tunnels, bridges, and ropeways. The highest tunnel in the world is being built here. The highest railroad bridge in the world is being built here. The highest rail lines in the world are being built here. The world is in awe after witnessing the marvel of the Chenab Bridge.”
PM Modi noted that he had come as a ‘sevak’ to fulfill longstanding demands of the people. “A few days ago, I had the opportunity to lay the foundation stone for a railway division in Jammu, fulfilling a long-standing demand. Today, I am handing over the Sonamarg Tunnel to the nation, fulfilling another promise. This is Modi—’wada karta hai to nibhata hai’ (if I make a promise, I fulfill it). This tunnel will ease the lives of the people of Kargil and Leh, reducing their hardships,” he added.
PM Modi reminisced about his earlier visits to the Kashmir Valley as a BJP worker, when he would travel on foot for hours through heavy snowfall. “Two days ago, our Chief Minister shared some pictures, which brought back memories. During my time as a BJP worker, I spent a lot of time here—in Sonamarg, Gulmarg, Baramulla, and Ganderbal. Despite the harsh winters, the warmth of the people of Jammu and Kashmir made us forget the cold,” he said.
The PM also extended festive greetings, noting the simultaneous celebrations of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu, and the beginning of the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.
PM Modi further emphasized the tourism potential of the region, especially during the “Chilla-i-Kalan” period, the harshest winter phase in the valley. “This time of year brings new opportunities for tourist destinations like Sonamarg, attracting visitors from across the country. The work on this tunnel began in 2015 under our government, and I am proud it has been completed. This tunnel will unlock various tourism opportunities in Sonamarg,” he said.
He also underscored the developmental strides being made in Jammu and Kashmir. “The region is now being connected by railways, and new schools and colleges are being built. This is the new Jammu and Kashmir. The entire nation is working together to make India a developed country. Our government, committed to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,’ ensures no region is left behind in the race for development,” he said.
The Sonamarg Tunnel project, spanning 12 km and constructed at a cost of over ₹2,700 crore, includes a 6.4 km main tunnel, an egress tunnel, and approach roads. Situated at an altitude of over 8,650 feet, it ensures all-weather connectivity between Srinagar and Sonamarg, bypassing landslide- and avalanche-prone routes. This will provide safer and uninterrupted access to the strategically critical Ladakh region.
The newly inaugurated tunnel is set to transform Sonamarg into a year-round tourist destination, boosting winter tourism, adventure sports, and local livelihoods. Along with the Zojila Tunnel, expected to be completed by 2028, it will reduce the route length from 49 km to 43 km and increase vehicle speeds from 30 km/h to 70 km/h, ensuring seamless NH-1 connectivity between Srinagar Valley and Ladakh.
This enhanced infrastructure is expected to strengthen defense logistics, drive economic growth, and foster socio-cultural integration across Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Title: Nvidia says new rule will weaken US leadership in AI
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 10:44:01 +0000
Content: Nvidia on Monday criticized a new effort by the Biden administration to tighten Washington’s grip on artificial intelligence chip flows around the world, saying the regulation would jeopardize current U.S. leadership in AI.
The new rule, which is expected to be published as soon as Monday, “threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” and would “undermine America’s leadership,” Nvidia Vice President of Government Affairs Ned Finkle said in a statement.
Reuters reported last month on the U.S. Commerce Department’s plan for approving global AI chip exports while also preventing bad actors from accessing them. One aim of the restrictions is to keep AI from supercharging China’s military capabilities.
Finkle argued America’s leading role in AI would be hurt because the rule “would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally.”
The Santa Clara, California-based company also said the rule would not improve U.S. national security and it would control technology that is already widely available in gaming and consumer hardware.
“Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” Finkle said.

Title: Odisha joins Ayushman Bharat Scheme, expands Health Coverage for 4.5 crore people
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:07:15 +0000
Content: Odisha has become the 34th state to implement the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), marking a milestone in its healthcare journey. The state signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Health Authority (NHA) at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, cementing the integration of the scheme with Odisha’s existing Gopabandhu Jan Arogya Yojana (GJAY).
The convergence of AB PM-JAY and GJAY will provide healthcare coverage of ₹5 lakh per family annually, with an additional ₹5 lakh for women. The scheme will bring approximately 1.03 crore families under its fold, with 67.8 lakh families funded by the Union Government. This collaboration aims to transform healthcare accessibility for nearly 86% of Odisha’s population.
Union Health Minister JP Nadda hailed the occasion as “a historic day for Odisha,” adding, “AB PM-JAY is not only the world’s largest health coverage scheme but also the fastest implemented since conception.” Highlighting the scheme’s impact, Nadda noted that it is fully digitized and covers nearly 45% of India’s population.
Since its launch, AB PM-JAY has facilitated over 8.19 crore hospital admissions across India, with ₹1.13 lakh crore spent on providing healthcare to underserved communities. Nadda clarified that the increase in hospital admissions signifies improved access to affordable healthcare, rather than a rise in illnesses. “In remote and conflict-affected regions like Bastar and Bijapur, admissions have grown by 4.3%, while Madhya Pradesh has seen a 30-fold increase in hospitalizations due to this scheme,” he said.
Citing a Lancet study, the Minister emphasized the scheme’s transformative role in Southeast Asia, where healthcare access for cancer patients has surged by 33%. “The scheme has revolutionized early cancer diagnoses and promoted health-seeking behavior, especially among women,” he added.
Odisha’s Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Mohan Charan Majhi said, “People in our state, who were earlier limited to treatment in 900 empaneled hospitals, now have cashless access to over 29,000 government and private hospitals.” Majhi projected the integrated schemes will collectively benefit around 4.5 crore residents of Odisha. “This transformative step will significantly elevate the health status of our state,” he said, emphasizing that digital healthcare advancements would complement this progress.
Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan echoed these sentiments, calling the MoU a “new beginning in Odisha’s healthcare story.”
Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw described the partnership as a progressive leap towards achieving the vision of a developed India. “The integration of these schemes will enhance Odisha’s healthcare services, reducing disparities and strengthening infrastructure across rural and urban areas,” he stated.
Kanak Vardhan Singh Deo, another key speaker, highlighted the government’s focus on addressing health inequalities through this initiative. “This integration is a bold step in bridging the gap between economically weaker sections and quality healthcare, ensuring better equity across Odisha’s districts,” he remarked.
With the convergence, Odisha residents now gain access to nearly 2,000 medical procedures spanning 27 specialties, including bypass surgeries and knee replacements. The MoU is expected to digitally modernize the state’s healthcare system, aligning with the broader goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘Utkarsh Odisha.’

Title: Magnitude 6.9 earthquake hits southern Japan
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:46:41 +0000
Content: An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 struck the Kyushu region of southern Japan on Monday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
Tsunami advisories for waves of a maximum height of 1 metre were issued for the southern prefectures of Miyazaki and Kochi.
A 20-centimetre tsunami was later recorded reaching Miyazaki city, public broadcaster NHK reported. The city – the prefectural capital – has a population of roughly 400,000 people.
There were no abnormalities reported at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant in western Japan or the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, NHK said, referring to the two plants nearest to where the quake occurred.
The JMA is investigating whether the quake was related to the Nankai Trough, NHK said.
Japan in August issued its first-ever advisory of higher-than-usual risks of a megaquake after a strong quake occurred at the edge of a tremulous seabed zone along the Pacific coast known as the Nankai Trough.

Title: India set to redefine global trade at 6.4% CAGR over next decade: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:28:44 +0000
Content: India is poised to redefine its role in global trade, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4 per cent in trade over the next decade, roughly in line with its high GDP growth, according to a report on Monday.
The ASEAN region and especially India, are among the greatest beneficiaries of production shifts spurred by geopolitics, such as trade tensions between the US and China.
“We project 6.4 per cent CAGR in India’s total trade through 2033, to $1.8 trillion annually, roughly in line with its high GDP growth,” according to the report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
As the world increasingly pivots toward resilient and diversified supply chains, India’s ‘China+1’ strategy, backed by its large domestic market, skilled workforce, and forward-looking policies, positions it as a preferred global manufacturing hub.
“Strengthening partnerships with the US, EU, and emerging regions like Africa and ASEAN will be pivotal for India to capitalise on this momentum and drive inclusive, sustainable growth in global trade,” said Nishant Gupta, Managing Director Partner, BCG India.
India is emerging as the other big Global South trade story as it pursues favourable relations with most of the world’s major economies.
Among the drivers will be India’s growing popularity as a production base for companies seeking to diversify supply chains concentrated in China, hefty government incentives for manufacturing, a huge low-cost workforce, and rapidly improving infrastructure, said the report.
The analysis by BCG’s Center for Geopolitics estimates that global trade is set to top $29 trillion by 2033, but the routes these goods will travel is changing at a remarkable pace. The Global South, which accounts for around 30 per cent of global trade, is likely to see several major shifts over the coming decade.
Geopolitical rivalries, alliances, and aspirations are rewiring the global economy — and will continue to do so in the years ahead, accelerated by the imposition of tariffs by the US on foreign imports, the report mentioned.
Without a broad increase in tariffs, world trade in goods will keep growing at an average of 2.9 per cent annually for the next eight years, but the routes goods travel will change markedly as North America reduces its dependence on China and China builds up its links with the Global South, which is cementing its power in the global trade map.
“Trade lanes were already shifting from historical patterns and looming US tariffs will accelerate this. Navigating these new dynamics will be critical for any global business,” said Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director and partner at BCG, global leader of the Global Advantage practice.
In terms of product categories imported by the US, the greatest impact would be on imported auto parts and automotive vehicles, which would primarily affect trade with Mexico, the EU, and Japan.
Consumer electronics, electrical machinery, and fashion goods would be most affected by higher tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We estimate that a 60 per cent tariff rate would add $61 billion to cost of importing consumer electronics products from China into the US,” said the report.

Title: Study shows tumour DNA in blood may help predict lung cancer outcomes
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:57:27 +0000
Content: A team of British scientists has found that a blood test to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) may help predict lung cancer outcomes.
Circulating tumour DNA, which consists of fragments of DNA released into the blood by tumours, is known to play an important role in disease prognosis but is challenging to measure accurately.
In a study, researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London used a whole-genome sequencing platform called NeXT Personal, which can detect very small amounts—1 part per million—of ctDNA.
The researchers analyzed blood plasma samples from 171 individuals with early-stage lung cancer using the platform.
The findings, published on Monday in Nature Medicine, revealed that individuals with a low level of ctDNA before surgery were less likely to experience a relapse and had better overall survival rates compared to those with high levels of ctDNA.
The high sensitivity of the test enabled the detection of smaller amounts of ctDNA, preventing misclassification of patients with low levels of ctDNA as ctDNA-negative.
“We’ve shown that the presence or absence of tumour DNA in the blood was strongly predictive of prognosis. ctDNA testing, especially using ultrasensitive platforms, could help clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment and provide patients with a clearer understanding of how their disease might progress,” said James Black, Postdoctoral Clinical Fellow at the Francis Crick Institute.
Currently, treatment for early-stage lung cancer involves surgical removal of the tumour, often combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, depending on the stage of the disease. These approaches aim to maximize the chances of a cure.
The team noted that the test will next be evaluated on samples from patients who have undergone surgery for the earliest stages of lung cancer. This assessment will help determine whether the presence of post-operative ctDNA in blood can predict the risk of future relapse.
If successful, the approach could enable doctors to offer additional therapy after surgery, improving patients’ chances of being cured, the scientists added.

Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a 4-month low of 5.22 per cent in December as prices of vegetables, pulses and sugar eased during the month bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Monday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after having touched a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October. CPI inflation had declined to 5.48 per cent in November.
The decline in retail inflation in December was attributed to the easing of the price spiral in key food items.
“During the month of December, a significant decline in inflation is observed in vegetables, pulses, sugar and confectionary, cereals and personal care &amp; effects,” according to a Ministry statement.
The year-on-year housing inflation rate for the month of December is 2.71 per cent, down from 2.87 per cent in November. The housing index is compiled for the urban sector only.
The top five items showing the highest year on year Inflation at the All India level in December 2024 are Peas (Vegetables) (89.12 per cent), Potato (68.23 per cent), Garlic (58.17 per cent), coconut oil (45.41 per cent) and Cauliflower (39.42 per cent). The key items having the lowest year-on-year inflation in December 2024 are jeera (-34.69), ginger (-22.93 per cent), dry chillies (-10.32 per cent), LPG (excl. conveyance) (-9.29 per cent), official data show.
The easing in inflation is a welcome sign as it was the first time that the rate of retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 per cent in October. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent on a durable basis before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth.
The RBI during its last policy review slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth but kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent with an eye on inflation.
The CRR has been reduced from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent which will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and bring down market interest rates.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
In his last monetary policy view, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “India’s growth story is still intact. Inflation is on the declining path, but we cannot overlook the significant risks in the outlook. This risk cannot be underestimated.”
He was optimistic about the outlook for the economy, observing that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.”

Title: A war room inaugurated at Rail Bhavan to monitor Mahakumbh Mela arrangements
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:22:04 +0000
Content: In preparation for the grand Mahakumbh 2025, Union Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, inaugurated a dedicated ‘war room’ at Rail Bhavan to monitor nine key railway stations in the Prayagraj region through 1,186 CCTV cameras.
The initiative is part of a comprehensive plan to ensure smooth operations and enhanced security during the Mahakumbh Mela, which is expected to attract over 40 crore devotees.
The war room, set up by the Railway Board, will provide real-time surveillance through 764 newly installed cameras, with 116 of these equipped for facial recognition.
A five-tier system has been put in place to analyze the camera feeds, track platform activities, and oversee passenger flow. Centralized control rooms at each station will coordinate with the war room for round-the-clock supervision.
Passenger Convenience at the Forefront
During the inauguration, Vaishnaw also launched a multilingual passenger guide booklet, available in 22 Indian languages and English, and announced the commencement of announcements in 12 Indian languages at Prayagraj station.
Highlighting the cultural significance of the Mahakumbh, the minister emphasized that Indian Railways has made extensive arrangements to facilitate the travel of devotees to Prayagraj for the sacred bathing at the Sangam.
To manage the increased influx of passengers, Indian Railways has bolstered its infrastructure, including the construction of 21 new Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and Road Under Bridges (RUBs), and the closure of all level crossing gates in the region.
A color-coded ticketing system has been introduced to streamline unreserved passengers’ entry at Prayagraj Junction and other stations.
Enhanced Facilities and Infrastructure
Indian Railways has also expanded platform capacity across nine Prayagraj region stations, including Prayagraj Junction, Naini Junction, and Phaphamau Junction, increasing the total number of platforms to 48. Seven new stations have been developed with second entry points, and Subedarganj station has been designated as a satellite hub for Prayagraj Junction.
To support passenger flow, 17 new temporary passenger shelters have been added, bringing the total to 28 shelters in the region. These shelters now have a holding capacity of 110,000 passengers, a significant increase from the previous 21,000.
Indian Railways has also made provisions to issue over 10 lakh tickets daily, incorporating a digital UTS barcode system to facilitate smoother ticketing.
Security and Assistance for Devotees
Over 13,000 railway employees and 10,000 personnel from the Government Railway Police have been deployed to manage operations and assist passengers.
An additional 1,000 volunteers will help travellers, and cleanliness teams will work around the clock to maintain hygiene at stations. First aid booths and medical observation rooms staffed with doctors and medical personnel will be operational at all stations.
The stations have also been adorned with over 20,000 square meters of Kumbh-themed artwork to reflect the cultural grandeur of the Mahakumbh. New foot overbridges, ramps, and color-coded foot markers have been installed for passenger convenience.
Special Arrangements for Key Bathing Dates
The Mahakumbh 2025, to be held at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers in Prayagraj, will take place from January 13 to February 26, 2025. The Indian Railways has made special arrangements for the key dates on which the pilgrims are expected to come in large numbers, such as Paush Purnima: January 13, 2025, Makar Sankranti: January 14, 2025, Mauni Amavasya: January 29, 2025, Basant Panchami: February 3, 2025, Magh Purnima: February 12, 2025 and Maha Shivaratri: February 26, 2025
With extensive preparations and a robust monitoring system in place, Indian Railways is playing a pivotal role in ensuring the successful execution of Mahakumbh 2025, which is expected to see participation from devotees across India and over 100 countries worldwide.

Title: Climate activists deface Darwin’s grave at London’s Westminster Abbey
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:17:46 +0000
Content: Climate activists from Just Stop Oil painted over the grave of British naturalist Charles Darwin at London’s Westminster Abbey on Monday.
Two activists entered Westminster Abbey – Britain’s site for royal weddings, coronations, burials and a major tourist attraction – on Monday morning and used spray chalk on Darwin’s grave, the campaign group said in a statement.
The activists wrote “1.5 is dead” in orange over the surface of the white marble gravestone – a reference to recent news that global temperatures in 2024 had exceeded 1.5 Celsius above the pre-industrial era for the first time.
“We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe,” one of the activists said. “Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.”
Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, died in 1882. He is buried in Westminster Abbey’s Scientists’ Corner, where Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking are also buried.
The church confirmed the incident in a statement.
“The Abbey’s conservators are taking immediate action to clean the memorial and do not anticipate that there will be any permanent damage,” a spokeswoman said.
“The police were called to the scene and dealt with the incident. The Abbey remains open for visiting and worshipping.”
London’s Metropolitan Police said two women had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at Westminster Abbey and taken to a central London police station.
Just Stop Oil activists have staged a number of high-profile protests in Britain including by disrupting sports and theatre events, painting over the U.S. embassy building in London and throwing soup at Van Gogh paintings.

Title: EAM Jaishankar meets Spain Foreign Minister, strengthens India-EU relationship
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:22:23 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, currently on a two-day visit to Spain, met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares on Monday, urging for deeper cooperation to strengthen bilateral ties between India and Spain.
During the meeting, Jaishankar announced the signing of two key agreements between the two nations—one focused on sports and the other on sustainable urban development. “We have signed two agreements—one in sports and the other in sustainable urban development. They are indicative of how we are broadening our area of cooperation,” Jaishankar said, noting Spain’s significant influence within the EU. He emphasized that Spain’s voice in Brussels could play a critical role in deepening India-EU relations. “If the voice of Spain is more clearly and effectively heard in Brussels in support of the relationship, it would certainly help deepen our ties,” he added.
Jaishankar also urged Spain to contribute to India’s “Make in India” initiative, highlighting that over 230 Spanish companies currently operate in India. “We would welcome more of them to join us in ‘Make in India,’ ‘Design in India,’ and collaborate with India,” he said. The two countries have made notable progress in defense and security, with Jaishankar mentioning the recent handover of the C295 aircraft during Spanish President Pedro Sánchez’s visit to India. “We look forward to intensifying our defense and security cooperation,” he added, praising the collaboration between the Indian and Spanish militaries.
In a bid to foster people-to-people ties, Jaishankar also shared plans to make 2026 a year of artificial intelligence, culture, and tourism between the two nations. “Looking ahead, one important milestone we have agreed on is 2026 as a year of culture, tourism, and AI. I think it will help bring our people much closer,” he said.
Jaishankar expressed his satisfaction with the recent opening of the Spanish Consulate in Bengaluru, which he called a “good sign” for deepening India-Spain ties. He also spoke about the growing need for mobility of skilled professionals, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, between the two countries. “The era of AI will call for greater mobility of skilled professionals. I was very happy that we have recently opened our consulate in Barcelona, and we look forward to your consulate in Bengaluru,” he noted.
Highlighting India’s interest in the Mediterranean region, Jaishankar shared that India’s annual trade with Mediterranean countries stands at USD 80 billion. “India actually has a fairly strong interest in the Mediterranean,” he said, noting that India has Indian companies operating ports in the region and is involved in defense, security, and green hydrogen projects. He reiterated the importance of Spain’s support in this regard, adding that India would be more visible in the Mediterranean in the coming years.
Jaishankar also pointed to India’s ongoing peacekeeping role in Lebanon and the Golan Heights under the UN, underscoring shared interests in global peace and security. “Our peacekeepers are deployed in Lebanon and the Golan Heights, and we have common interests in advancing peace and security,” he said.
On broader global issues, Jaishankar mentioned concerns about the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the Middle East, the future of Ukraine, and terrorism, all of which would feature prominently in ongoing discussions between the two countries. He expressed confidence that closer cooperation between India and Spain, along with stronger India-EU ties, could play a stabilizing role in the face of global uncertainties. “The world may look today a little volatile and uncertain, but it is important that countries with similar attitudes and converging interests work more closely,” Jaishankar said.
Reflecting on the progress of India-Spain relations, Jaishankar recalled his visit to Spain in 2017 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting that the bilateral relationship had made significant strides since then. “We can see in the ensuing years that there has been very good progress in our cooperation,” Jaishankar remarked. He also highlighted the growing bilateral trade, which currently stands at around 10 billion euros, with promising opportunities in areas like railways, digital technology, urban technologies, and green clean technologies.
Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares expressed Spain’s eagerness to strengthen ties with India, especially in light of the upcoming bilateral summit later this year. He highlighted the importance of the summit in reviewing the international context, including the Indo-Pacific region, global affairs, and development funding. “We hope to agree on a new strategic agenda between India and Europe and give a new boost to negotiations between the EU and India,” Albares said, emphasizing India’s crucial role in development funding, particularly at the UN Development Summit in Seville, Spain, in June 2025.

Title: India’s GDP growth likely to reach 6.7% next fiscal: Crisil
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:17:09 +0000
Content: India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to improve to 6.7% in the next fiscal year (FY25), according to a Crisil Intelligence report. The report noted that a sustained decline in food inflation, combined with stable non-food inflation, could create room for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the coming months.
Headline inflation is steadily progressing toward the RBI’s 4% target, as food inflation eased for the second consecutive month and non-food inflation remained stable.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation cooled to 5.2% in December, down from 5.5% in November. Food inflation eased to 8.4% from 9%, while non-food inflation remained stable at 3.1%.
“For the current fiscal, CPI inflation is projected to average 4.6%, with a slight upward bias in the forecast,” the Crisil report stated.
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose to 5.2% in November, up from 3.7% in October (revised from an earlier estimate of 3.5%). This growth was primarily driven by strong performance in investment goods and consumer durables, aided by a low base effect.
The National Statistical Office’s (NSO) first advance estimates indicate a moderation in GDP growth to 6.4% for the current fiscal, down from 8.2% last year.
“Looking ahead, we expect GDP growth to improve to 6.7% in FY25 under our base case scenario. Factors such as anticipated RBI rate cuts, lower crude oil prices, and a normal monsoon are expected to support growth,” the report added.
Agricultural growth is also likely to rise, as higher reservoir levels bode well for rabi crop output. This, in turn, is expected to boost farm incomes and rural consumption.
Additionally, increased agricultural production is likely to alleviate pressure on food inflation during the remainder of the current fiscal, which could further enhance discretionary consumption.

Title: PM Modi launches ‘Mission Mausam’ on IMD’s 150th Foundation Day, celebrates advancements in meteorology
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 07:00:42 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched ‘Mission Mausam’, an ambitious initiative by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), as the organization marked its 150th foundation day. Speaking at the event, PM Modi lauded IMD as a symbol of India’s scientific journey, reflecting the country’s progress in advanced science and technology over the years.
Highlighting the significance of the occasion, PM Modi announced the release of a special postage stamp and commemorative coin to celebrate IMD’s achievements. “In these 150 years, IMD has not only served crores of Indians but has also become a symbol of India’s scientific journey,” he remarked. The Prime Minister also praised the IMD for organizing the National Meteorological Olympiad, which saw thousands of students participating, further fueling their interest in meteorology.
The Prime Minister emphasized that IMD’s 150-year journey mirrors India’s advancements in science and technology. “These 150 years have not only been the journey of the country’s Weather Department but the journey of advanced science and technology in our country,” he said, underscoring how research and innovation in scientific institutions are central to the vision of New India.
PM Modi highlighted the significant strides made in IMD’s infrastructure and technology. “In the last 10 years, there has been an unprecedented expansion of the infrastructure and technology of IMD,” he noted, adding that the number of modern facilities such as Doppler weather radar, automatic weather stations, runway weather monitoring systems, and district-wise rainfall monitoring stations has increased manifold. He also pointed out how India’s space and digital technologies are benefiting meteorology, citing the country’s two meteorological observatories, Maitri and Bharati, located in Antarctica.
On the occasion, PM Modi introduced ‘Mission Mausam’, an initiative aimed at making India a climate-smart nation and reinforcing the country’s commitment to a sustainable future. “Mission Mausam is a symbol of India’s commitment towards a sustainable future and future readiness,” he said.
The Prime Minister also connected the foundation of IMD to the cultural significance of Makar Sankranti, celebrated on the same day. “IMD was founded on 15th January 1975, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. As a person from Gujarat, Makar Sankranti is my favorite festival. On this day, people of Gujarat go to their terraces to fly kites, and I too would do the same when I was in Gujarat,” PM Modi said, reflecting on his personal connection to the festival.
Alongside the launch of ‘Mission Mausam’, PM Modi also released a commemorative coin and the ‘Vision 2047’ document, outlining IMD’s goals for the next phase of its development. Union Minister Jitendra Singh, present at the event, commended IMD’s advancements, revealing that the accuracy of weather forecasts has improved by 50% over the past decade. He also noted that the number of radar networks has significantly increased from a handful to 39 under PM Modi’s leadership.

Content: The first ‘Amrit Snan’ (royal bath) of the Maha Kumbh Mela witnessed 13.8 million devotees taking a holy dip at the Sangam in Prayagraj by 10:30 am on Tuesday, according to officials.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath hailed the event as a “living testament” to India’s eternal culture and faith. In a post on X, he congratulated the devotees, saying, “On the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti, congratulations to all the devotees who earned virtue by taking the first ‘Amrit Snan’ at the Triveni Sangam in Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj!”

Title: Banks hike interest rates on FDs amid fierce competition for deposits
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 06:43:07 +0000
Content: Banks have started offering higher returns on FDs amid fierce competition to raise more deposits. While leading banks such as SBI and HDFC were the first to raise interest rates on FDs, smaller banks such as IDBI have followed suit for fear of getting left behind in the race.
SBI introduced a new category of super senior citizens above 80 years — who will get 10 basis points more than senior citizens. This scheme has been adopted by IDBI Bank as well.
IDBI Bank has launched the ‘IDBI Chiranjeevi-Super Senior Citizen FD’, a fixed deposit product exclusively for individuals aged 80 years and above.
The scheme offers an additional 0.65 per cent interest above the standard fixed deposit rates. The interest rates under this scheme include 8.05 per cent for a 555-day tenure, 7.9 per cent for 375 days, 8 per cent for 444 days, and 7.85 per cent for 700 days. The scheme is effective from January 13, 2025.
As part of the new innovative savings schemes, the State Bank of India (SBI) has also introduced a ‘Har Ghar Lakhpati’ (lakhpati in every home) recurring deposit scheme. The objective of the scheme is to enable individuals to accumulate a corpus of Rs one lakh or more through small monthly savings over three to ten years.
Individuals, including minors aged 10 and above, are eligible to open an account.
For people under age 60, the scheme offers interest rates of 6.75 per cent for tenures of three and four years, and 6.50 per cent for tenures of five to 10 years. For those above 60, it offers 7.25 per cent for three and four years, and 7 per cent for years five to 10.
Similarly, Bank of Baroda has rolled out liquid fixed deposits, customers can withdraw in units of Rs 1,000 after an initial deposit of Rs 5,000. Deposits exceeding Rs 5,000 must also be in multiples of Rs 1,000.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at a review meeting held earlier, asked the chiefs of public sector banks to accelerate the growth rate of their deposits to match the quicker pace at which the credit is growing.
The growth rate of deposits at the time was 3 to 4 per cent slower than the pace at which credit was growing in recent months which was seen as posing a risk of asset-liability mismatch in the banking system.

Title: Jaishankar highlights India’s global influence and strong ties with Spain
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 06:14:49 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, currently on a two-day visit to Spain, on Monday underscored India’s growing global prominence and its ability to provide meaningful support during challenging times.
Addressing the Indian diaspora in Madrid, Jaishankar highlighted the significant advancements in India-Spain relations and emphasized India’s rising global stature.
Jaishankar shared that his invitation by Spain’s Foreign Minister to address the country’s ambassadors at a global conference marked a historic moment. “It is the first time that a foreign ambassador was invited to address the global ambassadors of Spain,” he said. Reflecting on this, he remarked that the invitation signified the importance of India’s position on the world stage. “When a foreign ministry and ambassadors of another country ask you to come and speak to them, it’s worth thinking why. India’s positioning today is very important,” Jaishankar noted.
The External Affairs Minister highlighted India’s economic strength and leadership, positioning the country as a key player in global conversations. “Today, we are the fifth-largest economy, poised to be the third-largest,” he said. Jaishankar attributed India’s global influence to its capabilities and ideas, emphasizing the country’s growing recognition worldwide.
Jaishankar further discussed India’s ability to engage with diverse nations and facilitate dialogue between countries with conflicting interests. “There are very few countries in a position to talk to Russia and Ukraine; Israel and Iran; being members of Quad and BRICS. PM Modi is able to do both,” he remarked, referring to India’s unique diplomatic reach. He also emphasized India’s principle of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” in addressing global challenges, a philosophy that the world has come to appreciate.
Reflecting on India’s contributions during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaishankar highlighted the country’s role in providing vaccines to more than 100 nations. “If you go around the world, there are 100 countries that say, ‘If we got our vaccine, it was because of India,'” he said. He also recalled how Spain’s President Sanchez had personally reached out to Prime Minister Modi for supplies of Hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic.
Jaishankar further stressed India’s willingness to assist countries in need, pointing out that India’s contributions are not just about resources but about the country’s credibility and capacity to act as a bridge in times of crisis. “In difficult times, there is a country named India, willing to talk to and help different parties. It’s not about money or resources but about heart and mind,” he added.
On the economic front, Jaishankar acknowledged the strong trade ties between India and Spain, with bilateral trade currently valued at 10 billion euros annually. He also expressed optimism about expanding collaboration in areas such as railways, automobiles, clean technologies, and space. “The estimate of 10 billion euros might increase in the future,” he said, noting the growing importance of strong supply chains and relationships between nations in the current global climate.
Jaishankar also highlighted the invaluable role of the Indian diaspora in strengthening India’s foreign policy. “I hear very good words about the community… It’s something I hear across the world, and every time, I feel good. So I want to thank all of you,” he said, acknowledging their efforts in reinforcing India’s global standing.
Further strengthening India-Spain relations, Jaishankar announced that a Spanish consulate would soon be established in Bengaluru, a significant move in enhancing people-to-people ties between the two countries. He described this as a “good sign” for deepening business and cultural connections.
Looking ahead, Jaishankar revealed that 2026 would be designated as a “dual year” to celebrate India-Spain collaboration in culture, artificial intelligence, and tourism. “It will have a long-term good impact on ties,” he concluded, signaling a bright future for the bilateral relationship.

Title: Biden defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 06:09:37 +0000
Content: Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his foreign policy record on Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that remain unresolved.
A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden addressed U.S. diplomats at the State Department and touted his administration’s backing for Ukraine against Russia’s 2022 invasion and for Israel’s wars in the Middle East.
Biden said the United States was “winning the worldwide competition” and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted, while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S. involvement.
“Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,” Biden said. “We have not gone to war to make these things happen.”
While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials hope a deal betweenIsrael and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20.
Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid.
“So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace, a right to determine their own futures. Israel deserves peace and real security. The hostages and their families deserve to be reunited,” Biden said. “And so we’re working urgently to close this deal.”
Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support, since the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also drawing accusations of genocide in a World Court case brought by South Africa and of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Israel denies the allegations. The assault has displaced nearly Gaza’s entire 2.3 million population and drawn the concern of the world’s main hunger monitor.
Protesters shouting “war criminal” greeted Biden outside the State Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid intended to look like blood.
Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president also hailed Washington’s support for Israel during two Iranian attacks in 2024.
“All told, Iran is weaker than it’s been in decades,” he added, noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. “There’s no question that our actions contributed significantly.”
AUTHORITARIAN ALLIANCE
Biden acknowledged that authoritarian states China, Iran, North Korea and Russia were now more closely aligned with one another, but he said that was more “out of weakness than out of strength.”
Ukraine, with U.S. backing, had thwarted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goal of wiping the country off the map, Biden said, touting his 2023 visit to Kyiv as the first by a sitting president to a war zone outside the control of U.S. forces.
“When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he (could) conquer Kyiv in a matter of days. Truth is, since that war began, I’m the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him,” Biden said.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, said Biden’s address amounted to an acknowledgement “that U.S. support for Kyiv created the risk of triggering a nuclear confrontation with Russia.”
“Today’s statement by Biden is an admission of a deliberately executed provocation,” Zakharova wrote. “The Biden administration knew it was pushing the world toward the brink and still chose to escalate the conflict.”
Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying there was nothing adversaries like China and Russia would have liked more than seeing the United States continue to be tied down there for another decade.
Biden said when he entered the White House, experts predicted it was inevitable that China would surpass the United States in economic terms. Now, he predicted, that will never happen. He said the U.S. economy was moving forward, but there was still work to do.
“Now, make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with,” Biden said, including in Ukraine, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. He said the Biden administration was leaving the next administration “a very strong hand to play.”

Title: IMD’s 150th Foundation Day: PM Modi to launch ‘Mission Mausam’
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 06:00:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday will launch ‘Mission Mausam’, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at making India a weather-ready and climate-smart nation, as part of the celebrations marking the 150th Foundation Day of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The event, set to take place at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, marks a significant step in the country’s efforts to strengthen its weather surveillance and climate resilience capabilities.
Mission Mausam focuses on enhancing atmospheric observations with next-generation radars, satellites, and high-performance computers, while improving the understanding of weather and climate processes. The mission will also provide critical air quality data to aid long-term weather management and intervention strategies.
In addition to launching Mission Mausam, PM Modi will unveil the IMD Vision-2047 document, which outlines a roadmap for weather resilience and climate change adaptation. The plan highlights advancements in weather forecasting, climate change mitigation, and weather management strategies.
Approved by the Union Cabinet in September 2024, Mission Mausam comes with a budget of Rs 2,000 crore over two years. The project will primarily be implemented by the India Meteorological Department, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, and the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting.
The mission is expected to benefit a wide array of sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, defence, aviation, energy, and health. Additionally, it will support data-driven decision-making in urban planning, transport, and environmental monitoring.
To commemorate IMD’s 150 years of service, a series of events, workshops, and activities have been organized, celebrating the department’s role in making India more climate-resilient and showcasing its contributions to weather and climate services.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open higher; HCLTech shares plunge 9 percent
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 05:09:08 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened higher on Tuesday, with the Nifty 50 gaining 113.60 points to 23,199.55 and the Sensex adding 370.21 points to 76,700.22 by 9:16 AM.
However, shares of HCLTech tumbled 9 percent in early trade after its Q3 earnings report failed to meet expectations, prompting brokerage firm Nuvama to downgrade the stock from “buy” to “hold.”
Market experts indicated that broader market valuations remain stretched, with concerns about a potential sharp correction.
The Nifty 50 saw a 1.5 percent drop on Monday, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses and its sixth session in the red out of the last seven.
Rising US bond yields, a stronger dollar, and uncertainty around U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies were cited as key factors behind the recent market turbulence.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said: “After getting buffeted by a falling rupee, persistent FPI selling, weak economic data and challenging global cues, today looks like a technical bounce day from hugely oversold levels. Whether this level makes a bottom or we get another “sell on every rise” move remains to be seen. There is some global good news with reports that the Trump cabinet is proposing gradual tariffs post his inauguration on January 20th.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, pointed out that support lies in the 22,830-23,000 range, with resistance expected in the 23,450-23,500 zone.
Sectoral indices saw widespread gains, except for Nifty IT and Nifty FMCG. Nifty Realty surged 1.68 percent, Nifty Media rose 2 percent, and Nifty PSU Bank gained 2.37 percent.
Among the Nifty 50 stocks, NTPC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, and Adani Group companies led the gains, while HCLTech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, and TCS were the biggest laggards.
The broader Asian markets exhibited mixed trends, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Singapore’s Strait Times declining, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Taiwan’s Weighted Index, and South Korea’s KOSPI were in the green.
Key earnings announcements today include HDFC AMC, Network 18, Shoppers Stop, and Hathway Cable.

Title: North Korea fires short-range missiles ahead of Trump return
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 05:04:37 +0000
Content: North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, marking Pyongyang’s latest show of force just days ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office.
The missiles travelled about 250 km (155 miles) after lifting off at around 09:30 am (0030 GMT) from Kanggye, Jagang Province, near the country’s border with China, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
“We strongly condemn the launch as a clear provocation that seriously threatens the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,” the JCS said, warning the North against “misjudging” the situation and vowing to “overwhelmingly respond” to any additional provocations.
South Korea’s Acting President Choi Sang-mok also condemned the launch as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and said Seoul would sternly respond to North Korea’s provocations.
Seoul’s presidential office said its national security council held a meeting to review the situation and pledged an airtight posture.
Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he was aware of the missile test, and Tokyo was taking all possible measures to respond through close cooperation with Washington and Seoul, including real-time sharing of missile warning data.
The launch came about a week after the North fired what it claimed was a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile, which was its first missile test since Nov. 5.
The latest missile firing also occurred during a visit to Seoul by Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Iwaya condemned the North’s nuclear and missile development on Monday and pledged to boost security ties following talks in Seoul.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while visiting Seoul last week, also called for further strengthening of bilateral and trilateral cooperation involving Tokyo to better counter Pyongyang’s growing military threats.
Tuesday’s launch occurred days before the inauguration of Trump, who held unprecedented summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his first term and has touted their personal rapport.
South Korean lawmakers, after being briefed by the National Intelligence Service, said on Monday that Pyongyang’s recent weapons tests were partly aimed at “showing off its U.S. deterrent assets and drawing Trump’s attention” after vowing “the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction” at a key year-end policy meeting last month.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah named ICC Men’s Player of the month for December 2024
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:59:02 +0000
Content: Indian pace sensation Jasprit Bumrah has been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December 2024, following a string of extraordinary performances during India’s tour of Australia. The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the accolade on Tuesday, recognizing Bumrah’s dominance over world-class opposition.
Bumrah edged out tough competition from Australia’s Pat Cummins and South Africa’s Dane Paterson to claim the award. Over three grueling Test matches, Bumrah spearheaded India’s bowling attack, scalping an impressive 22 wickets at an exceptional average of 14.22, reaffirming his stature as one of the finest bowlers in world cricket.
The Adelaide Test marked the beginning of Bumrah’s stellar run, where his four-wicket haul curtailed Australia’s lead in the first innings, keeping India in contention. His heroics continued in Brisbane, where a devastating six-wicket spell in the first innings and three more wickets in the second innings left Australia’s batting line-up in tatters. Despite rain curtailing the match, Bumrah’s performance ensured India remained alive in the series.
Bumrah’s brilliance was on full display in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. He picked up four wickets in the first innings and followed it with a five-wicket haul in the second, dismissing Australia for 234. However, his lone-warrior efforts couldn’t prevent a 184-run defeat as India’s batting order faltered.
The tour was a challenging one for India, but Bumrah stood tall, consistently delivering match-defining spells. His remarkable achievements during the series included reaching the milestone of 200 Test wickets, becoming the fourth-fastest bowler to achieve the feat in terms of balls bowled. He also etched his name in history as the first bowler to claim 200 Test wickets at an average below 20.
For his exceptional contributions, which earned him the Player of the Series title as well, Jasprit Bumrah was crowned the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December 2024.

Title: Death of Indian national in Russia: India calls for early discharge of remaining Indians from conflict zone
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:52:35 +0000
Content: Reacting to reports of the death of an Indian national in Russia, India on Tuesday reiterated its demand for the early discharge of the remaining Indians currently serving the Russian Army in the conflict zones.
“We have learnt of the unfortunate death of an Indian national from Kerala who had apparently been recruited to serve in the Russian Army. Another Indian national from Kerala, who was similarly recruited, has been injured and is receiving treatment in a hospital in Moscow,” said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.
Offering condolences to the family of the deceased, the senior diplomat stated that the Indian Embassy in Moscow is in touch with the families, and all possible assistance is being rendered.
“We are working with the Russian authorities for early transportation of the mortal remains to India. We have also sought the early discharge and repatriation to India of the injured person. The matter has been strongly taken up with the Russian authorities in Moscow as well as with the Russian Embassy in New Delhi today. We have also reiterated our demand for the early discharge of the remaining Indian nationals,” he added.
The plight of Indians fighting for Russia in the Ukraine war is a key concern for New Delhi.
India has maintained that the recruitment of Indian nationals into the Russian army in a conflict situation is not in consonance with the India-Russia diplomatic partnership, and has asked for the early release and return of all such Indian nationals.

Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:46:49 +0000
Content: Russia is prepared to study U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s peace initiatives on Ukraine when he takes office next week, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday.
Lavrov cautioned that Trump’s comments on the war – which he previously said he could end within 24 hours of entering the White House – were being made before his inauguration, but said Russia welcomed the fact that Trump’s team was starting to speak of “the reality on the ground” when discussing Ukraine.
Lavrov said this was reflected in comments from both Trump and incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz.
Waltz told ABC on Sunday that it was clear the war must end somehow by diplomatic means.
He added: “I just don’t think it’s realistic to say we’re going to expel every Russian from every inch of Ukrainian soil, even Crimea. President Trump has acknowledged that reality, and I think it’s been a huge step forward that the entire world is acknowledging that reality. Now let’s move forward.”

Title: MHA approves expansion of CISF with two new battalions
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:28:01 +0000
Content: In a bid to strengthen the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has approved the formation of two new battalions.
The expansion aims to boost the CISF’s capacity to meet increasing security demands and bolster internal security across critical infrastructure and key installations.
Each of the newly sanctioned battalions will comprise 1,025 personnel, increasing the total number of CISF battalions from 13 to 15, thereby creating over 2,000 new jobs. The new battalions will be led by senior commandant-level officers, underscoring their critical role in addressing the growing security needs of the country.
The expansion comes at a time when the CISF is being called upon to manage more complex security tasks, particularly in overseeing high-security jails and responding swiftly to emergencies. The addition of these battalions is expected to strengthen the CISF’s rapid-response capabilities, ensuring faster deployment and improved management of critical situations.
“These new battalions will alleviate pressure on our current personnel and allow for better relief opportunities, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of the force,” said CISF Inspector General Ajay Dahiya.
The expansion also includes the recently approved Mahila Battalion, which aims to further enhance national security while offering more employment opportunities. With this expansion, the CISF’s total strength will rise to nearly two lakh personnel, enhancing the force’s ability to protect vital national infrastructure, including industrial sites, government buildings, nuclear and space establishments, airports, and historical monuments like the Taj Mahal.
Established in 1969 under the CISF Act, the CISF has evolved from providing security to public sector undertakings (PSUs) into a vital agency safeguarding critical infrastructure and offering security consultancy services across both public and private sectors. The new battalions will significantly bolster the force’s ability to carry out its multifaceted security mandate.

Content: In a move to enhance the production and export of turmeric, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, inaugurated the National Turmeric Board in New Delhi on Tuesday.
Palle Ganga Reddy was appointed as the first Chairperson of the Board, which will be headquartered in Nizamabad, according to a press release from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry.
The Board will focus on key areas such as research and development, value addition to turmeric products, and promoting awareness of the spice’s medicinal and essential properties. It will also work on improving turmeric yield, enhancing logistics and supply chains, and exploring new international markets for turmeric.
Ensuring quality and safety standards for turmeric production and exports will also be a critical aspect of the Board’s mandate.
Goyal emphasized that the Board will include representatives from various ministries, exporters, and producers’ bodies to ensure a comprehensive approach to the growth of the turmeric industry.
Turmeric, often referred to as the “Golden Spice,” holds immense economic potential for Indian farmers, particularly those in 20 states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, and Meghalaya.
Goyal noted that the Board would focus on boosting turmeric production in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which would help increase farmers’ incomes.
India is responsible for over 70% of the world’s turmeric production, with 30 varieties of turmeric being grown in the country.

Title: Jammu and Kashmir incomplete without PoK: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:40:29 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said that Jammu and Kashmir remains “incomplete” without Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), warning Pakistan against operating terrorist training camps in the region.
Speaking at the 9th Armed Forces Veterans’ Day event in J&K’s Akhnoor, Singh said, “Jammu and Kashmir is incomplete without PoK. For Pakistan, PoK is nothing more than a foreign territory. However, this land is being used for the business of terrorism. Terrorist training camps are operational in PoK. Pakistan must dismantle these camps.”
Referring to the 1965 India-Pakistan war, Singh said that the government under Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had the opportunity to end cross-border terrorism by converting the tactical advantage gained during the conflict into a strategic victory.
“The war between India and Pakistan in Akhnoor during 1965 saw the Indian Army successfully thwarting Pakistan’s efforts. Since then, Pakistan has supported illegal infiltration and terrorism. Cross-border terrorism could have ended in 1965 had the government at the time converted tactical gains into strategic advantage,” he said.
Singh also highlighted the contributions of India’s Muslim community in combating terrorism, noting their sacrifices. “More than 80% of terrorists entering India are from Pakistan, but our Muslim brothers have also laid down their lives fighting terrorism,” he added. 
Singh said steps are being taken to address gaps between Kashmir and the rest of the country. “One of our top priorities is bridging any divide between Kashmir and the rest of India. Initiatives are being undertaken in this direction. Veterans Day celebrations here in Akhnoor symbolize the unity between Akhnoor and the rest of the nation,” he emphasized.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also addressed the event, lauding the sacrifices made by veterans. “Veterans are individuals who gave everything for the country, without concern for their future or safety. It is now our duty to ensure their well-being,” he said. Abdullah mentioned ongoing efforts to extend benefits to ex-servicemen, including providing support under government schemes.
“We are committed to ensuring that recruitment reservations are utilized, financial aid is delivered smoothly, and all veterans receive the assistance they are entitled to,” Abdullah added. He also noted the contributions of former soldiers, highlighting Satish Sharma, a retired soldier’s son in his Cabinet, as an example.
Armed Forces Veterans’ Day, observed annually on January 14, commemorates the retirement of Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the Armed Forces’ first Commander-in-Chief, on this day in 1953. Introduced in 2016, the day is marked every year with interactive events celebrating the service of ex-servicemen.

“No other country has such a large interconnected grid. This is why international businesses are keen to invest in India, fostering job creation and economic growth,” Goyal said.
Delivering a keynote address titled India’s Rise and the Challenges it Faces, Goyal credited the country’s progress to a structured, result-oriented approach driven by what he termed the 5Ds—Democracy, Demographic Dividend, Diversity, Demand, and Dependability. These principles, he explained, have steered development across six key areas: global leadership; economy, manufacturing, and investments; innovation and entrepreneurship; infrastructure; global soft power; and women-led initiatives.
Goyal also discussed the government’s focus on welfare programs aimed at achieving sustainable development goals. Initiatives include providing universal access to essentials such as food, housing, education, healthcare, digital connectivity, piped water, and energy-efficient systems.
Despite acknowledging challenges, Goyal expressed confidence in the nation’s resilience. He stressed the importance of inclusive growth in confronting issues that test the country’s unity, security, and aspirations.
“The resilience that has powered India’s ascent will guide us through these obstacles,” he stated.
Goyal also underlined the government’s emphasis on accountability, highlighting that ministers and bureaucrats are trained to be responsive to the needs of the people.
Concluding his speech, Goyal revisited the Prime Minister’s 11 resolutions, announced during the 75th Anniversary of the Adoption of the Indian Constitution, which form the basis for building a developed India.

Content: Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday evening for a state visit, marking his first official trip to India as President. The visit coincides with the celebrations of 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Upon his arrival, Tharman was received at the airport by Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Jitin Prasada. His five-day visit, scheduled from January 14 to 18, includes meetings with President Droupadi Murmu, who will host a banquet in his honor. Tharman will also hold discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi following a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Thursday.
During his visit, Tharman is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising ministers, members of parliament, and senior officials. He is also set to meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other Indian dignitaries. In addition to engagements in New Delhi, Tharman will visit Odisha on January 17 and 18.
“India and Singapore have extensive cooperation based on a long tradition of friendship, trust and mutual respect. President Tharman’s visit is expected to provide further momentum to bilateral relations, which were elevated to the level of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Singapore in September 2024,” said MEA in a statement.
Prime Minister Modi has recently hailed the progress made in bilateral cooperation in a multitude of forward-looking areas.
“My visit to Singapore has been a very fruitful one. It will certainly add vigour to bilateral ties and benefit the people of our nations. I thank the government and people of Singapore for their warmth,” PM Modi posted on X after wrapping-up his two-day visit to Singapore in September 2024.

Title: Why are autism rates rising?
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:00:32 +0000
Content: Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental condition marked by disruptions in brain-signaling that cause people to behave, communicate, interact, and learn in atypical ways.
Autism diagnoses in the United States have increased significantly since 2000, intensifying public concern over what might contribute to its prevalence. Here is what you need to know.
HOW IS AUTISM DIAGNOSED?
There are no objective tools for diagnosing autism such as blood tests or brain scans. Instead, diagnoses are made based on observations and interviews.
The term spectrum reflects the wide range of possible manifestations. Some people with ASD may have good conversation skills while others may be nonverbal. Some may be acutely sensitive to sounds, touch, or other triggers. Some may have restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. Some may need help with daily living, while others require little or no support.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children for autism at 18 and 24 months, when most children will begin to show symptoms. Yet the average age of diagnosis remains close to 4 years in the U.S. and 5 years globally.
HOW COMMON IS AUTISM?
By 2020, the U.S. autism rate in 8-year-olds was 1 in 36, or 2.77%, up from 2.27% in 2018 and 0.66% in 2000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2021 study from England put the rate in children there at 1.76%, up from 1.57% in 2009.
The World Health Organization estimates the worldwide prevalence in children at 1%, up from 0.62% in 2012, with the caveat that many countries lack the resources to identify cases and report them.
WHAT CAUSES AUTISM?
The causes of autism are unclear. There is widespread speculation among scientists that its neurological characteristics may develop in utero, when the fetal brain is being wired. Studies have linked autism to maternal factors in pregnancy, and some research suggests a link to birth complications and timing.
A growing area of research focuses on epigenetics – the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. One theory suggests that a woman’s exposure to air pollution or harmful contaminants before or during pregnancy may trigger a genetic mutation leading to autism in her child.
Gene variations in some people with autism strengthen the evidence for a genetic component. Among the genetic disorders linked with higher risks for autism are Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
Other potential risk factors may include a sibling with autism, the age of parents when conceiving children, very low birth weight, jaundice as a newborn, complications in utero or during birth, having an unhealthy assortment of organisms living in the intestines, and immune system disorders.
Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. health secretary, and other public figures have promoted a theory – contrary to scientific evidence – that childhood vaccines are a cause of autism. The idea stems from a since-debunked study from British researcher Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s that connected a rise in autism diagnoses with widespread use of the measles vaccine.
No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or medications, or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
WHY ARE AUTISM RATES RISING?
Researchers attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition.
In 2013, mental health experts combined what had been three separate diagnoses – autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder – under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder.
An October 2024 study of U.S. insurance claims data found the largest increases in diagnoses were in groups with low screening rates in the past, including young adults, females, and children from some racial or ethnic minority groups.
Researchers have also noted that certain risk factors have become more common, such as having been born prematurely or to older parents.
ARE THERE TREATMENTS?
There are no treatments or cures for autism, nor can it be reversed. However, experts agree that early diagnosis is crucial. Intervention with supportive measures – ideally before age three – is critical for improving cognitive, social and communication skills.
Such measures can include speech therapy, occupational therapy, social skills training, sensory integration therapy, visual aids, structured routines, individualized education plans, family therapy, and providing a calm and predictable environment.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced the milestone on his social media, describing the event as a convergence of faith, unity, and cultural diversity.
The event attracted a global audience, with participants from countries such as the United States, France, Israel, Iran, and Portugal attending alongside Indian devotees. Many international visitors expressed their admiration for Indian culture and spirituality.
To ensure smooth management and safety, more than 50,000 security personnel were deployed, including police, paramilitary forces, and local security staff. Additionally, ‘Ganga Seva Doots’ (Ganga service volunteers) worked at the ghats to maintain cleanliness by removing offerings and other items from the river promptly.
This year’s Maha Kumbh saw the inclusion of Bhogali Bihu, a traditional festival from Assam, celebrated within the mela premises. Assamese devotees performed traditional dances, sang hymns, and distributed rice-based dishes, adding a regional dimension to the event.
Cultural programmes formed a key part of the Maha Kumbh. Artists and participants from various states showcased traditional music and dance, representing the country’s diverse cultural landscape. To support attendees, the administration provided free medical services, drinking water facilities, and transportation arrangements.
The large international turnout and the cultural programmes helped spotlight India’s traditions on a global scale, underscoring the country’s rich heritage and spirituality. The Maha Kumbh 2025 continues to be a platform for faith and cultural exchange, fostering unity among diverse groups of people.

Title: India’s automobile sales hit record 2.5 crore units in 2024, marking 11.6% growth
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 14:18:59 +0000
Content: India’s automobile sales recorded an 11.6% increase in 2024, reaching an all-time high of 2.5 crore units compared to 2.3 crore units in 2023, as per data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). The surge consolidates India’s position as the third-largest car market globally.
“Stable macroeconomic conditions and positive consumer sentiment drove growth across all vehicle segments,” said SIAM president Shailesh Chandra.
The two-wheeler segment was the primary driver, growing by 14.5% to 1.95 crore units in 2024. Passenger vehicles (PV) posted sales of 43 lakh units, a 4.2% rise, while three-wheeler sales increased by 6.8% to 7.3 lakh units.
Passenger vehicle dispatches to dealers in December 2024 rose 10% to 3,14,934 units from 2,86,390 units in December 2023. In contrast, two-wheeler dispatches fell by 9%, with 11,05,565 units in December compared to 12,12,238 units the previous year. Meanwhile, three-wheeler dispatches saw an increase to 52,733 units in December, up from 50,947 units in December 2023.
Commenting on the quarterly performance, Chandra emphasized that passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, and three-wheelers recorded their highest-ever sales during the October-December quarter of 2024. Passenger vehicle sales in Q3 2024-25 grew by 4.5%, reaching 10.6 lakh units compared to the same period last year.
SIAM director general Rajesh Menon also noted the positive impact of government policies in creating a favorable ecosystem for the industry. “The stable policy environment in 2024, continuing from previous years, provided a conducive foundation for growth,” Menon said.
As 2025 begins, industry representatives expect the positive momentum to continue, buoyed by initiatives like the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Manufacturers are optimistic about leveraging this momentum for sustained growth in the coming year.

Title: Medvedev advances after meltdown, Fonseca dazzles on debut at Australian Open
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 14:01:35 +0000
Content: Three-times Australian Open finalist Daniil Medvedev allowed his frustrations to boil over in a Melbourne Park meltdown before advancing to the second round on Tuesday while Taylor Fritz made a strong start in his bid to end a 22-year Grand Slam drought for American men.
The third day of action concluded with Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca more than living up to the hype around him as the qualifier crushed Russian ninth seed Andrey Rublev in a stunning Grand Slam main draw debut.
Danish 13th seed Holger Rune was pushed all the way to five sets and Emma Navarro also had a tough time in one of three all-American ties, the women’s eighth seed surviving a major scare to beat Peyton Stearns 7-6(5) 6-7(5) 7-5.
It was plain sailing for former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina as she blitzed Australian wildcard Emerson Jones 6-1 6-1 with new coach Goran Ivanisevic watching on impressed.
In a French thriller on Court Three, experience got the better of potential as Gael Monfils edged Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 7-6(7) 6-3 6-7(6) 7-6(5) 6-4, while there were also wins for 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu, ninth seed Daria Kasatkina and former men’s world number six Matteo Berrettini.
Home hope Alex de Minaur also moved through as he beat Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp.
Russian Medvedev, runner-up last year, smashed his racket and a net camera after dropping serve in the third set but rallied for a 6-2 4-6 3-6 6-1 6-2 win against Thai wildcard Kasidit Samrej.
The frustrated fifth seed’s behaviour earned him a code violation for racket abuse as play was held up before the fourth set as staff swept up debris from the court but he cut a happy figure after the match.
“At the end of last year, this match I probably would have lost,” said Medvedev. “Now it’s a new year and new energy … So I’m happy to win this match.”
Fourth seed Fritz stayed cool throughout his match against compatriot Jenson Brooksby, the U.S. Open finalist easing to a 6-2 6-0 6-3 win that showed why he is now considered best placed to end America’s 22-year wait for a major men’s prize.
The 27-year-old played an integral part in the United States winning the United Cup to begin the new season and continued his fine form with a 106-minute drubbing of Brooksby.
Brooksby, returning from two years on the sidelines after having operations on both wrists and serving a 13-month doping suspension, fought until the bitter end but was no match for Fritz, who sealed the victory with his 34th winner.
“I’m super happy with how the match went today,” said Fritz, who will next face qualifier Cristian Garin. “It’s never easy playing that first match in a slam so there were some nerves.”
Those who stayed last on Margaret Court Arena will not forget it in a hurry as the 18-year-old Fonseca dazzled under the lights in a 7-6(1) 6-3 7-6(5) defeat of Rublev.
His win meant he is only the second teenager since 1973 to beat a top-10 ATP player on his Grand Slam debut.
Crushing 51 winners, Fonseca looked completely at home on the big stage as he set up a second-round clash against Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego.
‘CRAZY MATCH’
Navarro was on the back foot for almost the entirety of her three hour, 20-minute clash on Rod Laver Arena with world number 46 Stearns before rallying from a break down to win the final four games of the third set and claim victory.
“Crazy match today,” Navarro said after sealing the deal with an emphatic backhand winner.
“I was just trying to make the most of the skills I had today, maybe wasn’t my best, but she played really well and it feels really special to get the win.”
Berrettini came from a set down to beat Britain’s Cameron Norrie 6-7(4) 6-4 6-1 6-3 and claim his first win at Melbourne Park since his run to the semi-finals in 2022.
His reward is a second-round tie against 13th seeded Dane Rune, who was tested over five sets by China’s Zhang Zhizhen before running out a 4-6 6-3 6-4 3-6 6-4 winner.
Raducanu reached the second round for the fourth year in a row but her 7-6(4) 7-6(2) win over 26th seeded Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova was not all smooth sailing.
The 22-year-old, playing her first match in months, racked up 15 double faults over the contest, including one as she blew a 30-0 lead when serving for the match.
She rallied with some brilliant tennis in the subsequent tiebreak to set up a second-round clash with American Amanda Anisimova, who beat Argentine Maria Lourdes Carle 6-2 6-3.
“I’m not sure what I changed in my serve today. I think it had a mind of its own,” said Raducanu.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah named ICC Men’s Player of the month for December 2024
Publication Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:59:02 +0000
Content: Indian pace sensation Jasprit Bumrah has been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December 2024, following a string of extraordinary performances during India’s tour of Australia. The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the accolade on Tuesday, recognizing Bumrah’s dominance over world-class opposition.
Bumrah edged out tough competition from Australia’s Pat Cummins and South Africa’s Dane Paterson to claim the award. Over three grueling Test matches, Bumrah spearheaded India’s bowling attack, scalping an impressive 22 wickets at an exceptional average of 14.22, reaffirming his stature as one of the finest bowlers in world cricket.
The Adelaide Test marked the beginning of Bumrah’s stellar run, where his four-wicket haul curtailed Australia’s lead in the first innings, keeping India in contention. His heroics continued in Brisbane, where a devastating six-wicket spell in the first innings and three more wickets in the second innings left Australia’s batting line-up in tatters. Despite rain curtailing the match, Bumrah’s performance ensured India remained alive in the series.
Bumrah’s brilliance was on full display in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. He picked up four wickets in the first innings and followed it with a five-wicket haul in the second, dismissing Australia for 234. However, his lone-warrior efforts couldn’t prevent a 184-run defeat as India’s batting order faltered.
The tour was a challenging one for India, but Bumrah stood tall, consistently delivering match-defining spells. His remarkable achievements during the series included reaching the milestone of 200 Test wickets, becoming the fourth-fastest bowler to achieve the feat in terms of balls bowled. He also etched his name in history as the first bowler to claim 200 Test wickets at an average below 20.
For his exceptional contributions, which earned him the Player of the Series title as well, Jasprit Bumrah was crowned the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December 2024.

Title: ED gets MHA approval to prosecute Kejriwal, Sisodia in liquor scam case
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 06:45:57 +0000
Content: The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has granted approval to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the alleged liquor scam, according to sources cited by ANI on Wednesday.
Both Kejriwal and Sisodia were granted bail by the Supreme Court last year in connection with the liquor policy case.
Separate cases have been filed against Kejriwal by the ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the case.
Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 last year after failing to respond to repeated summons. He was named in a chargesheet filed by the agency on May 17.
A special PMLA court in Delhi had paused the framing of charges against him after he moved the Delhi High Court, challenging the trial court’s cognizance of the chargesheet in the absence of a specific sanction for prosecution under the PMLA.
The ED has accused Kejriwal, Sisodia, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of accepting bribes from the ‘South Group,’ a cartel that controlled liquor sales and distribution in Delhi. The group is alleged to have profited from the excise policy implemented by the Delhi government for the 2021–22 fiscal year.
So far, the ED has conducted searches at 245 locations across the country, including Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Mumbai. More than a dozen individuals, including Kejriwal, Sisodia, AAP MP Sanjay Singh, and the party’s former media head Vijay Nair, have been arrested in connection with the case.
The ED has claimed that it identified proceeds of crime amounting to ₹1,100 crore. Kejriwal, along with Sisodia and Nair, is accused of soliciting additional funds beyond a ₹100 crore bribe to finance AAP’s election campaigns. The ED has described Kejriwal as the “kingpin” of the alleged irregularities linked to the excise policy.

Title: Kerala intensifies investment push in UAE, secures strong support for Global Summit
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 05:29:16 +0000
Content: Kerala’s ambitious drive to attract international investment gained significant momentum as Industries Minister P. Rajeev led a high-profile delegation to Dubai, securing strong commitments from UAE’s top business and government leaders for the upcoming Invest Kerala Global Summit (IKGS).
In a series of strategic meetings on January 13-14, 2025, Minister Rajeev engaged with key UAE officials including UAE Minister of Investment Mohamed Hassan Al Suwaidi and Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi. The discussions yielded a concrete outcome with the UAE confirming it would send a special delegation to the IKGS scheduled for February 21-22, 2025.
Minister Suwaidi expressed particular interest in exploring investments in Kerala’s logistics and food processing sectors. The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce announced plans to dispatch officials for preliminary assessments of potential investment locations in Kerala ahead of the summit.
During the investor roadshow at Taj Dubai, Indian Ambassador to UAE Shri Sunjay Sudhir highlighted the unique position of Kerala in Indo-UAE relations. “Kerala stands out in the trade connection. From humble beginnings, we have reached a stage where India is the UAE’s second-largest trading partner,” Ambassador Sudhir noted, emphasizing Abu Dhabi’s emergence as the ‘capital of capital’ with its sovereign wealth fund assets surpassing global financial hubs.
In his comprehensive address to potential investors, Minister Rajeev challenged long-standing misconceptions about Kerala’s industrial landscape. “Despite occupying just 1.16% of India’s land area and 2.8% of its population, Kerala contributes a remarkable 4% to the national GDP,” he stated, backing his assertion with compelling statistics about the state’s industrial achievements.
The minister highlighted Kerala’s dominance in the medical device industry, noting that the state accounts for 24% of India’s medical device industry turnover and 17% of medical device products.
He also spotlighted Kerala’s pioneering role in technology, citing the establishment of Keltron in 1973 – India’s first public-sector electronics company – and Technopark in 1993, the country’s first and largest technology park. “Today, Keltron manages AI-based traffic control systems for National Highways and smart city projects, showcasing our technological capabilities,” he added.

Title: What you need to know about the arrest of South Korea’s Yoon
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 05:20:50 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday for alleged insurrection over his bid to impose martial law, ending weeks of defiance and claims by Yoon and his lawyers that the arrest warrant was invalid.
Yoon and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is probing his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3, are at odds over whether the CIO has the authority to arrest and pursue criminal charges against a president.
Authorities now have 48 hours to question Yoon, before seeking a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days or releasing him.
Here is what we know about his arrest so far:
WHO ARE THE INVESTIGATORS?
The CIO is leading a joint investigation team involving police and the defence ministry seeking charges of insurrection and abuse of power against Yoon among others, while prosecutors carry out their own probe.
The CIO was launched in January 2021 as an independent anti-graft agency to investigate high-ranking officials, including the president, and their family members as part of efforts to keep prosecutors in check.
But its investigating and prosecuting rights are limited. It does not have the authority to prosecute the president and is required to refer the case to the prosecutors’ office to take any action, including indictment, once questioning is over.
WHAT IS YOON’S ARGUMENT?
Yoon said on Wednesday that he submitted himself for questioning to avoid any bloodshed despite what he called the illegality of the investigation and arrest.
Yoon’s lawyers have said that the CIO does not have the authority to handle his case as the law stipulates a wide-ranging list of high-ranking officials and violations it can investigate, but has no mention of insurrection.
Prosecutors capable of investigating insurrection charges have been carrying out a separate investigation on Yoon.
The lawyers also said that an arrest warrant granted by a Seoul district court was unconstitutional because it specified that the warrant was exempt from two clauses of the Criminal Procedure Act that limits seizure and search of a place subject to confidential military information, or a public official possessing official secrets, without providing legal grounds.
They said any criminal investigation should be conducted after the Constitutional Court holds a trial on Yoon’s impeachment and decides whether to remove him from office permanently.
Yoon’s team has filed a complaint and an injunction with the Constitutional Court to review the warrant’s legitimacy, though the Seoul Western District Court which issued the warrant has rejected a similar complaint.
On Jan. 3, the presidential security service and military guards blocked CIO investigators from arresting Yoon in a six-hour standoff. Its then chief, Park Chong-jun, had said that the security service could not cooperate on the warrant, citing the legal debate over the CIO’s investigative rights and the warrant’s validity.
WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE CIO, POLICE?
The CIO has said it has secured the rights to take on Yoon’s case by obtaining the arrest warrant, and the two clauses of the Criminal Procedure Act do not apply because the warrant was limited to arresting him, not seizing his possessions.
But the agency has apologised for initially failing to arrest Yoon and requested police to take over execution of the warrant, based on its consideration that “such a serious case as this one should not leave even the slightest possibility of controversy.”
Police have acknowledged that there was a legal dispute over such a transfer but said they would consult the CIO.
The CIO and the police held multiple meetings to discuss how to execute the warrant after securing a re-issued warrant on Jan. 7.
Seok Dong-hyeon, Yoon’s legal advisor, said the bid to transfer execution of the warrant is effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were “illegal”.
WHAT DO COURTS SAY?
The Constitutional Court said on Monday it is reviewing the complaint and injunction filed by Yoon’s lawyers.
The Seoul Western District Court, dismissing a similar complaint previously, said that it was not illegal for the CIO to handle Yoon’s case as allegations of insurrection are included in abuse of power charges covered by the agency.
It also said the warrant’s exemption from the two Criminal Procedure Act clauses appear to confirm that any search that might entail was aimed at arresting the defendant, not seizing his belongings, and it was not unconstitutional for a judge to specify that when approving a warrant.
Yoon’s lawyers criticised the court’s statement as “sophistry” and said they will consider appealing the decision to a higher court.

Title: James rescues a point for Chelsea in 2-2 draw with Bournemouth
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 05:13:48 +0000
Content: Chelsea captain Reece James rescued a point for Chelsea with a 95th minute free kick to snatch a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth in the Premier League on Tuesday. Second-half substitute James, who returned from a long spell out injured at the weekend, beat goalkeeper Mark Travers with a perfectly placed curling shot into the far corner of the net.
But it was two points dropped for the hosts who dominated much of the game, scoring through Cole Palmer in the first half before allowing Bournemouth to reply with a penalty from Justin Kluivert early in the second period.
Antoine Semenyo then shocked Stamford Bridge when he sent a near-post rocket past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez to make it 2-1 for the visitors.
Chelsea, who have failed to win in their last five league games, stay in fourth place in the table on 37 points from 21 matches, with Bournemouth seventh on 34.

Title: Jota earns leaders Liverpool 1-1 draw at high-flying Forest
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:57:56 +0000
Content: Liverpool substitute Diogo Jota’s second-half header earned the visitors a battling 1-1 draw with surprise Premier League title rivals Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, keeping the leaders six points clear at the top of the standings.
High-flying Forest, who are enjoying a remarkable season after just avoiding relegation last term, raced into the lead in an electric City Ground atmosphere through striker Chris Wood with eight minutes on the clock.
Liverpool, whose only league defeat this season prior to their trip to the East Midlands came against Forest in September, looked to be heading for another humbling before Jota headed home a 66th-minute equaliser from a corner.
Jota and Mohamed Salah went close to snatching victory for Liverpool but found home goalkeeper Matz Sels in inspired form. Instead, the draw ensured Arne Slot’s team sit six points above second-placed Forest, who have played a game more.
“I could not have asked for more,” Slot said. “Second half was outstanding. There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn’t get a second.
“It is so, so hard for every team to create here. And at times it was one chance after another. That’s why it was such a disappointment to go 1-0 down. I have to be pleased with what we got.”
MEMORY LANE
The fixture recalled memories of the late 1970s and early 1980s when Forest would regularly compete for the English top-flight title with Liverpool.
This season, Nuno Espirito Santo’s Forest side unexpectedly find themselves chasing the Merseysiders down once more, coming into Tuesday’s clash on the back of seven wins in a row in all competitions, without conceding a goal in the last five.
Out to do the league double over Liverpool for the first time in a season since 1963, Forest edged in front as Wood continued his fine form with his 13th league goal of the campaign.
The visitors were seeing all of the ball but not doing a great deal with it. In the opening period alone, Liverpool enjoyed 70% possession, while failing to find the target.
Forest continued to stand firm, with home supporters dreaming of being in touching distance of their illustrious opponents, only for Jota to be left unmarked to level 22 seconds after coming off the bench with his first touch.
Three superb saves from Sels preserved a deserved point for Forest, who remain Liverpool’s closest title rivals.
Forest supporters, however, having seen their side keep the league leaders at bay for so long, will view the draw as a missed opportunity.
“Tonight was a lesson for us, because this is how we want to compete,” Nuno said. “I am very proud of how we played.
“Tonight was a special atmosphere. I don’t look at the league table at this stage, we have to keep going.”

Title: Man City held to 2-2 draw after late collapse against Brentford
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:47:07 +0000
Content: Manchester City threw away a two-goal lead as Brentford’s Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard scored late goals to earn the hosts a 2-2 draw in a Premier League thriller on Tuesday.
After suffering six league defeats in November and December, City bounced back with a draw against Everton and wins over Leicester City and West Ham United, but Tuesday’s late collapse brought their short-lived revival to an abrupt halt.
The point leaves them sixth on 35, 12 adrift of leaders Liverpool,who drew 1-1 at second-placed Nottingham Forest, while the Bees are 10th on 28 following an unlikely comeback.
After struggling to create chances in the first half, City winger Savinho went close to breaking the deadlock in the 50th minute, marauding forward through the left channel before thumping a shot off the foot of the post.
Two minutes later City striker Erling Haaland headed straight at the keeper when he should have scored.
The breakthrough finally came for City in the 66th minute when a brilliant ball from the right by Kevin De Bruyne was met by Foden, who steered a deft volley in at the far post.
The game should have been over when Foden made it 2-0 12 minutes later by reacting quickest to rattle home the rebound, after Savinho’s shot was saved, to silence the home fans.
Four minutes later, however, Brentford’s Wissa ensured a nervy finish when he fired in from close range to reduce the deficit and, with City’s defenders having made several last-ditch interventions to protect the lead, they should have been aware of the threat posed by the hosts.
But Denmark international Norgaard was allowed to complete the comeback two minutes into added time, getting enough power on his glancing header to send it past Stefan Ortega, despite the City keeper getting a strong hand to it.
City manager Pep Guardiola was animated at the final whistle, both hugging and berating his goalkeeper after another underwhelming display by his side.
“We just looked tired at the end in the last 20 minutes, we looked leggy,” Foden said. “They put longer balls into the box and we didn’t deal with the physicality in the end.
“It’s definitely picked up from previously and performances are a lot better than they were. We’ve still got steps to go to where we want to be but as long as we keep making them small steps and improving that’s what we’re aiming to do.”
Things were a lot brighter for the Brentford players after their display of character was rewarded with a point.
“I don’t know how we did it,” Norgaard said. “We stayed in the game even though we were 2-0 down. We hung in there … and I’m proud of the way we managed to come back in the game.
“We aren’t here to lose by one so when Wissa got one back … I don’t know how I ended up there but it was nice to see it go in. Even though I’m not a striker I tend to listen in the meetings. I just attacked the gap and I was fortunate to see it go in,” he added.

Other notable delays include Mahabodhi Exp (12397) by 160 minutes, Ayodhya Exp (14205) by 189 minutes, and LKO NDLS AC Exp (14209) by 370 minutes. These delays have disrupted travel plans for thousands of passengers, adding to the challenges posed by the harsh winter conditions.
At Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, flight operations were also severely affected. While landings and take-offs continued, flights not equipped with CAT III (Category III Instrument Landing System) faced delays and disruptions. Airport authorities repeatedly advised passengers to stay updated on their flight statuses and contact airlines for the latest information.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that Delhi recorded a morning temperature of 9 degrees Celsius, with the minimum expected to dip further. The maximum temperature was forecast at 19 degrees Celsius. The IMD also issued warnings of a generally overcast sky, with light rain or drizzle predicted later in the evening or night. Dense fog is expected to persist, compounding the already challenging weather conditions.
Adding to the woes, air quality in Delhi has plummeted to the ‘very poor’ category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 344 at 7 a.m., a sharp rise from 252 the previous day. Several areas reported alarmingly high AQI levels, with Vivek Vihar recording the highest at 414, indicating severe pollution. Other critical readings included Rohini at 399, Nehru Nagar at 394, and Okhla Phase-2 at 380. The deteriorating air quality, combined with the cold wave and dense fog, has raised health concerns for residents.
Authorities are urging residents to take extra precautions while traveling and to limit outdoor activities to minimize health risks.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates new ISKCON temple in Mumbai
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:32:47 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the new International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple in the Kharghar area of Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, on Wednesday. The temple, named Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji Temple, was built with the efforts of ISKCON.
During the inauguration, PM Modi expressed his gratitude for being part of the event. He said, “Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji Temple is being inaugurated on this great land of knowledge and devotion, with the efforts of ISKCON. I am fortunate that I am getting the blessings of playing a role in this divine inauguration.”
The Prime Minister admired the temple’s design, stating that it reflects the tradition of spirituality and knowledge. “I was just seeing that the outline of the Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan Ji Mandir Parishad, the idea behind this temple, its form, reflects the entire tradition of spirituality and knowledge. Various forms of God can be seen in the temple. I am confident that this temple complex will become a holy center for enriching the faith as well as the consciousness of India. I congratulate all the saints and members of ISKCON and the people of Maharashtra for this noble work,” he added.
PM Modi also remembered former ISKCON Chairman Gopal Krishna Goswami, who passed away on May 5, 2024. He noted, “Today, on this occasion, I am also emotionally remembering the most revered Gopalkrishna Goswami Maharaj. His vision is attached to this project. His blessings are associated with his immense devotion towards Lord Shri Krishna. Today he may not be here in his physical body, but we are all feeling his spiritual presence.”
The Prime Minister praised Srila Prabhupada Swami, the founder of ISKCON, and spoke about how ISKCON’s followers are united by devotion to Krishna. “During colonialism, Srila Prabhupada took forward the importance of Ved, Vedant, and Gita. He did the ritual of linking Vedant to the consciousness of people. In 70 years, when people usually think they have fulfilled their duty, that’s when he began the mission of ISKCON,” he remarked.
PM Modi also highlighted the continuous efforts of his government in the interest of the people. He stated, “I am satisfied that our government is also continuously working in the interest of the countrymen with full dedication and a spirit of service…Construction of toilets in every house, providing Ujjwala gas connection to every poor woman, providing tap water facility to every house, providing free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh to every poor person.”
The Prime Minister mentioned the ‘Krishna circuit,’ an initiative aimed at connecting various pilgrimage and religious sites across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha.

Content: India is leading in artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, with 80% of companies identifying AI as a core strategic priority, surpassing the global average of 75%, according to a report released on Wednesday.
The report, compiled by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), reveals that 69% of Indian companies plan to increase their tech investments in 2025, with one-third of these companies set to allocate over $25 million to AI initiatives.
Furthermore, less than 10% of Indian executives expect a decrease in headcount due to AI-driven automation.
“This reflects the nation’s drive towards a comprehensive digital transformation agenda. In line with this, 69% of Indian firms plan to boost tech investments in 2025, with one-third of these firms dedicating over $25 million to AI efforts,” said Nipun Kalra, India Leader at BCG X.
The report also highlights that 81% of Indian companies recognize the need for improvements in AI-related cybersecurity measures, as AI applications grow more complex.
“Indian companies are also adopting AI for high-impact purposes, including redesigning workflows and developing new business models, reinforcing India’s role as a key player in AI innovation,” Kalra added.

Title: Team India women crush Ireland by 304 runs to sweep ODI Series 3-0
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:20:24 +0000
Content: Team India Women delivered a dominant performance in the third and final ODI against Ireland, crushing the visitors by a massive 304 runs to win the series 3-0.
The match, which set several records, saw opener Prateeka Rawal shine once again. She won both the player of the match and player of the series award for her two half centuries and a ton.
India’s dominant batting display 
Captain Smriti Mandhana won the toss and chose to bat first. She, alongside her new opening partner Prateeka Rawal, gave India a blazing start. Mandhana, in particular, unleashed a flurry of shots, dismantling the Ireland bowling attack. The opening pair put on a record-breaking 231-run partnership for the first wicket. Prateeka Rawal played a career-best knock of 154 runs, while Mandhana scored a blistering 135 off just 80 balls, featuring 7 sixes and 12 fours. 
With this knock, Mandhana also set the record for the fastest century by an Indian woman in ODIs. Prateeka Rawal, with her outstanding form, became the first batter (male or female) to accumulate 401* runs after just six ODI matches. 
Promoted to number 3, wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh contributed with a quickfire 59 off 42 balls, as India posted a record total of 435/5 in 50 overs, their highest score in an ODI. 
Ireland’s struggles against India’s bowling attack 
In response, Ireland’s batting was unable to cope with the disciplined and steady Indian bowling. The visitors kept losing wickets at regular intervals and were bowled out for just 134 runs in 31.4 overs. Opener Sarah Forbes (41) and Orla Prendergast (36) were the only batters to make significant contributions. 
Deepti Sharma was the star with the ball, taking 3 wickets for 27 runs, while Tanuja Kanwar claimed 2 wickets for 31 runs. Titas Sadhu, Sayali Satghare, and Minnu Mani also picked up one wicket each to complete the dominant performance.

Title: Strong Navy in Indian Ocean Region is our top priority: Rajnath Singh
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:16:34 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing national security and achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. Speaking at the commissioning ceremony for three advanced naval assets—INS Surat, INS Nilgiri, and INS Vaghsheer—Singh outlined India’s focus on modernizing its armed forces and implementing defence reforms by 2025.
“Improving India’s security system and achieving self-reliance in the defence sector has been the priority of the Prime Minister. The continuous strengthening of our defence sector is a testament to this. The commissioning of INS Surat, INS Nilgiri, and INS Vaghsheer together is not only a milestone for the Indian Navy but also a demonstration of India’s power in the Indian Ocean Region under your leadership,” Singh said.
The Defence Minister said that the Indian Ocean Region has become increasingly important in light of global developments. He pointed out that much of the world’s trade traverses this region, which has also become a hub of international power dynamics and security concerns due to activities like illegal fishing, drug smuggling, and terrorism.
He continued to emphasized that India’s geostrategic and economic interests in the Indian Ocean Region have been long-standing.
“Whether it’s trade with Rome over 2,000 years ago or trade with Southeast Asian countries, India’s trade today is 95 per cent connected to this region. In such a scenario, a strong Indian Navy presence in the Indian Ocean Region becomes our top priority,” Singh said. “The commissioning of these ships today will be another milestone in our journey toward achieving this goal.”
Singh said that over 75% of the materials used in INS Surat and INS Nilgiri were developed domestically, marking progress in India’s efforts toward self-reliance in defence.
“We are advancing modernization efforts by producing large platforms domestically while also focusing on systems that deliver high impact at lower costs,” he added.
The Ministry of Defence has declared 2025 as the “Year of Reforms,” Singh announced. He said the initiative aims to implement reforms across the Ministry and the armed forces to bolster the defence sector further. “By the end of the year, we will have introduced several reforms in the security sector to help India’s defence sector reach new levels,” Singh added.
INS Surat, the fourth ship in the P15B Guided Missile Destroyer Project, is among the most advanced destroyers globally. INS Nilgiri, from the P17A Stealth Frigate Project, incorporates cutting-edge design and stealth features. INS Vaghsheer, built under the P75 Scorpene Submarine Project in collaboration with France’s Naval Group, reflects India’s growing capabilities in submarine construction.

Katie Puris, who served as TikTok’s head of global brand and creative, claims in the lawsuit that her employer, along with its Chinese parent company ByteDance and subsidiary Douyin, discriminated against her on the basis of gender and age. Puris said that she was forced to sign an agreement with Douyin that required her to pledge allegiance to China’s socialist system and refrain from actions that could harm the nation’s “national honor” or “ethnic unity.”
The document also demanded employees avoid revealing “state secrets,” refrain from spreading “meaningless information,” and comply with China’s strict censorship policies. Puris argued that this agreement underscores ByteDance’s alleged control over TikTok’s operations, challenging claims of its independence from Beijing.
The allegations have sparked condemnation from the US Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. In a post on X, the committee wrote: “BREAKING: Documents And Recordings Reveal How TikTok Forced Staff To Swear Oaths To Uphold China’s ‘Socialist System.’ TikTok’s supposed independence is a fraud… ByteDance directly manages TikTok’s internal functions from China.”
The legal battle emerges amid heightened scrutiny of TikTok in the United States over its ties to the Chinese government. The US Supreme Court is currently set to decide on the constitutionality of a law signed by President Joe Biden, which could force ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a nationwide ban. The case has ignited intense debate about national security, with lawmakers expressing concerns about the platform’s potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Michigan Representative John Moolenaar called for ByteDance to divest from TikTok, labeling the company’s claims of independence as “misleading.” Meanwhile, TikTok has denied the allegations, with a company spokesperson stating, “We cannot comment on false claims meant to push a political agenda.”

Title: Bangladesh: Khaleda, Tarique acquitted in Zia Orphanage graft case
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 10:43:07 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the supreme court on Wednesday acquitted Khaleda Zia, Tarique Rahman and others in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case. The court headed by Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed pronounced the verdict unanimously acquitting Khaleda, former prime Minister of Bangladesh, and others who were convicted and sentenced by the lower court in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case, reports BSS.
The court came up with the judgment cancelling the High Court order that extended Begum Khaleda Zia’s initial five-year jail term to 10 in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case, and a lower court order that initially convicted them all.
The court in its observation said the case was filed out of vengeance against the accused. 
The apex court on November 11, 2024, allowed two leave to appeal petitions filed by BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, staying the High Court order that extended her five-year jail term to 10 in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case.
Khaleda Zia was initially imprisoned on February 8, 2018, when a special court in Dhaka sentenced her to five years in prison for her involvement in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft incident.
Later, in response to an appeal by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), the High Court on October 30 of the same year raised her jail term to 10 years.
Khaleda, 79, currently admitted in a hospital in London, who has been suffering from multiple health complications, including arthritis, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and kidney ailments, requires specialised care unavailable in Bangladesh, according to her doctors.
Khaleda’s son and acting chairman of BNP, Tarique Rahman, who is co-accused in the case, has gone into self-imposed exile in London.

Title: Israel, Hamas reach ceasefire agreement meant to end 15-month Gaza war, official says
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:27:08 +0000
Content: Negotiators reached a deal on Wednesday for a ceasefire in the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters, after 15 months of conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and inflamed the Middle East.
The deal, not yet formally announced, outlines a six-week initial ceasefire phase and includes the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian detainees held by Israel, an official briefed on the negotiations told reporters.
The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
Hamas, Gaza’s dominant Palestinian militant group, told Reuters its delegation had handed mediators its approval for the ceasefire agreement and return of hostages.
A Palestinian official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters earlier Hamas had given verbal approval to the ceasefire and hostage return proposal under negotiation in Qatar and was waiting for more information to give final written approval.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was cutting a visit to Europe short and flying back to Israel overnight to take part in security cabinet and government votes on the deal – meaning the votes would likely be by or on Thursday.
Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 soldiers and civilians and abducting more than 250 foreign and Israeli hostages.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, according to Gaza health ministry figures, and left the coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.
As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be “hell to pay” if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden’s team to push the deal over the line.
In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure that led to the deadliest single day in the country’s history.
The conflict spread across the Middle East, with Iran-backed proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. The deal comes after Israel killed the top leaders of Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah in assassinations which gave it the upper hand.

Title: Indian railways operates 137 special trains for devotees at Mahakumbh
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:56:52 +0000
Content: Indian Railways has introduced 137 special trains to facilitate the movement of devotees on the third day of the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. These additional services supplement the 349 regular trains operating to the city, with the total number of passengers arriving at Prayagraj stations exceeding 15.6 lakh in the first two days. The special trains include long-distance services and ring rail services connecting nearby temple towns such as Chitrakoot, Ayodhya, and Varanasi.
During the 46-day Mahakumbh, Indian Railways plans to operate more than 13,100 trains, comprising over 10,000 regular and approximately 3,100 special services. The number of special trains is reported to be 4.5 times greater than during the previous Kumbh Mela. Among these, 1,800 services are for short distances, while 700 cater to long-distance travel. Additionally, 560 trains are being operated on four designated ring rail routes that connect Prayagraj with other cities. These routes include Prayagraj-Ayodhya-Varanasi-Prayagraj, Prayagraj-Sangam Prayag-Jaunpur-Prayag-Prayagraj, Govindpuri-Prayagraj-Chitrakoot-Govindpuri, and Jhansi-Govindpuri-Prayagraj-Manikpur-Chitrakoot-Jhansi.
Over 3.5 crore devotees visited the Mahakumbh Mela on the second day, attracting attendees from across the country and abroad. Railway divisions are operating additional pairs of trains to manage the heavy rush. The Bhopal division alone is preparing to introduce 15 more pairs of trains in the coming days.
To handle the influx, nine railway stations around Mahakumbh have been upgraded. Stations such as Prayagraj, Phaphamau, Rambagh, and Jhunsi have undergone remodeling to accommodate more trains. Subedarganj station has been developed as a satellite station to support Prayagraj Junction, which handled 45% of the crowd during the 2019 Kumbh. The total number of platforms in the Prayagraj region now stands at 48, following the construction of seven new platforms.
Facilities for passengers have also been enhanced, with 17 new permanent Yatri Ashrayas becoming operational, increasing the total capacity from 21,000 to over 1.1 lakh. A systematic color-coding scheme has been introduced at various stations to assist passengers in navigating waiting areas. New toilets, upgraded waiting rooms and lounges, and arrangements for drinking water and food have also been implemented. Yatri Suvidha Kendras have been launched at Prayagraj Junction and Prayagraj Chheoki to provide facilities such as wheelchairs, luggage trolleys, hotel and taxi booking, baby milk, and medicines.
Security measures have been intensified, with around 5,900 personnel, including 3,200 from the Railway Protection Force (RPF), deployed across nine stations in the Prayagraj area. A total of 1,186 CCTV cameras, including 116 with Face Recognition Systems, have been installed. Drone cameras are being used for the first time for track surveillance and crowd monitoring on approach roads to stations.

Title: GRAP IV restrictions reimposed in Delhi-NCR as pollution levels surge
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:44:08 +0000
Content: The Centre on Wednesday re-imposed GRAP IV restrictions in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) due to the worsening air quality. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) sub-committee decided to implement all actions under Stage-III (‘Severe Air Quality of Delhi) and Stage-IV (‘Severe+’ Air Quality of Delhi) of the existing GRAP schedule, effective immediately, in addition to the Stage-I and Stage-II actions already in place, according to a statement.
“All actions of the GRAP schedule shall be implemented, monitored and reviewed by all the agencies concerned in the entire NCR to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further. All implementing agencies shall keep strict vigil and intensify measures of the GRAP schedule. Citizens are requested to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP,” the statement added.
The CAQM had, on January 12, revoked Stage-3 restrictions after the AQI in Delhi improved due to rainfall. Stage-IV restrictions include a ban on all construction activities, the entry of non-essential polluting trucks into Delhi, and the mandatory shift of school classes, except for classes 10 and 12, to hybrid mode.
Non-essential diesel trucks are prohibited from entering Delhi, and Delhi-registered BS-IV and older diesel-run heavy goods vehicles are banned, except for essential services, under Stage-IV.
During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages – Stage-I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage-II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage-III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage-IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).
Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local pollution sources, contribute to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during winters.

Title: Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan unveils Major Housing initiative for Madhya Pradesh
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:04:46 +0000
Content: In a significant boost to housing development in Madhya Pradesh, Union Minister for Rural Development and Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, presented a monumental housing initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
On behalf of the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, he announced that 8.21 lakh families in the state will receive pucca houses at a cost of Rs 12,636 crore, with completion expected by April-May next year.
The grand event, held in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, witnessed the presence of Chief Minister Dr. Mohan Yadav, State Ministers Prahlad Patel and Lakhan Patel, MLA Mukesh Tandon, and several other public representatives. The event commenced with a Kanya Pujan ceremony, followed by an enthusiastic roadshow where thousands of citizens welcomed Shivraj Singh and the Chief Minister.

Title: How biodiversity impacts every corner of human life
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 14:50:39 +0000
Content: Overhunting, ecosystem destruction and climate change caused by human emissions are all contributing to a rapid decline of global biodiversity.
A new report released by the World Wildlife Fund, an NGO, highlights what humanity is losing as a result.
From the large whales that mix ocean waters and make them more able to sustain life to tapirs that help the Amazon forest grow and provide rainwater to South America, the planet’s biodiversity is deeply connected to humanity’s well-being.
FISHING AND HUNTING
Hunting and fishing have been central to cultures throughout human history, and wildlife remains a key source of food and employment for humans.
Wild animal meat accounts for up to 80% of the animal protein consumed by populations in some rural regions of West and Central Africa, which makes it key both to the local economy as well as to food security, said the WWF report.
Humans also consume up to 2,500 freshwater fish species, research published in 2023 by the WIRES Water journal said, and a 2011 report in the Fish and Fisheries journal estimated that marine fisheries provide more than 200 million full-time jobs globally.
However, a decline in wild animal populations is harming fishing businesses and making less food available.
A study published in 2021 in the ICES Journal of Marine Science by researchers in Canada and Germany showed, for example, that cod catches in Eastern Canada reached a peak in 1968, at 810,000 tons, but fell to 10,559 tons in 2019 following a collapse in fishing stocks.
ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING AND REGULATION
Biodiversity is also central to ecosystem engineering and regulation – the process by which organisms shape habitats.
Extinction of one living being often leads to cascade effects that threaten whole ecosystems.
In grassland ecosystems, hoofed terrestrial herbivores compact the bare ground and soil, altering landscapes and promoting higher biodiversity, a 2024 assessment of research published in the Nature Ecology & Evolution journal showed.
Predators, meanwhile, contribute to keeping herbivore populations under control, limiting the risk of soil erosion from overgrazing, a 2014 report in the Science journal said.
In the oceans, sperm whales mix water and move nutrients through ocean layers with their large bodies, nourishing ecosystems and providing fishing grounds.
It is estimated, however, that great whale numbers have declined between 66% and 90% since commercial whaling began about 1,000 years ago, which means that they are making less of a contribution to keeping oceans plentiful.
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
Biodiversity is essential to keeping ecosystems healthy and able to provide humanity with what are called ecosystem services such as food, crop pollination, soil protection, cooling, fresh water and even leisure.
Research published in 2020 by the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal showed that five out of seven crops studied in the United States already lacked enough pollinators, such as bees, to secure full development.
This means production would likely be greater if there were more insect biodiversity.
In the case of the Amazon, a 2019 paper published in the Biotropica journal by Brazilian researchers found that tapirs distribute seeds over long distances and help speed the recovery of disturbed forests.
Water from the Amazon forms clouds that pour rain over much of South America, making it crucial for drinking water, agriculture, cooling and protection from wildfires.
Globally, destruction of natural areas coupled with climate change enabled 4.3 million square km of land (1.7 million square miles), an area larger than India, to turn dry between 1990 and 2020, according to figures released in 2024 by the U.N.
As the world dries up, it becomes more vulnerable to extreme climate events such as drought and the wildfires that hit South America in 2024 and now are spreading in California.
HUMAN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING
Biodiversity loss is also connected to humans suffering more from infectious diseases, according to a 2024 assessment of more than 2,900 studies.
For example, research published in 2011 as part of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity initiative suggested that loss of small mammal species contributes to the spread of diseases such as hantaviruses.
With less biodiversity, rodents of the same species have more frequent violent encounters in which they contaminate each other, increasing the risk that those diseases spread to humans.
Hantaviruses may cause serious health issues such as difficulty breathing and kidney failure.
Biodiversity is also linked to psychological and cultural benefits.
In a 2013 paper, people exposed to bird sounds told British researchers they felt relief from stress and fatigue.
Wild animals have also long served as inspiration to humans, featuring in artwork and music, but humanity has been losing that connection.
A 2018 study published by the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B concluded that many human populations are undergoing an “extinction of experience,” as destruction of habitats and concentration in urban areas makes interactions with wildlife more rare.

Title: What you need to know about the arrest of South Korea’s Yoon
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:59:48 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday for alleged insurrection over his bid to impose martial law, after weeks of defiance and claims by Yoon and his lawyers that the arrest warrant was invalid.
Here is what we know about his arrest so far:
WHY WAS YOON ARRESTED?
Yoon’s arrest stems from his brief imposition of martial law on Dec. 3, which stunned South Koreans as he declared on national television his aim to root out “anti-state forces” and to overcome political deadlock.
But after about six hours, he abandoned the plan after staffers at parliament used barricades and fire extinguishers to ward off soldiers trying to prevent lawmakers from voting to reject Yoon’s declaration.
Parliament voted to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14 and a trial at the Constitutional Court is underway to decide his political future, but investigators also launched a criminal probe into allegations of insurrection.
This is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity and when Yoon ignored summons for questioning, a court approved an arrest warrant on Dec. 31, which was later extended.
A first attempt to arrest him was blocked by presidential guards at his hillside villa before he was taken into custody on Wednesday.
WHO ARE THE INVESTIGATORS?
The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) is leading the joint investigation team involving police and the defence ministry, while prosecutors also carry out their own probe.
The CIO was launched in 2021 as an independent anti-graft agency to investigate high-ranking officials, including the president, and their family members.
But its investigating and prosecuting rights are limited. It does not have the authority to prosecute the president and is required to refer the case to the prosecutors’ office to take any action, including indictment, once questioning is over.
The investigators now have 48 hours to question Yoon, before seeking a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days or to release him.
WHAT IS YOON’S ARGUMENT?
Yoon said on Wednesday that he submitted himself for questioning to avoid any bloodshed despite what he called the illegality of the investigation and arrest.
Yoon’s lawyers have said that unlike prosecutors, the CIO does not have the authority to handle his case as the law stipulates a wide-ranging list of high-ranking officials and violations it can investigate, but has no mention of insurrection.
The lawyers also said that the arrest warrant was unconstitutional because it was granted by a court in the wrong jurisdiction.
They said any criminal investigation should be conducted after the Constitutional Court holds a trial on Yoon’s impeachment and decides whether to remove him from office permanently.
Yoon’s team has filed a complaint and an injunction with the Constitutional Court to review the warrant’s legitimacy.
WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE CIO, POLICE?
The CIO has said it has secured the rights to take on Yoon’s case by obtaining the arrest warrant, but apologised for previously failing to arrest Yoon and requested police to take over execution of the warrant.
Ahead of Yoon’s arrest, police acknowledged that there was a legal dispute over the case but held multiple meetings with the CIO to discuss how to execute the warrant after securing a re-issued arrest warrant on Jan. 7.
Seok Dong-hyeon, Yoon’s legal advisor, has said the bid to transfer execution of the warrant to the police was effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were “illegal”.
WHAT DO COURTS SAY?
The Constitutional Court said on Monday it is reviewing the complaint and injunction filed by Yoon’s lawyers.
The Seoul Western District Court, dismissing a similar complaint previously, said that it was not illegal for the CIO to handle Yoon’s case as allegations of insurrection are included in abuse of power charges covered by the agency.
Yoon’s lawyers criticised the court’s statement as “sophistry” and said they will consider appealing the decision to a higher court.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates new ISKCON temple in Mumbai
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:32:47 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the new International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) temple in the Kharghar area of Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, on Wednesday. The temple, named Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji Temple, was built with the efforts of ISKCON.
During the inauguration, PM Modi expressed his gratitude for being part of the event. He said, “Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji Temple is being inaugurated on this great land of knowledge and devotion, with the efforts of ISKCON. I am fortunate that I am getting the blessings of playing a role in this divine inauguration.”
The Prime Minister admired the temple’s design, stating that it reflects the tradition of spirituality and knowledge. “I was just seeing that the outline of the Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan Ji Mandir Parishad, the idea behind this temple, its form, reflects the entire tradition of spirituality and knowledge. Various forms of God can be seen in the temple. I am confident that this temple complex will become a holy center for enriching the faith as well as the consciousness of India. I congratulate all the saints and members of ISKCON and the people of Maharashtra for this noble work,” he added.
PM Modi also remembered former ISKCON Chairman Gopal Krishna Goswami, who passed away on May 5, 2024. He noted, “Today, on this occasion, I am also emotionally remembering the most revered Gopalkrishna Goswami Maharaj. His vision is attached to this project. His blessings are associated with his immense devotion towards Lord Shri Krishna. Today he may not be here in his physical body, but we are all feeling his spiritual presence.”
The Prime Minister praised Srila Prabhupada Swami, the founder of ISKCON, and spoke about how ISKCON’s followers are united by devotion to Krishna. “During colonialism, Srila Prabhupada took forward the importance of Ved, Vedant, and Gita. He did the ritual of linking Vedant to the consciousness of people. In 70 years, when people usually think they have fulfilled their duty, that’s when he began the mission of ISKCON,” he remarked.
PM Modi also highlighted the continuous efforts of his government in the interest of the people. He stated, “I am satisfied that our government is also continuously working in the interest of the countrymen with full dedication and a spirit of service…Construction of toilets in every house, providing Ujjwala gas connection to every poor woman, providing tap water facility to every house, providing free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh to every poor person.”
The Prime Minister mentioned the ‘Krishna circuit,’ an initiative aimed at connecting various pilgrimage and religious sites across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha.

Title: 80% of indian companies recognize AI as a core strategic priority: report
Publication Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:44:27 +0000
Content: India is leading in artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, with 80% of companies identifying AI as a core strategic priority, surpassing the global average of 75%, according to a report released on Wednesday.
The report, compiled by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), reveals that 69% of Indian companies plan to increase their tech investments in 2025, with one-third of these companies set to allocate over $25 million to AI initiatives.
Furthermore, less than 10% of Indian executives expect a decrease in headcount due to AI-driven automation.
“This reflects the nation’s drive towards a comprehensive digital transformation agenda. In line with this, 69% of Indian firms plan to boost tech investments in 2025, with one-third of these firms dedicating over $25 million to AI efforts,” said Nipun Kalra, India Leader at BCG X.
The report also highlights that 81% of Indian companies recognize the need for improvements in AI-related cybersecurity measures, as AI applications grow more complex.
“Indian companies are also adopting AI for high-impact purposes, including redesigning workflows and developing new business models, reinforcing India’s role as a key player in AI innovation,” Kalra added.
While 76% of Indian executives acknowledge the need for advancements in AI cybersecurity measures, 54% cite regulatory hurdles as a significant barrier to AI adoption.
Globally, only 7% of executives anticipate that AI automation will result in a decrease in headcount.
“In conversations with CEOs, it’s evident that AI is prioritized to boost productivity,” said Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG. “Leading AI adopters have figured out how to achieve results by focusing on a strategic set of AI projects, scaling them quickly, transforming key processes, upskilling teams, and consistently measuring the outcomes in terms of both operational and financial impact.”

Marking nine successful years of ‘Startup India,’ the Prime Minister described it as a landmark initiative that has redefined innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth.

“He (Khan) is being treated … and is out of danger,” senior police officer Gedam Dixit told Reuters.
Earlier, news agency ANI quoted hospital official Niraj Uttamani as saying, “He is currently undergoing surgery,” and adding, “The extent of the damage will be understood once the surgery is complete.”
A small piece of a foreign body had been identified close to the spine, added Uttamani, the chief operating officer of the hospital where Khan was taken at around 3:30 a.m.
Khan, who has featured in more than 70 films and television series, in some also as producer, lives in an apartment in the western suburb of Bandra, along with his wife Kareena Kapoor Khan, who is also an actor, and their two children.
Representatives of his wife confirmed Khan was undergoing a procedure after the burglary attempt, adding, “The rest of the family is doing fine.”

Title: Central govt staff allowed to use LTC for travel on Tejas, Vande Bharat, Humsafar
Publication Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:15:51 +0000
Content: The Central government has issued an order allowing its employees to travel on Tejas, Vande Bharat, and Humsafar express trains under the Leave Travel Concession (LTC) scheme in a move aimed at providing more convenient and faster travel options for them to visit their hometown or go for holidays to tourist destinations during leave.
According to the new order issued this week, employees can now use these premium trains in addition to the Rajdhani, Shatabdi, and Duronto trains, based on their travel entitlement
This decision was announced by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) after receiving many requests from various government offices and individuals. The DoPT has worked out the new rules in consultation with the Department of Expenditure before issuing the final order.
Central government employees get their ticket costs reimbursed for round trips under the leave travel concession (LTC scheme) in accordance with their entitlement depending on their rank and pay scale.
Although some premium trains such as the Rajdhani Express, Shatabdi, and Duronto were covered under the scheme, the Tejas and Vande Bharat trains, which were introduced more recently, were outside the ambit of the scheme.
“The matter has been examined by this department in consultation with the Department of Expenditure and it has been decided that apart from existing Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains, travel by Tejas Express, Vande Bharat Express and Humsafar Express trains under LTC as per the entitlement of the government employees has now been allowed,” the DoPT order states.
The LTC scheme for government employees is a prerequisite which covers the cost of travel to visit their hometown or any destination within India over a four-year block period.
The scheme offers government employees and their family members two options. They can avail of travel reimbursement to their hometown twice within a four-year block, split into two two-year periods. The other alternative they have is to visit their hometown once in a two-year period and go for a holiday to any place in India within the other two-year period.

Title: Blue Origin’s debut New Glenn rocket blasts off from Florida
Publication Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:07:11 +0000
Content: Blue Origin’s giant New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida early Thursday morning on its first mission to space, an inaugural step into Earth’s orbit for Jeff Bezos’ space company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business.
Thirty stories tall with a reusable first stage filled with liquid oxygen and methane, New Glenn launched around 2 a.m. ET (0700 GMT) from Blue Origin’s launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station under cloudy skies on its second attempt this week.
The rocket’s first attempt to launch on Monday was scrubbed around 3 a.m. ET because ice had accumulated on a propellant line. On Thursday, the company cited no issues ahead of launch.
Hundreds of employees had gathered for the launch at Blue Origin’s Kent, Washington headquarters and its Cape Canaveral, Florida rocket factory, a company live stream showed.
Locals on Florida’s east coast cheered from parks and camp sites several miles from the launchpad upon liftoff.
The culmination of a decade-long, multi-billion-dollar development journey, the mission includes an attempt to land New Glenn’s first stage booster on a sea-fairing barge in the Atlantic Ocean 10 minutes after liftoff, while the rocket’s second stage continues toward orbit.
Secured inside New Glenn’s payload bay is the first prototype of Blue Origin’s Blue Ring vehicle, a maneuverable spacecraft the company plans to sell to the Pentagon and commercial customers for national security and satellite servicing missions.
Getting the spacecraft to its intended orbit on an inaugural rocket launch would be a rare achievement for a space company.

Title: Singapore is invested in India’s ambition of Viksit Bharat, says President Shanmugaratnam on his state visit
Publication Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 06:14:14 +0000
Content: Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam was given a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Thursday by President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, marking the beginning of his State Visit to India.
This visit, his first as President of Singapore, coincides with the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations.
Speaking to the reporters following his ceremonial welcome, the Singapore President said, “We will never forget that India was one of the first few countries to recognise Singapore’s independence in 1965, and since then, our relationship has grown by bounce. It is a natural partnership between small country Singapore and large country India, but we find ways to cooperate in our mutual interests.”
Stressing the bilateral ties between the two nations, he mentioned that Singapore is the largest investor in India, and the defence ties between the two nations are also strong, continuing to grow further.
“We are now on a new trajectory with India with the upgrade of our relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, which was announced during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Singapore in September last year. We are exploring new initiatives going beyond the existing very active relationship that we have. We are working on cooperating in advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, new generation and net zero industrial parks, as well as on the skilling of the new industries that are involved,” he mentioned.
Stating the Indian and Singapore leaders “see eye-to-eye,” Shanmugaratnam also stated that both countries are working together in the field of digitalisation and sustainability.
“Singapore is invested in India’s ambition to be a developed country –Viksit Bharat 2047,” he added.
Tharman arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday evening and engaged in high-level discussions on Wednesday.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met the visiting President to discuss key areas of bilateral cooperation, including semiconductors, industrial parks, skilling, digitalisation, and trade development.
“Delighted to call on President Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore today. Discussed our cooperation in semiconductors, industrial parks, skilling, digitalisation, and trade development. Confident that his State visit will add new momentum to our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Jaishankar shared on X after the meeting.
Accompanied by a high-level delegation of ministers, parliament members, and officials, the Singapore President is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with President Murmu and Prime Minister Modi later in the day. Following his engagements in New Delhi, he will visit Odisha on January 17-18.
The Ministry of External Affairs highlighted the robust relationship between the two countries, emphasising that it is rooted in friendship, trust, and mutual respect. The ties were elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Singapore in September 2024.
Prime Minister Modi had previously acknowledged the strength of bilateral cooperation in various sectors during his visit to Singapore. He noted the potential for further collaboration, particularly in areas like social and digital investments and India’s emergence as a leading global growth centre.
President Tharman’s visit is expected to strengthen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, fostering deeper collaboration in key areas of mutual interest.

Title: “Economic corridor vision from India, Middle East, Europe can now become reality”: Biden on Gaza ceasefire
Publication Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 05:48:07 +0000
Content: US President Joe Biden expressed optimism on Wednesday that his vision of an economic corridor linking India, the Middle East, and Europe—first introduced at the G-20 Summit in New Delhi in September 2023—could now materialize following the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal.
Speaking on the agreement, Biden said, “At G-20 in Delhi in September 2023, I rallied key countries behind a vision of an economic corridor from India across the Middle East to Europe. That vision can now become a reality.”
The ceasefire deal, which was developed under the Biden administration, will largely be executed by the incoming administration led by President-elect Donald Trump. Acknowledging this transition, Biden said, “This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented for the most part by the next administration. In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team.”
The President also commended the relentless efforts of American diplomats, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Vice President Kamala Harris, in securing the agreement. “Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen, including an extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done,” Biden added.
Highlighting the broader implications for the Middle East, Biden emphasized the emerging opportunities for peace and stability, including the prospects of reducing the influence of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Assad regime in Syria, as well as advancing Palestinian statehood.
“As I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and there are genuine opportunities for a new future,” Biden said. “In Lebanon, there’s an opportunity for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah; in Syria, a future free from the tyranny of Assad; and for the Palestinian people, a credible pathway to a state of their own.”
The ceasefire agreement includes Hamas’s release of 33 Israeli hostages captured during the October 7, 2023, attacks, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The October 7 attacks had triggered a fierce Israeli military response in Gaza, resulting in catastrophic loss of life.
According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, Israeli operations have killed over 46,700 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 since the attacks began. In Israel, the Hamas-led attacks claimed 1,139 lives, with over 200 individuals taken hostage.

Title: US removes three Indian nuclear entities from export control list
Publication Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 05:43:28 +0000
Content: The United States has removed three Indian nuclear entities—the Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Center, the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, and Indian Rare Earths—from its export control list, which restricts the export of certain goods from US companies.
The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said on Wednesday that the removals aim to “support US foreign policy objectives by reducing barriers to advanced energy cooperation, including joint research and development as well as science and technology collaboration, to address shared energy security needs and goals.”
“The United States and India share a commitment to advancing peaceful nuclear cooperation and associated research and development activities, with strengthened science and technology cooperation over the past several years benefiting both countries and their global partners.”, the BIS added.
Matthew Borman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, emphasized that the removal of these three Indian entities would enable closer cooperation between the United States and India in securing resilient critical mineral and clean energy supply chains. He noted that this action aligns with and supports the broader ambition and strategic direction of the US-India partnership.
The US had initially added these and other Indian organizations to the Entity List following the May 1998 nuclear tests. In 2015, during President Barack Obama’s administration, nine Indian organizations were removed from the list.
On Wednesday, the BIS also announced the addition of 11 Chinese organizations to the Entity List. Ten of these entities were cited for advancing the People’s Republic of China’s military modernization through artificial intelligence research and integration, while one was added for its involvement in developing lithography technology for advanced-node fabrication facilities. This technology supports China’s indigenous production of advanced integrated circuits for military applications.
