Title: Youth key to India’s vision of becoming a developed nation: PM Modi at Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:21:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday highlighted the pivotal role of India’s youth in nation-building, expressing confidence that ‘Yuva Shakti’ would soon transform the country into a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed nation).
Addressing a gathering of around 3,000 participants at the ‘Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue’ held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, the Prime Minister remarked, “Mera vishwas kehta hai ki yuva shakti ka samarth, Bharat ko jald se jald Viksit Rashtra banayega” (I believe the power of youth will make India a developed nation very soon).
Emphasizing his connection with the younger generation, he described their bond as one of ‘Param Mitra’ (ultimate friendship), adding, “The strongest bond in a friendship is that of ‘Vishwas’ (trust). I have immense faith in you, and this trust inspired the creation of initiatives like ‘MYBharat.com’ and the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue.”
‘MY Bharat’ Initiative
The ‘MY Bharat’ platform, launched under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, aims to empower the nation’s youth through opportunities in social mobility, educational equity, and skill development.
The prime minister acknowledged the energy and enthusiasm of young participants at the venue, paying homage to Swami Vivekananda, whose ideals continue to inspire the nation. “Today, with the energy of India’s youth, this Bharat Mandapam is brimming with enthusiasm. The entire country is remembering and paying tribute to Swami Vivekananda,” he said.
Recalling India’s struggle for independence, PM Modi noted, “The people of India united to achieve freedom despite the British Empire’s immense strength. They lived the dream of independence and turned it into reality.”
Program Highlights
Earlier, the prime minister visited an exhibition at the event and interacted with several participants.
The two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue, hosted at Bharat Mandapam, began with a grand inaugural session attended by dignitaries including Union Ministers Mansukh Mandaviya and Raksha Khadse, alongside Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S Somnath, Pawan Goenka, Amitabh Kant, and Ronnie Screwvala.
The event opened with the traditional lighting of the lamp and a floral tribute to Swami Vivekananda. Departing from the 25-year tradition of hosting the National Youth Festival conventionally, the program seeks to engage 1 lakh youth in nation-building, as envisioned by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day address.
As part of the initiative, PM Modi also released a compilation of essays written by participants on ten themes, encompassing topics such as technology, sustainability, women empowerment, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Title: Devajit Saikia appointed as BCCI Secretary; Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected Treasurer
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:20:49 +0000
Content: Former first-class cricketer Devajit Saikia has been announced as the new secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), replacing Jay Shah, who assumed the role of ICC Chairman last year. The announcement was made during the BCCI Special General Meeting (SGM) on Sunday. 
IPrabhtej Singh Bhatia was elected as the Treasurer of the Indian Cricket Board. Confirming the appointments, BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla said, “Devajit Saikia elected new BCCI secretary, and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected as BCCI treasurer.” 
Saikia, who represented Assam in the 1990-91 first-class cricket season, scored 53 runs in four matches. He also has significant experience in cricket administration, having served as the BCCI joint secretary and the secretary of the Assam Cricket Association (ACA). Following Jay Shah’s election as ICC Chairman, Saikia had been serving as the acting interim secretary of the BCCI. 
The Special General Meeting also marked Jay Shah’s transition to his role as ICC Chairman, which began on December 1. Shah’s extensive administrative experience includes his tenure with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), where he oversaw the development of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the world’s largest cricket stadium. Under his leadership, India successfully hosted the 2023 Cricket World Cup in its entirety for the first time. 
In a key decision during Shah’s chairmanship, the ICC recently resolved the issue of hosting rights for the 2025 Champions Trophy. The tournament will be held in Pakistan, with an additional neutral venue included. The ICC has also adopted a hybrid model for its events in the 2024-27 cycle, with tournaments to be hosted in India or Pakistan. 
Meanwhile, former BCCI treasurer Ashish Shelar was recently elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in Maharashtra. He contested as part of the Mahayuti alliance, which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena.

Title: Fibre-rich diet may strengthen the body against infections: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:08:45 +0000
Content: A new study has found that the composition of the gut microbiome can help predict an individual’s susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections caused by bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Dietary changes, particularly increasing fibre intake, may alter the gut microbiome to reduce the risk of these infections.  
Enterobacteriaceae, a group of bacteria that includes Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella, and E. coli, is typically present in small amounts in a healthy gut microbiome. However, factors such as inflammation or consuming contaminated food can increase their numbers, leading to illness. In severe cases, an overgrowth of these bacteria can be life-threatening.  
Researchers used computational tools, including AI, to analyze the gut microbiome compositions of over 12,000 individuals across 45 countries through stool samples. They discovered that specific microbiome signatures can predict the likelihood of Enterobacteriaceae colonization, regardless of geographic location or health status.  
The study identified 135 gut microbe species commonly found in the absence of Enterobacteriaceae. Among these, Faecalibacterium was notable for producing short-chain fatty acids by breaking down dietary fibre, offering protection against harmful pathogens.  
The findings, published in the journal Nature Microbiology, suggest that increasing dietary fibre from vegetables, beans, and whole grains can support the growth of protective gut bacteria, crowding out harmful ones and lowering the risk of illness. The researchers noted that probiotics, which do not directly alter the gut environment, may have less impact on preventing infections.  
“Our results indicate that dietary habits are crucial in controlling susceptibility to infections caused by bacteria like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae,” said Dr Alexandre Almeida, senior author of the study and researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Veterinary Medicine. “By consuming fibre-rich foods, we provide the raw materials for our gut bacteria to produce protective short-chain fatty acids.”  
Klebsiella pneumoniae is known to cause severe infections, including pneumonia and meningitis.

Title: California wildfires claim 16 lives; Donald Trump calls it “one of the worst catastrophes” in US history
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:25:23 +0000
Content: US President-elect Donald Trump has voiced his frustration as the southern California wildfires continue to rage. Describing the disaster as “one of the worst catastrophes” in the country’s history, he criticized the authorities for their inability to extinguish the fires.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the fires in Los Angeles are still raging and lamented the lack of effective action. He expressed concern over the destruction of thousands of homes and the loss of lives, calling it a devastating event for the nation.
Reports indicate that at least 16 people have died in the wildfires, with nearly 200,000 displaced and around 10,000 structures, including entire neighborhoods, destroyed. While the Sunset fire has been contained, other fires remain active. The Hurst fire has burned 771 acres, the Kenneth fire has consumed 959 acres, and the Eaton fire has devastated 13,690 acres. The Palisades fire, the most destructive of all, has scorched 19,978 acres, bringing the total area affected to over 35,000 acres.
California Governor Gavin Newsom addressed the public, warning against misinformation about the fires. He reassured citizens that the state’s firefighting efforts have been significantly enhanced, with increased forest management and the world’s largest aerial firefighting fleet in operation. Newsom also emphasized that California remains committed to preventing looting and protecting affected communities.
A report by AccuWeather, cited by the New York Post, estimates that the wildfires could cause damages exceeding USD 50 billion, potentially making this disaster the most expensive in California’s history.

Title: Maha Kumbh likely to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, boost India’s economy
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:13:40 +0000
Content: The Maha Kumbh, set to begin in Prayagraj at the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers on Monday, is anticipated to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, providing a significant boost to India’s economy.
According to industry estimates, the Maha Kumbh is expected to increase both nominal and real GDP by over 1%.
The Uttar Pradesh government anticipates approximately 40 crore visitors, including domestic and international attendees, for the event.
Government estimates suggest that the Maha Kumbh could generate ₹2 lakh crore in trade if each of the 40 crore visitors spends an average of ₹5,000. Industry experts further project that average expenditure per person might rise to ₹10,000, potentially increasing the total economic impact to ₹4 lakh crore.
Meanwhile, companies from India and abroad are competing for space to showcase their presence during the 45-day event.
From fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) to pharmaceutical sectors, and mobility providers to digital payment platforms, businesses are loosening their marketing budgets, with anticipated spending exceeding ₹3,000 crore on branding and marketing at the Maha Kumbh, as per industry experts.
Public sector giant Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has supplied approximately 45,000 tonnes of steel for constructing various structures at the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025.
The steel provided by SAIL includes chequered plates, hot strip mill plates, mild steel plates, angles, and joists, according to a statement issued by the Maharatna company.
Prayagraj has undergone a significant transformation ahead of this grand congregation of Sanatan Dharma followers. Over 200 roads have been constructed and upgraded to ensure seamless connectivity for the millions of devotees expected to attend. The roads have been beautified with over 3 lakh plants and 1 lakh horticultural saplings, enhancing their visual appeal.

Title: PM Modi visits exhibition at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:57:51 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday visited the exhibition at the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025 held at Bharat Mandapam. During his visit, he interacted with participants and reviewed their projects.
The Department of Youth Affairs successfully inaugurated the two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue on Saturday at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi.
The event began with a grand inaugural session attended by Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports Raksha Khadse, Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S.

Title: Rain wreaks havoc on opening day of Australian Open
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:02:54 +0000
Content: Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour’s play was possible outside by early evening.
Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
“Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn’t get any tennis,” said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
“We’ve paid 60 bucks and haven’t seen anything.”
The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na’s Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
The 22-year-old’s last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
“The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes,” Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
“There’s more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let’s keep going playing with pressure.”
FIRST THROUGH TO SECOND ROUND
Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men’s second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
“It’s pretty nice, man. First time in my life I’m playing on a good court,” the 20th seed said.
“To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it’s much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain.”
Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France’s Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
Women’s favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena.

Title: ISRO SpaDeX docking mission: Satellites come within three metres in trial attempt
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:16:20 +0000
Content: Two satellites came as close as three metres during a trial attempt for space docking and are now moving back to a safe distance, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced on Sunday.
Providing an update on the SpaDeX Docking Mission, ISRO took to X, saying, “A trial attempt to reach up to 15 m and further to 3 m is done. Moving back spacecraft to safe distance. The docking process will be done after analysing data further.”
Earlier, the space agency said that the SpaDeX satellites were holding position at 15 metres and “capturing stunning photos and videos of each other!” The agency also shared images taken by the satellites at various distances.
This trial precedes the main docking experiment. During the attempt, the SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) — approached each other up to a distance of three metres before being moved apart for safety. ISRO emphasized that the docking process would only proceed after detailed analysis of the collected data.
Docking is a complex process, requiring precise maneuvers as the satellites move back and forth to achieve what ISRO has described as an “exciting handshake” in space.
India is employing its indigenously developed Bhartiya Docking System for this mission.
The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30, with the satellites SDX01 and SDX02 lifted onboard a PSLV C60 rocket and placed in a 475-km circular orbit.
If successful, India will become the fourth nation in the world — after the US, Russia, and China — to master the intricate technologies crucial for advanced space missions.
The achievement would also pave the way for future explorations, such as the Bharatiya Antariksh Station and Chandrayaan-4.
ISRO has postponed the historic docking of the two satellites twice, with its chief, Dr. S. Somnath, emphasizing that it is India’s first attempt at docking, and every first attempt comes with challenges. 
“The docking exercise will be done only when all sensors are fully calibrated and tested to satisfaction. All algorithms and scenarios are also tested on the ground before commands are sent to the spacecraft for autonomous docking,” Dr. Somnath had said earlier.
Post-docking, the two satellites will operate as a single spacecraft. Electrical power will be transferred from one satellite to the other to confirm the success of the docking. The mission will be declared successful only after the satellites are undocked and resume functioning independently, ISRO had said.

Title: Fog disrupts flight, train services in Delhi
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:07:17 +0000
Content: Dense fog disrupted flight and train services in Delhi on Sunday morning. According to the Indian Railways, 25 trains bound for Delhi were running late due to foggy conditions in the national capital and parts of northern India.
Some of the delayed trains included the Purushottam Superfast Express, Farakka Express, Anvt Humsafar, and S Kranti Superfast Express.
Amid the ongoing cold wave in Delhi, several flights were also delayed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a minimum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius in the city.
The air quality in the national capital was recorded as ‘poor,’ with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reporting an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 284 at 9 am. The IMD also issued a warning of a wet spell in the city, with thunderstorms and hail expected later in the day.
Visuals from India Gate showed near-zero visibility, while many people sought refuge in night shelters in Safdarjung to escape the harsh weather. Vegpal Singh, a local, stated that the shelters provided two meals daily, along with proper bedding and blankets. He added, “If medical treatment is needed, we take them to AIIMS, which is nearby.”
On January 11, light rain was recorded in Delhi, bringing the temperature down to 7.7 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Meanwhile, dense fog also blanketed other parts of North India. Morning visuals from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, showed the city shrouded in thick fog.
In Agra, Uttar Pradesh, the Taj Mahal appeared enveloped in a thin layer of fog as the cold wave intensified in the city. In Kanpur, a group of elderly people was seen huddled around a bonfire. Raj Kumar, an auto driver, said, “We face difficulties getting to work because of the cold. Bonfires should at least be set up at roundabouts.”
Cold waves continued to grip Jammu and Kashmir’s winter capital, Srinagar, as the chill intensified across northern India. Light rain was also reported in parts of Chandigarh.
Unexpectedly, a dense layer of fog enveloped Mumbai as well.

Title: India achieves 7.93% drop in greenhouse gas emissions: a milestone in climate resilience
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:32:11 +0000
Content: India is making significant strides in its journey toward climate resilience, reporting a 7.93% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2020 compared to 2019, according to its 4th Biennial Update Report (BUR-4) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The reduction underscores India’s commitment to a sustainable and low-carbon future, aligning with its pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, made during the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed India’s dedication to sustainable development, inspired by the principles of Mahatma Gandhi.
In a statement, he said, “India is the land of Mahatma Gandhi, whose vision for sustainable development inspires us greatly. We have shown what it is to realize key principles like Green Future and Net Zero.”
India’s Commitment to Global Climate Action
As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, India has committed to stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations and limiting global temperature increases to below 2°C, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. India continues to submit its Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to the UNFCCC, which provide updates on national GHG inventories, mitigation actions, and support received.
In 2020, India’s total GHG emissions, excluding Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF), stood at 2,959 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). Including LULUCF, net emissions were reduced to 2,437 million tonnes of CO2e, reflecting the country’s progress in emissions reduction.
The energy sector was the largest contributor, accounting for 75.66% of emissions, while forest lands sequestered around 522 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to reducing 22% of the nation’s total emissions.

Title: Zelenskiy says he’s ready to exchange North Korean soldiers for Ukrainians held in Russia
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:29:21 +0000
Content: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday Kyiv is ready to hand over captured North Korean soldiers to their leader Kim Jong Un if he can facilitate their exchange for Ukrainians held captive in Russia.
“In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It’s only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others,” Zelenskiy said on the social media platform X.
Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine had taken two North Koreans prisoner in Russia’s Kursk region, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the nearly three-year-old war last autumn.
Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia’s ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow’s forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence.
Zelenskiy has said Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses.
“Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,” Zelenskiy said.
He posted a short video showing the interrogation of two men who are presented as North Korean soldiers. One of them was shown lying on a bed with bandaged hands, the other was sitting with a bandage on his jaw.
One of the men said through an interpreter that he did not know he was fighting against Ukraine and had been told he was on a training exercise.
He said he hid in a shelter during the offensive and was found a couple of days later. He said that if he was ordered to return to North Korea, he would, but that he was ready to stay in Ukraine if given the chance.
Reuters could not verify the video.
“One of them (soldiers) expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine, the other to return to Korea,” Zelenskiy said in a televised statement.
Zelenskiy said that for North Korean soldiers who did not wish to return home, there may be other options available and “those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in the Korean (language) will be given that opportunity.”
Zelenskiy provided no specific details.
About 300 North Korean troops deployed to Russia have been killed with another 2,700 injured in combat against Ukrainian forces, with their rising number of casualties attributed to a lack of understanding of modern warfare and “the way Russia used the North Korean military”, a South Korean lawmaker briefed by the country’s spy agency said on Monday.
North Korean authorities appear to have called for its troops to commit suicide by blowing themselves up to evade capture, Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker on the South Korean parliament intelligence committee said citing the National Intelligence Service (NIS).
“It was also found in the memos carried by those killed that North Korean authorities emphasized self-destruction and suicide before capture, and that soldiers vaguely expect to join the Workers’ Party (of North Korea) or be pardoned,” Lee said.
Captured North Korean soldiers had not shown an intention to come to South Korea, though South Korea would cooperate with Ukraine if there was a request, Yonhap news agency also reported citing NIS.

Title: Surge in arrival of migratory birds in TN’s Pallikaranai after removal of encroachments
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 07:23:01 +0000
Content: Following the removal of encroachments, the Pallikaranai marshland in Tamil Nadu’s Mettukuppam has witnessed the arrival of more than 10,000 birds from 100 different species, including 70 migratory ones.
According to Gopikannan, an avid bird watcher with years of experience, several rare migratory birds have been spotted in the marshland this season. These include the Garganey, Northern Shoveler, Eurasian Teal, Eurasian Wigeon, Ruff, and Western Marsh Harrier. He attributed their presence to the marshland’s abundant food supply and favourable conditions. 
“The availability of food and a rich habitat makes Pallikaranai the preferred site for migratory birds during the season,” he said.
Tamil Nadu forest department officials confirmed that 52 encroachments were removed under the supervision of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and the affected families were relocated to designated areas. This intervention allowed the marshland to reclaim its natural state, creating a haven for both migratory and local bird species.
Officials reported that over 10,000 birds were observed in the Pallikaranai wetland this season. Continuous monitoring efforts by bird watchers and the forest department have significantly enriched their understanding of the ecosystem.
Heavy rainfall during the monsoon season brought ample water into the marshland, fostering a thriving habitat. As water levels gradually receded, a variety of waders joined the migratory species, further enhancing the marshland’s biodiversity.
The Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu has also reported a notable increase in migratory bird arrivals this season compared to previous years. Located in the Kollukudipatti and Vettangudipatti villages along the Madurai-Karaikudi Highway, the sanctuary spans 36 hectares.
Officials revealed that approximately 3,500 to 4,000 migratory birds visited the sanctuary in 2024, a remarkable rise from just 800 recorded in 2023. This surge is attributed to improved conservation measures and favourable weather conditions.
The Tamil Nadu forest department noted that around 20 species of birds visit the Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary annually, including the Egret, Indian Spot-Billed Duck, Darter, Asian Openbill Stork, and Black-Headed Ibis.
A senior forest department official explained that many of these birds travel thousands of kilometres from regions such as Australia, Europe, and Southeast Asia to roost and breed in the sanctuary.
Manikantan Thevar, a local villager and bird watcher, highlighted how migratory birds’ nesting behaviour often correlates with rainfall patterns, providing valuable information to farmers and locals. He explained, “If these birds nest in low-lying areas, it signals lighter rainfall, whereas nesting in higher terrains indicates heavy rain.”
The arrival of migratory birds in large numbers has brought cheer to villagers and bird watchers alike.

Title: PM Modi arrives in Kashmir to inaugurate Sonamarg tunnel, address rally
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:55:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kashmir on Monday to inaugurate the Z-Morh tunnel, rechristened as the Sonamarg tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ganderbal district.
After the special aircraft carrying the PM Modi, landed at the technical area of Srinagar international airport, the Prime Minister took an Air Force helicopter for Neelgrad in the Sonamarg area.
PM Modi will land at the Neelgrad helipad and drive in a cavalcade to the Gagangir area, where he will inaugurate the Sonamarg tunnel that provides all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg making it a round-the-year tourist destination.
Union Minister of SurfaceTransport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, MoS (PMO) Dr Jitendra Singh, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Chief Minister Omar Abdullah will be present during the inauguration of the tunnel.
PM Modi will later address a public rally at the truck yard in Sonamarg. Hundreds of people, braving extreme cold, have already gathered at the Sonamarg public rally venue to listen to the PM.
This is PM Modi’s first visit to the union territory after an elected government took office here.
Sonamarg tunnel will bypass the stretch of the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway that is prone to avalanches and heavy snowfall during the winter months.
The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) oversaw the Z-Morh tunnel constructed by APCO Infratech Private Limited for Rs 2,700 crore. The construction of the tunnel was started in 2018.
This tunnel will make Sonamarg an all-weather tourist destination, thereby helping employment for local youth, and boosting trade, tourism, and traffic to the Ladakh region, Amarnath Yatra and businesses.
The Tunnel is a 6.5 km long 2-lane road tunnel between Gagangair and Sonamarg in Ganderbal of Jammu and Kashmir. It was called the Z-Morh tunnel because of the Z-shaped stretch of road that the tunnel has replaced (Z-Morh translates to “Z-turn” in English). It takes only 15 minutes to travel the 6.5 km long tunnel compared to hours over the zig-zag road up and down the hills.
The Zojila Tunnel being constructed across the Zojila Pass together with the Z-Morh tunnel will make the journey to the Ladakh region safer and possibly throughout the year.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the Gagangir area of Ganderbal district on Saturday to oversee the arrangements being made for PM Modi’s arrival on Monday.
“Visited Sonmarg today to review preparations for PM @narendramodi ji’s visit on Monday. The inauguration of the Z-morh tunnel will open Sonmarg to tourism all-year-round, Sonmarg will now be developed as a great ski resort. The local population will not have to leave in winter &amp; the travel time to Kargil/Leh from Srinagar will also reduce,” he wrote on X on January 11.

Title: Maha Kumbh 2025: Brands flood market with Rs 2,000-crore ad surge as 45 crore devotees gather
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:49:52 +0000
Content: The Maha Kumbh 2025, poised to be the largest mass gathering in the world, is set to attract a staggering 45 crore devotees. This monumental event has caught the attention of brands across industries, eager to capitalise on the unprecedented scale by pouring thousands of crores into marketing and on-ground activities.
Running from 13 January to 26 February, this religious spectacle provides companies, particularly in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, and electronics, a rare opportunity to engage millions of consumers in one place.
Industry projections suggest that brands will invest between Rs 1,800 crore and Rs 2,000 crore in advertising campaigns, employing cutting-edge technologies like AI-driven themes, LED outdoor screens, virtual assistants, and mobile apps to capture the audience’s attention.
Luxury tents costing up to Rs 1 lakh per night, alongside budget homestays, cater to the wide spectrum of visitors. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that the event will generate Rs 1.2 lakh crore in revenue for Uttar Pradesh alone.
In addition to direct spending, trade associated with Maha Kumbh is expected to exceed Rs 4 lakh crore, giving a significant boost to both nominal and real GDP.
If each of the estimated 40 crore visitors spends an average of Rs 5,000, government figures predict trade revenues of Rs 2 lakh crore. However, industry experts believe the average spend could rise to Rs 10,000, pushing the economic impact to an impressive Rs 4 lakh crore.
With such vast economic potential, companies from around the world are vying for visibility at the 45-day event. Indian public sector giant Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has already supplied approximately 45,000 tonnes of steel for the construction of various structures, further underscoring the massive scale of preparation.
Prayagraj, the host city, has undergone a remarkable transformation in anticipation of this historic event. Over 200 roads have been constructed or upgraded, ensuring smooth transportation for millions of devotees. These roads are now lined with more than three lakh plants and one lakh horticultural saplings, adding to the city’s aesthetic appeal.
To ensure the safety of devotees along the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, particularly in the sacred Sangam area, the Uttar Pradesh government has deployed a substantial contingent of Water Police personnel, equipped with state-of-the-art technology.
This large-scale effort underscores the careful planning and security measures in place for the grand gathering of Sanatan Dharma followers.

Title: Thailand’s cabinet approves draft law to legalise casinos and gambling
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:36:32 +0000
Content: Thailand’s cabinet has approved a draft law that would legalise gambling and casinos, a move aimed at boosting tourism, jobs and investment, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Monday.
Under the government’s plan, the law, which will be sent to parliament for deliberation, would see gambling take place in large-scale entertainment complexes.
Casinos and most forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand but soccer betting and underground gaming activities and lotteries are rife, with vast sums of money changing hands.
Only some gambling is permitted, such as state-controlled horse races and on an official lottery.
Neighbours, Cambodia, Singapore, the Philippines, Laos and Myanmar have benefited from large casino complexes and Thailand’s government has argued the absence of legal casinos means it is turning its back on revenue and not reaching its tourism potential.
Tourism is a key driver of Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy and Thailand is forecasting record visitor numbers in the next few years.
“Legalisation will protect the public and would also generate more state revenue,” Paetongtarn told reporters.
Successive Thai governments have sought to legalise and regulate gambling to boost the economy but each attempt has faced pushback from conservatives in the Buddhist majority country.
The latest move could see foreign visitor numbers grow 5% to 10% and tourism revenue increase by about 120 billion baht to 220 billion baht ($3.45 billion to $6.32 billion), said Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat.
About 9,000 to 15,000 new jobs would be created, he added.
A key advocate of legalising gambling has been billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn’s father, an influential figure in the ruling party.

Title: Northern India Celebrates Lohri honoring tradition and community spirit
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:32:38 +0000
Content: As Northern India, particularly the states of Haryana and Punjab, experiences a cold wave, the region is celebrating the harvest festival of Lohri on Monday. Lohri, a festival of gratitude, is observed to honoUr Lord Surya, the Sun God, for providing light and warmth to help crops grow.
The President of India extended her warm wishes on this auspicious occasion. In a message shared on her X account, she said:
On the auspicious occasion of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Magh Bihu, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all Indian people living in the country and abroad.
These festivals are a symbol of our rich cultural heritage and unity in diversity. These festivals celebrated in different regions of India express respect for nature.
These festivals related to agriculture are also opportunities to express gratitude to our farmers for their tireless hard work.
I wish that this holy festival brings happiness and prosperity in the life of every person.”
Farmers, grateful for the fruits of their labor, gather around bonfires to celebrate with song, dance, and community joy. Popular Lohri songs such as “Sundari Mundari Ho…” fill the air as people dance the traditional Bhangra and Gidda. The festivities are marked by the sharing of sweets and snacks like peanuts, rewari, and other seasonal delicacies.
One of the stories closely associated with Lohri is that of Punjabi folk hero Rai Abdullah Khan Bhatti, also known as Dulla Bhatti. During Emperor Akbar’s reign, Dulla Bhatti led a revolt against Mughal rule. He became a symbol of protection when he saved two girls, Sundari and Mundri, from a corrupt landlord by adopting them and arranging their marriages. This story serves as a reminder of duty and loyalty, inspiring people to protect women and girls at all costs.
Lohri holds special significance for Punjabi families celebrating their first Lohri after marriage or the birth of a son. Friends and relatives gather to mark the occasion with joy and festivity. The festival embodies values of unity, love, and integrity, encouraging people to come together and share in the spirit of community.

Title: The dangers of Pakistan – North Korea nexus
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 06:29:16 +0000
Content: On 6 January, North Korea tested a hypersonic missile. A hypersonic missile is one that can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, which makes it more difficult to track and shoot down. The test coincided with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to South Korea.
 
North Korea released photographs that showed its leader Kim Jong-un watching the missile-test along with his daughter. Pyongyang said the missile reached a top speed of Mach 12 — that is 12 times the speed of sound.


Now, North Korea already possesses missiles that can reach the U.S. military base at Guam. It is developing missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland. However, what’s new is that Pyongyang is combining its missiles with a hypersonic warhead to make them potent. Two, it’s using carbon fibre composite materials in the missile’s engine section. Carbon fibre is lighter but stronger than other materials. And three, similar tests conducted last year featured a new, solid-fuel design. Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fuelled immediately before launch. They are easier and safer to operate and require less logistical support. This makes them harder to detect and more durable than liquid-fuel weapons. Also, they fly at a low altitude, and, therefore, evade detection by changing direction mid-flight. 
 
Kim hailed the missile test as a response to threats from hostile forces, a reference to the U.S. and its allies. He said the test showed the West that North Korea is ready to use any means to defend itself.
 
The U.S. and its allies reacted predictably. South Korea’s acting president Choi Sang-mok said it posed a threat to security on the Korean peninsula. Japan’s Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru said North Korea might be improving its missile technology with every test. And Blinken said the test underscored the importance of collaboration among the U.S., South Korea and Japan.
 
That’s half the story told. What the U.S. said about North Korea in the U.N. Security Council on 8 January, which, by the way, was Kim’s birthday, is what should worry the world, including India. A U.S. diplomat said : “The D.P.R.K. is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbours. In turn, the D.P.R.K. will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.”
 
That last bit is significant. India only knows too well about it.
 
A recent report published by The Tribune newspaper said New Delhi would want to ensure that Pyongyang’s new and bigger arsenal of hypersonic and short-range weapons does not have any place in Pakistan’s offensive military thinking. The report said developments on the Korean peninsula are of greater strategic importance to India today than they were four years ago because North Korea is a more emboldened military factor in East Asia now than it’s ever been.
 
The questions confronting India and the world are two-fold. One, will North Korea take to arms exports in a big way? And two, will it sell to Pakistan?
 
Let’s rewind a little. According to the late B. Raman, who worked for India’s spy agency, Pakistan’s ties with North Korea date back to 1971 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then foreign minister, visited Pyongyang and sought North Korean weapons to strengthen the Pakistani Military in the face of a looming war with India. Bhutto also visited North Korea in 1976, this time as Pakistan’s prime minister. In 1993, his daughter Benazir visited Pyongyang when she became prime minister. Benazir expanded the scope of the agreement signed by her father to include co-operation in nuclear and missile technologies including the training of Pakistani scientists and engineers in North Korea, the training of North Korean scientists and engineers at the Pakistani uranium enrichment plant at Kahuta and the supply of missiles and related technology to Pakistan. A former U.S. journalist, Mike Chinoy described Benazir Bhutto’s visit as the critical first step in an accelerating pattern of co-operation between Pakistan and North Korea.
 
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan made at least 13 visits to North Korea. Khan arranged a barter deal to exchange nuclear and missile technologies with North Korea. In 2004, Khan publicly confessed to transferring nuclear technology to North Korea between 1989 and 2000.
 
According to The New York Times, North Korea obtained many of the designs for gas centrifuges and much of the machinery required to make Highly Enriched Uranium, from Pakistan. Highly Enriched Uranium is used for producing nuclear weapons. In return, North Korea gave ballistic-missile parts to Pakistan in July 2002.
 
It’s important that you understand this timeline because it ties in perfectly with the development of North Korea’s own nuclear weapons programme. Remember, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. So, the Pakistani Nuclear Black Market has had a role in North Korea turning nuclear. What you also need to understand and appreciate is why Pakistan behaves the way it does. Husain Haqqani, a former adviser to Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, has said that the way Pakistan is governed could explain its nexus with North Korea. Haqqani wrote: “Pakistan is governed in a secretive manner, with its intelligence services and military running affairs in spheres of international concern. Even when the civilians are in charge of government, security policy remains largely in the military’s hands.”
 
So, Pakistan and North Korea go back a long way. What’s the guarantee then that Pakistan will not turn to North Korea again? If reports are to be believed, Pakistan may want to tap North Korea for Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile technology and hypersonic missiles. Pakistan has neither but North Korea has both. Will it be back to the future for Pakistan and North Korea? Watch this space.

Title: India set to redefine global trade at 6.4% CAGR over next decade: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:28:44 +0000
Content: India is poised to redefine its role in global trade, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4 per cent in trade over the next decade, roughly in line with its high GDP growth, according to a report on Monday.
The ASEAN region and especially India, are among the greatest beneficiaries of production shifts spurred by geopolitics, such as trade tensions between the US and China.
“We project 6.4 per cent CAGR in India’s total trade through 2033, to $1.8 trillion annually, roughly in line with its high GDP growth,” according to the report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
As the world increasingly pivots toward resilient and diversified supply chains, India’s ‘China+1’ strategy, backed by its large domestic market, skilled workforce, and forward-looking policies, positions it as a preferred global manufacturing hub.
“Strengthening partnerships with the US, EU, and emerging regions like Africa and ASEAN will be pivotal for India to capitalise on this momentum and drive inclusive, sustainable growth in global trade,” said Nishant Gupta, Managing Director Partner, BCG India.
India is emerging as the other big Global South trade story as it pursues favourable relations with most of the world’s major economies.
Among the drivers will be India’s growing popularity as a production base for companies seeking to diversify supply chains concentrated in China, hefty government incentives for manufacturing, a huge low-cost workforce, and rapidly improving infrastructure, said the report.
The analysis by BCG’s Center for Geopolitics estimates that global trade is set to top $29 trillion by 2033, but the routes these goods will travel is changing at a remarkable pace. The Global South, which accounts for around 30 per cent of global trade, is likely to see several major shifts over the coming decade.
Geopolitical rivalries, alliances, and aspirations are rewiring the global economy — and will continue to do so in the years ahead, accelerated by the imposition of tariffs by the US on foreign imports, the report mentioned.
Without a broad increase in tariffs, world trade in goods will keep growing at an average of 2.9 per cent annually for the next eight years, but the routes goods travel will change markedly as North America reduces its dependence on China and China builds up its links with the Global South, which is cementing its power in the global trade map.
“Trade lanes were already shifting from historical patterns and looming US tariffs will accelerate this. Navigating these new dynamics will be critical for any global business,” said Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director and partner at BCG, global leader of the Global Advantage practice.
In terms of product categories imported by the US, the greatest impact would be on imported auto parts and automotive vehicles, which would primarily affect trade with Mexico, the EU, and Japan.
Consumer electronics, electrical machinery, and fashion goods would be most affected by higher tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We estimate that a 60 per cent tariff rate would add $61 billion to cost of importing consumer electronics products from China into the US,” said the report.

Title: Study shows tumour DNA in blood may help predict lung cancer outcomes
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:57:27 +0000
Content: A team of British scientists has found that a blood test to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) may help predict lung cancer outcomes.
Circulating tumour DNA, which consists of fragments of DNA released into the blood by tumours, is known to play an important role in disease prognosis but is challenging to measure accurately.
In a study, researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London used a whole-genome sequencing platform called NeXT Personal, which can detect very small amounts—1 part per million—of ctDNA.
The researchers analyzed blood plasma samples from 171 individuals with early-stage lung cancer using the platform.
The findings, published on Monday in Nature Medicine, revealed that individuals with a low level of ctDNA before surgery were less likely to experience a relapse and had better overall survival rates compared to those with high levels of ctDNA.
The high sensitivity of the test enabled the detection of smaller amounts of ctDNA, preventing misclassification of patients with low levels of ctDNA as ctDNA-negative.
“We’ve shown that the presence or absence of tumour DNA in the blood was strongly predictive of prognosis. ctDNA testing, especially using ultrasensitive platforms, could help clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment and provide patients with a clearer understanding of how their disease might progress,” said James Black, Postdoctoral Clinical Fellow at the Francis Crick Institute.
Currently, treatment for early-stage lung cancer involves surgical removal of the tumour, often combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, depending on the stage of the disease. These approaches aim to maximize the chances of a cure.
The team noted that the test will next be evaluated on samples from patients who have undergone surgery for the earliest stages of lung cancer. This assessment will help determine whether the presence of post-operative ctDNA in blood can predict the risk of future relapse.
If successful, the approach could enable doctors to offer additional therapy after surgery, improving patients’ chances of being cured, the scientists added.

Title: India’s retail inflation falls to 4-month low of 5.22% in December
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:46:20 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation rate, based on the Consumer Price Index, fell to a 4-month low of 5.22 per cent in December as prices of vegetables, pulses and sugar eased during the month bringing respite to household budgets, according to figures released by the Ministry of Statistics on Monday.
The easing of inflation reflects a steadily declining trend after having touched a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October. CPI inflation had declined to 5.48 per cent in November.
The decline in retail inflation in December was attributed to the easing of the price spiral in key food items.
“During the month of December, a significant decline in inflation is observed in vegetables, pulses, sugar and confectionary, cereals and personal care &amp; effects,” according to a Ministry statement.
The year-on-year housing inflation rate for the month of December is 2.71 per cent, down from 2.87 per cent in November. The housing index is compiled for the urban sector only.
The top five items showing the highest year on year Inflation at the All India level in December 2024 are Peas (Vegetables) (89.12 per cent), Potato (68.23 per cent), Garlic (58.17 per cent), coconut oil (45.41 per cent) and Cauliflower (39.42 per cent). The key items having the lowest year-on-year inflation in December 2024 are jeera (-34.69), ginger (-22.93 per cent), dry chillies (-10.32 per cent), LPG (excl. conveyance) (-9.29 per cent), official data show.
The easing in inflation is a welcome sign as it was the first time that the rate of retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 per cent in October. The RBI is waiting for the retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent on a durable basis before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth.
The RBI during its last policy review slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth but kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent with an eye on inflation.
The CRR has been reduced from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent which will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and bring down market interest rates.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
In his last monetary policy view, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “India’s growth story is still intact. Inflation is on the declining path, but we cannot overlook the significant risks in the outlook. This risk cannot be underestimated.”
He was optimistic about the outlook for the economy, observing that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.”

Title: A war room inaugurated at Rail Bhavan to monitor Mahakumbh Mela arrangements
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:22:04 +0000
Content: In preparation for the grand Mahakumbh 2025, Union Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, inaugurated a dedicated ‘war room’ at Rail Bhavan to monitor nine key railway stations in the Prayagraj region through 1,186 CCTV cameras.
The initiative is part of a comprehensive plan to ensure smooth operations and enhanced security during the Mahakumbh Mela, which is expected to attract over 40 crore devotees.
The war room, set up by the Railway Board, will provide real-time surveillance through 764 newly installed cameras, with 116 of these equipped for facial recognition.
A five-tier system has been put in place to analyze the camera feeds, track platform activities, and oversee passenger flow. Centralized control rooms at each station will coordinate with the war room for round-the-clock supervision.
Passenger Convenience at the Forefront
During the inauguration, Vaishnaw also launched a multilingual passenger guide booklet, available in 22 Indian languages and English, and announced the commencement of announcements in 12 Indian languages at Prayagraj station.
Highlighting the cultural significance of the Mahakumbh, the minister emphasized that Indian Railways has made extensive arrangements to facilitate the travel of devotees to Prayagraj for the sacred bathing at the Sangam.
To manage the increased influx of passengers, Indian Railways has bolstered its infrastructure, including the construction of 21 new Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and Road Under Bridges (RUBs), and the closure of all level crossing gates in the region.
A color-coded ticketing system has been introduced to streamline unreserved passengers’ entry at Prayagraj Junction and other stations.
Enhanced Facilities and Infrastructure

Title: Climate activists deface Darwin’s grave at London’s Westminster Abbey
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 12:17:46 +0000
Content: Climate activists from Just Stop Oil painted over the grave of British naturalist Charles Darwin at London’s Westminster Abbey on Monday.
Two activists entered Westminster Abbey – Britain’s site for royal weddings, coronations, burials and a major tourist attraction – on Monday morning and used spray chalk on Darwin’s grave, the campaign group said in a statement.
The activists wrote “1.5 is dead” in orange over the surface of the white marble gravestone – a reference to recent news that global temperatures in 2024 had exceeded 1.5 Celsius above the pre-industrial era for the first time.
“We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe,” one of the activists said. “Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.”
Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, died in 1882. He is buried in Westminster Abbey’s Scientists’ Corner, where Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking are also buried.
The church confirmed the incident in a statement.
“The Abbey’s conservators are taking immediate action to clean the memorial and do not anticipate that there will be any permanent damage,” a spokeswoman said.
“The police were called to the scene and dealt with the incident. The Abbey remains open for visiting and worshipping.”
London’s Metropolitan Police said two women had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at Westminster Abbey and taken to a central London police station.
Just Stop Oil activists have staged a number of high-profile protests in Britain including by disrupting sports and theatre events, painting over the U.S. embassy building in London and throwing soup at Van Gogh paintings.

Title: Indian Stock Market Plunges Over 1% Amid Mixed Cues
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:25:11 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market witnessed a sharp downturn on Monday, with both the Sensex and Nifty indexes plummeting over 1% amid a mix of global and domestic pressures. Strong employment data from the United States suggested fewer rate cuts in 2025, adding to concerns about tighter monetary policies.
Adding to the challenges, rising crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, and significant foreign capital outflows further dampened investor sentiment. The market sell-off resulted in a staggering loss of approximately ₹12 lakh crore for investors.
The Sensex closed at 76,330.01, falling by 1,048.90 points, or 1.36%, while the Nifty ended at 23,085.95, marking a decline of 345.55 points, or 1.47%. Heavy selling pressure was observed across sectors, particularly in real estate, public sector banks, metals, auto, and pharma. Realty stocks took a significant hit, with the sector declining over 6%.
Market experts attributed the decline to a ripple effect from global markets, which faced a broad sell-off. The robust US payroll data fueled concerns about prolonged monetary tightening, strengthening the dollar, raising bond yields, and reducing the appeal of emerging markets.
Rupak De of LKP Securities noted the growing bearish sentiment, saying, “Bears remained at the helm as the Nifty continued to breach crucial levels. The index slipped below its previous swing low on the daily chart, indicating increasing bearishness. However, it held the 23,000 mark, which remains a key level to watch. If the Nifty sustains above 23,000 over the next few days, it could signal a potential recovery. Conversely, a decisive fall below this level might trigger a deeper correction.”
Among the broader indices, the Nifty Bank fell by 692.90 points, or 1.42%, to settle at 48,041.25. The Nifty Midcap 100 plunged 2,195.35 points, or 4.02%, closing at 52,390.4. Meanwhile, the Nifty Smallcap 100 dropped 723.45 points, or 4.10%, to end at 16,922.10.
In terms of individual performances, companies like Zomato, Power Grid, Tata Steel, NTPC, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, and Sun Pharma were among the major losers in the Sensex pack. However, a few stocks, including Axis Bank, TCS, IndusInd Bank, and Hindustan Unilever Limited, bucked the trend to emerge as the top gainers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling streak for the sixth consecutive trading day, offloading equities worth ₹2,254.68 crore on January 10. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹3,961.92 crore, offering some respite to the market.
The mixed cues, coupled with escalating challenges from both global and domestic factors, signal continued volatility in the near term, with market participants closely watching the 23,000 level on the Nifty for further direction.

Title: My heart says PM Modi will very soon fulfil promise of restoring statehood: CM Omar Abdullah
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:11:23 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday highlighted the transformation of Jammu and Kashmir into a hub of engineering marvels, including tunnels, bridges, and ropeways. He said that the world’s highest tunnel, railroad bridge, and rail lines are being constructed in the region.
Speaking after inaugurating the newly constructed Z-Morh tunnel in Sonamarg, Jammu and Kashmir, the PM Highlighed the impressive engineering of the Chenab Bridge, PM Modi said, “Our Jammu and Kashmir is becoming a hub of tunnels, bridges, and ropeways. The highest tunnel in the world is being built here. The highest railroad bridge in the world is being built here. The highest rail lines in the world are being built here. The world is in awe after witnessing the marvel of the Chenab Bridge.”
PM Modi noted that he had come as a ‘sevak’ to fulfill longstanding demands of the people. “A few days ago, I had the opportunity to lay the foundation stone for a railway division in Jammu, fulfilling a long-standing demand. Today, I am handing over the Sonamarg Tunnel to the nation, fulfilling another promise. This is Modi—’wada karta hai to nibhata hai’ (if I make a promise, I fulfill it). This tunnel will ease the lives of the people of Kargil and Leh, reducing their hardships,” he added.
PM Modi reminisced about his earlier visits to the Kashmir Valley as a BJP worker, when he would travel on foot for hours through heavy snowfall. “Two days ago, our Chief Minister shared some pictures, which brought back memories. During my time as a BJP worker, I spent a lot of time here—in Sonamarg, Gulmarg, Baramulla, and Ganderbal. Despite the harsh winters, the warmth of the people of Jammu and Kashmir made us forget the cold,” he said.
The PM also extended festive greetings, noting the simultaneous celebrations of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu, and the beginning of the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.
PM Modi further emphasized the tourism potential of the region, especially during the “Chilla-i-Kalan” period, the harshest winter phase in the valley. “This time of year brings new opportunities for tourist destinations like Sonamarg, attracting visitors from across the country. The work on this tunnel began in 2015 under our government, and I am proud it has been completed. This tunnel will unlock various tourism opportunities in Sonamarg,” he said.
He also underscored the developmental strides being made in Jammu and Kashmir. “The region is now being connected by railways, and new schools and colleges are being built. This is the new Jammu and Kashmir. The entire nation is working together to make India a developed country. Our government, committed to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,’ ensures no region is left behind in the race for development,” he said.
The Sonamarg Tunnel project, spanning 12 km and constructed at a cost of over ₹2,700 crore, includes a 6.4 km main tunnel, an egress tunnel, and approach roads. Situated at an altitude of over 8,650 feet, it ensures all-weather connectivity between Srinagar and Sonamarg, bypassing landslide- and avalanche-prone routes. This will provide safer and uninterrupted access to the strategically critical Ladakh region.
The newly inaugurated tunnel is set to transform Sonamarg into a year-round tourist destination, boosting winter tourism, adventure sports, and local livelihoods. Along with the Zojila Tunnel, expected to be completed by 2028, it will reduce the route length from 49 km to 43 km and increase vehicle speeds from 30 km/h to 70 km/h, ensuring seamless NH-1 connectivity between Srinagar Valley and Ladakh.
This enhanced infrastructure is expected to strengthen defense logistics, drive economic growth, and foster socio-cultural integration across Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Title: Nvidia says new rule will weaken US leadership in AI
Publication Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 10:44:01 +0000
Content: Nvidia on Monday criticized a new effort by the Biden administration to tighten Washington’s grip on artificial intelligence chip flows around the world, saying the regulation would jeopardize current U.S. leadership in AI.
The new rule, which is expected to be published as soon as Monday, “threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” and would “undermine America’s leadership,” Nvidia Vice President of Government Affairs Ned Finkle said in a statement.
Reuters reported last month on the U.S. Commerce Department’s plan for approving global AI chip exports while also preventing bad actors from accessing them. One aim of the restrictions is to keep AI from supercharging China’s military capabilities.
Finkle argued America’s leading role in AI would be hurt because the rule “would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally.”
The Santa Clara, California-based company also said the rule would not improve U.S. national security and it would control technology that is already widely available in gaming and consumer hardware.
“Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” Finkle said.
