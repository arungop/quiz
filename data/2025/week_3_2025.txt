Title: Youth key to India’s vision of becoming a developed nation: PM Modi at Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:21:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday highlighted the pivotal role of India’s youth in nation-building, expressing confidence that ‘Yuva Shakti’ would soon transform the country into a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed nation).
Addressing a gathering of around 3,000 participants at the ‘Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue’ held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, the Prime Minister remarked, “Mera vishwas kehta hai ki yuva shakti ka samarth, Bharat ko jald se jald Viksit Rashtra banayega” (I believe the power of youth will make India a developed nation very soon).
Emphasizing his connection with the younger generation, he described their bond as one of ‘Param Mitra’ (ultimate friendship), adding, “The strongest bond in a friendship is that of ‘Vishwas’ (trust). I have immense faith in you, and this trust inspired the creation of initiatives like ‘MYBharat.com’ and the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue.”
‘MY Bharat’ Initiative
The ‘MY Bharat’ platform, launched under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, aims to empower the nation’s youth through opportunities in social mobility, educational equity, and skill development.
The prime minister acknowledged the energy and enthusiasm of young participants at the venue, paying homage to Swami Vivekananda, whose ideals continue to inspire the nation. “Today, with the energy of India’s youth, this Bharat Mandapam is brimming with enthusiasm. The entire country is remembering and paying tribute to Swami Vivekananda,” he said.
Recalling India’s struggle for independence, PM Modi noted, “The people of India united to achieve freedom despite the British Empire’s immense strength. They lived the dream of independence and turned it into reality.”
Program Highlights
Earlier, the prime minister visited an exhibition at the event and interacted with several participants.
The two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue, hosted at Bharat Mandapam, began with a grand inaugural session attended by dignitaries including Union Ministers Mansukh Mandaviya and Raksha Khadse, alongside Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S Somnath, Pawan Goenka, Amitabh Kant, and Ronnie Screwvala.
The event opened with the traditional lighting of the lamp and a floral tribute to Swami Vivekananda. Departing from the 25-year tradition of hosting the National Youth Festival conventionally, the program seeks to engage 1 lakh youth in nation-building, as envisioned by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day address.
As part of the initiative, PM Modi also released a compilation of essays written by participants on ten themes, encompassing topics such as technology, sustainability, women empowerment, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Title: Devajit Saikia appointed as BCCI Secretary; Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected Treasurer
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:20:49 +0000
Content: Former first-class cricketer Devajit Saikia has been announced as the new secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), replacing Jay Shah, who assumed the role of ICC Chairman last year. The announcement was made during the BCCI Special General Meeting (SGM) on Sunday. 
IPrabhtej Singh Bhatia was elected as the Treasurer of the Indian Cricket Board. Confirming the appointments, BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla said, “Devajit Saikia elected new BCCI secretary, and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia elected as BCCI treasurer.” 
Saikia, who represented Assam in the 1990-91 first-class cricket season, scored 53 runs in four matches. He also has significant experience in cricket administration, having served as the BCCI joint secretary and the secretary of the Assam Cricket Association (ACA). Following Jay Shah’s election as ICC Chairman, Saikia had been serving as the acting interim secretary of the BCCI. 
The Special General Meeting also marked Jay Shah’s transition to his role as ICC Chairman, which began on December 1. Shah’s extensive administrative experience includes his tenure with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), where he oversaw the development of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the world’s largest cricket stadium. Under his leadership, India successfully hosted the 2023 Cricket World Cup in its entirety for the first time. 
In a key decision during Shah’s chairmanship, the ICC recently resolved the issue of hosting rights for the 2025 Champions Trophy. The tournament will be held in Pakistan, with an additional neutral venue included. The ICC has also adopted a hybrid model for its events in the 2024-27 cycle, with tournaments to be hosted in India or Pakistan. 
Meanwhile, former BCCI treasurer Ashish Shelar was recently elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in Maharashtra. He contested as part of the Mahayuti alliance, which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena.

Title: Fibre-rich diet may strengthen the body against infections: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 12:08:45 +0000
Content: A new study has found that the composition of the gut microbiome can help predict an individual’s susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections caused by bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Dietary changes, particularly increasing fibre intake, may alter the gut microbiome to reduce the risk of these infections.  
Enterobacteriaceae, a group of bacteria that includes Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella, and E. coli, is typically present in small amounts in a healthy gut microbiome. However, factors such as inflammation or consuming contaminated food can increase their numbers, leading to illness. In severe cases, an overgrowth of these bacteria can be life-threatening.  
Researchers used computational tools, including AI, to analyze the gut microbiome compositions of over 12,000 individuals across 45 countries through stool samples. They discovered that specific microbiome signatures can predict the likelihood of Enterobacteriaceae colonization, regardless of geographic location or health status.  
The study identified 135 gut microbe species commonly found in the absence of Enterobacteriaceae. Among these, Faecalibacterium was notable for producing short-chain fatty acids by breaking down dietary fibre, offering protection against harmful pathogens.  
The findings, published in the journal Nature Microbiology, suggest that increasing dietary fibre from vegetables, beans, and whole grains can support the growth of protective gut bacteria, crowding out harmful ones and lowering the risk of illness. The researchers noted that probiotics, which do not directly alter the gut environment, may have less impact on preventing infections.  
“Our results indicate that dietary habits are crucial in controlling susceptibility to infections caused by bacteria like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae,” said Dr Alexandre Almeida, senior author of the study and researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Veterinary Medicine. “By consuming fibre-rich foods, we provide the raw materials for our gut bacteria to produce protective short-chain fatty acids.”  
Klebsiella pneumoniae is known to cause severe infections, including pneumonia and meningitis.

Title: California wildfires claim 16 lives; Donald Trump calls it “one of the worst catastrophes” in US history
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:25:23 +0000
Content: US President-elect Donald Trump has voiced his frustration as the southern California wildfires continue to rage. Describing the disaster as “one of the worst catastrophes” in the country’s history, he criticized the authorities for their inability to extinguish the fires.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the fires in Los Angeles are still raging and lamented the lack of effective action. He expressed concern over the destruction of thousands of homes and the loss of lives, calling it a devastating event for the nation.
Reports indicate that at least 16 people have died in the wildfires, with nearly 200,000 displaced and around 10,000 structures, including entire neighborhoods, destroyed. While the Sunset fire has been contained, other fires remain active. The Hurst fire has burned 771 acres, the Kenneth fire has consumed 959 acres, and the Eaton fire has devastated 13,690 acres. The Palisades fire, the most destructive of all, has scorched 19,978 acres, bringing the total area affected to over 35,000 acres.
California Governor Gavin Newsom addressed the public, warning against misinformation about the fires. He reassured citizens that the state’s firefighting efforts have been significantly enhanced, with increased forest management and the world’s largest aerial firefighting fleet in operation. Newsom also emphasized that California remains committed to preventing looting and protecting affected communities.
A report by AccuWeather, cited by the New York Post, estimates that the wildfires could cause damages exceeding USD 50 billion, potentially making this disaster the most expensive in California’s history.

Title: Maha Kumbh likely to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, boost India’s economy
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:13:40 +0000
Content: The Maha Kumbh, set to begin in Prayagraj at the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers on Monday, is anticipated to generate over ₹4 lakh crore in trade, providing a significant boost to India’s economy.
According to industry estimates, the Maha Kumbh is expected to increase both nominal and real GDP by over 1%.
The Uttar Pradesh government anticipates approximately 40 crore visitors, including domestic and international attendees, for the event.
Government estimates suggest that the Maha Kumbh could generate ₹2 lakh crore in trade if each of the 40 crore visitors spends an average of ₹5,000. Industry experts further project that average expenditure per person might rise to ₹10,000, potentially increasing the total economic impact to ₹4 lakh crore.
Meanwhile, companies from India and abroad are competing for space to showcase their presence during the 45-day event.
From fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) to pharmaceutical sectors, and mobility providers to digital payment platforms, businesses are loosening their marketing budgets, with anticipated spending exceeding ₹3,000 crore on branding and marketing at the Maha Kumbh, as per industry experts.
Public sector giant Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has supplied approximately 45,000 tonnes of steel for constructing various structures at the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025.
The steel provided by SAIL includes chequered plates, hot strip mill plates, mild steel plates, angles, and joists, according to a statement issued by the Maharatna company.
Prayagraj has undergone a significant transformation ahead of this grand congregation of Sanatan Dharma followers. Over 200 roads have been constructed and upgraded to ensure seamless connectivity for the millions of devotees expected to attend. The roads have been beautified with over 3 lakh plants and 1 lakh horticultural saplings, enhancing their visual appeal.

Title: PM Modi visits exhibition at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:57:51 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday visited the exhibition at the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025 held at Bharat Mandapam. During his visit, he interacted with participants and reviewed their projects.
The Department of Youth Affairs successfully inaugurated the two-day Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue on Saturday at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi.
The event began with a grand inaugural session attended by Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs & Sports Raksha Khadse, Anand Mahindra, Palki Sharma, S. Somnath, Pawan Goenka, Amitabh Kant, and Ronnie Screwvala. The ceremony featured the traditional lighting of the lamp, followed by a floral tribute to Swami Vivekananda, whose enduring ideals continue to inspire the nation’s youth.
The Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue seeks to break away from the 25-year-old tradition of holding the National Youth Festival in a conventional format. It aligns with the Prime Minister’s Independence Day vision of engaging 1 lakh youth in politics without political affiliations and providing them with a national platform to turn their ideas for a developed India into reality.
The Prime Minister is also set to release a compilation of the best essays written by participants on ten themes, encompassing diverse areas such as technology, sustainability, women empowerment, manufacturing, and agriculture.
In a unique initiative, the Prime Minister will join the young leaders for lunch, offering them a chance to share their ideas, experiences, and aspirations directly with him.
Earlier today, BJP National President and Union Minister J.P. Nadda praised the ‘Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue’ program, emphasizing that platforms like this instill a sense of empowerment and confidence among the youth, inspiring them to contribute meaningfully to nation-building.
In a post on X, Nadda shared, “Hosted the young leaders of Himachal Pradesh under the ‘Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogues’ program in New Delhi. I shared my journey and experiences while carefully listening to their innovative ideas and fresh perspectives.
“Platforms like this instill a sense of empowerment and confidence among youngsters, inspiring them to contribute meaningfully to nation-building. I am enthused by the energy and passion of these youngsters and impressed with their commitment to the vision of Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi ji for ‘Viksit Bharat@2047’,” Nadda added in the post.

Title: Rain wreaks havoc on opening day of Australian Open
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 07:02:54 +0000
Content: Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour’s play was possible outside by early evening.
Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
“Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn’t get any tennis,” said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
“We’ve paid 60 bucks and haven’t seen anything.”
The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na’s Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
The 22-year-old’s last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
“The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes,” Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
“There’s more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let’s keep going playing with pressure.”
FIRST THROUGH TO SECOND ROUND
Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men’s second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
“It’s pretty nice, man. First time in my life I’m playing on a good court,” the 20th seed said.
“To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it’s much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain.”
Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France’s Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
Women’s favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena.

Title: ISRO SpaDeX docking mission: Satellites come within three metres in trial attempt
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:16:20 +0000
Content: Two satellites came as close as three metres during a trial attempt for space docking and are now moving back to a safe distance, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced on Sunday.
Providing an update on the SpaDeX Docking Mission, ISRO took to X, saying, “A trial attempt to reach up to 15 m and further to 3 m is done. Moving back spacecraft to safe distance. The docking process will be done after analysing data further.”
Earlier, the space agency said that the SpaDeX satellites were holding position at 15 metres and “capturing stunning photos and videos of each other!” The agency also shared images taken by the satellites at various distances.
This trial precedes the main docking experiment. During the attempt, the SpaDeX satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) — approached each other up to a distance of three metres before being moved apart for safety. ISRO emphasized that the docking process would only proceed after detailed analysis of the collected data.
Docking is a complex process, requiring precise maneuvers as the satellites move back and forth to achieve what ISRO has described as an “exciting handshake” in space.
India is employing its indigenously developed Bhartiya Docking System for this mission.
The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30, with the satellites SDX01 and SDX02 lifted onboard a PSLV C60 rocket and placed in a 475-km circular orbit.
If successful, India will become the fourth nation in the world — after the US, Russia, and China — to master the intricate technologies crucial for advanced space missions.
The achievement would also pave the way for future explorations, such as the Bharatiya Antariksh Station and Chandrayaan-4.
ISRO has postponed the historic docking of the two satellites twice, with its chief, Dr. S. Somnath, emphasizing that it is India’s first attempt at docking, and every first attempt comes with challenges. 
“The docking exercise will be done only when all sensors are fully calibrated and tested to satisfaction. All algorithms and scenarios are also tested on the ground before commands are sent to the spacecraft for autonomous docking,” Dr. Somnath had said earlier.
Post-docking, the two satellites will operate as a single spacecraft. Electrical power will be transferred from one satellite to the other to confirm the success of the docking. The mission will be declared successful only after the satellites are undocked and resume functioning independently, ISRO had said.

Title: Fog disrupts flight, train services in Delhi
Publication Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2025 05:07:17 +0000
Content: Dense fog disrupted flight and train services in Delhi on Sunday morning. According to the Indian Railways, 25 trains bound for Delhi were running late due to foggy conditions in the national capital and parts of northern India.
Some of the delayed trains included the Purushottam Superfast Express, Farakka Express, Anvt Humsafar, and S Kranti Superfast Express.
Amid the ongoing cold wave in Delhi, several flights were also delayed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a minimum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius in the city.
The air quality in the national capital was recorded as ‘poor,’ with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reporting an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 284 at 9 am. The IMD also issued a warning of a wet spell in the city, with thunderstorms and hail expected later in the day.
Visuals from India Gate showed near-zero visibility, while many people sought refuge in night shelters in Safdarjung to escape the harsh weather. Vegpal Singh, a local, stated that the shelters provided two meals daily, along with proper bedding and blankets. He added, “If medical treatment is needed, we take them to AIIMS, which is nearby.”
On January 11, light rain was recorded in Delhi, bringing the temperature down to 7.7 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Meanwhile, dense fog also blanketed other parts of North India. Morning visuals from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, showed the city shrouded in thick fog.
In Agra, Uttar Pradesh, the Taj Mahal appeared enveloped in a thin layer of fog as the cold wave intensified in the city. In Kanpur, a group of elderly people was seen huddled around a bonfire. Raj Kumar, an auto driver, said, “We face difficulties getting to work because of the cold. Bonfires should at least be set up at roundabouts.”
Cold waves continued to grip Jammu and Kashmir’s winter capital, Srinagar, as the chill intensified across northern India. Light rain was also reported in parts of Chandigarh.
Unexpectedly, a dense layer of fog enveloped Mumbai as well.
