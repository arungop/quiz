Title: Ukraine says 21 killed by Russian ballistic missile strike on Sumy
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:06:41 +0000
Content: At least 21 people were killed and 83 others were wounded by a Russian ballistic missile strike in the heart of the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday morning, Ukraine’s interior minister Ihor Klymenko said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the attack – one of the deadliest strikes on Ukraine this year – and called for a tough international reaction against Moscow.
“Only scoundrels can act like this. Taking the lives of ordinary people,” he wrote on social media, alongside a chilling video which showed corpses on the ground, a destroyed bus and burnt-out cars in the middle of a city street.
“And this is on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s Entry into Jerusalem,” Zelenskiy said.
Interior minister Klymenko said the victims were on the street, in vehicles, public transport and in buildings when the strike hit.
“Deliberate destruction of civilians on an important church feast day,” he wrote.
Reuters was seeking comment from Russian authorities.
Andriy Kovalenko, a security official who runs Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, noted that the strike came after a visit to Moscow by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Russia is building all this so-called diplomacy … around strikes on civilians,” he wrote on Telegram.
Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in St. Petersburg on the search for a Ukraine peace deal, as Trump told Russia to “get moving”.
In the aftermath of Sunday’s strike, Zelenskiy called on the U.S. and Europe to get tough on Russia in response to what he described as terrorism.
“Russia wants exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out this war. Without pressure on the aggressor, peace is impossible. Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs,” he wrote.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently holds about 20% of the country’s territory in the east and south. Russian forces have been slowly advancing in the east of late, though missile and drone strikes now dominate the war.
Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine had carried out five attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the previous day in what it called a violation of a U.S.-brokered moratorium on such strikes.
Ukraine and Russia agreed to pause strikes on each other’s energy facilities last month, but both sides have repeatedly accused each other of breaking the moratorium.

Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:46:20 +0000
Content: Homes were flooded and roads turned into muddy rivers after torrential rainfall over the Spanish Canary Island of Lanzarote, a popular year-round tourist destination.
A state of emergency was declared after 6 cm (2.4 inches) of rain fell in two hours on Saturday, emergency services said on Sunday.
Dramatic video footage showed a surge of brown flood water streaming under a bridge while bystanders took pictures and cars were stuck on flooded roads.
Enrique Espinosa, head of emergency services for the Lanzarote government, said some homes had been submerged.
“We have been working all night, attending 300 calls overnight, many of them in Arrecife and Teguise. Some houses are flooded and what remains is a great quantity of mud,” Espinosa told RTVE state television on Sunday.
No one has been injured in the flooding, authorities said.

Title: Sundays on Cycle: India pedals forward with over 300 events nationwide on April 13
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:42:28 +0000
Content: India witnessed yet another vibrant edition of the ‘Fit India Sundays on Cycle’, with over 300 events conducted simultaneously across the country. Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, Sports, flagged off the national capital’s edition at New Moti Bagh, energising the crowd and reinforcing the national momentum towards fitness.
Communities, athletes, police departments, and residents across the nation pedalled with purpose, celebrating fitness, fun, and environmental awareness under the campaign led by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.
New Moti Bagh Club played host to an energetic rally with around 350 residents from various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) pedalling in unison. Sunday’s event, a collaboration between local RWAs and Fit India, focused on fighting obesity and encouraging healthier habits among city dwellers.
Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, sports, joined the event and encouraged the enthusiastic crowd. She spoke about the momentum Fit India has gained over time.
She said, “Fit India is a nationwide popular movement. It has seen many different kinds of activities and is gaining popularity across all sections of society. As we speak, lakhs of people have already joined Sundays on Cycle across the country.
“Today alone, about 300 events are taking place. We also had the Fit India carnival in JLN Stadium, which was mentioned in the Honourable Prime Minister’s Mann ki Baat. All these efforts are creating the right kind of environment for fitness and wellness in India,” she said.
The event also featured special guests including Nitesh Siwach, a Greco-Roman wrestler, who recently clinched a bronze medal in the 97 kg category at the 2025 Asian Wrestling Championships in Amman, Jordan, and Rohtash Choudhary, popularly known as the ‘Push-Up Man of India,’ who holds multiple Guinness World Records, including performing 645 push-ups in one hour while carrying a 60 lb pack with one leg raised.
Nitesh Siwach praised the increasing awareness among people on improving their health.
“Fitness is an integral part of our lives. Mental and physical fitness is our true wealth. It is really good to see initiatives like these where people are coming together to cycle, and are in general becoming conscious about better health. I’m glad Fit India is doing this, and I hope it keeps growing,” he told SAI Media.
At SAI RC Imphal, renowned Indian weightlifter and Padma Shri awardee Kunjarani Devi flagged off the cycling rally, lending her support to the fitness cause. Her presence inspired hundreds to take the pledge toward healthier living and cleaner cities.

Title: India’s semiconductor industry likely to double revenue to $108 bn by 2030: Report
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 10:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian semiconductor industry’s revenues are likely to double from $54 billion to $108 billion between 2025 to 2030, according to a report by financial services firm UBS.
The report expects India to gain amid the US-China tariff war that will put the communist giant at a disadvantage and see India emerging as a stronger alternative for global giants looking to set up supply chains.
The report sees strong growth ahead for the market, including a localisation opportunity, which is expected to generate $13 billion in revenues in 2030.
UBS said this 15 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) estimate is faster than our forecast for the global semiconductor end market thanks to India’s favourable demographics fuelling strong electronics demand (and in turn semiconductors), rising enterprise adoption of advanced semiconductors, and favourable government policies.
India accounts for only 0.1 per cent of global wafer capacity, around 1 per cent of annual equipment spending, and a 6.5 per cent semiconductor end-demand share, the report states.
According to the report, major tech companies are evaluating the relocation of their supply chains amid the ongoing tariff uncertainties triggered by the Donald Trump administration in the US.
A few companies have already embarked on their “China plus one” strategy by diversifying their final assembly locations beyond China, the report points out.
India’s tech advantage lies mostly in its vast talent pool in the software and services industry, whereas mainland China’s dominance is in tech manufacturing.
In semiconductors, too, India has a unique advantage, with around 20 per cent of global chip designers working in the country for multinational corporations, the report points out.
Despite these uncertainties, the US and mainland China are the top end-markets. India, at 6.5 per cent, is a solid end market for global semiconductors, with $54 billion in revenues in 2025, the report added.

Title: India, Nepal agree on joint steps to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:51:41 +0000
Content: India and Nepal have decided to strengthen measures to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency notes and other goods such as e-cigarettes, according to a statement issued by the Finance Ministry on Sunday.
The issue was discussed at the 21st Director-General level talks on Customs Cooperation held between the two countries in Kathmandu on April 10-11. The Indian delegation was led by Abhai Kumar Srivastav, Director-General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Department of Revenue, while the Nepali delegation was led by Mahesh Bhattarai, Director-General, Department of Customs, Nepal.
It was acknowledged that smuggling of goods has been a common challenge, and both sides looked forward towards cooperation in preventing smuggling across the borders with active engagement and exchange of intelligence. Both nations agreed to take necessary measures to control the unauthorised trade and work in tandem.
Nepal is a priority partner of India under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy. India accounts for two-thirds of Nepal’s exports and is the largest trade partner of Nepal. The bilateral talks on Customs cooperation are an important mechanism to facilitate genuine trade as well as to prevent illicit trade along the border in an interconnected world.
The meeting also reviewed progress on MoU on Pre-arrival Exchange of Customs Data and Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES); finalisation of Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA); facilitation of movement of transit cargo under Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS); automation and digitisation of transit processes; upgradation of border infrastructure; knowledge sharing program and support for capacity development, among others.
Both sides emphasised on collaborating in areas that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and customs operations across the border that deliver significant economic benefits to both countries. It was mutually agreed to consider new technologies for facilitating trade and preventing smuggling of goods.
The meeting concluded on an optimistic note. The Nepali side expressed their gratitude to the Government of India, particularly the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), for knowledge sharing and capacity enhancement programmes for Nepal Customs officials at different levels, the statement added.

Title: WHO members close to accord on tackling future pandemics
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:14:53 +0000
Content: Members of the World Health Organization are close to a deal on a treaty to prepare for future pandemics, sources involved in the talks told Reuters on Saturday, with a WHO spokesperson saying discussions had been paused until Tuesday.
The pact, which has been arduously negotiated for three years and which would be legally binding, is intended to shore up the world’s defences against new pathogens after the COVID-19 pandemic killed millions of people in 2020-22.
“They (the talks) went overnight until 9 a.m. (Saturday) but didn’t manage to resolve the final issues,” one source involved in the discussions in Geneva said.
A diplomatic source in Geneva added that “big advancement was made … almost all the treaty was agreed upon with few outstanding yet crucial issues”.
The talks missed a key deadline last year despite several rounds of late-night talks.
The negotiating body’s co-chair had earlier told the AFP news agency that it had reached an agreement “in principle”.
The United States, which was slow to join the early talks, left the discussions this year after new President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February withdrawing from the WHO and barring participation in the talks.
The other 192 members of the WHO who joined the discussions would be free to ratify the deal or not after it is formally adopted.
One of the most contentious issues between wealthy countries and developing states is how to share drugs and vaccines fairly to avoid the mistakes of the COVID era.
The negotiations have been vexed throughout by allegations from right-wing commentators, including in the U.S. but also Britain and Australia, that they could undermine national sovereignty by giving too much power to a U.N. agency.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rejects such assertions, and says the accord would help countries better guard against pandemic outbreaks.
This week in Geneva, a small group of campaigners protested against the talks with one holding up a sign with a fanged snake uncoiling itself from the WHO symbol, with the motto: “WHO ARE YOU TO TAKE AWAY MY FREEDOMS?!”
The agreement, if finalised, would be a historic victory for the global health agency. Only once in the WHO’s 75-year history have its member countries agreed to a treaty – a tobacco control accord in 2003.

Title: Irish regulator investigates X over use of EU personal data to train Grok AI
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 07:24:02 +0000
Content: Ireland’s data regulator on Saturday said it had opened an investigation into social media platform X over the use of personal data collected from European Union users to train its AI system Grok.
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is the lead EU regulator for X due to the location of its EU operations in the country. It has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue under the EU’s strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The inquiry will look at “the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models,” the DPC said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have criticised EU regulation of U.S. companies and described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation.
X owner Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a top adviser to Trump, has also railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content.
The decision follows a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems.
X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent. The Irish regulator ended its court proceedings weeks later, saying X had agreed the limits on a permanent basis.
The powerful Irish privacy regulator has fined the likes of Microsoft’s  LinkedIn, TikTok and Meta  since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018. Its fines to date of Meta total almost 3 billion euros.
X, or Twitter as it was then called, has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020, the first penalty the regulator handed out under the new data privacy system.

Title: ‘May this festival bring new hope, happiness’, Prez Murmu, PM Modi extend greetings on Baisakhi
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 06:11:38 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the nation on the occasion of Baisakhi, saying that the festival would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the nation’s development.
Baisakhi, one of the biggest festivals marks the foundation day of the Khalsa Panth (Sikh order) by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, and also the start of the harvest season.
President Murmu, in a post on X, extended her heartfelt greetings to all Indians living in India and abroad.
The day is also celebrated in different parts of the country as Vishu, Bohag Bihu, Poila Boishakh, Meshadi, Vaishakhadi and Puthandu Pirapu, she said.
“These festivals celebrated at the time of harvest in various parts of India symbolise our social traditions and unity in diversity. Through these festivals we honour the hard work of our ‘Annadata’ farmers and express our gratitude to them. These festivals also give the message of preserving nature and protecting our cultural legacy,” President Murmu said in her post.
She hoped that these vibrant festivals would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the development of our nation.
Prime Minister Modi wished everyone a joyous Baisakhi and prayed that the festival brings happiness to everyone’s life.
He wrote on his X handle,” May this festival bring new hope, happiness and abundance into your life. May we always celebrate the spirit of togetherness, gratitude and renewal.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also wished that the festival brings joy to everyone’s life.
“Heartiest greetings to all of you on the holy festival of Baisakhi. I wish that this festival of joy and enthusiasm brings happiness, prosperity and good health to everyone’s life,” he said.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the festival is a symbol of the country’s rich farming traditions.
He wrote in X (in Hindi, loosely translated as), “Heartiest congratulations to all the farmers, Sikh brothers and the people of the state on the auspicious festival of Baisakhi, a symbol of India’s rich farming traditions and glorious heritage! May this festival of joy and happiness, Baisakhi, bring prosperity and happiness to everyone’s life.”
Crowds of devotees on Sunday thronged gurdwaras across Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country to celebrate Baisakhi.
The Golden Temple in Amritsar, one of Sikhism’s holiest shrines, was tastefully decorated, and many devotees came to offer prayers. Many consider taking the holy dip in the Golden Temple sarovar as significant to mark the day. Some devotees even stayed overnight on the Golden Temple premises to take the dip in the early hours. Day-long langars (community kitchens) have been organised to mark the day.
Besides the Golden Temple, people took a holy dip in scores of historic gurdwaras across Punjab. A sea of devotees was also witnessed at the Takht Kesgarh Sahib in the holy city of Anandpur Sahib, where the Khalsa Panth was founded in 1699.

Title: PM Modi pays tributes to Jallianwala Bagh massacre martyrs
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:48:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to the lives lost in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as India commemorates the 106th anniversary of the dark day on Sunday.
The massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, when Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered British Indian Army troops to open fire on a peaceful gathering of thousands at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “We pay homage to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh. The coming generations will always remember their indomitable spirit. It was indeed a dark chapter in our nation’s history. Their sacrifice became a major turning point in India’s freedom struggle.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also commemorated the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, referring to it as “a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle”.
He highlighted that the brutality of British rule ignited widespread anger among Indians, transforming the freedom movement into a mass struggle.
“The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle that shook the entire country. The anger that arose among the countrymen due to the cruelty of the British rule, which had reached the pinnacle of inhumanity, turned the freedom movement into a struggle of the masses,” HM Shah wrote in a post on X.
“I pay my tribute to the martyrs who were martyred in Jallianwala Bagh. The country will always cherish the immortal martyrs in its memories,” he added.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also honoured the martyrs, referring to Jallianwala Bagh as a “sacred pilgrimage for all patriots”. He praised the bravery of those who sacrificed their lives.
Taking to the social media platform X, CM Yogi wrote in a post, “Millions of salutes to the immortal martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh! Jallianwala Bagh is a sacred pilgrimage for all patriots, where the brave sons of the motherland sacrificed their lives while resisting the barbarity of the British rule.”
“The sacrifice of the immortal revolutionaries of Jallianwala Bagh is the immortal saga of the self-respect and freedom of the nation, which will always inspire,” he added.
On April 13, 1919, women, children, and the elderly were going about their usual routines in the park, some resting after visiting the Golden Temple. A group of individuals staged a silent protest against the Rowlatt Act (also known as the Black Act), which allowed the British government to imprison anyone without a trial.
Without warning, the protestors were surrounded by the British forces. They opened fire on the people in the park, which only stopped when the soldiers nearly ran out of ammunition.
Although the exact number of casualties is still debated, official records estimate that at least 379 people were killed. However, other sources suggest the death toll may be over 1,000, with more than 1,500 individuals wounded. The incident sparked widespread outrage and intensified the Indian struggle for independence.
Today, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site, situated in Amritsar, Punjab and managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, has been turned into a garden and memorial.
Located near the Golden Temple complex, it serves to honour the memory of those who were killed and wounded in the massacre on April 13, 1919. The site features a museum, a gallery, and several memorial structures.

Title: Iran, US hold ‘positive’ talks in Oman, agree to resume next week
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:06:03 +0000
Content: Iran and the U.S. said they held “positive” and “constructive” talks in Oman on Saturday and agreed to reconvene next week in a dialogue meant to address Tehran’s escalating nuclear programme, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if there is no deal.
“I think we are very close to a basis for negotiations and if we can conclude this basis next week, we’ll have gone a long way and will be able to start real discussions based on that,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state television.
Araqchi said the talks – the first between Iran and a Trump administration, including his 2017-2021 first term – took place in a “productive, calm and positive atmosphere”.
“Both sides have agreed to continue the talks … probably next Saturday,” Araqchi added. “Iran and the U.S. side want an agreement in the short term. We do not want talks for (the sake of) talks.”
The White House called the talks involving Trump’s Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff, U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima and Araqchi “very positive and constructive.”
“These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” it said in a statement. “The sides agreed to meet again next Saturday.”
Asked about the talks, Trump told reporters on Saturday night: “I think they’re going OK.”
“Nothing matters until you get it done, so I don’t like talking about it, but it’s going OK. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said on Air Force One.
Trump made a surprise announcement on Monday that Washington and Tehran would begin talks in Oman, a Gulf state that has mediated between the West and the Islamic Republic before. It has brokered the release of several foreign citizens and dual nationals held by Iran.
BOTH SIDES FAR APART
Saturday’s exchanges were indirect and mediated by Oman, as Iran had wanted, rather than face-to-face, as Trump had demanded. Each delegation had its separate room and exchanged messages via Oman’s foreign minister, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei.
Araqchi said his delegation had a brief encounter with its U.S. counterpart headed by Witkoff, after they exited the talks.
“After the end of more than 2-1/2 hours of indirect talks, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks. It (the encounter) was based on our political etiquette,” Araqchi said.
“The current focus of the talks will be de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges and limited agreements to ease sanctions (against Iran) in exchange for controlling Iran’s nuclear programme,” an Omani source told Reuters.
Baghaei denied this account but did not specify what was false.
Trump, who in his first term withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 big-power accord with Tehran, has again brought a tougher approach to a Middle Eastern power whose nuclear programme Washington’s ally Israel regards as an existential threat.
At the same time, Iran and allied groups have been weakened by the military offensives Israel has launched across the region, including air strikes in Iran, during its war with Hamas after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza in October 2023.
Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international bodies in Vienna, called the statements issued by both sides after the talks “encouraging”.
Tehran approached the talks warily, sceptical they could yield a deal and suspicious of Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not halt its accelerating uranium enrichment programme – regarded by the West as a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.
While each side has talked up the chances of some progress, they remain far apart on a dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons capability, but Western countries and Israel believe it is covertly trying to develop the means to build an atomic bomb.
“This is a beginning. So it is normal at this stage for the two sides to present to each other their fundamental positions through the Omani intermediary,” Baghaei said.
Signs of progress could help cool tensions in a region aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, missile fire between Iran and Israel, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the overthrow of the government in Syria.
HIGH STAKES
However, failure would aggravate fears of a wider conflagration across a region that exports much of the world’s oil. Tehran has cautioned neighbouring countries that have U.S. bases that they would face “severe consequences” if they were involved in any U.S. military attack on the OPEC member.
“There is a chance for initial understanding on further negotiations if the other party (U.S.) enters the talks with an equal stance,” Araqchi told Iranian TV.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on key state matters, has given Araqchi “full authority” for the talks, an Iranian official told Reuters.
Iran has ruled out negotiating its defence capabilities such as its ballistic missile programme.
Western nations say Iran’s enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel source, has gone far beyond the requirements of a civilian energy programme and has produced stocks at a level of fissile purity close to those required in warheads.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers, including Russia and China, in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran’s nuclear programme has leaped forward, including by enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a technical step from the levels needed for a bomb.

Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:30:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah extended warm wishes on the occasion of Bohag Bihu in Assam.  
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Bohag Bihu wishes to you all!”
As Bohag or Rongali Bihu marks the beginning of the Assamese New Year, the Prime Minister also added, “May the new year bring new beginnings, happiness, and prosperity in all that you do. Praying for everyone’s good health and fulfilment of all aspirations.”
Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma thanked PM Modi for his wishes on Bihu.
In an X post, CM Sarma said, “Adarniya Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, thank you so much for your Bohag Bihu wishes. As the Assamese New Year is set to begin, we recall your many visits to Assam during this time and your celebrations with the people of the state.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also posted on X, saying, “Warm greetings to our sisters and brothers of Assam on the occasion of Bohag Bihu. May the joy of welcoming the Assamese New Year, vibrating on the banks of the Brahmaputra, invite prosperity and well-being for everyone.”
CM Sarma, while thanking HM Shah, wrote on his X handle, “Thank you so much for your wishes on Bohag Bihu, Adarniya Griha Mantri Shri @AmitShah ji. With your constant guidance, Assam is ringing in the New Year in an atmosphere of peace and prosperity.”
Rongali Bihu, or Bohag, the most cherished of the three Bihus, marks the Assamese New Year and the arrival of spring. It is more than just a festival — it’s an emotion deeply woven into the cultural soul of the people of Assam.
The state is gripped by Bihu fever, with people enthusiastically celebrating the festival on Monday. Across Assam, Bihu committees are organising grand functions — from traditional dance competitions to musical nights, where local artists and cultural icons will take center stage. Youth groups are rehearsing tirelessly, ready to set the stage ablaze with their energy and pride.
In the villages, the celebration remains rooted — rustic, warm, and full of life. The sound of laughter mingles with music as people come together to celebrate nature’s bounty, community spirit, and the timeless bond between humans and the land they call home.
Even in cities, where modern life rushes forward, Bihu brings everyone back to their roots. Offices and schools close for the festivities, and people return to their hometowns, drawn by the irresistible call of tradition, family, and celebration.

Title: Back to Russian gas? Trump-wary EU has energy security dilemma
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:04:43 +0000
Content: More than three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe’s energy security is fragile.
U.S. liquefied natural gas helped to plug the Russian supply gap in Europe during the 2022-2023 energy crisis.
But now that President Donald Trump has rocked relationships with Europe established after World War Two, and turned to energy as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, businesses are wary that reliance on the United States has become another vulnerability.
Against this backdrop, executives at major EU firms have begun to say what would have been unthinkable a year ago: that importing some Russian gas, including from Russian state giant Gazprom could be a good idea.
That would require another major policy shift given that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 made the European Union pledge to end Russian energy imports by 2027.
Europe has limited options. Talks with LNG giant Qatar for more gas have stalled, and while the deployment of renewables has accelerated, the rate is not fast enough to allow the EU to feel secure.
“If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60 billion cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG,” Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at France’s Engie, told Reuters in an interview.
The French state partly owns Engie, which used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.
GERMAN PIVOT
France, which produces large amounts of nuclear power, already has one of the most diversified energy supplies in Europe.
Germany relied heavily on cheap Russian gas to help drive its manufacturing sector until the Ukraine war and has fewer options.
In Leuna Chemical Park, one of Germany’s biggest chemical clusters hosting plants of Dow Chemical and Shell among others, some makers say Russian gas should return quickly.
Russia used to cover 60% of local needs, mainly through the Nord Stream pipeline, which was blown up in 2022.
“We are in a severe crisis and can’t wait,” said Christof Guenther, managing director of InfraLeuna, the operator of the park.
He said the German chemical industry has cut jobs for five quarters in a row, something not seen for decades.
“Reopening pipelines would reduce prices more than any current subsidy programmes,” he said.
“It’s a taboo topic,” Guenther added, saying many colleagues agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas.
Almost a third of Germans voted for Russia-friendly parties in the February federal election.
In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the east German region where the Nord Stream pipeline comes ashore after running from Russia under the Baltic Sea, 49% of Germans want a return to Russian gas supplies, a poll carried out by the Forsa Institute found.
“We need Russian gas, we need cheap energy – no matter where it comes from,” said Klaus Paur, managing director of Leuna-Harze, a mid-sized petrochemical maker at the Leuna Park. “We need Nord Stream 2 because we have to keep energy costs in check.”
The industry wants the federal government to find cheap energy, said Daniel Keller, economy minister for the state of Brandenburg – home to the Schwedt refinery, co-owned by Russian oil firm Rosneft but held in German government trusteeship.
“We can imagine resuming the intake or transport of Russian oil after peace is established in Ukraine,” Keller said.
TRUMP FACTOR
U.S. gas covered 16.7% of EU imports last year – behind Norway with 33.6% and Russia with 18.8%.
Russia’s share will drop below 10% this year after Ukraine shut pipelines. The remaining flows are mainly LNG from Novatek.
The EU is preparing to buy more U.S. LNG as Trump wants Europe to lower its trade surplus with the United States.
“For sure, we will need more LNG,” EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said last week.
The tariff war has strengthened Europe’s concern about reliance on U.S. gas, said Tatiana Mitrova, a research fellow at Columbia University’s Centre on Global Energy Policy.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to regard U.S. LNG as a neutral commodity: at a certain point it might become a geopolitical tool,” Mitrova added.
If the trade war escalates, there is a small risk the United States could hold back on LNG exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management.
A senior EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed, saying no one could rule out “that this leverage is used”.
In the event U.S. domestic gas prices surge because of rising industrial and AI demand, the U.S. could curtail exports to all markets, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, said.
In 2022, the EU set itself a non-binding goal to end Russian gas imports by 2027, but has twice delayed publishing plans on how. An EU Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the companies’ comments.
ARBITRATION
Several EU firms have opened arbitration cases against Gazprom for non-delivery of gas following the Ukraine war.
Courts awarded Germany’s Uniper and Austria’s OMV 14 billion euros and 230 million euros respectively. Germany’s RWE has claimed 2 billion euros, while Engie and other firms have not disclosed their claim.
Engie’s Holleaux said Kyiv could allow Russia to send gas via Ukraine to meet arbitration repayments as a starting point of resuming contractual relationships with Gazprom.
“You (Gazprom) want to come back to the market? Very good, but we won’t sign a new contract if you don’t pay the award,” Holleaux said.
The return of Russian gas worries Maxim Timchenko, the chief of DTEK, Ukraine’s private gas company, which hopes to import U.S. LNG into Ukraine’s storage and export it to Europe.
“It’s hard to comment, being Ukrainian, but my hope is that European politicians learned their lessons dealing with Russia,” Timchenko said. used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation for Rs 410 crore Hisar airport terminal; highlights rise in airports from 74 to over 150 since 2014
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:46:44 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday marked Ambedkar Jayanti by laying the foundation stone of the new terminal building at Maharaja Agrasen Airport in Hisar, Haryana, and flagging off the inaugural flight to Ayodhya.
Addressing a massive rally, the Prime Minister said that before 2014, India had just 74 airports. However, in the last decade, the number has crossed the 150 mark, highlighting significant progress in improving connectivity compared to the efforts of previous governments.
The launch of scheduled flights from Hisar — twice weekly to Ayodhya and thrice weekly to Jammu, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Chandigarh — represents a major boost to Haryana’s aviation network.
The new terminal project, valued at over Rs 410 crore, will include a modern passenger terminal, a dedicated cargo facility, and an air traffic control building.
The PM paid homage to Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, calling it a “Diwali” for Dalits, and for the marginalised and backward communities.
“Your soldiers, sportsmen, and brotherhood are the identity of Haryana,” he said, thanking the crowd for their enthusiastic participation.
Reflecting on his early political journey in the state, PM Modi said, “All the people who worked with me — their hard work laid the foundation for the BJP in Haryana. Today, I am proud that Haryana is working seriously towards fulfilling the resolve of a Viksit Bharat.”
Reaffirming the BJP’s commitment to inclusive growth, PM Modi added, “The BJP’s mantra is to work for the rapid development of all Dalits, the poor, the marginalised, and backward communities in Haryana. In line with this mantra, flights have now started from the holy land of Shri Krishna’s Haryana to Lord Ram’s Ayodhya.”
Calling the foundation stone of the airport terminal a symbol of Haryana’s aspirations, he congratulated the people and said, “I had promised you that people wearing slippers would also take flight. Today, we are witnessing this promise being fulfilled across the country.”
He highlighted the success of the Centre’s UDAN scheme, which has enabled thousands of Indians to fly for the first time.
“Before 2014, the country had just 74 airports. Today, the number has crossed the 150 mark,” PM Modi reiterated, underlining the impact of the UDAN Yojana (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), which aims to boost regional connectivity and make air travel more accessible and affordable.
Later in the day, PM Modi will travel to Yamuna Nagar to inaugurate and lay foundation stones for more development projects and interact with the public.
As part of efforts to enhance power infrastructure and ensure last-mile electricity access, PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for an 800 MW thermal power unit at the Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Plant. Spread across 233 acres and costing around Rs 8,470 crore, the project is expected to strengthen Haryana’s energy security and ensure uninterrupted power supply.
Furthering the GOBARDhan initiative (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan), the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for a Compressed Biogas Plant in Mukarabpur, Yamuna Nagar.
The plant, with a projected annual output of 2,600 metric tonnes, aims to enhance organic waste management, generate clean energy, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
Additionally, PM Modi will inaugurate the Rewari Bypass project — a 14.4 km corridor built at a cost of Rs 1,070 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The new bypass will ease congestion in Rewari City, reduce Delhi–Narnaul travel time by nearly an hour, and help boost regional economic and social development.

Title: China’s March exports jump in temporary boost as Trump 2.0 heaps pressure
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:09:31 +0000
Content: China’s exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect, but an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war has darkened the outlook for factories and growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods to hefty levels that many economists say will profoundly impact global trade flows and business investment.
Exports rose 12.4% year-on-year, a five-month high, handily beating the 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Exports grew 2.3% in January-February.
Trade uncertainties have rocked financial markets this month after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on many countries on April 2. Trump unexpectedly paused the higher duties on a dozen economies days later, but slapped even stiffer levies on China that Beijing has dismissed as “a joke”.
Economists warn the March export figures will be eclipsed by a fast-deteriorating outlook.
“Export growth accelerated in March, as manufacturers rushed to ship goods to the U.S. ahead of ‘Liberation Day’,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
“But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” he added.
“We think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.”
Trump levied 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports into the United States, effective on February 4, and followed that up with another 10% in March, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
Washington’s fresh round of tariffs lifts duties on China to an eye-watering 145%, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on U.S. goods by 125% in an intensifying trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Monday data also highlighted a soft underbelly in domestic demand in China, meaning policymakers will have their work cut out in trying to guard against any sharp trade downturn.
Inbound shipments fell 4.3%, compared with a 2.0% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll, and an unexpectedly steep contraction of 8.4% at the start of the year.
Markets in China were up modestly, but much of the activity was linked to mixed messages from Trump over the weekend regarding exemptions on smartphones and other electronics. China’s blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.3%.
FIGHT TO THE END
Beijing has vowed to fight U.S tariffs to the end and protect the economy from “external shocks”, with markets widely expecting authorities to roll out further fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in coming months to underpin growth.
Exports have been a lone bright spot in China’s economy, which has struggled to mount a solid post-COVID recovery as confidence has remained low in the face of a protracted property crisis and deepening deflationary pressures.
President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments on the tariffs, told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing on Friday that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Xi kicked off a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, aiming to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours amid the tariff disruptions.
The World Trade Organization has warned the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade row could cut the shipment of goods between the two economies by as much as 80% and severely hurt global growth.
Goldman Sachs last week lowered its forecasts for China’s 2025 GDP growth to 4% from 4.5%, citing the effects of tariffs. Citi cut its forecast to 4.2% from 4.7% two days earlier. Their revised forecasts are well below the government’s growth target of “around 5%.”
China’s export industry is facing a complex and severe external environment, customs official Lv Daliang said on Monday.
“China is actively building a diversified market and deepening production and supply chain cooperation with all parties,” he told a regular press briefing.
Mounting trade pressure and a dwindling U.S. consumer base have also prompted Chinese exporters to assess domestic opportunities
TRADE IMBALANCE?
China’s March trade surplus was $102.64 billion, down slightly from $104.8 billion in December, the most recent comparable reading.
More importantly, China’s trade surplus with the United States in the first quarter came in at $76.6 billion, up from $70.2 billion a year earlier.
This will likely keep the production powerhouse in Trump’s sights given that improving the trade gap is at the top of his agenda.
Commodities data showed while Chinese imports of crude oil rose in March, those of soybeans, coal, iron ore and unwrought copper dropped.
Imports from the United States may have already been affected by the trade spat.
China’s total soybean imports tumbled by 36.8% in March year-on-year.
“China seems to stop its farming imports from the U.S. altogether already,” said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“Its soybean imports tumbled by around half in March during a high season of China-U.S. farming trade, perhaps because state-owned importers already received the guidance to stop imports,” he said.

Title: Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya leads ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna with over 6,000 youth volunteers
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:37:06 +0000
Content: In a powerful tribute to the legacy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports and Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya led the ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna, Bihar, on Sunday. The event witnessed the participation of over 6,000 MY Bharat Youth Volunteers and was flagged off by Bihar Legislative Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav.
Organized as part of a nationwide initiative by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the padayatra celebrated Babasaheb’s contributions to social justice, equality, and constitutional values, while also mobilizing youth engagement for building a “Viksit Bharat.”
Addressing the gathering, Dr. Mandaviya called upon India’s youth to take inspiration from Dr. Ambedkar’s vision. “As the sun rose over Patna, it illuminated not just a statue but a spirit — a renewed commitment to Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals and a Viksit Bharat led by its most powerful force, its youth,” he said.
The Union Minister emphasized the pioneering role of Dr. Ambedkar in advocating equal rights for women as early as 1947 — a time when gender equality was scarcely recognized globally. He urged the youth to take a solemn sankalp (pledge) to uphold the ideals of national icons and align themselves with the Panch Pran vision articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a strong, inclusive, and self-reliant India.
Jai Bhim Padyatras were held simultaneously across all state capitals and 5,000 locations nationwide. MY Bharat volunteers participated in mass cleanliness drives, cleaned statues of Dr. Ambedkar, and reaffirmed their commitment to constitutional values through collective readings of the Preamble.
The event in Patna was further enlivened with cultural performances, patriotic songs dedicated to Dr. Ambedkar, and active community service. Volunteers were seen picking up litter and distributing refreshments along the route, showcasing civic responsibility and the spirit of service.
The padyatra concluded near the Patna High Court, where Dr. Mandaviya, along with other dignitaries including Bihar’s Deputy Chief Ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and former Union Minister and Patna MP, paid floral tributes to Dr. Ambedkar and participated in a cleanliness drive.
In Mumbai, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse also took part in the padayatra, amplifying the message of unity and national participation.

Title: Trump in excellent health, cholesterol well controlled, says White House physician
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:31:35 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump remains in excellent health and his high cholesterol is “well controlled,” White House physician U.S. Navy Captain Sean Barbella said in a report released on Sunday, two days after Trump underwent a routine physical.
The report is the most detailed information on the health of Trump, 78, since he returned to the White House in January as the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency.
“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” Barbella wrote in his report.
The report noted that Trump has a history of “well-controlled” high cholesterol and is taking two medications to address it.
The report also noted that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last year.
The report said his hearing was normal.
Trump’s campaign released a report after the assassination attempt last year concluding the injuries were superficial.
“It went, I think, well. …Every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday after the exam. “I think I did well.”
Barbella’s report also references Trump’s history with COVID-19. Trump was hospitalized during a serious bout with the virus in October 2020 during his run for reelection.
It noted that Trump takes two medications to control cholesterol — rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, generic names of the branded drugs Crestor and Zetia — and uses a mometasone cream to control rosacea, a condition that can cause redness in the face, as well as aspirin.
VACCINES UP TO DATE
It also mentions that Trump has received all recommended vaccines. Trump has in the past spread debunked claims about links between vaccines and autism often mentioned by his Health Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy has also cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines during a large, ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, contrary to established science, but has also said the vaccine is the best way to prevent the virus’ spread.
Trump told reporters he took a cognitive test because he wanted to “be a little different” than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, now 82.
Trump scored 30 out of 30 on the test, known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Barbella’s report noted.
Trump sought to draw a contrast with Biden during his presidential campaign last year, portraying himself as younger and fitter. A disastrous debate performance from Biden last year raised questions about his acuity and ultimately forced him from the presidential race.
Biden’s doctors repeatedly deemed him fit to serve, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental fitness in his final months in the White House.
Barbella’s report on Trump concludes that his “active lifestyle” contributes to his health, referencing daily meetings, press events and “frequent victories in golf events.”

Title: Newcastle United extend winning streak to five with 4-1 thumping of Man United
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:01:34 +0000
Content: Harvey Barnes struck twice in the second half as Newcastle United extended their winning streak to five with a commanding 4-1 win over Manchester United at St. James’ Park on Sunday. 
Led by assistants Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones in the absence of Eddie Howe—who was hospitalised on Friday—the Magpies started brightly and dominated from the outset. Sandro Tonali gave the hosts a deserved lead with a superb volley after Alexander Isak’s delicate lofted assist. Despite their dominance, Newcastle were pegged back late in the first half which started when Manuel Ugarte won the ball well in midfield and invited Diogo Dalot to charge forward. The right wing-back timed the release of his pass to Garnacho well, and the Argentina international slotted past Pope and into the far corner of the net.
 
But the second half belonged entirely to Newcastle. Just three minutes after the restart, Tino Livramento’s deep cross was kept alive by Jacob Murphy, whose sharp cutback was finished with precision by Barnes for his first. Barnes then added his second on 64 minutes when Noussair Mazraoui slipped over in possession but Barnes didn’t hesitate, picking up the ball and shifting through the gears. His run took him right through the middle of the Manchester United centre halves and his attempt rocketed into the top right-hand corner
Newcastle never let up. Manchester United, managed by Ruben Amorim, offered little in response after falling behind. The final blow came in the closing stages when Altay Bayındır’s misplaced pass was seized upon by Joelinton, who teed up Bruno Guimarães to slot home Newcastle’s fourth.
Despite an initial equaliser, United were outplayed and outfought. They now sit 14th in the Premier League table, while Newcastle’s fifth straight win propels them into the top four, intensifying their Champions League push.

Title: IPL 2025: Virat Kohli and Phil Salt’s fifties power RCB to 9-wicket win against RR
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:48:18 +0000
Content: A clinical all-round performance from Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), led by explosive fifties from Phil Salt and Virat Kohli, sealed a dominant nine-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their IPL 2025 clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday.
Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, RCB restricted RR to 173/4, despite a fluent 75 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and a crucial unbeaten 35 from Dhruv Jurel. RCB chased down the target in just 17.3 overs, thanks to a blistering start from Salt and an anchoring knock by Kohli.
RCB’s Run Chase: A Power-Packed Start
Openers Phil Salt and Virat Kohli gave RCB a flying start, adding 65 runs in the powerplay. Salt led the assault, smashing 46 runs off just 23 balls in the first six overs. He brought up his half-century in the eighth over and continued to dominate until he was dismissed for a quickfire 65 off 33 balls by Kumar Kartikeya. His innings included five fours and six towering sixes.
After Salt’s departure in the ninth over, Devdutt Padikkal joined Kohli and the duo carried forward the momentum. Kohli played a measured knock, rotating the strike and punishing loose deliveries. He brought up his third fifty of the season – and 100th in T20s – with a classy straight six off Wanindu Hasaranga in the 15th over.
Padikkal accelerated in the final stretch, scoring 40 off 28 balls, while Kohli remained unbeaten on 62 off 45 deliveries. Their unbeaten 83-run stand for the second wicket guided RCB to 174/1 in 17.3 overs.
RR’s Innings: Jaiswal Stands Tall Amid Inconsistency
Earlier, RR openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson gave the hosts a steady start, finishing the powerplay at 45/0. However, Samson struggled for fluency and was dismissed for a sluggish 15 off 19 balls by Krunal Pandya in the seventh over.
Jaiswal, unfazed at the other end, anchored the innings with fluent stroke play. Partnering with Riyan Parag, he brought up his second fifty of the season in the 13th over. The duo added a 50-run stand before Parag fell for 30 (22) in the 14th over to Yash Dayal.
Trying to accelerate, Jaiswal perished in the 16th over for 75 off 47 balls, laced with ten fours and two sixes. Dhruv Jurel (35* off 23) finished strong alongside Shimron Hetmyer (6), helping RR reach a competitive 173/4.
Bowling and Fielding Highlights
RCB’s bowlers shared the wickets, with Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, and Yash Dayal taking one each. Suyash Sharma was unlucky, finishing wicketless despite beating the bat often. RCB’s fielding was below par, marked by seven misfields and multiple dropped catches, including a sitter by Virat Kohli.
For RR, only Kumar Kartikeya (1/25) managed to strike with the ball. The rest of the bowling unit was put to the sword by the in-form RCB batters.
Brief Scores:
Rajasthan Royals: 173/4 (Yashasvi Jaiswal 75, Dhruv Jurel 35*; Krunal Pandya 1/29)
Royal Challengers Bengaluru: 174/1 in 17.3 overs (Phil Salt 65, Virat Kohli 62*; Kumar Kartikeya 1/25)
Result: RCB won by 9 wickets
Player of the Match: Phil Salt

Title: Delhi’s unbeaten IPL run ends after a hat-trick of run-outs v Mumbai
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:19:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Capitals suffered their first defeat of the new Indian Premier League season on Sunday after Mumbai Indians eked out a 12-run victory to rekindle their fading hopes of making the playoffs.
Karun Nair led Delhi’s pursuit of 206 with a scintillating 89 but once he departed, the wheels came off their innings and the Capitals were all out for 193 – losing their last three wickets to a hat-trick of run-outs in a bizarre finish.
Delhi, who had won four matches in a row, are now behind table-toppers Gujarat Titans on run rate, though the Capitals have played one match fewer.
Five-time champions Mumbai climbed to seventh place after their second win in six matches.
Earlier, former captain Rohit Sharma’s lean run continued but Tilak Varma’s breezy half-century provided the bedrock of Mumbai’s strong 205-5 after being put into bat at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
Mumbai lost Rohit (18) in the powerplay but Ryan Rickelton (41) and Suryakumar Yadav (40) ensured they did not completely surrender the momentum.
Delhi spinner Kuldeep Yadav removed both the batters but Varma smashed 59 off 33 balls, three of which went soaring over the boundary rope, before falling in the final over of their innings.
Naman Dhir made a quickfire 38 not out as Mumbai posted their second 200-plus total this season.
Delhi lost opener Jake Fraser-McGurk to the first ball of their chase but Nair, brought in as the Impact Player, tore into the Mumbai attack during his 119-run second wicket stand with Abishek Porel (33).
Leg-spinner Karn Sharma’s three wickets dragged Mumbai back into the contest and Mitchell Santner claimed two to turn the match on its head.
Delhi needed 23 from the last two overs with three wickets in hand but Ashutosh Sharma, Kuldeep, and Mohit Sharma were run out in the last three balls of the penultimate over from Jasprit Bumrah.
Earlier in Jaipur, Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Rajasthan Royals by nine wickets to climb to third place following their fourth win in six matches.

Title: Stock markets closed on April 14 for Ambedkar Jayanti
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:13:45 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets are closed on Monday on account of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti, which commemorates the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, born on April 14, 1891.
Every year, this day is observed as a public holiday across the country. Schools, banks, and several government offices remain closed in honour of the social reformer and architect of the Indian Constitution.
Indian equity markets ended the past week with gains after a very volatile start.  
The week began with a sharp sell-off on Monday, as global markets reacted negatively to the U.S. government’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs. This move sparked fears of a trade war and triggered panic among investors. The situation worsened when China responded with its own set of retaliatory measures, further impacting investor sentiment worldwide.
However, markets managed to recover some ground after the U.S. decided to defer the implementation of tariffs for all countries except China. This move brought some relief to global markets, including India, and led to a rebound in stock prices in the following sessions.
Last Friday, the Sensex closed at 75,157.26 points, up 1,310.11 points or 1.77 per cent, while the Nifty closed at 22,828.55 points, up 429.40 points or 1.92 per cent. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, Consumer Durables, and Oil & Gas were the top movers.
On the domestic front, Indian indices also received a boost from the Reserve Bank of India’s recent policy announcement. The central bank not only cut interest rates but also adopted a dovish stance, indicating that further support could be provided if necessary. This decision was welcomed by investors and helped cushion earlier losses.
