Title: Ukraine says 21 killed by Russian ballistic missile strike on Sumy
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:06:41 +0000
Content: At least 21 people were killed and 83 others were wounded by a Russian ballistic missile strike in the heart of the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday morning, Ukraine’s interior minister Ihor Klymenko said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the attack – one of the deadliest strikes on Ukraine this year – and called for a tough international reaction against Moscow.
“Only scoundrels can act like this. Taking the lives of ordinary people,” he wrote on social media, alongside a chilling video which showed corpses on the ground, a destroyed bus and burnt-out cars in the middle of a city street.
“And this is on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s Entry into Jerusalem,” Zelenskiy said.
Interior minister Klymenko said the victims were on the street, in vehicles, public transport and in buildings when the strike hit.
“Deliberate destruction of civilians on an important church feast day,” he wrote.
Reuters was seeking comment from Russian authorities.
Andriy Kovalenko, a security official who runs Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, noted that the strike came after a visit to Moscow by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Russia is building all this so-called diplomacy … around strikes on civilians,” he wrote on Telegram.
Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in St. Petersburg on the search for a Ukraine peace deal, as Trump told Russia to “get moving”.
In the aftermath of Sunday’s strike, Zelenskiy called on the U.S. and Europe to get tough on Russia in response to what he described as terrorism.
“Russia wants exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out this war. Without pressure on the aggressor, peace is impossible. Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs,” he wrote.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently holds about 20% of the country’s territory in the east and south. Russian forces have been slowly advancing in the east of late, though missile and drone strikes now dominate the war.
Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine had carried out five attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the previous day in what it called a violation of a U.S.-brokered moratorium on such strikes.
Ukraine and Russia agreed to pause strikes on each other’s energy facilities last month, but both sides have repeatedly accused each other of breaking the moratorium.

Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:46:20 +0000
Content: Homes were flooded and roads turned into muddy rivers after torrential rainfall over the Spanish Canary Island of Lanzarote, a popular year-round tourist destination.
A state of emergency was declared after 6 cm (2.4 inches) of rain fell in two hours on Saturday, emergency services said on Sunday.
Dramatic video footage showed a surge of brown flood water streaming under a bridge while bystanders took pictures and cars were stuck on flooded roads.
Enrique Espinosa, head of emergency services for the Lanzarote government, said some homes had been submerged.
“We have been working all night, attending 300 calls overnight, many of them in Arrecife and Teguise. Some houses are flooded and what remains is a great quantity of mud,” Espinosa told RTVE state television on Sunday.
No one has been injured in the flooding, authorities said.

Title: Sundays on Cycle: India pedals forward with over 300 events nationwide on April 13
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:42:28 +0000
Content: India witnessed yet another vibrant edition of the ‘Fit India Sundays on Cycle’, with over 300 events conducted simultaneously across the country. Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, Sports, flagged off the national capital’s edition at New Moti Bagh, energising the crowd and reinforcing the national momentum towards fitness.
Communities, athletes, police departments, and residents across the nation pedalled with purpose, celebrating fitness, fun, and environmental awareness under the campaign led by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.
New Moti Bagh Club played host to an energetic rally with around 350 residents from various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) pedalling in unison. Sunday’s event, a collaboration between local RWAs and Fit India, focused on fighting obesity and encouraging healthier habits among city dwellers.
Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, sports, joined the event and encouraged the enthusiastic crowd. She spoke about the momentum Fit India has gained over time.
She said, “Fit India is a nationwide popular movement. It has seen many different kinds of activities and is gaining popularity across all sections of society. As we speak, lakhs of people have already joined Sundays on Cycle across the country.
“Today alone, about 300 events are taking place. We also had the Fit India carnival in JLN Stadium, which was mentioned in the Honourable Prime Minister’s Mann ki Baat. All these efforts are creating the right kind of environment for fitness and wellness in India,” she said.
The event also featured special guests including Nitesh Siwach, a Greco-Roman wrestler, who recently clinched a bronze medal in the 97 kg category at the 2025 Asian Wrestling Championships in Amman, Jordan, and Rohtash Choudhary, popularly known as the ‘Push-Up Man of India,’ who holds multiple Guinness World Records, including performing 645 push-ups in one hour while carrying a 60 lb pack with one leg raised.
Nitesh Siwach praised the increasing awareness among people on improving their health.
“Fitness is an integral part of our lives. Mental and physical fitness is our true wealth. It is really good to see initiatives like these where people are coming together to cycle, and are in general becoming conscious about better health. I’m glad Fit India is doing this, and I hope it keeps growing,” he told SAI Media.
At SAI RC Imphal, renowned Indian weightlifter and Padma Shri awardee Kunjarani Devi flagged off the cycling rally, lending her support to the fitness cause. Her presence inspired hundreds to take the pledge toward healthier living and cleaner cities.

Title: India’s semiconductor industry likely to double revenue to $108 bn by 2030: Report
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 10:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian semiconductor industry’s revenues are likely to double from $54 billion to $108 billion between 2025 to 2030, according to a report by financial services firm UBS.
The report expects India to gain amid the US-China tariff war that will put the communist giant at a disadvantage and see India emerging as a stronger alternative for global giants looking to set up supply chains.
The report sees strong growth ahead for the market, including a localisation opportunity, which is expected to generate $13 billion in revenues in 2030.
UBS said this 15 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) estimate is faster than our forecast for the global semiconductor end market thanks to India’s favourable demographics fuelling strong electronics demand (and in turn semiconductors), rising enterprise adoption of advanced semiconductors, and favourable government policies.
India accounts for only 0.1 per cent of global wafer capacity, around 1 per cent of annual equipment spending, and a 6.5 per cent semiconductor end-demand share, the report states.
According to the report, major tech companies are evaluating the relocation of their supply chains amid the ongoing tariff uncertainties triggered by the Donald Trump administration in the US.
A few companies have already embarked on their “China plus one” strategy by diversifying their final assembly locations beyond China, the report points out.
India’s tech advantage lies mostly in its vast talent pool in the software and services industry, whereas mainland China’s dominance is in tech manufacturing.
In semiconductors, too, India has a unique advantage, with around 20 per cent of global chip designers working in the country for multinational corporations, the report points out.
Despite these uncertainties, the US and mainland China are the top end-markets. India, at 6.5 per cent, is a solid end market for global semiconductors, with $54 billion in revenues in 2025, the report added.

Title: India, Nepal agree on joint steps to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:51:41 +0000
Content: India and Nepal have decided to strengthen measures to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency notes and other goods such as e-cigarettes, according to a statement issued by the Finance Ministry on Sunday.
The issue was discussed at the 21st Director-General level talks on Customs Cooperation held between the two countries in Kathmandu on April 10-11. The Indian delegation was led by Abhai Kumar Srivastav, Director-General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Department of Revenue, while the Nepali delegation was led by Mahesh Bhattarai, Director-General, Department of Customs, Nepal.
It was acknowledged that smuggling of goods has been a common challenge, and both sides looked forward towards cooperation in preventing smuggling across the borders with active engagement and exchange of intelligence. Both nations agreed to take necessary measures to control the unauthorised trade and work in tandem.
Nepal is a priority partner of India under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy. India accounts for two-thirds of Nepal’s exports and is the largest trade partner of Nepal. The bilateral talks on Customs cooperation are an important mechanism to facilitate genuine trade as well as to prevent illicit trade along the border in an interconnected world.
The meeting also reviewed progress on MoU on Pre-arrival Exchange of Customs Data and Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES); finalisation of Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA); facilitation of movement of transit cargo under Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS); automation and digitisation of transit processes; upgradation of border infrastructure; knowledge sharing program and support for capacity development, among others.
Both sides emphasised on collaborating in areas that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and customs operations across the border that deliver significant economic benefits to both countries. It was mutually agreed to consider new technologies for facilitating trade and preventing smuggling of goods.
The meeting concluded on an optimistic note. The Nepali side expressed their gratitude to the Government of India, particularly the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), for knowledge sharing and capacity enhancement programmes for Nepal Customs officials at different levels, the statement added.

Title: WHO members close to accord on tackling future pandemics
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:14:53 +0000
Content: Members of the World Health Organization are close to a deal on a treaty to prepare for future pandemics, sources involved in the talks told Reuters on Saturday, with a WHO spokesperson saying discussions had been paused until Tuesday.
The pact, which has been arduously negotiated for three years and which would be legally binding, is intended to shore up the world’s defences against new pathogens after the COVID-19 pandemic killed millions of people in 2020-22.
“They (the talks) went overnight until 9 a.m. (Saturday) but didn’t manage to resolve the final issues,” one source involved in the discussions in Geneva said.
A diplomatic source in Geneva added that “big advancement was made … almost all the treaty was agreed upon with few outstanding yet crucial issues”.
The talks missed a key deadline last year despite several rounds of late-night talks.
The negotiating body’s co-chair had earlier told the AFP news agency that it had reached an agreement “in principle”.
The United States, which was slow to join the early talks, left the discussions this year after new President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February withdrawing from the WHO and barring participation in the talks.
The other 192 members of the WHO who joined the discussions would be free to ratify the deal or not after it is formally adopted.
One of the most contentious issues between wealthy countries and developing states is how to share drugs and vaccines fairly to avoid the mistakes of the COVID era.
The negotiations have been vexed throughout by allegations from right-wing commentators, including in the U.S. but also Britain and Australia, that they could undermine national sovereignty by giving too much power to a U.N. agency.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rejects such assertions, and says the accord would help countries better guard against pandemic outbreaks.
This week in Geneva, a small group of campaigners protested against the talks with one holding up a sign with a fanged snake uncoiling itself from the WHO symbol, with the motto: “WHO ARE YOU TO TAKE AWAY MY FREEDOMS?!”
The agreement, if finalised, would be a historic victory for the global health agency. Only once in the WHO’s 75-year history have its member countries agreed to a treaty – a tobacco control accord in 2003.

Title: Irish regulator investigates X over use of EU personal data to train Grok AI
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 07:24:02 +0000
Content: Ireland’s data regulator on Saturday said it had opened an investigation into social media platform X over the use of personal data collected from European Union users to train its AI system Grok.
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is the lead EU regulator for X due to the location of its EU operations in the country. It has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue under the EU’s strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The inquiry will look at “the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models,” the DPC said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have criticised EU regulation of U.S. companies and described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation.
X owner Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a top adviser to Trump, has also railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content.
The decision follows a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems.
X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent. The Irish regulator ended its court proceedings weeks later, saying X had agreed the limits on a permanent basis.
The powerful Irish privacy regulator has fined the likes of Microsoft’s  LinkedIn, TikTok and Meta  since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018. Its fines to date of Meta total almost 3 billion euros.
X, or Twitter as it was then called, has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020, the first penalty the regulator handed out under the new data privacy system.

Title: ‘May this festival bring new hope, happiness’, Prez Murmu, PM Modi extend greetings on Baisakhi
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 06:11:38 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the nation on the occasion of Baisakhi, saying that the festival would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the nation’s development.
Baisakhi, one of the biggest festivals marks the foundation day of the Khalsa Panth (Sikh order) by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, and also the start of the harvest season.
President Murmu, in a post on X, extended her heartfelt greetings to all Indians living in India and abroad.
The day is also celebrated in different parts of the country as Vishu, Bohag Bihu, Poila Boishakh, Meshadi, Vaishakhadi and Puthandu Pirapu, she said.
“These festivals celebrated at the time of harvest in various parts of India symbolise our social traditions and unity in diversity. Through these festivals we honour the hard work of our ‘Annadata’ farmers and express our gratitude to them. These festivals also give the message of preserving nature and protecting our cultural legacy,” President Murmu said in her post.
She hoped that these vibrant festivals would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the development of our nation.
Prime Minister Modi wished everyone a joyous Baisakhi and prayed that the festival brings happiness to everyone’s life.
He wrote on his X handle,” May this festival bring new hope, happiness and abundance into your life. May we always celebrate the spirit of togetherness, gratitude and renewal.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also wished that the festival brings joy to everyone’s life.
“Heartiest greetings to all of you on the holy festival of Baisakhi. I wish that this festival of joy and enthusiasm brings happiness, prosperity and good health to everyone’s life,” he said.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the festival is a symbol of the country’s rich farming traditions.
He wrote in X (in Hindi, loosely translated as), “Heartiest congratulations to all the farmers, Sikh brothers and the people of the state on the auspicious festival of Baisakhi, a symbol of India’s rich farming traditions and glorious heritage! May this festival of joy and happiness, Baisakhi, bring prosperity and happiness to everyone’s life.”
Crowds of devotees on Sunday thronged gurdwaras across Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country to celebrate Baisakhi.
The Golden Temple in Amritsar, one of Sikhism’s holiest shrines, was tastefully decorated, and many devotees came to offer prayers. Many consider taking the holy dip in the Golden Temple sarovar as significant to mark the day. Some devotees even stayed overnight on the Golden Temple premises to take the dip in the early hours. Day-long langars (community kitchens) have been organised to mark the day.
Besides the Golden Temple, people took a holy dip in scores of historic gurdwaras across Punjab. A sea of devotees was also witnessed at the Takht Kesgarh Sahib in the holy city of Anandpur Sahib, where the Khalsa Panth was founded in 1699.

Title: PM Modi pays tributes to Jallianwala Bagh massacre martyrs
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:48:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to the lives lost in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as India commemorates the 106th anniversary of the dark day on Sunday.
The massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, when Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered British Indian Army troops to open fire on a peaceful gathering of thousands at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “We pay homage to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh. The coming generations will always remember their indomitable spirit. It was indeed a dark chapter in our nation’s history. Their sacrifice became a major turning point in India’s freedom struggle.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also commemorated the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, referring to it as “a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle”.
He highlighted that the brutality of British rule ignited widespread anger among Indians, transforming the freedom movement into a mass struggle.
“The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle that shook the entire country. The anger that arose among the countrymen due to the cruelty of the British rule, which had reached the pinnacle of inhumanity, turned the freedom movement into a struggle of the masses,” HM Shah wrote in a post on X.
“I pay my tribute to the martyrs who were martyred in Jallianwala Bagh. The country will always cherish the immortal martyrs in its memories,” he added.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also honoured the martyrs, referring to Jallianwala Bagh as a “sacred pilgrimage for all patriots”. He praised the bravery of those who sacrificed their lives.
Taking to the social media platform X, CM Yogi wrote in a post, “Millions of salutes to the immortal martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh! Jallianwala Bagh is a sacred pilgrimage for all patriots, where the brave sons of the motherland sacrificed their lives while resisting the barbarity of the British rule.”
“The sacrifice of the immortal revolutionaries of Jallianwala Bagh is the immortal saga of the self-respect and freedom of the nation, which will always inspire,” he added.
On April 13, 1919, women, children, and the elderly were going about their usual routines in the park, some resting after visiting the Golden Temple. A group of individuals staged a silent protest against the Rowlatt Act (also known as the Black Act), which allowed the British government to imprison anyone without a trial.
Without warning, the protestors were surrounded by the British forces. They opened fire on the people in the park, which only stopped when the soldiers nearly ran out of ammunition.
Although the exact number of casualties is still debated, official records estimate that at least 379 people were killed. However, other sources suggest the death toll may be over 1,000, with more than 1,500 individuals wounded. The incident sparked widespread outrage and intensified the Indian struggle for independence.
Today, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site, situated in Amritsar, Punjab and managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, has been turned into a garden and memorial.
Located near the Golden Temple complex, it serves to honour the memory of those who were killed and wounded in the massacre on April 13, 1919. The site features a museum, a gallery, and several memorial structures.

Title: Iran, US hold ‘positive’ talks in Oman, agree to resume next week
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:06:03 +0000
Content: Iran and the U.S. said they held “positive” and “constructive” talks in Oman on Saturday and agreed to reconvene next week in a dialogue meant to address Tehran’s escalating nuclear programme, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if there is no deal.
“I think we are very close to a basis for negotiations and if we can conclude this basis next week, we’ll have gone a long way and will be able to start real discussions based on that,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state television.
Araqchi said the talks – the first between Iran and a Trump administration, including his 2017-2021 first term – took place in a “productive, calm and positive atmosphere”.
“Both sides have agreed to continue the talks … probably next Saturday,” Araqchi added. “Iran and the U.S. side want an agreement in the short term. We do not want talks for (the sake of) talks.”
The White House called the talks involving Trump’s Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff, U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima and Araqchi “very positive and constructive.”
“These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” it said in a statement. “The sides agreed to meet again next Saturday.”
Asked about the talks, Trump told reporters on Saturday night: “I think they’re going OK.”
“Nothing matters until you get it done, so I don’t like talking about it, but it’s going OK. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said on Air Force One.
Trump made a surprise announcement on Monday that Washington and Tehran would begin talks in Oman, a Gulf state that has mediated between the West and the Islamic Republic before. It has brokered the release of several foreign citizens and dual nationals held by Iran.
BOTH SIDES FAR APART
Saturday’s exchanges were indirect and mediated by Oman, as Iran had wanted, rather than face-to-face, as Trump had demanded. Each delegation had its separate room and exchanged messages via Oman’s foreign minister, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei.
Araqchi said his delegation had a brief encounter with its U.S. counterpart headed by Witkoff, after they exited the talks.
“After the end of more than 2-1/2 hours of indirect talks, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks. It (the encounter) was based on our political etiquette,” Araqchi said.
“The current focus of the talks will be de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges and limited agreements to ease sanctions (against Iran) in exchange for controlling Iran’s nuclear programme,” an Omani source told Reuters.
Baghaei denied this account but did not specify what was false.
Trump, who in his first term withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 big-power accord with Tehran, has again brought a tougher approach to a Middle Eastern power whose nuclear programme Washington’s ally Israel regards as an existential threat.
At the same time, Iran and allied groups have been weakened by the military offensives Israel has launched across the region, including air strikes in Iran, during its war with Hamas after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza in October 2023.
Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international bodies in Vienna, called the statements issued by both sides after the talks “encouraging”.
Tehran approached the talks warily, sceptical they could yield a deal and suspicious of Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not halt its accelerating uranium enrichment programme – regarded by the West as a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.
While each side has talked up the chances of some progress, they remain far apart on a dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons capability, but Western countries and Israel believe it is covertly trying to develop the means to build an atomic bomb.
“This is a beginning. So it is normal at this stage for the two sides to present to each other their fundamental positions through the Omani intermediary,” Baghaei said.
Signs of progress could help cool tensions in a region aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, missile fire between Iran and Israel, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the overthrow of the government in Syria.
HIGH STAKES
However, failure would aggravate fears of a wider conflagration across a region that exports much of the world’s oil. Tehran has cautioned neighbouring countries that have U.S. bases that they would face “severe consequences” if they were involved in any U.S. military attack on the OPEC member.
“There is a chance for initial understanding on further negotiations if the other party (U.S.) enters the talks with an equal stance,” Araqchi told Iranian TV.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on key state matters, has given Araqchi “full authority” for the talks, an Iranian official told Reuters.
Iran has ruled out negotiating its defence capabilities such as its ballistic missile programme.
Western nations say Iran’s enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel source, has gone far beyond the requirements of a civilian energy programme and has produced stocks at a level of fissile purity close to those required in warheads.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers, including Russia and China, in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran’s nuclear programme has leaped forward, including by enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a technical step from the levels needed for a bomb.

Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:30:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah extended warm wishes on the occasion of Bohag Bihu in Assam.  
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Bohag Bihu wishes to you all!”
As Bohag or Rongali Bihu marks the beginning of the Assamese New Year, the Prime Minister also added, “May the new year bring new beginnings, happiness, and prosperity in all that you do. Praying for everyone’s good health and fulfilment of all aspirations.”
Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma thanked PM Modi for his wishes on Bihu.
In an X post, CM Sarma said, “Adarniya Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, thank you so much for your Bohag Bihu wishes. As the Assamese New Year is set to begin, we recall your many visits to Assam during this time and your celebrations with the people of the state.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also posted on X, saying, “Warm greetings to our sisters and brothers of Assam on the occasion of Bohag Bihu. May the joy of welcoming the Assamese New Year, vibrating on the banks of the Brahmaputra, invite prosperity and well-being for everyone.”
CM Sarma, while thanking HM Shah, wrote on his X handle, “Thank you so much for your wishes on Bohag Bihu, Adarniya Griha Mantri Shri @AmitShah ji. With your constant guidance, Assam is ringing in the New Year in an atmosphere of peace and prosperity.”
Rongali Bihu, or Bohag, the most cherished of the three Bihus, marks the Assamese New Year and the arrival of spring. It is more than just a festival — it’s an emotion deeply woven into the cultural soul of the people of Assam.
The state is gripped by Bihu fever, with people enthusiastically celebrating the festival on Monday. Across Assam, Bihu committees are organising grand functions — from traditional dance competitions to musical nights, where local artists and cultural icons will take center stage. Youth groups are rehearsing tirelessly, ready to set the stage ablaze with their energy and pride.
In the villages, the celebration remains rooted — rustic, warm, and full of life. The sound of laughter mingles with music as people come together to celebrate nature’s bounty, community spirit, and the timeless bond between humans and the land they call home.
Even in cities, where modern life rushes forward, Bihu brings everyone back to their roots. Offices and schools close for the festivities, and people return to their hometowns, drawn by the irresistible call of tradition, family, and celebration.

Title: Back to Russian gas? Trump-wary EU has energy security dilemma
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:04:43 +0000
Content: More than three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe’s energy security is fragile.
U.S. liquefied natural gas helped to plug the Russian supply gap in Europe during the 2022-2023 energy crisis.
But now that President Donald Trump has rocked relationships with Europe established after World War Two, and turned to energy as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, businesses are wary that reliance on the United States has become another vulnerability.
Against this backdrop, executives at major EU firms have begun to say what would have been unthinkable a year ago: that importing some Russian gas, including from Russian state giant Gazprom could be a good idea.
That would require another major policy shift given that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 made the European Union pledge to end Russian energy imports by 2027.
Europe has limited options. Talks with LNG giant Qatar for more gas have stalled, and while the deployment of renewables has accelerated, the rate is not fast enough to allow the EU to feel secure.
“If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60 billion cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG,” Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at France’s Engie, told Reuters in an interview.
The French state partly owns Engie, which used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.
GERMAN PIVOT
France, which produces large amounts of nuclear power, already has one of the most diversified energy supplies in Europe.
Germany relied heavily on cheap Russian gas to help drive its manufacturing sector until the Ukraine war and has fewer options.
In Leuna Chemical Park, one of Germany’s biggest chemical clusters hosting plants of Dow Chemical and Shell among others, some makers say Russian gas should return quickly.
Russia used to cover 60% of local needs, mainly through the Nord Stream pipeline, which was blown up in 2022.
“We are in a severe crisis and can’t wait,” said Christof Guenther, managing director of InfraLeuna, the operator of the park.
He said the German chemical industry has cut jobs for five quarters in a row, something not seen for decades.
“Reopening pipelines would reduce prices more than any current subsidy programmes,” he said.
“It’s a taboo topic,” Guenther added, saying many colleagues agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas.
Almost a third of Germans voted for Russia-friendly parties in the February federal election.
In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the east German region where the Nord Stream pipeline comes ashore after running from Russia under the Baltic Sea, 49% of Germans want a return to Russian gas supplies, a poll carried out by the Forsa Institute found.
“We need Russian gas, we need cheap energy – no matter where it comes from,” said Klaus Paur, managing director of Leuna-Harze, a mid-sized petrochemical maker at the Leuna Park. “We need Nord Stream 2 because we have to keep energy costs in check.”
The industry wants the federal government to find cheap energy, said Daniel Keller, economy minister for the state of Brandenburg – home to the Schwedt refinery, co-owned by Russian oil firm Rosneft but held in German government trusteeship.
“We can imagine resuming the intake or transport of Russian oil after peace is established in Ukraine,” Keller said.
TRUMP FACTOR
U.S. gas covered 16.7% of EU imports last year – behind Norway with 33.6% and Russia with 18.8%.
Russia’s share will drop below 10% this year after Ukraine shut pipelines. The remaining flows are mainly LNG from Novatek.
The EU is preparing to buy more U.S. LNG as Trump wants Europe to lower its trade surplus with the United States.
“For sure, we will need more LNG,” EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said last week.
The tariff war has strengthened Europe’s concern about reliance on U.S. gas, said Tatiana Mitrova, a research fellow at Columbia University’s Centre on Global Energy Policy.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to regard U.S. LNG as a neutral commodity: at a certain point it might become a geopolitical tool,” Mitrova added.
If the trade war escalates, there is a small risk the United States could hold back on LNG exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management.
A senior EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed, saying no one could rule out “that this leverage is used”.
In the event U.S. domestic gas prices surge because of rising industrial and AI demand, the U.S. could curtail exports to all markets, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, said.
In 2022, the EU set itself a non-binding goal to end Russian gas imports by 2027, but has twice delayed publishing plans on how. An EU Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the companies’ comments.
ARBITRATION
Several EU firms have opened arbitration cases against Gazprom for non-delivery of gas following the Ukraine war.
Courts awarded Germany’s Uniper and Austria’s OMV 14 billion euros and 230 million euros respectively. Germany’s RWE has claimed 2 billion euros, while Engie and other firms have not disclosed their claim.
Engie’s Holleaux said Kyiv could allow Russia to send gas via Ukraine to meet arbitration repayments as a starting point of resuming contractual relationships with Gazprom.
“You (Gazprom) want to come back to the market? Very good, but we won’t sign a new contract if you don’t pay the award,” Holleaux said.
The return of Russian gas worries Maxim Timchenko, the chief of DTEK, Ukraine’s private gas company, which hopes to import U.S. LNG into Ukraine’s storage and export it to Europe.
“It’s hard to comment, being Ukrainian, but my hope is that European politicians learned their lessons dealing with Russia,” Timchenko said. used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation for Rs 410 crore Hisar airport terminal; highlights rise in airports from 74 to over 150 since 2014
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:46:44 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday marked Ambedkar Jayanti by laying the foundation stone of the new terminal building at Maharaja Agrasen Airport in Hisar, Haryana, and flagging off the inaugural flight to Ayodhya.
Addressing a massive rally, the Prime Minister said that before 2014, India had just 74 airports. However, in the last decade, the number has crossed the 150 mark, highlighting significant progress in improving connectivity compared to the efforts of previous governments.
The launch of scheduled flights from Hisar — twice weekly to Ayodhya and thrice weekly to Jammu, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Chandigarh — represents a major boost to Haryana’s aviation network.
The new terminal project, valued at over Rs 410 crore, will include a modern passenger terminal, a dedicated cargo facility, and an air traffic control building.
The PM paid homage to Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, calling it a “Diwali” for Dalits, and for the marginalised and backward communities.
“Your soldiers, sportsmen, and brotherhood are the identity of Haryana,” he said, thanking the crowd for their enthusiastic participation.
Reflecting on his early political journey in the state, PM Modi said, “All the people who worked with me — their hard work laid the foundation for the BJP in Haryana. Today, I am proud that Haryana is working seriously towards fulfilling the resolve of a Viksit Bharat.”
Reaffirming the BJP’s commitment to inclusive growth, PM Modi added, “The BJP’s mantra is to work for the rapid development of all Dalits, the poor, the marginalised, and backward communities in Haryana. In line with this mantra, flights have now started from the holy land of Shri Krishna’s Haryana to Lord Ram’s Ayodhya.”
Calling the foundation stone of the airport terminal a symbol of Haryana’s aspirations, he congratulated the people and said, “I had promised you that people wearing slippers would also take flight. Today, we are witnessing this promise being fulfilled across the country.”
He highlighted the success of the Centre’s UDAN scheme, which has enabled thousands of Indians to fly for the first time.
“Before 2014, the country had just 74 airports. Today, the number has crossed the 150 mark,” PM Modi reiterated, underlining the impact of the UDAN Yojana (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), which aims to boost regional connectivity and make air travel more accessible and affordable.
Later in the day, PM Modi will travel to Yamuna Nagar to inaugurate and lay foundation stones for more development projects and interact with the public.
As part of efforts to enhance power infrastructure and ensure last-mile electricity access, PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for an 800 MW thermal power unit at the Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Plant. Spread across 233 acres and costing around Rs 8,470 crore, the project is expected to strengthen Haryana’s energy security and ensure uninterrupted power supply.
Furthering the GOBARDhan initiative (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan), the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for a Compressed Biogas Plant in Mukarabpur, Yamuna Nagar.
The plant, with a projected annual output of 2,600 metric tonnes, aims to enhance organic waste management, generate clean energy, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
Additionally, PM Modi will inaugurate the Rewari Bypass project — a 14.4 km corridor built at a cost of Rs 1,070 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The new bypass will ease congestion in Rewari City, reduce Delhi–Narnaul travel time by nearly an hour, and help boost regional economic and social development.

Title: China’s March exports jump in temporary boost as Trump 2.0 heaps pressure
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:09:31 +0000
Content: China’s exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect, but an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war has darkened the outlook for factories and growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods to hefty levels that many economists say will profoundly impact global trade flows and business investment.
Exports rose 12.4% year-on-year, a five-month high, handily beating the 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Exports grew 2.3% in January-February.
Trade uncertainties have rocked financial markets this month after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on many countries on April 2. Trump unexpectedly paused the higher duties on a dozen economies days later, but slapped even stiffer levies on China that Beijing has dismissed as “a joke”.
Economists warn the March export figures will be eclipsed by a fast-deteriorating outlook.
“Export growth accelerated in March, as manufacturers rushed to ship goods to the U.S. ahead of ‘Liberation Day’,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
“But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” he added.
“We think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.”
Trump levied 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports into the United States, effective on February 4, and followed that up with another 10% in March, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
Washington’s fresh round of tariffs lifts duties on China to an eye-watering 145%, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on U.S. goods by 125% in an intensifying trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Monday data also highlighted a soft underbelly in domestic demand in China, meaning policymakers will have their work cut out in trying to guard against any sharp trade downturn.
Inbound shipments fell 4.3%, compared with a 2.0% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll, and an unexpectedly steep contraction of 8.4% at the start of the year.
Markets in China were up modestly, but much of the activity was linked to mixed messages from Trump over the weekend regarding exemptions on smartphones and other electronics. China’s blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.3%.
FIGHT TO THE END
Beijing has vowed to fight U.S tariffs to the end and protect the economy from “external shocks”, with markets widely expecting authorities to roll out further fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in coming months to underpin growth.
Exports have been a lone bright spot in China’s economy, which has struggled to mount a solid post-COVID recovery as confidence has remained low in the face of a protracted property crisis and deepening deflationary pressures.
President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments on the tariffs, told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing on Friday that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Xi kicked off a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, aiming to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours amid the tariff disruptions.
The World Trade Organization has warned the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade row could cut the shipment of goods between the two economies by as much as 80% and severely hurt global growth.
Goldman Sachs last week lowered its forecasts for China’s 2025 GDP growth to 4% from 4.5%, citing the effects of tariffs. Citi cut its forecast to 4.2% from 4.7% two days earlier. Their revised forecasts are well below the government’s growth target of “around 5%.”
China’s export industry is facing a complex and severe external environment, customs official Lv Daliang said on Monday.
“China is actively building a diversified market and deepening production and supply chain cooperation with all parties,” he told a regular press briefing.
Mounting trade pressure and a dwindling U.S. consumer base have also prompted Chinese exporters to assess domestic opportunities
TRADE IMBALANCE?
China’s March trade surplus was $102.64 billion, down slightly from $104.8 billion in December, the most recent comparable reading.
More importantly, China’s trade surplus with the United States in the first quarter came in at $76.6 billion, up from $70.2 billion a year earlier.
This will likely keep the production powerhouse in Trump’s sights given that improving the trade gap is at the top of his agenda.
Commodities data showed while Chinese imports of crude oil rose in March, those of soybeans, coal, iron ore and unwrought copper dropped.
Imports from the United States may have already been affected by the trade spat.
China’s total soybean imports tumbled by 36.8% in March year-on-year.
“China seems to stop its farming imports from the U.S. altogether already,” said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“Its soybean imports tumbled by around half in March during a high season of China-U.S. farming trade, perhaps because state-owned importers already received the guidance to stop imports,” he said.

Title: Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya leads ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna with over 6,000 youth volunteers
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:37:06 +0000
Content: In a powerful tribute to the legacy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports and Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya led the ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna, Bihar, on Sunday. The event witnessed the participation of over 6,000 MY Bharat Youth Volunteers and was flagged off by Bihar Legislative Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav.
Organized as part of a nationwide initiative by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the padayatra celebrated Babasaheb’s contributions to social justice, equality, and constitutional values, while also mobilizing youth engagement for building a “Viksit Bharat.”
Addressing the gathering, Dr. Mandaviya called upon India’s youth to take inspiration from Dr. Ambedkar’s vision. “As the sun rose over Patna, it illuminated not just a statue but a spirit — a renewed commitment to Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals and a Viksit Bharat led by its most powerful force, its youth,” he said.
The Union Minister emphasized the pioneering role of Dr. Ambedkar in advocating equal rights for women as early as 1947 — a time when gender equality was scarcely recognized globally. He urged the youth to take a solemn sankalp (pledge) to uphold the ideals of national icons and align themselves with the Panch Pran vision articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a strong, inclusive, and self-reliant India.
Jai Bhim Padyatras were held simultaneously across all state capitals and 5,000 locations nationwide. MY Bharat volunteers participated in mass cleanliness drives, cleaned statues of Dr. Ambedkar, and reaffirmed their commitment to constitutional values through collective readings of the Preamble.
The event in Patna was further enlivened with cultural performances, patriotic songs dedicated to Dr. Ambedkar, and active community service. Volunteers were seen picking up litter and distributing refreshments along the route, showcasing civic responsibility and the spirit of service.
The padyatra concluded near the Patna High Court, where Dr. Mandaviya, along with other dignitaries including Bihar’s Deputy Chief Ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and former Union Minister and Patna MP, paid floral tributes to Dr. Ambedkar and participated in a cleanliness drive.
In Mumbai, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse also took part in the padayatra, amplifying the message of unity and national participation.

Title: Trump in excellent health, cholesterol well controlled, says White House physician
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:31:35 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump remains in excellent health and his high cholesterol is “well controlled,” White House physician U.S. Navy Captain Sean Barbella said in a report released on Sunday, two days after Trump underwent a routine physical.
The report is the most detailed information on the health of Trump, 78, since he returned to the White House in January as the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency.
“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” Barbella wrote in his report.
The report noted that Trump has a history of “well-controlled” high cholesterol and is taking two medications to address it.
The report also noted that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last year.
The report said his hearing was normal.
Trump’s campaign released a report after the assassination attempt last year concluding the injuries were superficial.
“It went, I think, well. …Every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday after the exam. “I think I did well.”
Barbella’s report also references Trump’s history with COVID-19. Trump was hospitalized during a serious bout with the virus in October 2020 during his run for reelection.
It noted that Trump takes two medications to control cholesterol — rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, generic names of the branded drugs Crestor and Zetia — and uses a mometasone cream to control rosacea, a condition that can cause redness in the face, as well as aspirin.
VACCINES UP TO DATE
It also mentions that Trump has received all recommended vaccines. Trump has in the past spread debunked claims about links between vaccines and autism often mentioned by his Health Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy has also cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines during a large, ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, contrary to established science, but has also said the vaccine is the best way to prevent the virus’ spread.
Trump told reporters he took a cognitive test because he wanted to “be a little different” than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, now 82.
Trump scored 30 out of 30 on the test, known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Barbella’s report noted.
Trump sought to draw a contrast with Biden during his presidential campaign last year, portraying himself as younger and fitter. A disastrous debate performance from Biden last year raised questions about his acuity and ultimately forced him from the presidential race.
Biden’s doctors repeatedly deemed him fit to serve, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental fitness in his final months in the White House.
Barbella’s report on Trump concludes that his “active lifestyle” contributes to his health, referencing daily meetings, press events and “frequent victories in golf events.”

Title: Newcastle United extend winning streak to five with 4-1 thumping of Man United
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:01:34 +0000
Content: Harvey Barnes struck twice in the second half as Newcastle United extended their winning streak to five with a commanding 4-1 win over Manchester United at St. James’ Park on Sunday. 
Led by assistants Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones in the absence of Eddie Howe—who was hospitalised on Friday—the Magpies started brightly and dominated from the outset. Sandro Tonali gave the hosts a deserved lead with a superb volley after Alexander Isak’s delicate lofted assist. Despite their dominance, Newcastle were pegged back late in the first half which started when Manuel Ugarte won the ball well in midfield and invited Diogo Dalot to charge forward. The right wing-back timed the release of his pass to Garnacho well, and the Argentina international slotted past Pope and into the far corner of the net.
 
But the second half belonged entirely to Newcastle. Just three minutes after the restart, Tino Livramento’s deep cross was kept alive by Jacob Murphy, whose sharp cutback was finished with precision by Barnes for his first. Barnes then added his second on 64 minutes when Noussair Mazraoui slipped over in possession but Barnes didn’t hesitate, picking up the ball and shifting through the gears. His run took him right through the middle of the Manchester United centre halves and his attempt rocketed into the top right-hand corner
Newcastle never let up. Manchester United, managed by Ruben Amorim, offered little in response after falling behind. The final blow came in the closing stages when Altay Bayındır’s misplaced pass was seized upon by Joelinton, who teed up Bruno Guimarães to slot home Newcastle’s fourth.
Despite an initial equaliser, United were outplayed and outfought. They now sit 14th in the Premier League table, while Newcastle’s fifth straight win propels them into the top four, intensifying their Champions League push.

Title: IPL 2025: Virat Kohli and Phil Salt’s fifties power RCB to 9-wicket win against RR
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:48:18 +0000
Content: A clinical all-round performance from Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), led by explosive fifties from Phil Salt and Virat Kohli, sealed a dominant nine-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their IPL 2025 clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday.
Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, RCB restricted RR to 173/4, despite a fluent 75 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and a crucial unbeaten 35 from Dhruv Jurel. RCB chased down the target in just 17.3 overs, thanks to a blistering start from Salt and an anchoring knock by Kohli.
RCB’s Run Chase: A Power-Packed Start
Openers Phil Salt and Virat Kohli gave RCB a flying start, adding 65 runs in the powerplay. Salt led the assault, smashing 46 runs off just 23 balls in the first six overs. He brought up his half-century in the eighth over and continued to dominate until he was dismissed for a quickfire 65 off 33 balls by Kumar Kartikeya. His innings included five fours and six towering sixes.
After Salt’s departure in the ninth over, Devdutt Padikkal joined Kohli and the duo carried forward the momentum. Kohli played a measured knock, rotating the strike and punishing loose deliveries. He brought up his third fifty of the season – and 100th in T20s – with a classy straight six off Wanindu Hasaranga in the 15th over.
Padikkal accelerated in the final stretch, scoring 40 off 28 balls, while Kohli remained unbeaten on 62 off 45 deliveries. Their unbeaten 83-run stand for the second wicket guided RCB to 174/1 in 17.3 overs.
RR’s Innings: Jaiswal Stands Tall Amid Inconsistency
Earlier, RR openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson gave the hosts a steady start, finishing the powerplay at 45/0. However, Samson struggled for fluency and was dismissed for a sluggish 15 off 19 balls by Krunal Pandya in the seventh over.
Jaiswal, unfazed at the other end, anchored the innings with fluent stroke play. Partnering with Riyan Parag, he brought up his second fifty of the season in the 13th over. The duo added a 50-run stand before Parag fell for 30 (22) in the 14th over to Yash Dayal.
Trying to accelerate, Jaiswal perished in the 16th over for 75 off 47 balls, laced with ten fours and two sixes. Dhruv Jurel (35* off 23) finished strong alongside Shimron Hetmyer (6), helping RR reach a competitive 173/4.
Bowling and Fielding Highlights
RCB’s bowlers shared the wickets, with Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, and Yash Dayal taking one each. Suyash Sharma was unlucky, finishing wicketless despite beating the bat often. RCB’s fielding was below par, marked by seven misfields and multiple dropped catches, including a sitter by Virat Kohli.
For RR, only Kumar Kartikeya (1/25) managed to strike with the ball. The rest of the bowling unit was put to the sword by the in-form RCB batters.
Brief Scores:
Rajasthan Royals: 173/4 (Yashasvi Jaiswal 75, Dhruv Jurel 35*; Krunal Pandya 1/29)
Royal Challengers Bengaluru: 174/1 in 17.3 overs (Phil Salt 65, Virat Kohli 62*; Kumar Kartikeya 1/25)
Result: RCB won by 9 wickets
Player of the Match: Phil Salt

Title: Delhi’s unbeaten IPL run ends after a hat-trick of run-outs v Mumbai
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:19:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Capitals suffered their first defeat of the new Indian Premier League season on Sunday after Mumbai Indians eked out a 12-run victory to rekindle their fading hopes of making the playoffs.
Karun Nair led Delhi’s pursuit of 206 with a scintillating 89 but once he departed, the wheels came off their innings and the Capitals were all out for 193 – losing their last three wickets to a hat-trick of run-outs in a bizarre finish.
Delhi, who had won four matches in a row, are now behind table-toppers Gujarat Titans on run rate, though the Capitals have played one match fewer.
Five-time champions Mumbai climbed to seventh place after their second win in six matches.
Earlier, former captain Rohit Sharma’s lean run continued but Tilak Varma’s breezy half-century provided the bedrock of Mumbai’s strong 205-5 after being put into bat at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
Mumbai lost Rohit (18) in the powerplay but Ryan Rickelton (41) and Suryakumar Yadav (40) ensured they did not completely surrender the momentum.
Delhi spinner Kuldeep Yadav removed both the batters but Varma smashed 59 off 33 balls, three of which went soaring over the boundary rope, before falling in the final over of their innings.
Naman Dhir made a quickfire 38 not out as Mumbai posted their second 200-plus total this season.
Delhi lost opener Jake Fraser-McGurk to the first ball of their chase but Nair, brought in as the Impact Player, tore into the Mumbai attack during his 119-run second wicket stand with Abishek Porel (33).
Leg-spinner Karn Sharma’s three wickets dragged Mumbai back into the contest and Mitchell Santner claimed two to turn the match on its head.
Delhi needed 23 from the last two overs with three wickets in hand but Ashutosh Sharma, Kuldeep, and Mohit Sharma were run out in the last three balls of the penultimate over from Jasprit Bumrah.
Earlier in Jaipur, Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Rajasthan Royals by nine wickets to climb to third place following their fourth win in six matches.

Title: Stock markets closed on April 14 for Ambedkar Jayanti
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:13:45 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets are closed on Monday on account of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti, which commemorates the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, born on April 14, 1891.
Every year, this day is observed as a public holiday across the country. Schools, banks, and several government offices remain closed in honour of the social reformer and architect of the Indian Constitution.
Indian equity markets ended the past week with gains after a very volatile start.  
The week began with a sharp sell-off on Monday, as global markets reacted negatively to the U.S. government’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs. This move sparked fears of a trade war and triggered panic among investors. The situation worsened when China responded with its own set of retaliatory measures, further impacting investor sentiment worldwide.
However, markets managed to recover some ground after the U.S. decided to defer the implementation of tariffs for all countries except China. This move brought some relief to global markets, including India, and led to a rebound in stock prices in the following sessions.
Last Friday, the Sensex closed at 75,157.26 points, up 1,310.11 points or 1.77 per cent, while the Nifty closed at 22,828.55 points, up 429.40 points or 1.92 per cent. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, Consumer Durables, and Oil & Gas were the top movers.
On the domestic front, Indian indices also received a boost from the Reserve Bank of India’s recent policy announcement. The central bank not only cut interest rates but also adopted a dovish stance, indicating that further support could be provided if necessary. This decision was welcomed by investors and helped cushion earlier losses.

Title: Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 comes into effect, marking major reforms in higher education
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:06:39 +0000
Content: The Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 has come into effect in the State, following the assent of the Governor of Odisha, Dr. Haribabu Kambhampati.
The Bill was passed on April 2, after extensive deliberation in the Odisha Assembly. With the Governor’s approval on April 12, the Act is now in force throughout the state, marking a significant reform in Odisha’s higher education system.
Expressing his gratitude to the Governor, Odisha Minister Suryabanshi Suraj described this development as a “new dawn” for higher education in the state. He emphasized that the Act will bring transformative changes aimed at strengthening the education system, addressing longstanding challenges, and enhancing academic excellence.
“The Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 has been designed to address long-standing challenges in the state’s higher education domain. It aims to bring about substantial reforms, ensuring autonomy for universities and enhancing the efficiency of academic functions,” Minister Suraj stated.
One of the key reforms introduced through the implementation of the Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 is that universities will no longer depend on the Odisha Public Service Commission (OPSC) to hire teachers. Instead, each university will form its own committee of education experts to carry out the recruitment process. This will help complete the process within a fixed timeframe and ensure that the selected teachers meet the specific needs of different subjects and courses.
The selection process for Vice-Chancellors has also been revised. A three-member committee comprising respected educationists will be formed to choose new Vice-Chancellors. The age limit for holding this post has been raised from 67 to 70 years, allowing more experienced academic leaders to take charge.
Another important step is the reintroduction of the Senate in universities. The Senate is the top advisory body that helps guide a university’s development. It will have 68 members, including teachers, educationists, students, and staff. Each university must hold at least two Senate meetings every year, providing a platform for all stakeholders to participate in important decisions.
To build a strong and inclusive education system, the government is also focusing on improving the teacher-student ratio, introducing distance education in every university to reach more students, and increasing the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER).
For better financial management, universities will have Finance Committees and Building and Construction Committees to monitor funds and infrastructure projects. All university finances will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, and reports will be submitted to the Odisha Legislative Assembly.

Title: “Votebank ka virus”: PM Modi slams Congress for opposing Waqf Act, promises end to land misuse
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:59:27 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took a dig at Congress, accusing it of fostering vote bank politics by opposing the recently amended Waqf Act. 
Addressing a public rally in Hisar, the Prime Minister alleged that the Congress had long treated Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) as second-class citizens, while neglecting the principles of equality championed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.
“Congress has become the destroyer of the Constitution,” PM Modi declared. “Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a nation where the poor and backward could live with dignity and pursue their dreams. But Congress spread the virus of vote bank politics, betraying that vision.”
He further claimed that under Congress rule, basic banking services were out of reach for marginalized communities. “During their time, banks wouldn’t even open their doors for SCs, STs, and OBCs. Loans and welfare schemes were mere fantasies. Today, the majority of beneficiaries under the Jan Dhan Yojana are from these very communities,” he said.
Turning his focus to the Waqf Board, the Prime Minister criticized what he described as large-scale mismanagement and misuse of land meant for community welfare.  
“There are lakhs of hectares of land under Waqf, yet the poor never benefitted from it. Instead, land mafias thrived. This will end with the amended Waqf Act,” he said. “Under the new provisions, no land or property belonging to Adivasis can be claimed by the Waqf Board. This is a step toward genuine social justice. Poor and Pasmanda Muslims will now receive what is rightfully theirs.”
PM Modi also accused Congress of attempting to erase Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy, alleging that the party actively worked against him during his lifetime.  
“Congress humiliated Babasaheb, made him lose elections twice, and tried to erase his contribution. While Dr. Ambedkar was a protector of the Constitution, Congress has repeatedly acted as its destroyer,” he said.
Highlighting achievements under his government, the Prime Minister contrasted his administration’s development initiatives with what he described as decades of Congress neglect.  
“While Congress leaders lived in luxury with swimming pools, only 16 out of every 100 village households had piped water connections. In just six to seven years, we’ve provided clean drinking water to over 12 crore rural households. Today, 80 percent of rural homes have tap water, and we’re working to achieve 100 percent coverage.”
He also reiterated his party’s commitment to a Uniform Civil Code, referencing its implementation in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand.
“The Constitution calls for one civil code for all citizens—a truly secular code. Congress never had the courage to implement it. But we have, and Congress continues to oppose it,” he asserted.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi flagged off the first direct commercial flight from Hisar Airport to Ayodhya and laid the foundation stone for a new terminal at Hisar Airport. Several other developmental projects were also inaugurated during the event.

Title: AICTE forms expert committee to integrate AI across all academic streams
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:58:11 +0000
Content: In a significant step toward transforming technical education in India, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has constituted an expert committee to facilitate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Applied AI across diverse academic programmes beyond traditional computer science degrees.
The committee is chaired by Anand Deshpande, Managing Director of Persistent Systems, and includes AI experts from IITs, NITs, and other leading institutions. The move is aimed at promoting lateral expansion of AI in streams such as BBA, BCA, electrical engineering, and other disciplines.
“We are forming a committee to introduce AI laterally across all programmes, especially Applied AI,” said AICTE Chairman Prof. TG Sitharam. “The idea is to spread AI and related curricula across streams so that every student—regardless of discipline—gains foundational knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and data analytics.”
AICTE, India’s apex regulatory body for technical education, has already revised curricula for several programmes to incorporate AI elements. “We have created new curricula for BBA and BCA and introduced AI in electrical engineering. Our goal is that everyone should understand AI and data analytics,” Sitharam added.
Recognizing the crucial role of educators, AICTE has also prioritised faculty training to support the effective rollout of AI-focused modules. “Our teachers need to be trained not only in teaching AI but also in adapting to how AI is changing the learning environment—like how students now submit AI-generated assignments. We need to evolve the way we frame questions and evaluate learning,” the Chairman said.
In line with its vision, AICTE has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Artificial Intelligence’, launching a range of initiatives to raise awareness and build capacity. The ambitious plan aims to bring AI education to over 14,000 colleges and 40 million students across India. Key components of the initiative include AI awareness campaigns, faculty development programmes, and collaborations with top technology firms.
AICTE follows a structured curriculum revision process every two years, engaging with expert panels to update academic frameworks in line with emerging technologies. “Curriculum revision is a detailed exercise involving expert consultation. We repeat this process every two years to ensure relevance,” Sitharam noted.
With this strategic push, AICTE aims to make India’s technical education system future-ready, equipping students across disciplines with the skills needed for an AI-driven world.

Title: Blue Origin to fly Katy Perry to edge of space with all-female crew
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:37:35 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry, along with five other women, is set to make history by traveling to the edge of space on Monday evening aboard Jeff Bezos’ aerospace venture Blue Origin’s tourist mission.
The six-member crew is scheduled to lift off on the company’s reusable New Shepard rocket — NS-31 — from Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:30 a.m. CDT (7:00 p.m. IST).
This marks the 11th human flight to suborbital space by Blue Origin. The journey will last approximately 11 minutes and reach beyond the Kármán line — the internationally recognized boundary of space.
“I’ve dreamt of going to space for 15 years, and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality,” Perry shared in a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video.
“I am so honoured to be alongside five other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first-ever all-female flight space crew!” she added.
In the video, Perry offered fans a sneak peek inside her space capsule and hinted at a musical performance during the flight.
“I think I’m gonna sing — I’ve got to sing in space,” she said.
Joining Perry on the mission are Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sanchez.
“This is the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo spaceflight in 1963,” Blue Origin stated.
Perry, one of the best-selling music artists of all time, is also known for her philanthropic efforts. Flynn is a film producer and philanthropist, while King and Sanchez are award-winning journalists.
Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist, will become the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman to travel to space.
Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and the CEO of STEMBoard, an engineering firm, is expected to conduct three research experiments, including studies on plant biology and human physiology — advancing her mission to explore space for the benefit of Earth.
This will be Blue Origin’s second mission of the year. To date, the company has flown 52 people beyond the Kármán line.

Title: Explained: What is Type-5 diabetes? Why the malnutrition-induced condition is back?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:15:59 +0000
Content: While blood sugar cases are significantly soaring worldwide, a lesser-known malnutrition-related form of diabetes — designated as Type-5 diabetes – is gaining global attention after decades.
Nearly 75 years after being first recorded, the condition that previously remained undefined was designated as Type- 5 diabetes at the recently held International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) World Diabetes Congress in Bangkok, Thailand.
The condition, occurring often in young and thin adults, was first reported in Jamaica in 1955, and then defined as J-type diabetes.
In the 1960s, the condition was reported in undernourished populations across India, Pakistan, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
While in 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the condition as a distinct form of diabetes, it removed the designation in 1999 as there were no proper follow-up studies and supporting evidence.
What is Type-5 diabetes?
It is a malnutrition-related diabetes, typically affecting lean and malnourished teenagers and young adults in low- and middle-income countries.
Type 5 diabetes is estimated to affect 20-to-25 million people worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Earlier findings had suggested that malnutrition-related diabetes stemmed from insulin resistance.
However, insulin injections, as in Type 1 diabetes patients, will not benefit these patients. In some cases, it can cause dangerously low blood sugar.
It is because “people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn’t recognised before. This finding has revolutionised how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” said Meredith Hawkins, Professor of Medicine at the Global Diabetes Institute at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, US.
In a 2022 study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, Hawkins, and her colleagues at Christian Medical College in Vellore, demonstrated that malnutrition-related diabetes is fundamentally different from Type-2 diabetes, typically, caused by obesity, and Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease.
However, the expert noted that “doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis”.
To better understand the condition and develop treatments, the IDF has constituted a working group.
What will the working group do?
According to Hawkins, the condition has “historically been vastly under-diagnosed and poorly understood”.
She said that “malnutrition-related diabetes is more common than tuberculosis and nearly as common as HIV/AIDS”.
“The lack of an official name has hindered efforts to diagnose patients or find effective therapies,” Hawkins said.
The working group has been tasked to develop formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 diabetes over the next two years.
It will define diagnostic criteria and develop guidelines for the management of the disease. It will also establish a global registry to facilitate research collaborations and develop education modules to train healthcare professionals worldwide.

Title: Centre issues draft rules for gas meters under Legal Metrology Act to ensure accuracy, consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:42:24 +0000
Content: In a major move to enhance consumer protection and promote fair trade practices, the Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, has released draft rules for gas meters under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011. The new framework mandates that all gas meters used for domestic, commercial, and industrial purposes undergo testing, verification, and stamping before being deployed for trade or commerce.
According to an official statement from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, the proposed rules also require periodic re-verification of gas meters in use to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
The key objective behind the draft is to foster accuracy, transparency, and accountability in gas measurement. Verified and stamped meters will help prevent overcharging, under-measurement, and billing disputes, thus safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring fair billing. This initiative is also expected to lead to improved energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs for consumers, thanks to standardized and compliant devices.
The draft rules set out a structured compliance framework for manufacturers and gas distribution companies, aligning with international best practices and OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology) standards. The move is seen as a step toward bolstering India’s global trade credibility and encouraging innovation and quality assurance in domestic manufacturing.
The Legal Metrology Division, responsible for maintaining the accuracy of weights and measures, adopted a comprehensive and consultative approach to frame the rules. A technical committee comprising representatives from the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Regional Reference Standard Laboratories (RRSLs), industry experts, and Voluntary Consumer Organizations (VCOs) helped shape the draft. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) also reviewed the draft and provided scientific and technical inputs.
To ensure inclusive stakeholder participation, the draft rules were circulated widely among manufacturers, testing labs, City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies, and State Legal Metrology Departments. Feedback was thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the final draft. Several rounds of inter-departmental and stakeholder consultations ensured that the rules are both robust and practical.
The finalized rules include a transitional period to give adequate time for the industry and authorities to prepare for implementation, thereby avoiding any disruption in gas supply or undue burden on consumers and businesses.

Title: Delhi’s new anti-pollution moves: Will they be enough?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:37:12 +0000
Content: Delhi’s recurring winter pollution crisis has become a case study in urban environmental mismanagement. While the government takes action during these peak months, the bigger question remains: Are we doing enough—and more importantly, are we doing it all year round?
Experts and environmentalists have long pointed out that Delhi’s approach to air pollution tends to be reactive. Most of the effort kicks in only when the situation turns severe—usually between October and November—rather than being part of a continuous, year-round plan.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is supposed to manage pollution based on severity levels, is often seen as a short-term band-aid. It doesn’t tackle the root causes or prepare the city for sudden spikes in pollution.
One of the major contributors to Delhi’s poor air quality is vehicular emissions. Despite moves like shifting public transport to CNG and enforcing BS6 norms, the impact has been limited. The city still has a massive number of vehicles on its roads—around 8 percent of the country’s total, concentrated in a relatively small area.
Add to that the traffic congestion, and it’s no surprise that pollution levels remain high. While electric vehicles (EVs) are being promoted as the next big solution, experts caution that they’re not a silver bullet—especially if the electricity that powers them comes from coal.
In response to growing pressure and criticism, the Delhi government recently announced a new set of policies. Chief Minister Rekha Gupta revealed that vehicles from other states will now be required to carry a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate when entering Delhi.
The idea is to tighten emissions checks and prevent highly polluting vehicles from adding to the city’s burden. This comes after a CAG report highlighted serious lapses in Delhi’s existing pollution control systems, pointing out weak enforcement and poor coordination between agencies.
Alongside this, the government is planning a major expansion of EV infrastructure. By 2026, Delhi aims to have 48,000 EV charging points across the city—18,000 publicly managed and 30,000 semi-private.
While this is a step in the right direction, experts stress that without strengthening public transport, these measures won’t go far. If people don’t have clean, affordable alternatives to driving, EVs alone won’t reduce the number of vehicles on the road or ease the traffic that slows the city to a crawl.
The government is also planning to set up six new air quality monitoring stations and an eco-park for processing electronic waste—another often overlooked source of pollution. These may seem like smaller steps, but they’re important pieces of a bigger puzzle. However, even the best city-level efforts can only go so far.
Delhi’s air doesn’t exist in isolation. Pollution flows in from surrounding states, carried by wind and weather. Experts say what’s needed now is a joint approach—an “air shed” model, where Delhi and its neighboring states work together, much like they would in managing a shared water system.
Only by addressing the issue regionally can real, lasting progress be made. Delhi’s latest announcements show that there is political will to act. But unless these plans are part of a bigger, long-term, and better-coordinated effort, it’s likely that come next winter, the smog will return—and with it, the same old questions.

Title: Crisil projects 6.5% GDP growth for India in FY26, flags US tariffs as key risk
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:47:49 +0000
Content: Global credit rating agency Crisil on Monday projected India’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in fiscal 2026, while cautioning that US tariff hikes remain a significant downside risk to the forecast.
Despite external headwinds, Crisil expects monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to offer some cushion, along with other positive domestic developments. “Interest rate cuts, income tax relief, and easing inflation are expected to boost consumption this fiscal. Additionally, a normal monsoon could support agricultural incomes,” the report stated.
Crisil also anticipates that a decline in global crude oil prices, potentially driven by a global slowdown, will provide further support to domestic economic activity.
However, US tariff hikes pose a major challenge, with uncertainties around their duration and frequent revisions likely to dampen investor sentiment and slow investments, the agency warned.
For the current fiscal (FY25), Crisil observed that the second half showed signs of improvement, particularly in capital, infrastructure, and construction goods output, indicating a gradual pickup in construction and capital expenditure activities.
High-frequency indicators further reinforce these growth prospects. The RBI’s latest Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey indicates sequential strengthening in demand during Q4 FY25, while the Consumer Confidence Survey shows improved sentiment in both rural and urban areas in March.
“A healthy rabi output and easing inflation in the fourth quarter also support stronger consumption demand,” Crisil added.
Industrial growth, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), moderated to 2.9% in February from 5.2% in January (revised from 5.0%), largely due to slower growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors, although the electricity sector recorded an uptick.
Overall, IIP growth averaged 4.0% in Q4 FY25, in line with 4.1% in Q3, with manufacturing sub-sectors like petroleum products, machinery, and textiles performing better in the second half of FY25.

Title: Indian Coast Guard, Gujarat ATS seize narcotics worth Rs. 1,800 crore in joint operation
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:18:45 +0000
Content: In a significant crackdown on drug trafficking, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), in a joint operation with the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), seized over 300 kg of methamphetamine valued at approximately Rs. 1,800 crore, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence on Monday.
The overnight operation, conducted between April 12 and 13, was based on actionable intelligence provided by the Gujarat ATS. An ICG vessel from the Coast Guard Region (West), deployed on a multi-mission patrol off the North Maharashtra–South Gujarat coast, was redirected to intercept a suspicious boat near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Sensing the Coast Guard’s approach, the suspect vessel jettisoned its cargo into the sea and attempted to flee toward the IMBL. While the suspect boat managed to cross into international waters, evading apprehension, the ICG launched a sea boat and successfully recovered the dumped narcotics consignment after an intensive night-time search.
The seized drugs have since been transported to Porbandar for further investigation.
This successful bust marks the 13th major joint operation between the ICG and Gujarat ATS in recent years, showcasing the strength of inter-agency coordination in safeguarding national security and combating transnational crime.

Title: AICTE forms expert committee to integrate AI across all academic streams
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:58:11 +0000
Content: In a significant step toward transforming technical education in India, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has constituted an expert committee to facilitate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Applied AI across diverse academic programmes beyond traditional computer science degrees.
The committee is chaired by Anand Deshpande, Managing Director of Persistent Systems, and includes AI experts from IITs, NITs, and other leading institutions. The move is aimed at promoting lateral expansion of AI in streams such as BBA, BCA, electrical engineering, and other disciplines.
“We are forming a committee to introduce AI laterally across all programmes, especially Applied AI,” said AICTE Chairman Prof. TG Sitharam. “The idea is to spread AI and related curricula across streams so that every student—regardless of discipline—gains foundational knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and data analytics.”
AICTE, India’s apex regulatory body for technical education, has already revised curricula for several programmes to incorporate AI elements. “We have created new curricula for BBA and BCA and introduced AI in electrical engineering. Our goal is that everyone should understand AI and data analytics,” Sitharam added.
Recognizing the crucial role of educators, AICTE has also prioritised faculty training to support the effective rollout of AI-focused modules. “Our teachers need to be trained not only in teaching AI but also in adapting to how AI is changing the learning environment—like how students now submit AI-generated assignments. We need to evolve the way we frame questions and evaluate learning,” the Chairman said.
In line with its vision, AICTE has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Artificial Intelligence’, launching a range of initiatives to raise awareness and build capacity. The ambitious plan aims to bring AI education to over 14,000 colleges and 40 million students across India. Key components of the initiative include AI awareness campaigns, faculty development programmes, and collaborations with top technology firms.
AICTE follows a structured curriculum revision process every two years, engaging with expert panels to update academic frameworks in line with emerging technologies. “Curriculum revision is a detailed exercise involving expert consultation. We repeat this process every two years to ensure relevance,” Sitharam noted.
With this strategic push, AICTE aims to make India’s technical education system future-ready, equipping students across disciplines with the skills needed for an AI-driven world.

Title: Blue Origin to fly Katy Perry to edge of space with all-female crew
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:37:35 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry, along with five other women, is set to make history by traveling to the edge of space on Monday evening aboard Jeff Bezos’ aerospace venture Blue Origin’s tourist mission.
The six-member crew is scheduled to lift off on the company’s reusable New Shepard rocket — NS-31 — from Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:30 a.m. CDT (7:00 p.m. IST).
This marks the 11th human flight to suborbital space by Blue Origin. The journey will last approximately 11 minutes and reach beyond the Kármán line — the internationally recognized boundary of space.
“I’ve dreamt of going to space for 15 years, and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality,” Perry shared in a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video.
“I am so honoured to be alongside five other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first-ever all-female flight space crew!” she added.
In the video, Perry offered fans a sneak peek inside her space capsule and hinted at a musical performance during the flight.
“I think I’m gonna sing — I’ve got to sing in space,” she said.
Joining Perry on the mission are Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sanchez.
“This is the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo spaceflight in 1963,” Blue Origin stated.
Perry, one of the best-selling music artists of all time, is also known for her philanthropic efforts. Flynn is a film producer and philanthropist, while King and Sanchez are award-winning journalists.
Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist, will become the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman to travel to space.
Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and the CEO of STEMBoard, an engineering firm, is expected to conduct three research experiments, including studies on plant biology and human physiology — advancing her mission to explore space for the benefit of Earth.
This will be Blue Origin’s second mission of the year. To date, the company has flown 52 people beyond the Kármán line.

Title: Explained: What is Type-5 diabetes? Why the malnutrition-induced condition is back?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:15:59 +0000
Content: While blood sugar cases are significantly soaring worldwide, a lesser-known malnutrition-related form of diabetes — designated as Type-5 diabetes – is gaining global attention after decades.
Nearly 75 years after being first recorded, the condition that previously remained undefined was designated as Type- 5 diabetes at the recently held International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) World Diabetes Congress in Bangkok, Thailand.
The condition, occurring often in young and thin adults, was first reported in Jamaica in 1955, and then defined as J-type diabetes.
In the 1960s, the condition was reported in undernourished populations across India, Pakistan, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
While in 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the condition as a distinct form of diabetes, it removed the designation in 1999 as there were no proper follow-up studies and supporting evidence.
What is Type-5 diabetes?
It is a malnutrition-related diabetes, typically affecting lean and malnourished teenagers and young adults in low- and middle-income countries.
Type 5 diabetes is estimated to affect 20-to-25 million people worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Earlier findings had suggested that malnutrition-related diabetes stemmed from insulin resistance.
However, insulin injections, as in Type 1 diabetes patients, will not benefit these patients. In some cases, it can cause dangerously low blood sugar.
It is because “people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn’t recognised before. This finding has revolutionised how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” said Meredith Hawkins, Professor of Medicine at the Global Diabetes Institute at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, US.
In a 2022 study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, Hawkins, and her colleagues at Christian Medical College in Vellore, demonstrated that malnutrition-related diabetes is fundamentally different from Type-2 diabetes, typically, caused by obesity, and Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease.
However, the expert noted that “doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis”.
To better understand the condition and develop treatments, the IDF has constituted a working group.
What will the working group do?
According to Hawkins, the condition has “historically been vastly under-diagnosed and poorly understood”.
She said that “malnutrition-related diabetes is more common than tuberculosis and nearly as common as HIV/AIDS”.
“The lack of an official name has hindered efforts to diagnose patients or find effective therapies,” Hawkins said.
The working group has been tasked to develop formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 diabetes over the next two years.
It will define diagnostic criteria and develop guidelines for the management of the disease. It will also establish a global registry to facilitate research collaborations and develop education modules to train healthcare professionals worldwide.

Title: Centre issues draft rules for gas meters under Legal Metrology Act to ensure accuracy, consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:42:24 +0000
Content: In a major move to enhance consumer protection and promote fair trade practices, the Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, has released draft rules for gas meters under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011. The new framework mandates that all gas meters used for domestic, commercial, and industrial purposes undergo testing, verification, and stamping before being deployed for trade or commerce.
According to an official statement from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, the proposed rules also require periodic re-verification of gas meters in use to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
The key objective behind the draft is to foster accuracy, transparency, and accountability in gas measurement. Verified and stamped meters will help prevent overcharging, under-measurement, and billing disputes, thus safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring fair billing. This initiative is also expected to lead to improved energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs for consumers, thanks to standardized and compliant devices.
The draft rules set out a structured compliance framework for manufacturers and gas distribution companies, aligning with international best practices and OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology) standards. The move is seen as a step toward bolstering India’s global trade credibility and encouraging innovation and quality assurance in domestic manufacturing.
The Legal Metrology Division, responsible for maintaining the accuracy of weights and measures, adopted a comprehensive and consultative approach to frame the rules. A technical committee comprising representatives from the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Regional Reference Standard Laboratories (RRSLs), industry experts, and Voluntary Consumer Organizations (VCOs) helped shape the draft. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) also reviewed the draft and provided scientific and technical inputs.
To ensure inclusive stakeholder participation, the draft rules were circulated widely among manufacturers, testing labs, City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies, and State Legal Metrology Departments. Feedback was thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the final draft. Several rounds of inter-departmental and stakeholder consultations ensured that the rules are both robust and practical.
The finalized rules include a transitional period to give adequate time for the industry and authorities to prepare for implementation, thereby avoiding any disruption in gas supply or undue burden on consumers and businesses.

Title: Delhi’s new anti-pollution moves: Will they be enough?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:37:12 +0000
Content: Delhi’s recurring winter pollution crisis has become a case study in urban environmental mismanagement. While the government takes action during these peak months, the bigger question remains: Are we doing enough—and more importantly, are we doing it all year round?
Experts and environmentalists have long pointed out that Delhi’s approach to air pollution tends to be reactive. Most of the effort kicks in only when the situation turns severe—usually between October and November—rather than being part of a continuous, year-round plan.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is supposed to manage pollution based on severity levels, is often seen as a short-term band-aid. It doesn’t tackle the root causes or prepare the city for sudden spikes in pollution.
One of the major contributors to Delhi’s poor air quality is vehicular emissions. Despite moves like shifting public transport to CNG and enforcing BS6 norms, the impact has been limited. The city still has a massive number of vehicles on its roads—around 8 percent of the country’s total, concentrated in a relatively small area.
Add to that the traffic congestion, and it’s no surprise that pollution levels remain high. While electric vehicles (EVs) are being promoted as the next big solution, experts caution that they’re not a silver bullet—especially if the electricity that powers them comes from coal.
In response to growing pressure and criticism, the Delhi government recently announced a new set of policies. Chief Minister Rekha Gupta revealed that vehicles from other states will now be required to carry a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate when entering Delhi.
The idea is to tighten emissions checks and prevent highly polluting vehicles from adding to the city’s burden. This comes after a CAG report highlighted serious lapses in Delhi’s existing pollution control systems, pointing out weak enforcement and poor coordination between agencies.
Alongside this, the government is planning a major expansion of EV infrastructure. By 2026, Delhi aims to have 48,000 EV charging points across the city—18,000 publicly managed and 30,000 semi-private.
While this is a step in the right direction, experts stress that without strengthening public transport, these measures won’t go far. If people don’t have clean, affordable alternatives to driving, EVs alone won’t reduce the number of vehicles on the road or ease the traffic that slows the city to a crawl.
The government is also planning to set up six new air quality monitoring stations and an eco-park for processing electronic waste—another often overlooked source of pollution. These may seem like smaller steps, but they’re important pieces of a bigger puzzle. However, even the best city-level efforts can only go so far.
Delhi’s air doesn’t exist in isolation. Pollution flows in from surrounding states, carried by wind and weather. Experts say what’s needed now is a joint approach—an “air shed” model, where Delhi and its neighboring states work together, much like they would in managing a shared water system.
Only by addressing the issue regionally can real, lasting progress be made. Delhi’s latest announcements show that there is political will to act. But unless these plans are part of a bigger, long-term, and better-coordinated effort, it’s likely that come next winter, the smog will return—and with it, the same old questions.

Title: Crisil projects 6.5% GDP growth for India in FY26, flags US tariffs as key risk
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:47:49 +0000
Content: Global credit rating agency Crisil on Monday projected India’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in fiscal 2026, while cautioning that US tariff hikes remain a significant downside risk to the forecast.
Despite external headwinds, Crisil expects monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to offer some cushion, along with other positive domestic developments. “Interest rate cuts, income tax relief, and easing inflation are expected to boost consumption this fiscal. Additionally, a normal monsoon could support agricultural incomes,” the report stated.
Crisil also anticipates that a decline in global crude oil prices, potentially driven by a global slowdown, will provide further support to domestic economic activity.
However, US tariff hikes pose a major challenge, with uncertainties around their duration and frequent revisions likely to dampen investor sentiment and slow investments, the agency warned.
For the current fiscal (FY25), Crisil observed that the second half showed signs of improvement, particularly in capital, infrastructure, and construction goods output, indicating a gradual pickup in construction and capital expenditure activities.
High-frequency indicators further reinforce these growth prospects. The RBI’s latest Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey indicates sequential strengthening in demand during Q4 FY25, while the Consumer Confidence Survey shows improved sentiment in both rural and urban areas in March.
“A healthy rabi output and easing inflation in the fourth quarter also support stronger consumption demand,” Crisil added.
Industrial growth, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), moderated to 2.9% in February from 5.2% in January (revised from 5.0%), largely due to slower growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors, although the electricity sector recorded an uptick.
Overall, IIP growth averaged 4.0% in Q4 FY25, in line with 4.1% in Q3, with manufacturing sub-sectors like petroleum products, machinery, and textiles performing better in the second half of FY25.

Title: Indian Coast Guard, Gujarat ATS seize narcotics worth Rs. 1,800 crore in joint operation
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:18:45 +0000
Content: In a significant crackdown on drug trafficking, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), in a joint operation with the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), seized over 300 kg of methamphetamine valued at approximately Rs. 1,800 crore, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence on Monday.
The overnight operation, conducted between April 12 and 13, was based on actionable intelligence provided by the Gujarat ATS. An ICG vessel from the Coast Guard Region (West), deployed on a multi-mission patrol off the North Maharashtra–South Gujarat coast, was redirected to intercept a suspicious boat near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Sensing the Coast Guard’s approach, the suspect vessel jettisoned its cargo into the sea and attempted to flee toward the IMBL. While the suspect boat managed to cross into international waters, evading apprehension, the ICG launched a sea boat and successfully recovered the dumped narcotics consignment after an intensive night-time search.
The seized drugs have since been transported to Porbandar for further investigation.
This successful bust marks the 13th major joint operation between the ICG and Gujarat ATS in recent years, showcasing the strength of inter-agency coordination in safeguarding national security and combating transnational crime.

Title: India’s rooftop solar capacity projected to reach 25–30 GW by FY27
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:08:38 +0000
Content: India’s rooftop solar energy capacity is expected to rise significantly from 17 GW to an estimated 25–30 GW between FY25 and FY27, according to a report released on Tuesday..
This projected surge is aligned with the country’s broader energy transition goals as solar power continues to emerge as a central pillar in India’s clean energy roadmap.
As per CareEdge Ratings, rooftop solar—especially in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment—is set to play a critical role in India’s renewable growth trajectory. The nation’s total renewable energy capacity stood at 220 GW as of FY25, with a target of reaching 300 GW of solar capacity by 2030.
Rooftop solar capacity reached 17.02 GW in FY25. Increased awareness among businesses about reducing operational costs and meeting sustainability goals is driving its rapid adoption.
The report highlights that government incentives, declining technology costs, and supportive policies—such as net metering and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes—are expected to further accelerate rooftop solar deployment.
“Rooftop solar installations in India have gained momentum. With the growing C&I demand backed by an improving policy ecosystem, we expect the market to reach nearly 25–30 GW over the next two years,” said Tanvi Shah, Director at CareEdge Advisory and Research.
The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, which aims to install rooftop solar in one crore households with subsidies up to Rs. 78,000, is poised to strengthen residential adoption. The scheme is designed to support low- and middle-income households by reducing electricity bills while also creating nearly 17 lakh jobs, thus boosting the entire solar value chain.
In a notable development, India’s rooftop solar initiative crossed the milestone of 10 lakh installations as of March 10.
Among states, Gujarat continues to lead the way through its ambitious ‘Surya Gujarat’ programme. Maharashtra is also witnessing strong C&I uptake, particularly from MSMEs and urban commercial centres.
The report notes that the rooftop segment currently accounts for around 20% of India’s total solar capacity. Its growing importance is attributed to its distributed nature and direct consumer engagement, despite utility-scale solar remaining the dominant contributor.

Title: Passenger vehicle sales soar to 4.3 million units in FY 2024-25, UVs drive growth: SIAM report
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:04:25 +0000
Content: Passenger vehicle sales in India reached an all-time high of 4.3 million units in the financial year 2024-25, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
This marks a 2% increase compared to the previous year, with Utility Vehicles (UVs) remaining the key growth driver in the passenger vehicle segment. Their share in overall sales rose to 65% in FY 2024-25, up from around 60% in the previous year.
The report also noted that new model launches with modern designs and advanced features attracted more buyers. Additionally, attractive discounts and promotional offers helped maintain demand.
According to the data, passenger vehicles also saw their highest-ever exports during the year, reaching 770,000 units. This represents a 14.6% increase compared to FY 2023-24. The rise in exports was driven by demand for global models manufactured in India, especially in Latin American and African markets. Some automakers even began exporting to developed countries.
Overall, the Indian automobile industry grew by 7.3% in domestic sales and saw a strong 19.2% increase in exports. SIAM attributed this performance to strong customer demand, government support, infrastructure investments, and a growing focus on sustainable mobility. Positive economic policies and strong market sentiment also contributed to sustaining the growth.
Two-wheeler sales experienced a solid recovery, with 19.6 million units sold in FY 2024-25, reflecting a growth of 9.1%. Improved rural demand and rising consumer confidence played a key role in this growth. The scooter segment led the way, supported by better connectivity in rural and semi-urban areas and the launch of new models with improved features.
Electric vehicles (EVs) also gained ground, with their share in total two-wheeler sales crossing 6% during the year. Two-wheeler exports grew strongly by 21.4%, reaching 4.2 million units. This growth was fueled by new product launches and increased demand in Africa and Latin America.
Looking ahead, SIAM expects the auto sector to continue its growth in FY 2025-26. Stable economic conditions, proactive government policies, and infrastructure spending are likely to support this growth. A normal monsoon, as forecasted, is also expected to boost demand, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.

Title: ICC considers tweaks to two-ball rule in ODIs to rebalance the format
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 05:28:35 +0000
Content: In a move that could significantly alter the dynamics of One Day Internationals (ODIs), the ICC men’s cricket committee, chaired by former India captain Sourav Ganguly, has proposed a change to the existing two-ball rule in a bid to restore a better balance between bat and ball in the 50-over format.
Currently, each ODI innings begins with two new balls—one from each end—which has been the norm since October 2011. However, at the ICC meetings held this week in Harare, the committee recommended a key alteration: from the 35th over of an innings, the fielding team would continue with only one of the two balls in use.
Proposed Rule Change
According to the recommendation, both balls will be used for the first 34 overs, as is currently the case. After 34 overs, the fielding side will be allowed to choose which of the two 17-over-old balls to continue with for the remainder of the innings. The unchosen ball will be retained as a spare and used only if necessary.
This adjustment is aimed at introducing more wear and tear on the ball in the latter stages of an innings, potentially aiding bowlers—particularly spinners and reverse-swing specialists—and rebalancing a format that has increasingly favored batters in recent years.
The committee had also weighed the idea of implementing the change earlier, around the 25th over, but that suggestion did not garner enough support. Instead, the consensus settled on allowing both balls to be used for 17 overs each, offering a more balanced approach.
Boards have been asked to provide feedback on the proposed tweak by the end of April. If there is a consensus, the change will be formalized at the ICC’s annual general meeting in July. Since this is a change to the playing conditions rather than the laws of the game, it does not require ICC Board approval.
Historical Context
The current two-ball rule was reintroduced in 2011, though similar conditions were in place during the 1992 World Cup and various periods prior. Between 2007 and 2011, ODIs featured a mandatory ball change after the 34th over, with a similarly used but cleaner ball replacing the original to aid visibility—especially under lights.
Stop Clock in Tests and U-19 Format Debate
In addition to the ODI rule change, the ICC is also weighing the introduction of a 60-second stop clock in Test cricket, a move already implemented in limited-overs formats to curb slow over-rates. Under the rule, teams exceeding the time limit for resuming play between overs face penalties such as bringing an additional fielder inside the 30-yard circle.
There was also discussion on converting the Under-19 Men’s World Cup from a 50-over format to T20, but no clear consensus was reached. Most members expressed reservations about the change, and such a shift would require formal approval by the ICC Board.
The also committee discussed the possibility of introducing bonus points in the World Test Championship, though the idea was met with skepticism due to concerns over its complexity.

Title: Blue Origin rocket carrying Katy Perry and all-female crew reaches edge of space, returns safely
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:39:54 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry and five other women launched into space on a Blue Origin rocket and successfully returned to Earth on Monday, marking the first all-female spaceflight in more than 60 years.
The crew lifted off from West Texas at 9:31 a.m. ET (1331 GMT) and traveled to the edge of space, where they experienced a brief period of weightlessness before returning to Earth in a flight lasting around 11 minutes, according to a live broadcast by Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos.
The spaceflight was a high-profile success for Bezos’ New Shepard launch vehicle, which has been developed for space tourism.
The six-person crew also included Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sanchez, CBS host Gayle King, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, scientist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn.
King said that when the crew returned to their seats after weightlessness, Perry sang the Louis Armstrong song “What a Wonderful World.”
“I feel super connected to love,” Katy Perry said after landing back on Earth.
Perry was holding a daisy, a flower she took into space, to remind her of her daughter, Daisy.
Among celebrities in attendance at the launch pad were a tearful Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, and show business personalities Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian.
It was the first all-female spaceflight since Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova – the first woman in space – orbited Earth during a nearly three-day solo flight in 1963.
Blue Origin does not disclose the average cost of a seat on one of its rockets. On its website, the company says potential passengers have to pay $150,000 in the form of a refundable deposit to start the “order process.”
In 2021, the company revealed the highest bid for a seat on its New Shepard spacecraft was $28 million. That same year, “Star Trek” actor William Shatner flew free of charge as a guest of Blue Origin.
In 2018, Reuters reported the company was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride.
Blue Origin says on its website it aims to radically reduce the cost of access to space, with its rockets designed for reusability.
Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy and organization at Warwick Business School in Britain, estimates each launch of the New Shepard costs between $1 to $3 million.
“Even ignoring development cost, there are six seats so each passenger would have to pay around half a million USD for this to be a financially viable ongoing business,” Heracleous said. “It will take a long long time before space tourism can be a financially sustainable business available to the public at large.”

Title: IPL 2025: Dhoni’s finishing masterclass ends CSK’s five-match losing streak with five-wicket win over LSG
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:21 +0000
Content: Skipper MS Dhoni once again showcased his timeless brilliance, scripting a thrilling five-wicket win for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the ongoing IPL 2025 on Monday. The victory ended Chennai’s five-match losing streak and reaffirmed Dhoni’s stature as one of the finest finishers in the game.
Chasing 167, CSK rode on a vintage Dhoni cameo and a composed, unbeaten knock from Shivam Dube to cross the finish line with three balls to spare. Dhoni remained unbeaten on 26 off just 11 balls, striking four boundaries and a six, while Dube anchored the chase with 43* off 37 deliveries.
CSK got off to a flying start, thanks to a sizzling opening stand between debutant Shaik Rasheed and New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra. Ravindra set the tone with consecutive boundaries off Shardul Thakur in the opening over, and Rasheed followed suit by taking on Akash Deep with impeccable timing. Their 52-run partnership laid a solid platform before Rasheed (27) fell to Avesh Khan, who deceived the youngster with a slower delivery.
In his milestone 100th IPL match, Rahul Tripathi had a slice of luck when Abdul Samad dropped a sitter. However, he couldn’t capitalise, managing just 9 before falling to Ravi Bishnoi. Ravindra, after a brisk 37 off 22 balls, was trapped LBW by Aiden Markram, putting CSK on the backfoot.
Dube and Ravindra Jadeja attempted to stabilize the innings, but Bishnoi struck again, dismissing Jadeja near the boundary with Markram completing a sharp catch. Vijay Shankar’s quick exit added to Chennai’s troubles, leaving Dhoni to steer the chase.
Entering amidst a roaring crowd, Dhoni wasted no time. He struck two back-to-back boundaries to end the 16th over, then launched a one-handed six off the final ball of the 17th. With 24 needed off 12 balls, Dube unleashed an assault on Thakur, carving a boundary followed by a towering six, easing the pressure.
Lucknow’s fate was sealed when Bishnoi dropped Dhoni on 20—a straightforward chance that went begging. The CSK captain punished the lapse by slamming another boundary and finishing the over with 19 runs. Dube sealed the win in the final over, helping CSK snap their losing streak in style.
Earlier in the match, LSG, put into bat by CSK, struggled early. Khaleel Ahmed struck in the first over, dismissing Aiden Markram for 6 with Rahul Tripathi taking a fine diving catch. Anshul Kambhoj then removed the dangerous Nicholas Pooran for just 8, reducing LSG to 23/2 in four overs.
Mitchell Marsh and captain Rishabh Pant mounted a recovery, counterattacking the pacers. LSG reached 50 in the seventh over, with Pant reverse-scooping a six. Marsh was bowled by Jadeja for 30 (25), breaking a promising 50-run stand. At the halfway mark, LSG was 78/3.
Ayush Badoni gave LSG a boost with two consecutive sixes off Jamie Overton, but Dhoni’s sharp stumping off Jadeja ended his knock on 22 (17). Pant shifted gears, bringing up his first IPL 2025 fifty in 42 balls, including four boundaries and three sixes.
LSG collected 34 runs in the 18th and 19th overs, with Pant and Abdul Samad going big. However, the final over-swung back CSK’s way. Samad was run out for 20, and Pant fell for 63 (49) off Pathirana’s bowling. Pathirana then cleaned up Shardul Thakur off the last ball, restricting LSG to 166/7 in 20 overs.

Title: US steps up probes into pharmaceutical, chip imports, setting stage for tariffs
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 03:56:30 +0000
Content: The Trump administration is proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on grounds that extensive reliance on foreign production of medicine and chips is a national security threat, Federal Register filings on Monday showed.
The filings announce 21-day public comment periods and mark President Donald Trump’s latest use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 as justification for so-called sectoral tariffs aimed at boosting domestic production of goods he says are critical to national security.
Using the 232 provision, the Trump administration has started investigations into imports of copper and lumber, and probes completed during Trump’s first term formed the basis for 25% tariffs rolled out since his return to the White House in January on steel and aluminum and on the auto industry.
The filings, which indicate the administration began the investigations on April 1, follow exclusions unveiled over the weekend for smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China from Trump’s steep 125% reciprocal duties. Trump officials had said those products would soon be subject to Section 232 tariffs.
Section 232 probes need to be completed within 270 days of their initiation.
Trump has made use of tariffs a central plank of his administration’s economic and national security policies, rolling out a series of aggressive levies against trading partners that economists estimate have lifted the average import duty to around 25% from just 2.5% in matter of months.
The announcements have roiled financial markets, with most U.S. stock indexes now down 10% or more from record highs hit following Trump’s election win in November. Waves of economists have also downgraded their outlooks for the American economy, many foretelling higher joblessness and inflation in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.
A top Federal Reserve official – Governor Christopher Waller – earlier on Monday called Trump’s tariff policy “one of the biggest shocks to affect the U.S. economy in many decades.”
‘BREATHING ROOM AND VISIBILITY’
The U.S. began collecting baseline tariffs of 10% on most U.S. imports on April 5, and Trump on April 9 put on hold even stiffer levies aimed at goods at dozens of other trading partners, although the heftiest tariffs targeting China remain in place. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are exempt from those duties, but Trump has said they will face separate tariffs.
Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing tariffs on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector.
The U.S. relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, something former President Joe Biden sought to reverse during his term by granting billions of dollars in Chips Act awards to lure chipmakers to expand production in the United States.
The notices published on Monday showed the investigations will include both pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients as well as other derivative products.
Drugmakers have argued that tariffs could increase the chance of shortages and reduce access for patients. Still, Trump has pushed for the fees, arguing that the U.S. needs more drug manufacturing so it does not have to rely on other countries for its supply of medicines.
Companies in the industry have lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges and to allow time to shift manufacturing.
Large drugmakers have global manufacturing footprints, mainly in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and moving more production to the U.S. involves a major commitment of resources and could take years.
“This notice gives us some breathing room and visibility on when the tariffs might be expected, and we will be certainly looking out for the lobby actions that PHRMA and the industry CEOs will be engaging in over the next three weeks,” said Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen.
“We are bracing for announcement of tariffs around mid-May and see tariffs of 10-25% as being possible, with the industry angling for a slow ramping to these tariffs and potential carve-outs,” Breen said.
Gary Shapiro, CEO and Vice Chair of the Consumer Technology Association, said that Trump’s Friday exclusion on smartphones, computers and semiconductors recognized that his tariffs will hurt consumers.
“At the same time, the shift from IEEPA to Section 232 as a legal basis for tariffs reveals the Administration’s desire for a more durable justification,” Shapiro said in a statement. “But claiming that downstream consumer tech products qualify as ‘semiconductors’ is a stretch.”
He called for “a smarter, targeted trade strategy where we team up with allies to compete with China.”

Title: India targets 10% global market share in power tools, 25% in hand tools
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 16:41:38 +0000
Content: India is aiming to significantly expand its footprint in the global hand and power tools market, with a target of achieving $25 billion in exports over the next decade. According to a new report released by NITI Aayog on Tuesday, the country could potentially capture 10 percent of the global market in power tools and 25 percent in hand tools, generating approximately 35 lakh jobs in the process.
The report, titled “Unlocking $25+ Billion Export Potential – India’s Hand & Power Tools Sector,” lays out a detailed strategy to boost India’s competitiveness in this sector. Currently, the global trade in hand and power tools is valued at around $100 billion and is projected to grow to approximately $190 billion by 2035. Of this, hand tools are expected to expand from $34 billion to $60 billion, while power tools, including accessories, are set to grow from $63 billion to $134 billion.
China currently dominates the global export market, accounting for about half of the hand tools exports ($13 billion) and 40 percent of power tools exports ($22 billion). In contrast, India’s current exports stand at $600 million in hand tools and $470 million in power tools, translating to a modest market share of 1.8 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.
Despite its limited market share, the report suggests that India has the potential to significantly scale up its exports, targeting $25 billion over the next decade. Achieving this target could generate around 35 lakh jobs and help India capture 10 percent of the global power tools market and 25 percent of the hand tools market.
The report identifies a number of structural challenges that hinder India’s competitiveness, including a 14 to 17 percent cost disadvantage compared to China. These are attributed to higher raw material costs, lower labour productivity, elevated interest rates, and higher logistics costs, especially from inland production hubs to ports. Additionally, regulatory constraints such as restrictive overtime rules and complex export procedures further exacerbate these challenges.
To address these issues, the report recommends a set of strategic interventions. One major proposal is the development of world-class hand tool manufacturing clusters, spread over 4,000 acres and built under public-private partnerships. These clusters would offer modern infrastructure, including plug-and-play facilities, worker housing, and improved connectivity to support industrial growth.
It also calls for market reforms to reduce structural cost burdens. These include rationalizing import duties on critical raw materials, streamlining Quality Control Orders, simplifying the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme, and revising labour and building regulations.
The report emphasizes that if these reforms are effectively implemented, no additional government support would be necessary beyond current schemes such as Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) and duty drawbacks. However, in the absence of such reforms, it estimates a requirement of ₹8,000 crore in bridge cost support, which it frames as an investment likely to generate two to three times its value in tax revenues over five years.

Title: CT scan radiation risk comparable to alcohol and obesity: study
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:21:26 +0000
Content: Repeated exposure to unnecessary CT (computed tomography) scans may increase cancer risk to a level comparable with alcohol consumption and obesity, a new study has found.
The research, conducted by scientists at the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF), estimated that radiation from CT scans contributes to about 5% of all cancer cases annually.
The study identified infants, children, and adolescents—particularly those under one year old—as the most vulnerable to scan-related cancers. However, adults remain at risk too, since they are the primary recipients of such scans, the researchers noted, warning against overuse and excessive radiation exposure.
In children, the most likely cancers linked to CT scan radiation are thyroid, lung, and breast cancer. Among adults, common CT-associated cancers include those of the lung, colon, bladder, breast, and leukemia.
“CTs can save lives, but their potential harms are often overlooked,” said Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UCSF radiologist and lead author of the study.
“The findings place CT radiation exposure on par with other well-known cancer risks, such as alcohol use and excess body weight,” she added.
Published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the study estimated that around 103,000 cancer cases could result from the 93 million CT scans performed in the United States in 2023 alone. This is three to four times higher than earlier projections.
The researchers stressed that minimizing the number of CT scans, along with reducing radiation doses per scan, could help prevent thousands of cancer cases.
“Reducing both the frequency and intensity of CT imaging could save lives,” Smith-Bindman said.
While CT scans remain a crucial tool for diagnosing illnesses and detecting tumors, they expose patients to ionising radiation—a known carcinogen.
The findings were based on data from 93 million CT exams conducted on 61.5 million patients, with scan rates increasing significantly with age. Adults aged 60–69 accounted for the highest number of scans, while children represented 4.2% of the total scans conducted.

Title: Apple airlifted iPhones worth a record $2 billion from India in March as Trump tariffs loomed
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 14:53:35 +0000
Content: Apple’s main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the United States in March, an all-time high, as the U.S. company airlifted devices to bypass President Donald Trump’s impending tariffs, customs data shows.
The smartphone maker stepped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones to the United States to ensure sufficient inventory in one of its biggest markets on concern Trump’s tariffs would push up costs.
In April, the U.S. administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months.
Foxconn, Apple’s main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters.
This included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn’s total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion.
Exports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models.
Customs data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.
Trump latergranted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived.
To expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours.
At least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to “beat the tariffs”.

Content: The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) has reported a robust 49% increase in its net profit, reaching ₹502 crore for the January-March quarter of financial year 2024-25, compared to ₹337 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.
 
India’s leading green financing non-banking financial company (NBFC) also posted a revenue of ₹1,392 crore for the fourth quarter, marking a 37.7% rise from ₹1,011 crore in Q4 of FY 2023-24.
 
During the quarter, IREDA recorded a 27% growth in loan sanctions, amounting to ₹47,453 crore, while loan disbursements rose 20% year-on-year to ₹30,168 crore.
 
The company’s total loan book expanded significantly to ₹76,250 crore, reflecting a 28% increase from ₹59,698 crore reported at the end of the corresponding quarter last year.
 
In a move to boost its global presence, IREDA signed a loan agreement worth 26 billion Japanese yen with the Tokyo branch of State Bank of India (SBI) on March 28. The facility includes a green shoe option of an additional 10 billion yen. The five-year unsecured loan, structured with a bullet payment at maturity, is expected to carry a hedged cost of below 7%, making it more cost-effective than similar-tenure loans in the domestic market.
 
IREDA continues to maintain strong international credit ratings of ‘BBB-’ (long-term) and ‘A-3’ (short-term) with a ‘Stable’ outlook from S&P Global, reflecting its sound corporate governance and credibility in international markets.
 
In the previous quarter (October–December), the NBFC reported a 26.8% rise in net profit to ₹425.37 crore, up from ₹335.54 crore in the same period a year ago. Revenue during Q3 FY 2024 stood at ₹1,698.99 crore, marking a 35.57% increase from ₹1,253.20 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24.

Title: India’s exports hit record $820.93 billion in FY25 amid global headwinds
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:00:31 +0000
Content: India’s total exports of goods and services rose by 5.5% to a record $820.93 billion in the financial year ending March 31,  compared to $773 billion in the previous year, according to Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal. This growth comes despite global economic uncertainties and trade tensions.
 
Merchandise exports stood at $437.4 billion, while non-petroleum exports registered a 6% year-on-year increase, reaching $374.08 billion in FY25.
 
However, India’s trade deficit widened to $21.54 billion in March, up from $14.05 billion in February, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Merchandise exports rose marginally by 0.7% to $41.97 billion during the month, while imports surged by 11.3% to $63.51 billion, leading to the broader gap.
 
Compared to February, exports in March jumped 13.75%, while imports grew 24.6%.
 
These developments come amid rising tensions in global markets, particularly after the US hiked tariffs on several imports. India is currently engaged in talks with the United States to finalise a bilateral trade agreement, with the US agreeing to pause the tariff hikes for 90 days.
 
According to official sources, the first phase of the agreement is expected to be concluded within this pause period. The terms of reference have already been finalised, and negotiations are taking place primarily through video conferencing. If needed, Indian officials may travel to Washington, or US officials may visit New Delhi.
 
Authorities are also on alert to prevent any misuse of trade routes. A close watch is being maintained to ensure that other countries do not route their exports through India to evade US tariffs. Similarly, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has been instructed to monitor that Indian exporters do not use third countries to reroute goods.
 
Officials emphasized that India remains a trusted trade partner of the US, and any such circumvention could damage that reputation.
 
Speaking to journalists last week, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal described the ongoing negotiations with the US as “very good.” He said India offers a strong case for a trade deal, given its economic potential and demographic strengths.
 
“Considering the growth trajectory India is expected to follow over the next 25–30 years, with a young, aspirational population driving demand, we believe India presents a compelling case for a strong bilateral trade agreement with the United States,” Goyal said at a press conference.

Content: India’s annual retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to 3.34% in March 2025—the lowest level since August 2019—according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics on Tuesday.
Food inflation also slowed significantly during the month, dropping to 2.69%, its lowest since November 2021.
The notable decline in both headline and food inflation is primarily attributed to a reduction in the prices of key food items such as vegetables, eggs, pulses, meat and fish, cereals, and milk, the ministry noted.
Among the commodities with the sharpest year-on-year price drops in March were ginger (-38.11%), tomato (-34.96%), cauliflower (-25.99%), jeera (cumin) (-25.86%), and garlic (-25.22%).
Housing inflation stood at 3.03% in March, slightly higher than February’s 2.91%. Notably, the housing index is compiled only for the urban sector.
Fuel and light inflation was recorded at 1.48%, while education inflation for the month came in at 3.98%, the data showed.
Retail inflation in India has been on a downward trend in recent months. Reflecting this, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee recently revised its inflation forecast for 2025–26 to 4.0%, down from the earlier projection of 4.2%, citing improved prospects for food prices.
“Headline inflation moderated during January–February 2025 following a sharp correction in food inflation. The outlook for food inflation has turned decisively positive,” said RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra last week.
He noted that concerns regarding rabi crop output have eased significantly, with the second advance estimates pointing to record wheat production and higher pulse output compared to the previous year. These developments, along with robust kharif crop arrivals, are expected to contribute to a sustained softening of food prices.
“The sharp decline in inflation expectations in our latest survey—both for three months and one year ahead—will help anchor inflationary trends going forward,” Malhotra added.
The Governor also emphasized that falling global crude oil prices are favorable for the inflation outlook. However, he cautioned that global market uncertainties and potential weather-related supply disruptions remain as upside risks.
Assuming a normal monsoon, the RBI projects CPI inflation for the financial year 2025–26 at 4.0%, with quarterly estimates as follows: Q1: 3.6%, Q2: 3.9%, Q3: 3.8%, and Q4: 4.4%.
The risks to this outlook are considered evenly balanced.

Title: M&A, PE deals in consumer sector surge to 3-year high of $4 billion in Jan–March
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:21:43 +0000
Content: The value of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and private equity (PE) investments in India’s consumer and retail sector surged to a three-year high of nearly $4 billion in the January–March 2025 quarter, according to Grant Thornton Bharat’s latest quarterly deal tracker report.
Topping the deal charts were two mega investments: Temasek, the Singapore-based PE firm, invested $1 billion for a 10% stake in Haldiram Snacks, while Wilmar International increased its holding in Adani Wilmar (now renamed AWL Agri-Business after Adani Group’s exit) from 44% to nearly 75% through a $1.4 billion deal. These high-value investments underscore growing investor confidence in India’s food processing and consumer goods segments, the report noted.
The total deal value in Q1 2025 was three times higher than the $1.28 billion recorded in Q1 2023 and more than double the $1.74 billion seen in Q1 2024. The number of deals also climbed to 139, compared to 78 in Q1 2023 and 102 in Q1 2024.
“India’s consumer and retail sector is entering a dynamic phase of growth, with M&A and private equity investments surging across high-potential segments such as food & beverages, personal care, and e-commerce,” said Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat.
“In particular, the F&B space is seeing strong momentum, as consumers seek better products and brands embrace digital distribution to reach them. We expect strategic consolidation and capital inflows to continue, as businesses demonstrate resilience, digital agility, and strong consumer connect.”
The consolidation trend was evident in strategic acquisitions by major players: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) acquired D2C skincare brand Minimalist, ITC took over frozen foods brand Prasuma, and Adani Wilmar acquired GD Foods, the maker of Tops sauces and pickles.

Title: Indian markets rally on US tariff relief; Sensex surges over 1,500 points
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 10:53:43 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets witnessed a sharp rally on Tuesday, buoyed by the United States’ decision to provide a 90-day relief from reciprocal tariffs. The announcement lifted investor sentiment, especially amid expectations of similar relief for the automotive sector.
The BSE Sensex opened with a robust jump of nearly 1,700 points at 76,852 and soon touched the intra-day high of 76,908. Throughout the session, the index traded in a narrow range near its peak, supported by strong buying in private banks, metal stocks, IT firms, and infrastructure-related shares.
By the close of trade, the Sensex had gained 1,578 points, or 2.1%, ending at 76,735. Heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank contributed significantly to the gains, collectively adding around 750 points to the overall rally.
The NSE Nifty also mirrored the positive sentiment, opening at the day’s high of 23,368 and settling marginally lower at 23,329—up 500 points or 2.2% for the day.
Global cues, especially from the US, added to the upbeat mood in domestic markets. Investors responded positively to expectations that President Donald Trump could announce additional tariff exemptions, sparking optimism across major indices.
“Markets are adjusting to the new reality of daily Trump twists and turns,” said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital. “Markets tend to react positively when tariffs appear to be lifted temporarily and negatively when unexpected developments arise.”
On the Nifty, top gainers included IndusInd Bank, Shriram Finance, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Motors, and Axis Bank.
Broader market indices such as the Nifty 500, Midcap, and Smallcap also traded in the green, reflecting widespread buying interest.
Sector-wise, Realty, Automobiles, Metals, Financial Services, and Media stocks led the rally.
“Optimism was further boosted by reports that President Trump is considering similar tariff relief for the automotive sector,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity.
The Indian rupee also strengthened against the US dollar, closing 28 paise higher at 85.77, compared to Friday’s close of 86.05.

Title: Australian politicians took $147,000 of match tickets while weighing sports betting ban
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:26:45 +0000
Content: Australian politicians were gifted about A$245,000 ($147,000) in match tickets over nearly two years by the country’s most popular sporting leagues as part of a lobbying campaign against a proposed ban on advertising of online gambling, according to Reuters calculations based on government documents.
Lobbying by the gambling industry against the ban has been reported previously in media but the calculation of the total value of tickets declared by politicians in the parliamentary gift register shows the role played by sporting bodies and provides a dollar amount for the first time. Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had promised a crackdown on gambling advertising following a 2023 parliamentary inquiry ordered by his government that recommended a “comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising for online gambling”.
But he took the issue off the legislative agenda late last year and has left it to be considered by a new parliament to be formed following a May 3 general election that his party is tipped to win by a narrow margin. Polls show that three-quarters of Australians want a ban.
“We know vested interests have been lobbying hard to prevent a ban and the level of soft diplomacy revealed by this analysis of declared gifts to politicians is deeply concerning,” said David Pocock, an independent senator.
“It is appalling that 18 months after the landmark report into online gambling harm, and after a full term of a Labor government, the prime minister has failed to take any meaningful action to ban gambling advertising.”
Albanese and the AFL did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The NRL declined comment.
Such lobbying is not illegal in Australia but individual gifts worth over A$300 received by parliamentarians must be reported to the prime minister’s office, which maintains the parliamentary gift register, a public database.
It shows that politicians from both Australia’s main parties received 312 free tickets between June 28, 2023, when the government report recommended a ban on online gambling advertisements, and March 28 this year when parliament was dissolved.
There was no price ascribed to the tickets but Reuters calculated their value based on the cheapest corporate box seat. The calculations were verified by Hunter Fujak, senior lecturer in sports management at Deakin University, and Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology, Sydney’s Centre for Sport, Business and Society.
“It’s a reasonable estimate, probably on the conservative side,” Harcourt said.
PM, OPPOSITION LEADER GIVEN TICKETS
Albanese received A$29,000 worth of tickets, mostly to grand finals and games played by his NRL home team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the gift register showed.
Peter Dutton, leader of the opposition conservative coalition, received A$21,350 of tickets during the period, the register shows.
Dutton’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
The gifted tickets over the 21-month period compared with tickets worth an estimated A$234,000 given to politicians in the previous parliamentary term from 2019 to 2022, although sports attendance at that time was impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns. Data before 2019 was not available.
Australians lose the most on gambling in the world on a per capita basis, government data shows. Consultancy H2 Gambling Capital estimates gamblers in Australia will lose A$34 billion in 2025. The country’s sports bodies benefit because, unlike in many other countries, they take a percentage cut of money gambled on their games. They also earn revenues from sponsorship and broadcast rights.
In a confidential submission to government, the NRL said the percentage cut it receives from gambling, currently about A$70 million a year, would be more than halved if the ban comes into force, said a person who saw the document. The source declined to be identified because the submission has not been released publicly.
The percentage cut, although a small portion of its A$745 million total revenue in 2024, is the NRL’s fastest-growing revenue stream after increasing fifteen-fold in a decade, the person said.
The NRL meanwhile attributes about one-third of the A$400 million a year it makes in broadcast rights – its main earner – to sports betting advertising, the person said.
Kate Chaney, an independent who was on the parliamentary committee that produced the 2023 report calling for the ban, said Australian sporting bodies were “addicted to gambling money” and “making decisions based on what’s good for their financial viability, not for sport in Australia”.
The government did not respond to questions about the submission and its consultation process, while the NRL declined comment.
LOBBYING GROUP After the report recommending reform was published, the Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports (COMPPS), a lobbying group for the NRL, the AFL and other sports bodies, coordinated a campaign to lobby politicians with consistent messaging against the ban, said three people familiar with the planning.
They declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the topic.
COMPPS members invited politicians to events and seated them close to sports body officials, mostly from the NRL and AFL, who were briefed on how to discuss the impact of the advertising ban, said two people involved in the planning.
The members shared information about which politicians to target based on who was influential in government or passionate about a particular sport, the people added.
COMPPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“You’re not just buying them a ticket in the box and giving them hospitality, you’ve got their ear for the length of the game,” said Charles Livingstone, an associate professor of public health at Monash University and member of the World Health Organisation’s Expert Group on Gambling.
“These guys are in a position to plant ideas and to influence politicians in ways that no one else can.”
Both the NRL and the AFL documented their opposition to the ban in messages to Albanese within days of grand final events attended by the prime minister and other senior politicians last year. The AFL proposed an “alternative … regulatory framework”, according to an October 1 email from the AFL to Albanese. Albanese’s office produced the email following a discovery request by Pocock, the independent senator.
Albanese’s office confirmed it had received the correspondence from both the NRL and AFL but did not give details.
Louis Francis, a public health academic at Curtin University, said the end result – gambling reform stalled in the face of overwhelming public support – was testament to the “friendships and connections” sporting bodies could make by inviting politicians to games.
Free tickets for politicians amounted to “a really small price to pay to get access to political decision makers,” she said. “And the return is great.”

Title: India’s FY25 exports up 5.5% to $821 billion; March sees 2.65% rise
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 06:44:37 +0000
Content: India’s cumulative exports for the financial year 2024–25 (April–March) rose by 5.5% to $820.93 billion, up from $778.13 billion in the previous year, driven by strong performances in key sectors, according to data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.
In March 2025, total exports of goods and services rose 2.65% year-on-year to $73.61 billion. Imports for the month climbed 4.9% to $77.23 billion.
Among the major contributors to merchandise export growth were electronic goods, coffee, tobacco, rice, jute products including floor coverings, meat, dairy and poultry products, tea, carpets, plastics and linoleum, readymade garments of all textiles, drugs and pharmaceuticals, cereal preparations and processed food items, mica, coal, minerals (including processed varieties), engineering goods, and fruits and vegetables.
Electronic goods exports saw a remarkable 32.47% jump, rising from $29.12 billion in FY2023-24 to $38.58 billion in FY2024-25. Coffee exports surged by 40.37%, from $1.29 billion to $1.81 billion, while tobacco exports climbed 36.53%, reaching $1.98 billion from $1.45 billion a year earlier.
Rice exports rose by 19.73% to $12.47 billion, compared to $10.42 billion in FY2023-24. Tea exports also showed positive growth, increasing by 11.84% to $0.92 billion.
Non-petroleum exports during FY2024-25 were valued at $374.08 billion, registering a 6 percent increase over $352.92 billion recorded in the previous year.
Other significant growth segments included meat, dairy, and poultry products, which rose by 12.57% to $5.1 billion; textiles, up by 10.03% to $15.99 billion; and drugs and pharmaceuticals, which recorded a 9.39% rise to $30.47 billion.

Title: India one of preferred markets with resilient macro conditions: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 06:38:48 +0000
Content: A Morgan Stanley report released on Wednesday identified India as one of its top equity market picks, citing resilient macroeconomic conditions and adequate stimulus support.
In the context of the “Brave New World” dynamic shaping the early phase of the new US administration, the global brokerage said, “Among the larger markets, we maintain our core overweight (OW) recommendations on domestic India, domestic Japan, Singapore, and the UAE,” among others.
“We remain most cautious on Taiwan and New Zealand, while we reduce the underweight on Korea and shift to an equal weight (EW) stance on Australia,” it added.
India and Australia have moderate levels of exports and total revenues in listed equities from the US, mainly concentrated in healthcare and IT services (India) and industrials (Australia).
The brokerage sees a relatively resilient outlook for financials earnings, supported by strong capital ratios and a positive asset quality outlook across most of its coverage.
“We particularly like financials in Singapore, India, Chile, the UAE, and Japan,” the report said.
For the most defensive recommendations, the firm advises focusing on markets with high domestic exposure and economies where macro conditions are seen as resilient or sufficiently buffered by stimulus. This includes India (75% domestic), the Philippines (91% domestic), and Malaysia (68% domestic). In contrast, the report expressed caution on domestic growth in Indonesia and Thailand.
According to another Morgan Stanley report released on Tuesday, India’s “low beta” is helping it significantly outperform amid the global selloff—even as the index may approach multi-month lows.
Key India-specific catalysts include continued dovish actions from the RBI, stimulus through GST rate cuts, and a potential trade deal with the US. Morgan Stanley also sees lower food inflation and declining oil prices keeping both food and non-food inflation at benign levels.

Title: US dismisses reports of NATO funding cuts
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 05:50:08 +0000
Content: US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has rejected reports suggesting that the Trump administration plans to reduce US funding for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
During a press briefing on Tuesday, Bruce emphasized that the US remains committed to NATO and aims to strengthen the military alliance as a deterrent, not to help fight wars or fund them. She added that NATO was intended to be a collective defense mechanism to prevent bad actors from taking harmful actions.
“That’s from a story that looks at a memo that was leaked, not from an actual plan or suggestion. What I can tell you is that it concerns me when I see the word ‘eliminate.’ I traveled to NATO for that summit with the Secretary of State. Every meeting, every moment, every time we were on camera, and in every bilateral meeting with the Secretary-General, the one message—among several—was that the Secretary of State of the United States reiterated our full commitment to NATO, as did the President of the United , States”, Bruce said.
“Our commitment means that we want to ensure the nations within NATO can deliver on NATO’s mission, which is to serve as a deterrent. NATO is not meant to fund wars or help fight them; it was designed to prevent bad actors from doing bad things, because it would be too costly for them. At this point, we have nations that need to ramp up, share the burden, and increase their defense spending—not because we’re being difficult, but because we are committed to NATO”, she added.
“Reports claiming the US will end funding for NATO couldn’t be further from the truth. Such stories are nothing but ‘fear-mongering,’ which understandably causes concern. There will be ample opportunity to discuss this when President Trump sends his budget proposal to Congress.”
Bruce acknowledged that NATO members are increasing their defense budgets, recognizing the importance of shared commitment. She emphasized, “A story about eliminating funding for NATO is completely false. This is about strengthening NATO and, dare I say, making it great again. But fear-mongering about this issue is counterproductive and understandably upsets people.”
“As with our review of foreign aid, some things will change, but that doesn’t mean we’ve changed our commitment to NATO. It may look different. If other nations are raising their contributions, perhaps the American contribution could decrease, but NATO would remain stronger. That’s the kind of solution families and allies seek—looking out for each other and being honest”, she added.
Bruce’s comments came after reports suggested the Trump administration might reduce nearly 50 percent of the State Department’s funding for the next fiscal year, including cuts to international organizations like the UN, NATO, and peacekeeping operations.
The memo also proposed reducing funding for humanitarian assistance and global health programs by over 50 percent. It remained unclear whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio had endorsed the memo, which was dated April 10. The seriousness of the proposed cuts in Congress was also uncertain.
According to a US official familiar with the department’s review, the White House is expected to send Congress a budget proposal this spring that may align with the memo’s outline to push lawmakers to formalize ongoing reductions.

Title: Trump maintains position on Canada, believes it would benefit as 51st US state: White House
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 05:17:54 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump still believes Canada would benefit from becoming the 51st state of the United States, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Tuesday.
Responding to a question about whether Trump’s stance on Canada had changed, Leavitt said, “I would reject the notion that the president’s position on Canada has shifted. Perhaps he just hasn’t been asked about Canada recently by members of the press in the Oval Office, where they see him almost every day. However, the president still maintains his position on Canada. The United States has been subsidizing Canada’s national defense, and he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America.”
Trump had previously floated the idea of Canada joining the US and mockingly referred to former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the “Governor of Canada.”
Leavitt also addressed trade-related issues, noting there were no new announcements regarding support for automakers but emphasizing Trump’s flexible approach to negotiations. “His goal is fair trade that puts the American worker first,” she said, adding that the president has been in discussions with automakers and workers who support his efforts.
On Monday, Trump told reporters he was “looking into” potential part-specific tariff exemptions for carmakers, emphasizing the importance of flexibility as companies adjust their supply chains. His comments came shortly after the administration exempted electronic devices—such as smartphones and laptops—from reciprocal tariffs.
Speaking to reporters during a meeting with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele on Monday, Trump said, “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they are switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico, and other places. They’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time — so I’m talking about things like that.”
Trump reiterated his earlier remarks about the need for flexibility during ongoing tariff talks with various nations. “I’m a very flexible person. I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible — and you have to be,” Trump said. “You just can’t have a wall and only a wall. Sometimes, you have to go around it, under it, or above it.”
“There will maybe be things coming… I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to a position of greatness for our country”, the US President added.

Title: From the fringes in France to the heart of LA, shooting welcomes venue decision
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:50:21 +0000
Content: The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has welcomed the sport’s return to the “heart of the Olympic experience” at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles after being held away from the main venue in Paris last year.
The shooting events at the 2024 Games were staged 270km from Paris in Chateauroux, with current ISSF President Luciano Rossi saying it was “a big mistake” by his federation predecessors to accept that venue.
The Italian also vowed to lobby the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ensure shooting was staged within the host city only in 2028.
Olympic organisers announced the venues on Tuesday, with target shooting to take place in a temporary indoor range in Long Beach while the shotgun events will be held at the LA Clays Shooting Sports Park in El Monte – both in LA County.
Rossi said in a statement the shooting community should be “proud and grateful to see our venues right at the heart of the Olympic experience”.
“With determined efforts from my ISSF colleagues, and thanks to excellent co-operation with LA28 and the IOC, our shooting athletes will get the full Olympic Games experience and be at the heart of the action,” he added.
Shooting will have a full programme of 15 events in Los Angeles.

Title: Barcelona reach Champions League semis despite 3-1 loss at Dortmund
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:45:27 +0000
Content: Five-time European champions Barcelona reached their first Champions League semi-final in six seasons with a 5-3 aggregate victory despite being beaten 3-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.
Serhou Guirassy scored a hat-trick for Dortmund to condemn Barca to their first defeat across all competitions this year but it could not prevent the Catalans from reaching the last four.
Barcelona will play either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich, who face each other on Wednesday, in the last four.
“Dortmund did very well. We did not have our best day. I had a feeling something like that would happen today because I know the stadium well,” said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.
“Things didn’t go too well for us but Dortmund played very well. But congratulations to my team, we’re in the semi-finals. We’re happy. I’m really happy for the team and the club.”
The visitors found themselves on the back foot from the start with Dortmund shooting out of the blocks as they attempted to bounce back from last week’s 4-0 first-leg loss.
Dortmund, who drew 2-2 against Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday, had two golden chances in the opening minutes before Guirassy’s chipped penalty in the 11th minute gave them a deserved lead.
The Spaniards, unbeaten in 2025 going into the game, gradually fought their way back and could have levelled were it not for some sloppy finishing from Jules Kounde in the 40th.
After the break, however, Dortmund were again the stronger side at the start and Guirassy headed in after Ramy Bensebaini’s nod from a corner four minutes after the restart to ignite hopes of a potential record-matching comeback.
Dortmund’s attempt to match Barcelona’s Champions League record of overturning a four-goal first-leg deficit in a knockout stage was derailed by Bensebaini’s 54th-minute own goal that settled Spanish nerves.
Robert Lewandowski had put Bensebaini under pressure as he chased a cutback from Fermin Lopez, and the Dortmund player stabbed the ball into his own net.
Lopez then had a chance to score himself in the 64th but his shot missed the target.
Guirassy, the first Dortmund player to score 13 goals in a single Champions League campaign, completed his hat-trick in the 76th, pouncing on a defensive error.
But, with Dortmund, who are struggling in the Bundesliga and risk missing out on Champions League football next season, still needing two more goals to take the game to extra time, the hosts gradually ran out of steam.
“We wanted to play better and more courageously and support each other more on the pitch,” said Dortmund’s Pascal Gross.
“We did that today and it was a completely different game. It’s a shame we didn’t play like that in the first leg as we could have got something out of it.”

Title: After Harvard rejects US demands, Trump adds new threat
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:43:06 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status on Tuesday and said the university should apologize, a day after it rejected what it called unlawful demands to overhaul academic programs or lose federal grants.
Beginning with Columbia University, the Trump administration has rebuked universities across the country over their handling of the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled campuses last year following the 2023 Hamas-led attack inside Israel and the subsequent Israeli attacks on Gaza.
Trump has called the protests anti-American and antisemitic, accused universities of peddling Marxism and “radical left” ideology, and promised to end federal grants and contracts to universities that do not agree to his administration’s demands.
Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday he was mulling whether to seek to end Harvard’s tax-exempt status if it continued pushing what he called “political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?'”
He did not say how he would do this. Under the U.S. tax code, most universities are exempt from federal income tax because they are deemed to be “operated exclusively” for public educational purposes.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Trump wanted to see Harvard apologize for what she called “antisemitism that took place on their college campus against Jewish American students.”
She accused Harvard and other schools of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funding based on race or national origin.
Under Title VI, federal funds can be terminated only after a lengthy investigation and hearings as well as a 30-day notice to Congress, which has not happened at Columbia or Harvard.
Some professors and students have said the protests are being unfairly conflated with antisemitism as a pretext for an unconstitutional attack on academic freedoms.
Columbia, a private school in New York City, agreed to negotiations over demands to tighten its protest rules after the Trump administration said last month it had terminated grants and contracts worth $400 million, mostly for medical and other scientific research.
Harvard President Alan Garber in a letter on Monday said demands the Trump administration made of the Massachusetts university, including an audit to ensure the “viewpoint diversity” of its students and faculty and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs, were unprecedented “assertions of power, unmoored from the law” that violated constitutional free speech and the Civil Rights Act.
Like Columbia, he said Harvard had worked to fight antisemitism and other prejudice on its campus while preserving academic freedoms and the right to protest.
Hours after Garber’s letter, the Trump administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said it was freezing more than $2 billion in contracts and grants to Harvard, the country’s oldest and richest university. The administration did not respond to questions about which grants and contracts had been cut, and Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
Some Columbia professors have sued the Trump administration, saying the grant terminations violated Title VI and their constitutional speech and due process rights. A federal judge in New York ordered the Trump administration to reply by May 1.
After reading the Harvard president’s letter, Columbia’s interim president, Claire Shipman, said in a statement on Monday night that Columbia will continue “good faith discussions” and “constructive dialog” with the U.S. Justice Department’s antisemitism task force.
“We would reject any agreement in which the government dictates what we teach, research, or who we hire,” she wrote.
SUPPORT FROM OTHER SCHOOLS
A few of Harvard’s peer institutions lent support on Tuesday to the school’s stand against the Trump administration.
“Princeton stands with Harvard,” Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber wrote on social media, encouraging people to read the Harvard president’s rebuke of the government’s demands.
Stanford University President Jonathan Levin and Provost Jenny Martinez said in a statement they fully backed Harvard.
“Harvard’s objections to the letter it received are rooted in the American tradition of liberty, a tradition essential to our country’s universities, and worth defending,” the pair wrote.
They added that while universities need to “address legitimate concerns with humility and openness” it’s clear that “the way to bring about constructive change is not by destroying the nation’s capacity for scientific research…”
On Monday, a group of U.S. universities, including Princeton and the University of Illinois, sued the Department of Energy over steep cuts to federal research funding in areas like advanced nuclear technology, cybersecurity and novel radioactive drugs.
Trump, who took office on January 20, faces court challenges to his immigration policies and pushback from state attorneys general against his firing of government workers and suspension of trillions of dollars in federal grants, loans and financial support.

Title: PSG survive Aston Villa scare to reach Champions League semis
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:10:45 +0000
Content: Paris St Germain kept alive their dream of a first Champions League title on Tuesday by squeezing past Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate after a pulsating second leg of their quarter-final which the English side won 3-2.
Ahead 3-1 from the first leg, PSG appeared to have sealed the contest within the first half-hour as their marauding fullbacks Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes scored from two flowing counter-attacks to stun the Villa Park crowd.
But Youri Tielemans revived hope with a 34th-minute deflected goal before Villa stunned the visitors early in the second half with two goals in two minutes from John McGinn and Ezri Konsa.
Villa poured forward, drawing a string of outstanding saves from PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to preserve the aggregate win and enable his side to move into a semi-final against either Real Madrid or Arsenal, who play on Wednesday.
“Aston Villa made it difficult for us but we did what we had to do,” said PSG’s delighted captain Marquinhos.
“It’s such a difficult competition but we’re getting better and better, and we’re proving that we’re such a good team. It’s going to be such a difficult semi-final, whether it’s Arsenal or Real Madrid, but, of course, there is a belief that this Paris St Germain team can go all the way and win it.”
PSG had been hot favourites to win the quarter-final given their first-leg advantage and recent form, including sealing a fourth straight Ligue 1 title and reaching the final of the French Cup.
But Villa were not lacking belief themselves, especially at home where they were on a 17-match unbeaten run in all competitions. The hosts came out flying, nearly taking the lead from a corner in an early flurry of attacks.
FRANTIC FINALE
However, PSG struck first blood in the 11th minute when Hakimi stroked the ball in after Villa’s usually ultra-reliable goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez pushed it into his path.
Sixteen minutes later, Mendes curled in PSG’s second goal off the post at the end of another fast-flowing counter-attack.
Tielemans’s first-half goal inspired a Villa onslaught after the break, with McGinn letting fly from outside the box to score in the 55th minute, helped by a small deflection. Two minutes later, Konza struck Villa’s third on the night after being set up by a brilliant dribble from Marcus Rashford.
Villa’s highest-profile fan, Prince William, was on his feet and one more goal would have put them level on aggregate.
But Donnarumma brilliantly defied Rashford, Tielemans, and then substitute Marco Asensio — on loan from PSG — during a nerve-wracking finale.
“Very proud of the boys, of what we’ve done tonight,” said Konza. “Obviously, the two goals at the start killed us. But we showed great belief, the great character to get back into the game. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough.”
Villa fans gave their team a standing ovation for their sterling performance against the form team of Europe, as PSG’s boisterous away supporters danced and chanted into the rainy Birmingham night.

Title: ‘Not a single tree’: SC extends stay on deforestation near Hyderabad University
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:29:42 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Wednesday extended the stay on tree cutting in 400 acres of land at Kancha Gachibowli in Hyderabad for another month and directed the Wildlife Warden of Telangana to take steps to protect wildlife affected by deforestation in 100 acres.
The bench, consisting of Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih, scheduled the next hearing for May 15, after senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Telangana government, requested four weeks to respond to the report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC).
The CEC had visited the site and submitted its report in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order from April 3.
While granting the state government time to review and respond to the CEC report, the bench ordered that the status quo be maintained and emphasized that no trees should be cut.
The court also directed the Wildlife Warden to examine and implement immediate steps required to protect wildlife impacted by deforestation in the 100 acres.
It further warned that if state government officers attempt to oppose restoration efforts, they would face temporary imprisonment.
The Supreme Court had taken up the matter suo motu on April 3 and stayed further tree cutting.
Protests had erupted from students of Hyderabad Central University (HCU), environmental activists, and opposition parties after authorities began clearing the land near the university for an auction by the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC), intended for the development of IT parks.
The authorities faced criticism from protestors for destroying a crucial green space in the city and disrupting wildlife habitats.
During Wednesday’s hearing, the bench questioned the state government about whether it had obtained permission from the CEC for tree felling.
The bench also inquired about the urgency behind the development activity, which involved the removal of trees from the forest area.
The bench noted their surprise at seeing herbivorous animals in videos running for shelter and being attacked by stray dogs.
Instructing the authorities to present a restoration plan, the bench made it clear that it would go to great lengths to protect the environment.
When senior advocate K. Parameshwar, appearing as amicus curiae, informed the Court about the land being mortgaged to a private party for Rs 10,000 crore, and referenced the CEC report, the bench stated that their primary concern was how so many trees had been felled without permission.
It remarked that it was up to the state whether some of its officers would face temporary imprisonment and urged the state to prioritize the protection of wildlife.

Title: In a first in India, ATM installed onboard train on a trial basis
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:29:36 +0000
Content: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Indian Railways has installed an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) onboard the Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express in Maharashtra, as part of a trial run.
Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared a video of the onboard ATM on X, marking the beginning of the ATM on Wheels initiative. The project aligns with the Railway Board’s directive to explore innovative ways to boost non-fare revenue.
A meeting with potential vendors was held on March 25, during which the idea of installing mobile ATMs on trains was discussed. Following that, the first trial run was conducted on April 10, on the 12110 Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express. The train’s mini pantry space was converted into a secure ATM installation area by the mechanical team.
“The ATM was properly secured for its maiden journey using rubber pads and bolts to isolate vibrations. Two fire extinguishers have also been provided in the allocated space,” Indian Railways stated.
The initiative is part of Indian Railways’ broader transformation drive under Viksit Bharat 2047, aiming to modernize infrastructure, enhance passenger experience, and increase operational efficiency.
In 2024, Indian Railways achieved the complete renewal of 6,450 km of track, 8,550 turnout renewals, and upgraded train speeds to 130 kmph over 2,000 km. Additionally, 3,210 Route Kilometers (Rkm) were electrified, extending the electrified broad-gauge network to 97%, with renewable energy capacity reaching 2,014 MW.
Under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, 1,337 stations have been identified for redevelopment. The Railways also launched 136 Vande Bharat trains and introduced the first Namo Bharat Rapid Rail. During peak seasons, 21,513 special train trips were operated.
In the area of safety, 10,000 locomotives are being equipped with Kavach technology. So far, 9,000 technicians have been trained, and bids have been invited for 15,000 Rkm under the program.

Title: Sensex rises for third day; Nifty near 23,450 as banks lead rally
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:05:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets continued their upward trend for the third straight session on Wednesday, supported by strong buying in financial stocks, especially private banks, and select oil and gas shares.
The Sensex opened 262 points higher at 76,996 but briefly turned negative due to weak global cues amid rising US-China trade tensions. However, it recovered later in the day, rising 556 points from the day’s low to touch a high of 77,110. The index finally closed at 77,044, up 309 points or 0.4 per cent.
In the last three sessions, the Sensex has gained 3,197 points.
The Nifty followed a similar path. It touched a low of 23,273 and later rose to a high of 23,452. The index ended near its high at 23,433, up 104.60 points or 0.45 per cent. The Nifty has now risen by 1,038 points in three days.
Among the top gainers on the Nifty were IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Trent, ONGC, and Asian Paints. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, and Tata Motors were among the laggards.
Sector-wise, all indices ended in the green except auto. Media, PSU banks, and oil & gas sectors led the rally with gains of 1–2 per cent. The broader market also remained firm, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advancing 0.5 per cent each.
Global markets, however, faced pressure. Asian indices declined as investor sentiment was hit by US President Donald Trump’s warning of tariffs up to 245 per cent on Chinese imports. The Hang Seng and Taiwan indices fell nearly 2 per cent each, while Kospi and Nikkei dropped over 1 per cent.
“On the daily chart, the index has closed above the 100-EMA for the second consecutive session. Support is now placed at 23,300, and the positive momentum is likely to persist as long as it holds above this level,” said Rupak De of LKP Securities.
Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities noted that the rupee appreciated for the third consecutive day, supported by foreign inflows, a weaker US dollar, and encouraging economic data. The near-term trend remains bearish for USD-INR, with support at 85.40 and resistance at 86.05.

Title: Israel will keep Gaza buffer zone, minister says, as ceasefire efforts stall
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:55:37 +0000
Content: Israeli troops will remain in the buffer zones they have created in Gaza even after any settlement to end the war, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday, as efforts to revive a ceasefire agreement faltered.
Since resuming their operation last month, Israeli forces have carved out a broad “security zone” extending deep into Gaza and squeezing more than 2 million Palestinians into ever smaller areas in the south and along the coastline.
“Unlike in the past, the IDF is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,” Katz said in a statement following a meeting with military commanders, adding that “tens of percent” of Gaza had been added to the zone.
“The IDF will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and the communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza – as in Lebanon and Syria.”
In southern Gaza alone, Israeli forces have seized about 20% of the enclave’s territory, taking control of the border city of Rafah and pushing inland up to the so-called “Morag corridor” that runs from the eastern edge of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea between Rafah and the city of Khan Younis.
It already held a wide corridor across the central Netzarim area and has extended a buffer zone all around the border hundreds of metres inland, including the Shejaia area just to the east of Gaza City in the north.
Israel says its forces have killed hundreds of Hamas fighters, including many senior commanders of the Palestinian militant group, but the operation has alarmed the United Nations and European countries.
More than 400,000 Palestinians have been displaced since hostilities resumed on March 18 after two months of relative calm, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, and Israeli air strikes and bombardments have killed at least 1,630 people.
Medical charity MSF said Gaza had become a “mass grave” with humanitarian groups struggling to provide aid. “We are witnessing in real time the destruction and forced displacement of the entire population in Gaza,” Amande Bazerolle, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Gaza said in a statement.
Katz said Israel, which has blocked the delivery of aid supplies into the territory, was creating infrastructure to allow distribution through civilian companies at a later date. But he said the blockade on aid would remain in place.
He said Israel would push forward with a plan to allow Gazans who wished to leave the enclave to do so, although it remains unclear which countries would be willing to accept large numbers of Palestinians.
RED LINES
The comments from Katz, repeating Israel’s demand on Hamas to disarm, underscore how far away the two sides remain from any ceasefire agreement, despite efforts by Egyptian mediators to revive efforts to reach a deal.
Hamas has repeatedly described calls to disarm as a red line it will not cross and has said Israeli troops must withdraw from Gaza under any permanent ceasefire.
“Any truce lacking real guarantees for halting the war, achieving full withdrawal, lifting the blockade, and beginning reconstruction will be a political trap,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.
Two Israeli officials said this week that there had been no progress in the talks despite media reports of a possible truce to allow the exchange of some of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners.
Israeli officials have said the increased military pressure will force Hamas to release the hostages but the government has faced large demonstrations by Israeli protesters demanding a deal to stop the fighting and get them back.
Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the October 2023 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
The offensive has killed at least 51,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and devastated the coastal enclave, forcing most of the population to move multiple times and reducing broad areas to rubble.
On Wednesday, Palestinian medical authorities said an airstrike killed 10 people, including Fatema Hassouna, a well-known writer and photographer who had documented the war. A strike on another house further north killed three, they said.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israel’s suspension of the entry of fuel, medical, and food supplies since early March had begun to obstruct the work of the few remaining working hospitals, with medical supplies drying up.
“Hundreds of patients and wounded individuals are deprived of essential medications, and their suffering is worsening due to the closure of border crossings,” the ministry said.

Title: India has potential to become world’s second-largest economy: Mark Mobius
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:52:00 +0000
Content: India has the potential to become the world’s second-largest economy if it continues on its current path of resilience and policy continuity, according to billionaire investor Mark Mobius.
In recent years, India has surged from being the 11th-largest economy to the fifth-largest. As of 2025, it remains behind only the US, China, Germany, and Japan in terms of total GDP.
According to the latest IMF estimates, India’s real GDP is expected to reach $4.3 trillion in 2025—just behind Japan’s $4.4 trillion and Germany’s $4.9 trillion. On its current trajectory, India is projected to surpass Japan this year and overtake Germany by 2027.
Speaking to IANS, Mobius said India could potentially rise to the second spot globally.
“India now has a substantially larger population than China. It’s now estimated that China’s population may be 800 million or less, with an average age much higher than India’s 1.2 billion people,” he said.
He added that if India removes import restrictions—both tariff and non-tariff—the manufacturing sector could thrive, driving the economy forward.
Mobius, who runs the Mobius EM Opportunities Fund for emerging markets, also commented on India’s stock market performance amid global uncertainties. He noted that even before US trade restrictions came into play, the Indian market had undergone a significant correction.
“There will be a recovery in the market, so it’s a good time for investors to begin averaging into strong stocks. For those already holding, it’s best to wait and ride out the recovery,” he advised.
Indian markets made a remarkable comeback recently, with a single-day rally on Tuesday adding Rs 11 lakh crore to investors’ wealth—wiping out all losses triggered by the US tariff shock on April 2. The recovery was broad-based, driven by strong investor sentiment and upbeat global and domestic cues.

Title: Gold hits new high, climbs over Rs 95,000 on MCX
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:39:24 +0000
Content: Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) surged to yet another record high on Wednesday, fueled by a weakening US dollar and escalating global trade tensions. As of 3:07 PM, gold was trading at ₹95,172 per 10 grams, after reaching an all-time high of ₹95,435.”
Gold prices globally have also been hitting fresh highs, surpassing USD 3,300 per ounce.
The latest rise in global gold prices is also attributed to strong demand, including investments from various central banks through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Persistent geopolitical tensions have further boosted gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.
Gold is often considered a hedge against uncertainty, and the returns in recent times have been remarkable.
Publicly available data shows that gold prices have surged at an unprecedented pace in 2025, rising over 20 per cent so far. Over the past year, they have climbed around 40 per cent.
According to Sachin Jain, Regional CEO (India) at the World Gold Council (WGC), the fundamentals of gold as an asset class remain ‘very strong’ and are expected to remain so throughout the year.

Title: Karad sets benchmark in sanitary waste management with 100% safe disposal
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:16:05 +0000
Content: Karad, a small city in Maharashtra’s Satara district, has achieved 100% segregation, collection, and processing of sanitary and biomedical waste, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs announced on Wednesday.
According to the statement, the city collects an average of 300 to 350 kg of sanitary waste daily—including sanitary napkins, diapers, and other hygiene products—from hospitals, clinics, households, and public facilities.
Women-led groups have played a key role in spreading awareness at the community level. Red bins placed in public toilets ensure proper disposal, while schools have installed sanitary pad vending machines, incinerators, and disposal systems to promote hygienic practices among adolescents.
Sanitary waste is collected through dedicated bins mounted on garbage vehicles and sent to a high-temperature incinerator run by the Karad Hospital Association. This Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) incinerates waste at up to 1200°C, under real-time monitoring by the State Pollution Control Board.
The initiative runs on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, where the municipal council manages collection and transport, and the hospital body operates the 600 kg/day incinerator. The facility is provided at no cost to citizens, ensuring sustainable and efficient waste management.

Title: China responds to 245% US tariff: “Ask US for details”
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:59:12 +0000
Content: Reacting to the White House’s claim that China now faces tariffs of up to 245% on exports to the United States, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged reporters to “ask the US side for specific tax rate figures.”
Addressing a press briefing on Wednesday, Lin reiterated China’s consistent position on the issue, saying that the tariff dispute was initiated by the US. He maintained that Beijing’s countermeasures were taken to safeguard its legitimate rights and uphold international fairness and justice, describing them as both “reasonable and legal.”
Lin emphasized that tariff and trade wars yield no winners. “China does not want to fight these wars, but we are not afraid of them,” he said. Reaffirming China’s stance, he added that the country remains committed to collaboration and removing trade barriers.
In a post on X, Lin said, “In a world full of uncertainties, China remains committed to joining hands, not throwing punches; removing barriers, not erecting walls; promoting connectivity, not pursuing decoupling.”
He also underscored China’s role in the global economy, saying, “China is the world’s market and a source of opportunities for every country.”
Lin’s comments came after the White House released a fact sheet claiming China’s retaliatory tariffs have led to an effective rate of up to 245% on exports to the US. Previously, Chinese exports faced a 145% tariff.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on several countries with which the US has trade deficits. However, following talks initiated by many nations, the administration paused the higher tariffs for 90 days—with the exception of China, which retaliated.
The White House noted that more than 75 countries have already engaged in discussions to negotiate new trade deals.
“As a result, the individualized higher tariffs are currently paused amid these discussions, except for China, which retaliated,” the fact sheet stated.
For now, a baseline tariff of 10% will apply to all US imports. Trump’s broader trade strategy, titled the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan,” aims to impose matching tariffs on countries with which the US has significant trade imbalances, citing national security and economic fairness as key concerns.
At Tuesday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed Trump’s stance on China. When asked whether the President would consider easing tariffs to facilitate the TikTok deal, Leavitt said, “The President has made his position on China quite clear.”
She read an additional comment from Trump, stating, “The ball is in China’s court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don’t have to make a deal with them.”
She added, “There’s no difference between China and any other country, except they are much larger. And China wants what we have — the American consumer. Or to put it another way, they need our money.”
Trump’s trade moves have triggered turbulence in global financial markets, with major sell-offs in both Asia and Europe. Analysts warn that prolonged trade tensions could lead to inflationary pressures and dampen global economic growth.
Since beginning his second term, President Trump has doubled down on his tariff reciprocity policy, including with nations like India, vowing to match any tariffs imposed on the US to ensure balanced trade relationships.
