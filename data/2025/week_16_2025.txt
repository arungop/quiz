Title: Ukraine says 21 killed by Russian ballistic missile strike on Sumy
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:06:41 +0000
Content: At least 21 people were killed and 83 others were wounded by a Russian ballistic missile strike in the heart of the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday morning, Ukraine’s interior minister Ihor Klymenko said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the attack – one of the deadliest strikes on Ukraine this year – and called for a tough international reaction against Moscow.
“Only scoundrels can act like this. Taking the lives of ordinary people,” he wrote on social media, alongside a chilling video which showed corpses on the ground, a destroyed bus and burnt-out cars in the middle of a city street.
“And this is on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s Entry into Jerusalem,” Zelenskiy said.
Interior minister Klymenko said the victims were on the street, in vehicles, public transport and in buildings when the strike hit.
“Deliberate destruction of civilians on an important church feast day,” he wrote.
Reuters was seeking comment from Russian authorities.
Andriy Kovalenko, a security official who runs Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, noted that the strike came after a visit to Moscow by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Russia is building all this so-called diplomacy … around strikes on civilians,” he wrote on Telegram.
Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in St. Petersburg on the search for a Ukraine peace deal, as Trump told Russia to “get moving”.
In the aftermath of Sunday’s strike, Zelenskiy called on the U.S. and Europe to get tough on Russia in response to what he described as terrorism.
“Russia wants exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out this war. Without pressure on the aggressor, peace is impossible. Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs,” he wrote.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently holds about 20% of the country’s territory in the east and south. Russian forces have been slowly advancing in the east of late, though missile and drone strikes now dominate the war.
Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine had carried out five attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the previous day in what it called a violation of a U.S.-brokered moratorium on such strikes.
Ukraine and Russia agreed to pause strikes on each other’s energy facilities last month, but both sides have repeatedly accused each other of breaking the moratorium.

Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:46:20 +0000
Content: Homes were flooded and roads turned into muddy rivers after torrential rainfall over the Spanish Canary Island of Lanzarote, a popular year-round tourist destination.
A state of emergency was declared after 6 cm (2.4 inches) of rain fell in two hours on Saturday, emergency services said on Sunday.
Dramatic video footage showed a surge of brown flood water streaming under a bridge while bystanders took pictures and cars were stuck on flooded roads.
Enrique Espinosa, head of emergency services for the Lanzarote government, said some homes had been submerged.
“We have been working all night, attending 300 calls overnight, many of them in Arrecife and Teguise. Some houses are flooded and what remains is a great quantity of mud,” Espinosa told RTVE state television on Sunday.
No one has been injured in the flooding, authorities said.

Title: Sundays on Cycle: India pedals forward with over 300 events nationwide on April 13
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 11:42:28 +0000
Content: India witnessed yet another vibrant edition of the ‘Fit India Sundays on Cycle’, with over 300 events conducted simultaneously across the country. Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, Sports, flagged off the national capital’s edition at New Moti Bagh, energising the crowd and reinforcing the national momentum towards fitness.
Communities, athletes, police departments, and residents across the nation pedalled with purpose, celebrating fitness, fun, and environmental awareness under the campaign led by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.
New Moti Bagh Club played host to an energetic rally with around 350 residents from various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) pedalling in unison. Sunday’s event, a collaboration between local RWAs and Fit India, focused on fighting obesity and encouraging healthier habits among city dwellers.
Sujata Chaturvedi, secretary, sports, joined the event and encouraged the enthusiastic crowd. She spoke about the momentum Fit India has gained over time.
She said, “Fit India is a nationwide popular movement. It has seen many different kinds of activities and is gaining popularity across all sections of society. As we speak, lakhs of people have already joined Sundays on Cycle across the country.
“Today alone, about 300 events are taking place. We also had the Fit India carnival in JLN Stadium, which was mentioned in the Honourable Prime Minister’s Mann ki Baat. All these efforts are creating the right kind of environment for fitness and wellness in India,” she said.
The event also featured special guests including Nitesh Siwach, a Greco-Roman wrestler, who recently clinched a bronze medal in the 97 kg category at the 2025 Asian Wrestling Championships in Amman, Jordan, and Rohtash Choudhary, popularly known as the ‘Push-Up Man of India,’ who holds multiple Guinness World Records, including performing 645 push-ups in one hour while carrying a 60 lb pack with one leg raised.
Nitesh Siwach praised the increasing awareness among people on improving their health.
“Fitness is an integral part of our lives. Mental and physical fitness is our true wealth. It is really good to see initiatives like these where people are coming together to cycle, and are in general becoming conscious about better health. I’m glad Fit India is doing this, and I hope it keeps growing,” he told SAI Media.
At SAI RC Imphal, renowned Indian weightlifter and Padma Shri awardee Kunjarani Devi flagged off the cycling rally, lending her support to the fitness cause. Her presence inspired hundreds to take the pledge toward healthier living and cleaner cities.

Title: India’s semiconductor industry likely to double revenue to $108 bn by 2030: Report
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 10:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian semiconductor industry’s revenues are likely to double from $54 billion to $108 billion between 2025 to 2030, according to a report by financial services firm UBS.
The report expects India to gain amid the US-China tariff war that will put the communist giant at a disadvantage and see India emerging as a stronger alternative for global giants looking to set up supply chains.
The report sees strong growth ahead for the market, including a localisation opportunity, which is expected to generate $13 billion in revenues in 2030.
UBS said this 15 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) estimate is faster than our forecast for the global semiconductor end market thanks to India’s favourable demographics fuelling strong electronics demand (and in turn semiconductors), rising enterprise adoption of advanced semiconductors, and favourable government policies.
India accounts for only 0.1 per cent of global wafer capacity, around 1 per cent of annual equipment spending, and a 6.5 per cent semiconductor end-demand share, the report states.
According to the report, major tech companies are evaluating the relocation of their supply chains amid the ongoing tariff uncertainties triggered by the Donald Trump administration in the US.
A few companies have already embarked on their “China plus one” strategy by diversifying their final assembly locations beyond China, the report points out.
India’s tech advantage lies mostly in its vast talent pool in the software and services industry, whereas mainland China’s dominance is in tech manufacturing.
In semiconductors, too, India has a unique advantage, with around 20 per cent of global chip designers working in the country for multinational corporations, the report points out.
Despite these uncertainties, the US and mainland China are the top end-markets. India, at 6.5 per cent, is a solid end market for global semiconductors, with $54 billion in revenues in 2025, the report added.

Title: India, Nepal agree on joint steps to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:51:41 +0000
Content: India and Nepal have decided to strengthen measures to check cross-border smuggling of gold, narcotics, fake currency notes and other goods such as e-cigarettes, according to a statement issued by the Finance Ministry on Sunday.
The issue was discussed at the 21st Director-General level talks on Customs Cooperation held between the two countries in Kathmandu on April 10-11. The Indian delegation was led by Abhai Kumar Srivastav, Director-General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Department of Revenue, while the Nepali delegation was led by Mahesh Bhattarai, Director-General, Department of Customs, Nepal.
It was acknowledged that smuggling of goods has been a common challenge, and both sides looked forward towards cooperation in preventing smuggling across the borders with active engagement and exchange of intelligence. Both nations agreed to take necessary measures to control the unauthorised trade and work in tandem.
Nepal is a priority partner of India under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy. India accounts for two-thirds of Nepal’s exports and is the largest trade partner of Nepal. The bilateral talks on Customs cooperation are an important mechanism to facilitate genuine trade as well as to prevent illicit trade along the border in an interconnected world.
The meeting also reviewed progress on MoU on Pre-arrival Exchange of Customs Data and Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES); finalisation of Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA); facilitation of movement of transit cargo under Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS); automation and digitisation of transit processes; upgradation of border infrastructure; knowledge sharing program and support for capacity development, among others.
Both sides emphasised on collaborating in areas that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and customs operations across the border that deliver significant economic benefits to both countries. It was mutually agreed to consider new technologies for facilitating trade and preventing smuggling of goods.
The meeting concluded on an optimistic note. The Nepali side expressed their gratitude to the Government of India, particularly the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), for knowledge sharing and capacity enhancement programmes for Nepal Customs officials at different levels, the statement added.

Title: WHO members close to accord on tackling future pandemics
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:14:53 +0000
Content: Members of the World Health Organization are close to a deal on a treaty to prepare for future pandemics, sources involved in the talks told Reuters on Saturday, with a WHO spokesperson saying discussions had been paused until Tuesday.
The pact, which has been arduously negotiated for three years and which would be legally binding, is intended to shore up the world’s defences against new pathogens after the COVID-19 pandemic killed millions of people in 2020-22.
“They (the talks) went overnight until 9 a.m. (Saturday) but didn’t manage to resolve the final issues,” one source involved in the discussions in Geneva said.
A diplomatic source in Geneva added that “big advancement was made … almost all the treaty was agreed upon with few outstanding yet crucial issues”.
The talks missed a key deadline last year despite several rounds of late-night talks.
The negotiating body’s co-chair had earlier told the AFP news agency that it had reached an agreement “in principle”.
The United States, which was slow to join the early talks, left the discussions this year after new President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February withdrawing from the WHO and barring participation in the talks.
The other 192 members of the WHO who joined the discussions would be free to ratify the deal or not after it is formally adopted.
One of the most contentious issues between wealthy countries and developing states is how to share drugs and vaccines fairly to avoid the mistakes of the COVID era.
The negotiations have been vexed throughout by allegations from right-wing commentators, including in the U.S. but also Britain and Australia, that they could undermine national sovereignty by giving too much power to a U.N. agency.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rejects such assertions, and says the accord would help countries better guard against pandemic outbreaks.
This week in Geneva, a small group of campaigners protested against the talks with one holding up a sign with a fanged snake uncoiling itself from the WHO symbol, with the motto: “WHO ARE YOU TO TAKE AWAY MY FREEDOMS?!”
The agreement, if finalised, would be a historic victory for the global health agency. Only once in the WHO’s 75-year history have its member countries agreed to a treaty – a tobacco control accord in 2003.

Title: Irish regulator investigates X over use of EU personal data to train Grok AI
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 07:24:02 +0000
Content: Ireland’s data regulator on Saturday said it had opened an investigation into social media platform X over the use of personal data collected from European Union users to train its AI system Grok.
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is the lead EU regulator for X due to the location of its EU operations in the country. It has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue under the EU’s strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The inquiry will look at “the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models,” the DPC said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have criticised EU regulation of U.S. companies and described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation.
X owner Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a top adviser to Trump, has also railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content.
The decision follows a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems.
X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent. The Irish regulator ended its court proceedings weeks later, saying X had agreed the limits on a permanent basis.
The powerful Irish privacy regulator has fined the likes of Microsoft’s  LinkedIn, TikTok and Meta  since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018. Its fines to date of Meta total almost 3 billion euros.
X, or Twitter as it was then called, has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020, the first penalty the regulator handed out under the new data privacy system.

Title: ‘May this festival bring new hope, happiness’, Prez Murmu, PM Modi extend greetings on Baisakhi
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 06:11:38 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the nation on the occasion of Baisakhi, saying that the festival would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the nation’s development.
Baisakhi, one of the biggest festivals marks the foundation day of the Khalsa Panth (Sikh order) by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, and also the start of the harvest season.
President Murmu, in a post on X, extended her heartfelt greetings to all Indians living in India and abroad.
The day is also celebrated in different parts of the country as Vishu, Bohag Bihu, Poila Boishakh, Meshadi, Vaishakhadi and Puthandu Pirapu, she said.
“These festivals celebrated at the time of harvest in various parts of India symbolise our social traditions and unity in diversity. Through these festivals we honour the hard work of our ‘Annadata’ farmers and express our gratitude to them. These festivals also give the message of preserving nature and protecting our cultural legacy,” President Murmu said in her post.
She hoped that these vibrant festivals would motivate people to work with commitment and dedication for the development of our nation.
Prime Minister Modi wished everyone a joyous Baisakhi and prayed that the festival brings happiness to everyone’s life.
He wrote on his X handle,” May this festival bring new hope, happiness and abundance into your life. May we always celebrate the spirit of togetherness, gratitude and renewal.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also wished that the festival brings joy to everyone’s life.
“Heartiest greetings to all of you on the holy festival of Baisakhi. I wish that this festival of joy and enthusiasm brings happiness, prosperity and good health to everyone’s life,” he said.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the festival is a symbol of the country’s rich farming traditions.
He wrote in X (in Hindi, loosely translated as), “Heartiest congratulations to all the farmers, Sikh brothers and the people of the state on the auspicious festival of Baisakhi, a symbol of India’s rich farming traditions and glorious heritage! May this festival of joy and happiness, Baisakhi, bring prosperity and happiness to everyone’s life.”
Crowds of devotees on Sunday thronged gurdwaras across Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country to celebrate Baisakhi.
The Golden Temple in Amritsar, one of Sikhism’s holiest shrines, was tastefully decorated, and many devotees came to offer prayers. Many consider taking the holy dip in the Golden Temple sarovar as significant to mark the day. Some devotees even stayed overnight on the Golden Temple premises to take the dip in the early hours. Day-long langars (community kitchens) have been organised to mark the day.
Besides the Golden Temple, people took a holy dip in scores of historic gurdwaras across Punjab. A sea of devotees was also witnessed at the Takht Kesgarh Sahib in the holy city of Anandpur Sahib, where the Khalsa Panth was founded in 1699.

Title: PM Modi pays tributes to Jallianwala Bagh massacre martyrs
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:48:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to the lives lost in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as India commemorates the 106th anniversary of the dark day on Sunday.
The massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, when Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered British Indian Army troops to open fire on a peaceful gathering of thousands at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar.
Taking to X, PM Modi posted, “We pay homage to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh. The coming generations will always remember their indomitable spirit. It was indeed a dark chapter in our nation’s history. Their sacrifice became a major turning point in India’s freedom struggle.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also commemorated the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, referring to it as “a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle”.
He highlighted that the brutality of British rule ignited widespread anger among Indians, transforming the freedom movement into a mass struggle.
“The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is a dark chapter in India’s freedom struggle that shook the entire country. The anger that arose among the countrymen due to the cruelty of the British rule, which had reached the pinnacle of inhumanity, turned the freedom movement into a struggle of the masses,” HM Shah wrote in a post on X.
“I pay my tribute to the martyrs who were martyred in Jallianwala Bagh. The country will always cherish the immortal martyrs in its memories,” he added.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also honoured the martyrs, referring to Jallianwala Bagh as a “sacred pilgrimage for all patriots”. He praised the bravery of those who sacrificed their lives.
Taking to the social media platform X, CM Yogi wrote in a post, “Millions of salutes to the immortal martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh! Jallianwala Bagh is a sacred pilgrimage for all patriots, where the brave sons of the motherland sacrificed their lives while resisting the barbarity of the British rule.”
“The sacrifice of the immortal revolutionaries of Jallianwala Bagh is the immortal saga of the self-respect and freedom of the nation, which will always inspire,” he added.
On April 13, 1919, women, children, and the elderly were going about their usual routines in the park, some resting after visiting the Golden Temple. A group of individuals staged a silent protest against the Rowlatt Act (also known as the Black Act), which allowed the British government to imprison anyone without a trial.
Without warning, the protestors were surrounded by the British forces. They opened fire on the people in the park, which only stopped when the soldiers nearly ran out of ammunition.
Although the exact number of casualties is still debated, official records estimate that at least 379 people were killed. However, other sources suggest the death toll may be over 1,000, with more than 1,500 individuals wounded. The incident sparked widespread outrage and intensified the Indian struggle for independence.
Today, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site, situated in Amritsar, Punjab and managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, has been turned into a garden and memorial.
Located near the Golden Temple complex, it serves to honour the memory of those who were killed and wounded in the massacre on April 13, 1919. The site features a museum, a gallery, and several memorial structures.

Title: Iran, US hold ‘positive’ talks in Oman, agree to resume next week
Publication Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:06:03 +0000
Content: Iran and the U.S. said they held “positive” and “constructive” talks in Oman on Saturday and agreed to reconvene next week in a dialogue meant to address Tehran’s escalating nuclear programme, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if there is no deal.
“I think we are very close to a basis for negotiations and if we can conclude this basis next week, we’ll have gone a long way and will be able to start real discussions based on that,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state television.
Araqchi said the talks – the first between Iran and a Trump administration, including his 2017-2021 first term – took place in a “productive, calm and positive atmosphere”.
“Both sides have agreed to continue the talks … probably next Saturday,” Araqchi added. “Iran and the U.S. side want an agreement in the short term. We do not want talks for (the sake of) talks.”
The White House called the talks involving Trump’s Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff, U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima and Araqchi “very positive and constructive.”
“These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” it said in a statement. “The sides agreed to meet again next Saturday.”
Asked about the talks, Trump told reporters on Saturday night: “I think they’re going OK.”
“Nothing matters until you get it done, so I don’t like talking about it, but it’s going OK. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said on Air Force One.
Trump made a surprise announcement on Monday that Washington and Tehran would begin talks in Oman, a Gulf state that has mediated between the West and the Islamic Republic before. It has brokered the release of several foreign citizens and dual nationals held by Iran.
BOTH SIDES FAR APART
Saturday’s exchanges were indirect and mediated by Oman, as Iran had wanted, rather than face-to-face, as Trump had demanded. Each delegation had its separate room and exchanged messages via Oman’s foreign minister, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei.
Araqchi said his delegation had a brief encounter with its U.S. counterpart headed by Witkoff, after they exited the talks.
“After the end of more than 2-1/2 hours of indirect talks, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks. It (the encounter) was based on our political etiquette,” Araqchi said.
“The current focus of the talks will be de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges and limited agreements to ease sanctions (against Iran) in exchange for controlling Iran’s nuclear programme,” an Omani source told Reuters.
Baghaei denied this account but did not specify what was false.
Trump, who in his first term withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 big-power accord with Tehran, has again brought a tougher approach to a Middle Eastern power whose nuclear programme Washington’s ally Israel regards as an existential threat.
At the same time, Iran and allied groups have been weakened by the military offensives Israel has launched across the region, including air strikes in Iran, during its war with Hamas after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza in October 2023.
Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international bodies in Vienna, called the statements issued by both sides after the talks “encouraging”.
Tehran approached the talks warily, sceptical they could yield a deal and suspicious of Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not halt its accelerating uranium enrichment programme – regarded by the West as a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.
While each side has talked up the chances of some progress, they remain far apart on a dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons capability, but Western countries and Israel believe it is covertly trying to develop the means to build an atomic bomb.
“This is a beginning. So it is normal at this stage for the two sides to present to each other their fundamental positions through the Omani intermediary,” Baghaei said.
Signs of progress could help cool tensions in a region aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, missile fire between Iran and Israel, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the overthrow of the government in Syria.
HIGH STAKES
However, failure would aggravate fears of a wider conflagration across a region that exports much of the world’s oil. Tehran has cautioned neighbouring countries that have U.S. bases that they would face “severe consequences” if they were involved in any U.S. military attack on the OPEC member.
“There is a chance for initial understanding on further negotiations if the other party (U.S.) enters the talks with an equal stance,” Araqchi told Iranian TV.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on key state matters, has given Araqchi “full authority” for the talks, an Iranian official told Reuters.
Iran has ruled out negotiating its defence capabilities such as its ballistic missile programme.
Western nations say Iran’s enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel source, has gone far beyond the requirements of a civilian energy programme and has produced stocks at a level of fissile purity close to those required in warheads.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers, including Russia and China, in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran’s nuclear programme has leaped forward, including by enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a technical step from the levels needed for a bomb.

Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:30:05 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah extended warm wishes on the occasion of Bohag Bihu in Assam.  
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Bohag Bihu wishes to you all!”
As Bohag or Rongali Bihu marks the beginning of the Assamese New Year, the Prime Minister also added, “May the new year bring new beginnings, happiness, and prosperity in all that you do. Praying for everyone’s good health and fulfilment of all aspirations.”
Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma thanked PM Modi for his wishes on Bihu.
In an X post, CM Sarma said, “Adarniya Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, thank you so much for your Bohag Bihu wishes. As the Assamese New Year is set to begin, we recall your many visits to Assam during this time and your celebrations with the people of the state.”
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also posted on X, saying, “Warm greetings to our sisters and brothers of Assam on the occasion of Bohag Bihu. May the joy of welcoming the Assamese New Year, vibrating on the banks of the Brahmaputra, invite prosperity and well-being for everyone.”
CM Sarma, while thanking HM Shah, wrote on his X handle, “Thank you so much for your wishes on Bohag Bihu, Adarniya Griha Mantri Shri @AmitShah ji. With your constant guidance, Assam is ringing in the New Year in an atmosphere of peace and prosperity.”
Rongali Bihu, or Bohag, the most cherished of the three Bihus, marks the Assamese New Year and the arrival of spring. It is more than just a festival — it’s an emotion deeply woven into the cultural soul of the people of Assam.
The state is gripped by Bihu fever, with people enthusiastically celebrating the festival on Monday. Across Assam, Bihu committees are organising grand functions — from traditional dance competitions to musical nights, where local artists and cultural icons will take center stage. Youth groups are rehearsing tirelessly, ready to set the stage ablaze with their energy and pride.
In the villages, the celebration remains rooted — rustic, warm, and full of life. The sound of laughter mingles with music as people come together to celebrate nature’s bounty, community spirit, and the timeless bond between humans and the land they call home.
Even in cities, where modern life rushes forward, Bihu brings everyone back to their roots. Offices and schools close for the festivities, and people return to their hometowns, drawn by the irresistible call of tradition, family, and celebration.

Title: Back to Russian gas? Trump-wary EU has energy security dilemma
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:04:43 +0000
Content: More than three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe’s energy security is fragile.
U.S. liquefied natural gas helped to plug the Russian supply gap in Europe during the 2022-2023 energy crisis.
But now that President Donald Trump has rocked relationships with Europe established after World War Two, and turned to energy as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, businesses are wary that reliance on the United States has become another vulnerability.
Against this backdrop, executives at major EU firms have begun to say what would have been unthinkable a year ago: that importing some Russian gas, including from Russian state giant Gazprom could be a good idea.
That would require another major policy shift given that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 made the European Union pledge to end Russian energy imports by 2027.
Europe has limited options. Talks with LNG giant Qatar for more gas have stalled, and while the deployment of renewables has accelerated, the rate is not fast enough to allow the EU to feel secure.
“If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60 billion cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG,” Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at France’s Engie, told Reuters in an interview.
The French state partly owns Engie, which used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.
GERMAN PIVOT
France, which produces large amounts of nuclear power, already has one of the most diversified energy supplies in Europe.
Germany relied heavily on cheap Russian gas to help drive its manufacturing sector until the Ukraine war and has fewer options.
In Leuna Chemical Park, one of Germany’s biggest chemical clusters hosting plants of Dow Chemical and Shell among others, some makers say Russian gas should return quickly.
Russia used to cover 60% of local needs, mainly through the Nord Stream pipeline, which was blown up in 2022.
“We are in a severe crisis and can’t wait,” said Christof Guenther, managing director of InfraLeuna, the operator of the park.
He said the German chemical industry has cut jobs for five quarters in a row, something not seen for decades.
“Reopening pipelines would reduce prices more than any current subsidy programmes,” he said.
“It’s a taboo topic,” Guenther added, saying many colleagues agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas.
Almost a third of Germans voted for Russia-friendly parties in the February federal election.
In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the east German region where the Nord Stream pipeline comes ashore after running from Russia under the Baltic Sea, 49% of Germans want a return to Russian gas supplies, a poll carried out by the Forsa Institute found.
“We need Russian gas, we need cheap energy – no matter where it comes from,” said Klaus Paur, managing director of Leuna-Harze, a mid-sized petrochemical maker at the Leuna Park. “We need Nord Stream 2 because we have to keep energy costs in check.”
The industry wants the federal government to find cheap energy, said Daniel Keller, economy minister for the state of Brandenburg – home to the Schwedt refinery, co-owned by Russian oil firm Rosneft but held in German government trusteeship.
“We can imagine resuming the intake or transport of Russian oil after peace is established in Ukraine,” Keller said.
TRUMP FACTOR
U.S. gas covered 16.7% of EU imports last year – behind Norway with 33.6% and Russia with 18.8%.
Russia’s share will drop below 10% this year after Ukraine shut pipelines. The remaining flows are mainly LNG from Novatek.
The EU is preparing to buy more U.S. LNG as Trump wants Europe to lower its trade surplus with the United States.
“For sure, we will need more LNG,” EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said last week.
The tariff war has strengthened Europe’s concern about reliance on U.S. gas, said Tatiana Mitrova, a research fellow at Columbia University’s Centre on Global Energy Policy.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to regard U.S. LNG as a neutral commodity: at a certain point it might become a geopolitical tool,” Mitrova added.
If the trade war escalates, there is a small risk the United States could hold back on LNG exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management.
A senior EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed, saying no one could rule out “that this leverage is used”.
In the event U.S. domestic gas prices surge because of rising industrial and AI demand, the U.S. could curtail exports to all markets, Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, said.
In 2022, the EU set itself a non-binding goal to end Russian gas imports by 2027, but has twice delayed publishing plans on how. An EU Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the companies’ comments.
ARBITRATION
Several EU firms have opened arbitration cases against Gazprom for non-delivery of gas following the Ukraine war.
Courts awarded Germany’s Uniper and Austria’s OMV 14 billion euros and 230 million euros respectively. Germany’s RWE has claimed 2 billion euros, while Engie and other firms have not disclosed their claim.
Engie’s Holleaux said Kyiv could allow Russia to send gas via Ukraine to meet arbitration repayments as a starting point of resuming contractual relationships with Gazprom.
“You (Gazprom) want to come back to the market? Very good, but we won’t sign a new contract if you don’t pay the award,” Holleaux said.
The return of Russian gas worries Maxim Timchenko, the chief of DTEK, Ukraine’s private gas company, which hopes to import U.S. LNG into Ukraine’s storage and export it to Europe.
“It’s hard to comment, being Ukrainian, but my hope is that European politicians learned their lessons dealing with Russia,” Timchenko said. used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas. Holleaux said Russia could supply around 20-25% of EU needs, down from 40% before the war.
The head of French oil major Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, has warned Europe against over-relying on U.S. gas.
“We need to diversify, many routes, not over-rely on one or two,” Pouyanne told Reuters. Total is a large exporter of U.S. LNG and also sells Russian LNG from private firm Novatek.
“Europe will never go back to importing 150 billion cubic meters from Russia like before the war … but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,” Pouyanne added.

Title: PM Modi lays foundation for Rs 410 crore Hisar airport terminal; highlights rise in airports from 74 to over 150 since 2014
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:46:44 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday marked Ambedkar Jayanti by laying the foundation stone of the new terminal building at Maharaja Agrasen Airport in Hisar, Haryana, and flagging off the inaugural flight to Ayodhya.
Addressing a massive rally, the Prime Minister said that before 2014, India had just 74 airports. However, in the last decade, the number has crossed the 150 mark, highlighting significant progress in improving connectivity compared to the efforts of previous governments.
The launch of scheduled flights from Hisar — twice weekly to Ayodhya and thrice weekly to Jammu, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Chandigarh — represents a major boost to Haryana’s aviation network.
The new terminal project, valued at over Rs 410 crore, will include a modern passenger terminal, a dedicated cargo facility, and an air traffic control building.
The PM paid homage to Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, calling it a “Diwali” for Dalits, and for the marginalised and backward communities.
“Your soldiers, sportsmen, and brotherhood are the identity of Haryana,” he said, thanking the crowd for their enthusiastic participation.
Reflecting on his early political journey in the state, PM Modi said, “All the people who worked with me — their hard work laid the foundation for the BJP in Haryana. Today, I am proud that Haryana is working seriously towards fulfilling the resolve of a Viksit Bharat.”
Reaffirming the BJP’s commitment to inclusive growth, PM Modi added, “The BJP’s mantra is to work for the rapid development of all Dalits, the poor, the marginalised, and backward communities in Haryana. In line with this mantra, flights have now started from the holy land of Shri Krishna’s Haryana to Lord Ram’s Ayodhya.”
Calling the foundation stone of the airport terminal a symbol of Haryana’s aspirations, he congratulated the people and said, “I had promised you that people wearing slippers would also take flight. Today, we are witnessing this promise being fulfilled across the country.”
He highlighted the success of the Centre’s UDAN scheme, which has enabled thousands of Indians to fly for the first time.
“Before 2014, the country had just 74 airports. Today, the number has crossed the 150 mark,” PM Modi reiterated, underlining the impact of the UDAN Yojana (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), which aims to boost regional connectivity and make air travel more accessible and affordable.
Later in the day, PM Modi will travel to Yamuna Nagar to inaugurate and lay foundation stones for more development projects and interact with the public.
As part of efforts to enhance power infrastructure and ensure last-mile electricity access, PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for an 800 MW thermal power unit at the Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Plant. Spread across 233 acres and costing around Rs 8,470 crore, the project is expected to strengthen Haryana’s energy security and ensure uninterrupted power supply.
Furthering the GOBARDhan initiative (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan), the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for a Compressed Biogas Plant in Mukarabpur, Yamuna Nagar.
The plant, with a projected annual output of 2,600 metric tonnes, aims to enhance organic waste management, generate clean energy, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
Additionally, PM Modi will inaugurate the Rewari Bypass project — a 14.4 km corridor built at a cost of Rs 1,070 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The new bypass will ease congestion in Rewari City, reduce Delhi–Narnaul travel time by nearly an hour, and help boost regional economic and social development.

Title: China’s March exports jump in temporary boost as Trump 2.0 heaps pressure
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:09:31 +0000
Content: China’s exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect, but an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war has darkened the outlook for factories and growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods to hefty levels that many economists say will profoundly impact global trade flows and business investment.
Exports rose 12.4% year-on-year, a five-month high, handily beating the 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Exports grew 2.3% in January-February.
Trade uncertainties have rocked financial markets this month after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on many countries on April 2. Trump unexpectedly paused the higher duties on a dozen economies days later, but slapped even stiffer levies on China that Beijing has dismissed as “a joke”.
Economists warn the March export figures will be eclipsed by a fast-deteriorating outlook.
“Export growth accelerated in March, as manufacturers rushed to ship goods to the U.S. ahead of ‘Liberation Day’,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
“But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” he added.
“We think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.”
Trump levied 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports into the United States, effective on February 4, and followed that up with another 10% in March, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
Washington’s fresh round of tariffs lifts duties on China to an eye-watering 145%, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on U.S. goods by 125% in an intensifying trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Monday data also highlighted a soft underbelly in domestic demand in China, meaning policymakers will have their work cut out in trying to guard against any sharp trade downturn.
Inbound shipments fell 4.3%, compared with a 2.0% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll, and an unexpectedly steep contraction of 8.4% at the start of the year.
Markets in China were up modestly, but much of the activity was linked to mixed messages from Trump over the weekend regarding exemptions on smartphones and other electronics. China’s blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.3%.
FIGHT TO THE END
Beijing has vowed to fight U.S tariffs to the end and protect the economy from “external shocks”, with markets widely expecting authorities to roll out further fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in coming months to underpin growth.
Exports have been a lone bright spot in China’s economy, which has struggled to mount a solid post-COVID recovery as confidence has remained low in the face of a protracted property crisis and deepening deflationary pressures.
President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments on the tariffs, told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing on Friday that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Xi kicked off a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, aiming to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours amid the tariff disruptions.
The World Trade Organization has warned the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade row could cut the shipment of goods between the two economies by as much as 80% and severely hurt global growth.
Goldman Sachs last week lowered its forecasts for China’s 2025 GDP growth to 4% from 4.5%, citing the effects of tariffs. Citi cut its forecast to 4.2% from 4.7% two days earlier. Their revised forecasts are well below the government’s growth target of “around 5%.”
China’s export industry is facing a complex and severe external environment, customs official Lv Daliang said on Monday.
“China is actively building a diversified market and deepening production and supply chain cooperation with all parties,” he told a regular press briefing.
Mounting trade pressure and a dwindling U.S. consumer base have also prompted Chinese exporters to assess domestic opportunities
TRADE IMBALANCE?
China’s March trade surplus was $102.64 billion, down slightly from $104.8 billion in December, the most recent comparable reading.
More importantly, China’s trade surplus with the United States in the first quarter came in at $76.6 billion, up from $70.2 billion a year earlier.
This will likely keep the production powerhouse in Trump’s sights given that improving the trade gap is at the top of his agenda.
Commodities data showed while Chinese imports of crude oil rose in March, those of soybeans, coal, iron ore and unwrought copper dropped.
Imports from the United States may have already been affected by the trade spat.
China’s total soybean imports tumbled by 36.8% in March year-on-year.
“China seems to stop its farming imports from the U.S. altogether already,” said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“Its soybean imports tumbled by around half in March during a high season of China-U.S. farming trade, perhaps because state-owned importers already received the guidance to stop imports,” he said.

Title: Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya leads ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna with over 6,000 youth volunteers
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:37:06 +0000
Content: In a powerful tribute to the legacy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Union Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports and Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya led the ‘Jai Bhim Padyatra’ in Patna, Bihar, on Sunday. The event witnessed the participation of over 6,000 MY Bharat Youth Volunteers and was flagged off by Bihar Legislative Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav.
Organized as part of a nationwide initiative by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the padayatra celebrated Babasaheb’s contributions to social justice, equality, and constitutional values, while also mobilizing youth engagement for building a “Viksit Bharat.”
Addressing the gathering, Dr. Mandaviya called upon India’s youth to take inspiration from Dr. Ambedkar’s vision. “As the sun rose over Patna, it illuminated not just a statue but a spirit — a renewed commitment to Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals and a Viksit Bharat led by its most powerful force, its youth,” he said.
The Union Minister emphasized the pioneering role of Dr. Ambedkar in advocating equal rights for women as early as 1947 — a time when gender equality was scarcely recognized globally. He urged the youth to take a solemn sankalp (pledge) to uphold the ideals of national icons and align themselves with the Panch Pran vision articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a strong, inclusive, and self-reliant India.
Jai Bhim Padyatras were held simultaneously across all state capitals and 5,000 locations nationwide. MY Bharat volunteers participated in mass cleanliness drives, cleaned statues of Dr. Ambedkar, and reaffirmed their commitment to constitutional values through collective readings of the Preamble.
The event in Patna was further enlivened with cultural performances, patriotic songs dedicated to Dr. Ambedkar, and active community service. Volunteers were seen picking up litter and distributing refreshments along the route, showcasing civic responsibility and the spirit of service.
The padyatra concluded near the Patna High Court, where Dr. Mandaviya, along with other dignitaries including Bihar’s Deputy Chief Ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and former Union Minister and Patna MP, paid floral tributes to Dr. Ambedkar and participated in a cleanliness drive.
In Mumbai, Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Raksha Nikhil Khadse also took part in the padayatra, amplifying the message of unity and national participation.

Title: Trump in excellent health, cholesterol well controlled, says White House physician
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:31:35 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump remains in excellent health and his high cholesterol is “well controlled,” White House physician U.S. Navy Captain Sean Barbella said in a report released on Sunday, two days after Trump underwent a routine physical.
The report is the most detailed information on the health of Trump, 78, since he returned to the White House in January as the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency.
“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” Barbella wrote in his report.
The report noted that Trump has a history of “well-controlled” high cholesterol and is taking two medications to address it.
The report also noted that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last year.
The report said his hearing was normal.
Trump’s campaign released a report after the assassination attempt last year concluding the injuries were superficial.
“It went, I think, well. …Every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday after the exam. “I think I did well.”
Barbella’s report also references Trump’s history with COVID-19. Trump was hospitalized during a serious bout with the virus in October 2020 during his run for reelection.
It noted that Trump takes two medications to control cholesterol — rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, generic names of the branded drugs Crestor and Zetia — and uses a mometasone cream to control rosacea, a condition that can cause redness in the face, as well as aspirin.
VACCINES UP TO DATE
It also mentions that Trump has received all recommended vaccines. Trump has in the past spread debunked claims about links between vaccines and autism often mentioned by his Health Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy has also cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines during a large, ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, contrary to established science, but has also said the vaccine is the best way to prevent the virus’ spread.
Trump told reporters he took a cognitive test because he wanted to “be a little different” than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, now 82.
Trump scored 30 out of 30 on the test, known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Barbella’s report noted.
Trump sought to draw a contrast with Biden during his presidential campaign last year, portraying himself as younger and fitter. A disastrous debate performance from Biden last year raised questions about his acuity and ultimately forced him from the presidential race.
Biden’s doctors repeatedly deemed him fit to serve, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental fitness in his final months in the White House.
Barbella’s report on Trump concludes that his “active lifestyle” contributes to his health, referencing daily meetings, press events and “frequent victories in golf events.”

Title: Newcastle United extend winning streak to five with 4-1 thumping of Man United
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:01:34 +0000
Content: Harvey Barnes struck twice in the second half as Newcastle United extended their winning streak to five with a commanding 4-1 win over Manchester United at St. James’ Park on Sunday. 
Led by assistants Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones in the absence of Eddie Howe—who was hospitalised on Friday—the Magpies started brightly and dominated from the outset. Sandro Tonali gave the hosts a deserved lead with a superb volley after Alexander Isak’s delicate lofted assist. Despite their dominance, Newcastle were pegged back late in the first half which started when Manuel Ugarte won the ball well in midfield and invited Diogo Dalot to charge forward. The right wing-back timed the release of his pass to Garnacho well, and the Argentina international slotted past Pope and into the far corner of the net.
 
But the second half belonged entirely to Newcastle. Just three minutes after the restart, Tino Livramento’s deep cross was kept alive by Jacob Murphy, whose sharp cutback was finished with precision by Barnes for his first. Barnes then added his second on 64 minutes when Noussair Mazraoui slipped over in possession but Barnes didn’t hesitate, picking up the ball and shifting through the gears. His run took him right through the middle of the Manchester United centre halves and his attempt rocketed into the top right-hand corner
Newcastle never let up. Manchester United, managed by Ruben Amorim, offered little in response after falling behind. The final blow came in the closing stages when Altay Bayındır’s misplaced pass was seized upon by Joelinton, who teed up Bruno Guimarães to slot home Newcastle’s fourth.
Despite an initial equaliser, United were outplayed and outfought. They now sit 14th in the Premier League table, while Newcastle’s fifth straight win propels them into the top four, intensifying their Champions League push.

Title: IPL 2025: Virat Kohli and Phil Salt’s fifties power RCB to 9-wicket win against RR
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:48:18 +0000
Content: A clinical all-round performance from Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), led by explosive fifties from Phil Salt and Virat Kohli, sealed a dominant nine-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their IPL 2025 clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday.
Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, RCB restricted RR to 173/4, despite a fluent 75 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and a crucial unbeaten 35 from Dhruv Jurel. RCB chased down the target in just 17.3 overs, thanks to a blistering start from Salt and an anchoring knock by Kohli.
RCB’s Run Chase: A Power-Packed Start
Openers Phil Salt and Virat Kohli gave RCB a flying start, adding 65 runs in the powerplay. Salt led the assault, smashing 46 runs off just 23 balls in the first six overs. He brought up his half-century in the eighth over and continued to dominate until he was dismissed for a quickfire 65 off 33 balls by Kumar Kartikeya. His innings included five fours and six towering sixes.
After Salt’s departure in the ninth over, Devdutt Padikkal joined Kohli and the duo carried forward the momentum. Kohli played a measured knock, rotating the strike and punishing loose deliveries. He brought up his third fifty of the season – and 100th in T20s – with a classy straight six off Wanindu Hasaranga in the 15th over.
Padikkal accelerated in the final stretch, scoring 40 off 28 balls, while Kohli remained unbeaten on 62 off 45 deliveries. Their unbeaten 83-run stand for the second wicket guided RCB to 174/1 in 17.3 overs.
RR’s Innings: Jaiswal Stands Tall Amid Inconsistency
Earlier, RR openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson gave the hosts a steady start, finishing the powerplay at 45/0. However, Samson struggled for fluency and was dismissed for a sluggish 15 off 19 balls by Krunal Pandya in the seventh over.
Jaiswal, unfazed at the other end, anchored the innings with fluent stroke play. Partnering with Riyan Parag, he brought up his second fifty of the season in the 13th over. The duo added a 50-run stand before Parag fell for 30 (22) in the 14th over to Yash Dayal.
Trying to accelerate, Jaiswal perished in the 16th over for 75 off 47 balls, laced with ten fours and two sixes. Dhruv Jurel (35* off 23) finished strong alongside Shimron Hetmyer (6), helping RR reach a competitive 173/4.
Bowling and Fielding Highlights
RCB’s bowlers shared the wickets, with Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, and Yash Dayal taking one each. Suyash Sharma was unlucky, finishing wicketless despite beating the bat often. RCB’s fielding was below par, marked by seven misfields and multiple dropped catches, including a sitter by Virat Kohli.
For RR, only Kumar Kartikeya (1/25) managed to strike with the ball. The rest of the bowling unit was put to the sword by the in-form RCB batters.
Brief Scores:
Rajasthan Royals: 173/4 (Yashasvi Jaiswal 75, Dhruv Jurel 35*; Krunal Pandya 1/29)
Royal Challengers Bengaluru: 174/1 in 17.3 overs (Phil Salt 65, Virat Kohli 62*; Kumar Kartikeya 1/25)
Result: RCB won by 9 wickets
Player of the Match: Phil Salt

Title: Delhi’s unbeaten IPL run ends after a hat-trick of run-outs v Mumbai
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:19:39 +0000
Content: Delhi Capitals suffered their first defeat of the new Indian Premier League season on Sunday after Mumbai Indians eked out a 12-run victory to rekindle their fading hopes of making the playoffs.
Karun Nair led Delhi’s pursuit of 206 with a scintillating 89 but once he departed, the wheels came off their innings and the Capitals were all out for 193 – losing their last three wickets to a hat-trick of run-outs in a bizarre finish.
Delhi, who had won four matches in a row, are now behind table-toppers Gujarat Titans on run rate, though the Capitals have played one match fewer.
Five-time champions Mumbai climbed to seventh place after their second win in six matches.
Earlier, former captain Rohit Sharma’s lean run continued but Tilak Varma’s breezy half-century provided the bedrock of Mumbai’s strong 205-5 after being put into bat at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
Mumbai lost Rohit (18) in the powerplay but Ryan Rickelton (41) and Suryakumar Yadav (40) ensured they did not completely surrender the momentum.
Delhi spinner Kuldeep Yadav removed both the batters but Varma smashed 59 off 33 balls, three of which went soaring over the boundary rope, before falling in the final over of their innings.
Naman Dhir made a quickfire 38 not out as Mumbai posted their second 200-plus total this season.
Delhi lost opener Jake Fraser-McGurk to the first ball of their chase but Nair, brought in as the Impact Player, tore into the Mumbai attack during his 119-run second wicket stand with Abishek Porel (33).
Leg-spinner Karn Sharma’s three wickets dragged Mumbai back into the contest and Mitchell Santner claimed two to turn the match on its head.
Delhi needed 23 from the last two overs with three wickets in hand but Ashutosh Sharma, Kuldeep, and Mohit Sharma were run out in the last three balls of the penultimate over from Jasprit Bumrah.
Earlier in Jaipur, Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Rajasthan Royals by nine wickets to climb to third place following their fourth win in six matches.

Title: Stock markets closed on April 14 for Ambedkar Jayanti
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:13:45 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets are closed on Monday on account of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti, which commemorates the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, born on April 14, 1891.
Every year, this day is observed as a public holiday across the country. Schools, banks, and several government offices remain closed in honour of the social reformer and architect of the Indian Constitution.
Indian equity markets ended the past week with gains after a very volatile start.  
The week began with a sharp sell-off on Monday, as global markets reacted negatively to the U.S. government’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs. This move sparked fears of a trade war and triggered panic among investors. The situation worsened when China responded with its own set of retaliatory measures, further impacting investor sentiment worldwide.
However, markets managed to recover some ground after the U.S. decided to defer the implementation of tariffs for all countries except China. This move brought some relief to global markets, including India, and led to a rebound in stock prices in the following sessions.
Last Friday, the Sensex closed at 75,157.26 points, up 1,310.11 points or 1.77 per cent, while the Nifty closed at 22,828.55 points, up 429.40 points or 1.92 per cent. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, Consumer Durables, and Oil & Gas were the top movers.
On the domestic front, Indian indices also received a boost from the Reserve Bank of India’s recent policy announcement. The central bank not only cut interest rates but also adopted a dovish stance, indicating that further support could be provided if necessary. This decision was welcomed by investors and helped cushion earlier losses.

Title: Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 comes into effect, marking major reforms in higher education
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:06:39 +0000
Content: The Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 has come into effect in the State, following the assent of the Governor of Odisha, Dr. Haribabu Kambhampati.
The Bill was passed on April 2, after extensive deliberation in the Odisha Assembly. With the Governor’s approval on April 12, the Act is now in force throughout the state, marking a significant reform in Odisha’s higher education system.
Expressing his gratitude to the Governor, Odisha Minister Suryabanshi Suraj described this development as a “new dawn” for higher education in the state. He emphasized that the Act will bring transformative changes aimed at strengthening the education system, addressing longstanding challenges, and enhancing academic excellence.
“The Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 has been designed to address long-standing challenges in the state’s higher education domain. It aims to bring about substantial reforms, ensuring autonomy for universities and enhancing the efficiency of academic functions,” Minister Suraj stated.
One of the key reforms introduced through the implementation of the Odisha University (Amendment) Act, 2024 is that universities will no longer depend on the Odisha Public Service Commission (OPSC) to hire teachers. Instead, each university will form its own committee of education experts to carry out the recruitment process. This will help complete the process within a fixed timeframe and ensure that the selected teachers meet the specific needs of different subjects and courses.
The selection process for Vice-Chancellors has also been revised. A three-member committee comprising respected educationists will be formed to choose new Vice-Chancellors. The age limit for holding this post has been raised from 67 to 70 years, allowing more experienced academic leaders to take charge.
Another important step is the reintroduction of the Senate in universities. The Senate is the top advisory body that helps guide a university’s development. It will have 68 members, including teachers, educationists, students, and staff. Each university must hold at least two Senate meetings every year, providing a platform for all stakeholders to participate in important decisions.
To build a strong and inclusive education system, the government is also focusing on improving the teacher-student ratio, introducing distance education in every university to reach more students, and increasing the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER).
For better financial management, universities will have Finance Committees and Building and Construction Committees to monitor funds and infrastructure projects. All university finances will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, and reports will be submitted to the Odisha Legislative Assembly.

Title: “Votebank ka virus”: PM Modi slams Congress for opposing Waqf Act, promises end to land misuse
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:59:27 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took a dig at Congress, accusing it of fostering vote bank politics by opposing the recently amended Waqf Act. 
Addressing a public rally in Hisar, the Prime Minister alleged that the Congress had long treated Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) as second-class citizens, while neglecting the principles of equality championed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.
“Congress has become the destroyer of the Constitution,” PM Modi declared. “Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a nation where the poor and backward could live with dignity and pursue their dreams. But Congress spread the virus of vote bank politics, betraying that vision.”
He further claimed that under Congress rule, basic banking services were out of reach for marginalized communities. “During their time, banks wouldn’t even open their doors for SCs, STs, and OBCs. Loans and welfare schemes were mere fantasies. Today, the majority of beneficiaries under the Jan Dhan Yojana are from these very communities,” he said.
Turning his focus to the Waqf Board, the Prime Minister criticized what he described as large-scale mismanagement and misuse of land meant for community welfare.  
“There are lakhs of hectares of land under Waqf, yet the poor never benefitted from it. Instead, land mafias thrived. This will end with the amended Waqf Act,” he said. “Under the new provisions, no land or property belonging to Adivasis can be claimed by the Waqf Board. This is a step toward genuine social justice. Poor and Pasmanda Muslims will now receive what is rightfully theirs.”
PM Modi also accused Congress of attempting to erase Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy, alleging that the party actively worked against him during his lifetime.  
“Congress humiliated Babasaheb, made him lose elections twice, and tried to erase his contribution. While Dr. Ambedkar was a protector of the Constitution, Congress has repeatedly acted as its destroyer,” he said.
Highlighting achievements under his government, the Prime Minister contrasted his administration’s development initiatives with what he described as decades of Congress neglect.  
“While Congress leaders lived in luxury with swimming pools, only 16 out of every 100 village households had piped water connections. In just six to seven years, we’ve provided clean drinking water to over 12 crore rural households. Today, 80 percent of rural homes have tap water, and we’re working to achieve 100 percent coverage.”
He also reiterated his party’s commitment to a Uniform Civil Code, referencing its implementation in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand.
“The Constitution calls for one civil code for all citizens—a truly secular code. Congress never had the courage to implement it. But we have, and Congress continues to oppose it,” he asserted.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi flagged off the first direct commercial flight from Hisar Airport to Ayodhya and laid the foundation stone for a new terminal at Hisar Airport. Several other developmental projects were also inaugurated during the event.

Title: AICTE forms expert committee to integrate AI across all academic streams
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:58:11 +0000
Content: In a significant step toward transforming technical education in India, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has constituted an expert committee to facilitate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Applied AI across diverse academic programmes beyond traditional computer science degrees.
The committee is chaired by Anand Deshpande, Managing Director of Persistent Systems, and includes AI experts from IITs, NITs, and other leading institutions. The move is aimed at promoting lateral expansion of AI in streams such as BBA, BCA, electrical engineering, and other disciplines.
“We are forming a committee to introduce AI laterally across all programmes, especially Applied AI,” said AICTE Chairman Prof. TG Sitharam. “The idea is to spread AI and related curricula across streams so that every student—regardless of discipline—gains foundational knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and data analytics.”
AICTE, India’s apex regulatory body for technical education, has already revised curricula for several programmes to incorporate AI elements. “We have created new curricula for BBA and BCA and introduced AI in electrical engineering. Our goal is that everyone should understand AI and data analytics,” Sitharam added.
Recognizing the crucial role of educators, AICTE has also prioritised faculty training to support the effective rollout of AI-focused modules. “Our teachers need to be trained not only in teaching AI but also in adapting to how AI is changing the learning environment—like how students now submit AI-generated assignments. We need to evolve the way we frame questions and evaluate learning,” the Chairman said.
In line with its vision, AICTE has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Artificial Intelligence’, launching a range of initiatives to raise awareness and build capacity. The ambitious plan aims to bring AI education to over 14,000 colleges and 40 million students across India. Key components of the initiative include AI awareness campaigns, faculty development programmes, and collaborations with top technology firms.
AICTE follows a structured curriculum revision process every two years, engaging with expert panels to update academic frameworks in line with emerging technologies. “Curriculum revision is a detailed exercise involving expert consultation. We repeat this process every two years to ensure relevance,” Sitharam noted.
With this strategic push, AICTE aims to make India’s technical education system future-ready, equipping students across disciplines with the skills needed for an AI-driven world.

Title: Blue Origin to fly Katy Perry to edge of space with all-female crew
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:37:35 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry, along with five other women, is set to make history by traveling to the edge of space on Monday evening aboard Jeff Bezos’ aerospace venture Blue Origin’s tourist mission.
The six-member crew is scheduled to lift off on the company’s reusable New Shepard rocket — NS-31 — from Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:30 a.m. CDT (7:00 p.m. IST).
This marks the 11th human flight to suborbital space by Blue Origin. The journey will last approximately 11 minutes and reach beyond the Kármán line — the internationally recognized boundary of space.
“I’ve dreamt of going to space for 15 years, and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality,” Perry shared in a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video.
“I am so honoured to be alongside five other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first-ever all-female flight space crew!” she added.
In the video, Perry offered fans a sneak peek inside her space capsule and hinted at a musical performance during the flight.
“I think I’m gonna sing — I’ve got to sing in space,” she said.
Joining Perry on the mission are Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sanchez.
“This is the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo spaceflight in 1963,” Blue Origin stated.
Perry, one of the best-selling music artists of all time, is also known for her philanthropic efforts. Flynn is a film producer and philanthropist, while King and Sanchez are award-winning journalists.
Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist, will become the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman to travel to space.
Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and the CEO of STEMBoard, an engineering firm, is expected to conduct three research experiments, including studies on plant biology and human physiology — advancing her mission to explore space for the benefit of Earth.
This will be Blue Origin’s second mission of the year. To date, the company has flown 52 people beyond the Kármán line.

Title: Explained: What is Type-5 diabetes? Why the malnutrition-induced condition is back?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:15:59 +0000
Content: While blood sugar cases are significantly soaring worldwide, a lesser-known malnutrition-related form of diabetes — designated as Type-5 diabetes – is gaining global attention after decades.
Nearly 75 years after being first recorded, the condition that previously remained undefined was designated as Type- 5 diabetes at the recently held International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) World Diabetes Congress in Bangkok, Thailand.
The condition, occurring often in young and thin adults, was first reported in Jamaica in 1955, and then defined as J-type diabetes.
In the 1960s, the condition was reported in undernourished populations across India, Pakistan, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
While in 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the condition as a distinct form of diabetes, it removed the designation in 1999 as there were no proper follow-up studies and supporting evidence.
What is Type-5 diabetes?
It is a malnutrition-related diabetes, typically affecting lean and malnourished teenagers and young adults in low- and middle-income countries.
Type 5 diabetes is estimated to affect 20-to-25 million people worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Earlier findings had suggested that malnutrition-related diabetes stemmed from insulin resistance.
However, insulin injections, as in Type 1 diabetes patients, will not benefit these patients. In some cases, it can cause dangerously low blood sugar.
It is because “people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn’t recognised before. This finding has revolutionised how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” said Meredith Hawkins, Professor of Medicine at the Global Diabetes Institute at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, US.
In a 2022 study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, Hawkins, and her colleagues at Christian Medical College in Vellore, demonstrated that malnutrition-related diabetes is fundamentally different from Type-2 diabetes, typically, caused by obesity, and Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease.
However, the expert noted that “doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis”.
To better understand the condition and develop treatments, the IDF has constituted a working group.
What will the working group do?
According to Hawkins, the condition has “historically been vastly under-diagnosed and poorly understood”.
She said that “malnutrition-related diabetes is more common than tuberculosis and nearly as common as HIV/AIDS”.
“The lack of an official name has hindered efforts to diagnose patients or find effective therapies,” Hawkins said.
The working group has been tasked to develop formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 diabetes over the next two years.
It will define diagnostic criteria and develop guidelines for the management of the disease. It will also establish a global registry to facilitate research collaborations and develop education modules to train healthcare professionals worldwide.

Title: Centre issues draft rules for gas meters under Legal Metrology Act to ensure accuracy, consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:42:24 +0000
Content: In a major move to enhance consumer protection and promote fair trade practices, the Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, has released draft rules for gas meters under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011. The new framework mandates that all gas meters used for domestic, commercial, and industrial purposes undergo testing, verification, and stamping before being deployed for trade or commerce.
According to an official statement from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, the proposed rules also require periodic re-verification of gas meters in use to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
The key objective behind the draft is to foster accuracy, transparency, and accountability in gas measurement. Verified and stamped meters will help prevent overcharging, under-measurement, and billing disputes, thus safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring fair billing. This initiative is also expected to lead to improved energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs for consumers, thanks to standardized and compliant devices.
The draft rules set out a structured compliance framework for manufacturers and gas distribution companies, aligning with international best practices and OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology) standards. The move is seen as a step toward bolstering India’s global trade credibility and encouraging innovation and quality assurance in domestic manufacturing.
The Legal Metrology Division, responsible for maintaining the accuracy of weights and measures, adopted a comprehensive and consultative approach to frame the rules. A technical committee comprising representatives from the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Regional Reference Standard Laboratories (RRSLs), industry experts, and Voluntary Consumer Organizations (VCOs) helped shape the draft. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) also reviewed the draft and provided scientific and technical inputs.
To ensure inclusive stakeholder participation, the draft rules were circulated widely among manufacturers, testing labs, City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies, and State Legal Metrology Departments. Feedback was thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the final draft. Several rounds of inter-departmental and stakeholder consultations ensured that the rules are both robust and practical.
The finalized rules include a transitional period to give adequate time for the industry and authorities to prepare for implementation, thereby avoiding any disruption in gas supply or undue burden on consumers and businesses.

Title: Delhi’s new anti-pollution moves: Will they be enough?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:37:12 +0000
Content: Delhi’s recurring winter pollution crisis has become a case study in urban environmental mismanagement. While the government takes action during these peak months, the bigger question remains: Are we doing enough—and more importantly, are we doing it all year round?
Experts and environmentalists have long pointed out that Delhi’s approach to air pollution tends to be reactive. Most of the effort kicks in only when the situation turns severe—usually between October and November—rather than being part of a continuous, year-round plan.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is supposed to manage pollution based on severity levels, is often seen as a short-term band-aid. It doesn’t tackle the root causes or prepare the city for sudden spikes in pollution.
One of the major contributors to Delhi’s poor air quality is vehicular emissions. Despite moves like shifting public transport to CNG and enforcing BS6 norms, the impact has been limited. The city still has a massive number of vehicles on its roads—around 8 percent of the country’s total, concentrated in a relatively small area.
Add to that the traffic congestion, and it’s no surprise that pollution levels remain high. While electric vehicles (EVs) are being promoted as the next big solution, experts caution that they’re not a silver bullet—especially if the electricity that powers them comes from coal.
In response to growing pressure and criticism, the Delhi government recently announced a new set of policies. Chief Minister Rekha Gupta revealed that vehicles from other states will now be required to carry a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate when entering Delhi.
The idea is to tighten emissions checks and prevent highly polluting vehicles from adding to the city’s burden. This comes after a CAG report highlighted serious lapses in Delhi’s existing pollution control systems, pointing out weak enforcement and poor coordination between agencies.
Alongside this, the government is planning a major expansion of EV infrastructure. By 2026, Delhi aims to have 48,000 EV charging points across the city—18,000 publicly managed and 30,000 semi-private.
While this is a step in the right direction, experts stress that without strengthening public transport, these measures won’t go far. If people don’t have clean, affordable alternatives to driving, EVs alone won’t reduce the number of vehicles on the road or ease the traffic that slows the city to a crawl.
The government is also planning to set up six new air quality monitoring stations and an eco-park for processing electronic waste—another often overlooked source of pollution. These may seem like smaller steps, but they’re important pieces of a bigger puzzle. However, even the best city-level efforts can only go so far.
Delhi’s air doesn’t exist in isolation. Pollution flows in from surrounding states, carried by wind and weather. Experts say what’s needed now is a joint approach—an “air shed” model, where Delhi and its neighboring states work together, much like they would in managing a shared water system.
Only by addressing the issue regionally can real, lasting progress be made. Delhi’s latest announcements show that there is political will to act. But unless these plans are part of a bigger, long-term, and better-coordinated effort, it’s likely that come next winter, the smog will return—and with it, the same old questions.

Title: Crisil projects 6.5% GDP growth for India in FY26, flags US tariffs as key risk
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:47:49 +0000
Content: Global credit rating agency Crisil on Monday projected India’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in fiscal 2026, while cautioning that US tariff hikes remain a significant downside risk to the forecast.
Despite external headwinds, Crisil expects monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to offer some cushion, along with other positive domestic developments. “Interest rate cuts, income tax relief, and easing inflation are expected to boost consumption this fiscal. Additionally, a normal monsoon could support agricultural incomes,” the report stated.
Crisil also anticipates that a decline in global crude oil prices, potentially driven by a global slowdown, will provide further support to domestic economic activity.
However, US tariff hikes pose a major challenge, with uncertainties around their duration and frequent revisions likely to dampen investor sentiment and slow investments, the agency warned.
For the current fiscal (FY25), Crisil observed that the second half showed signs of improvement, particularly in capital, infrastructure, and construction goods output, indicating a gradual pickup in construction and capital expenditure activities.
High-frequency indicators further reinforce these growth prospects. The RBI’s latest Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey indicates sequential strengthening in demand during Q4 FY25, while the Consumer Confidence Survey shows improved sentiment in both rural and urban areas in March.
“A healthy rabi output and easing inflation in the fourth quarter also support stronger consumption demand,” Crisil added.
Industrial growth, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), moderated to 2.9% in February from 5.2% in January (revised from 5.0%), largely due to slower growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors, although the electricity sector recorded an uptick.
Overall, IIP growth averaged 4.0% in Q4 FY25, in line with 4.1% in Q3, with manufacturing sub-sectors like petroleum products, machinery, and textiles performing better in the second half of FY25.

Title: Indian Coast Guard, Gujarat ATS seize narcotics worth Rs. 1,800 crore in joint operation
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:18:45 +0000
Content: In a significant crackdown on drug trafficking, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), in a joint operation with the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), seized over 300 kg of methamphetamine valued at approximately Rs. 1,800 crore, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence on Monday.
The overnight operation, conducted between April 12 and 13, was based on actionable intelligence provided by the Gujarat ATS. An ICG vessel from the Coast Guard Region (West), deployed on a multi-mission patrol off the North Maharashtra–South Gujarat coast, was redirected to intercept a suspicious boat near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Sensing the Coast Guard’s approach, the suspect vessel jettisoned its cargo into the sea and attempted to flee toward the IMBL. While the suspect boat managed to cross into international waters, evading apprehension, the ICG launched a sea boat and successfully recovered the dumped narcotics consignment after an intensive night-time search.
The seized drugs have since been transported to Porbandar for further investigation.
This successful bust marks the 13th major joint operation between the ICG and Gujarat ATS in recent years, showcasing the strength of inter-agency coordination in safeguarding national security and combating transnational crime.

Title: AICTE forms expert committee to integrate AI across all academic streams
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:58:11 +0000
Content: In a significant step toward transforming technical education in India, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has constituted an expert committee to facilitate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Applied AI across diverse academic programmes beyond traditional computer science degrees.
The committee is chaired by Anand Deshpande, Managing Director of Persistent Systems, and includes AI experts from IITs, NITs, and other leading institutions. The move is aimed at promoting lateral expansion of AI in streams such as BBA, BCA, electrical engineering, and other disciplines.
“We are forming a committee to introduce AI laterally across all programmes, especially Applied AI,” said AICTE Chairman Prof. TG Sitharam. “The idea is to spread AI and related curricula across streams so that every student—regardless of discipline—gains foundational knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and data analytics.”
AICTE, India’s apex regulatory body for technical education, has already revised curricula for several programmes to incorporate AI elements. “We have created new curricula for BBA and BCA and introduced AI in electrical engineering. Our goal is that everyone should understand AI and data analytics,” Sitharam added.
Recognizing the crucial role of educators, AICTE has also prioritised faculty training to support the effective rollout of AI-focused modules. “Our teachers need to be trained not only in teaching AI but also in adapting to how AI is changing the learning environment—like how students now submit AI-generated assignments. We need to evolve the way we frame questions and evaluate learning,” the Chairman said.
In line with its vision, AICTE has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Artificial Intelligence’, launching a range of initiatives to raise awareness and build capacity. The ambitious plan aims to bring AI education to over 14,000 colleges and 40 million students across India. Key components of the initiative include AI awareness campaigns, faculty development programmes, and collaborations with top technology firms.
AICTE follows a structured curriculum revision process every two years, engaging with expert panels to update academic frameworks in line with emerging technologies. “Curriculum revision is a detailed exercise involving expert consultation. We repeat this process every two years to ensure relevance,” Sitharam noted.
With this strategic push, AICTE aims to make India’s technical education system future-ready, equipping students across disciplines with the skills needed for an AI-driven world.

Title: Blue Origin to fly Katy Perry to edge of space with all-female crew
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:37:35 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry, along with five other women, is set to make history by traveling to the edge of space on Monday evening aboard Jeff Bezos’ aerospace venture Blue Origin’s tourist mission.
The six-member crew is scheduled to lift off on the company’s reusable New Shepard rocket — NS-31 — from Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:30 a.m. CDT (7:00 p.m. IST).
This marks the 11th human flight to suborbital space by Blue Origin. The journey will last approximately 11 minutes and reach beyond the Kármán line — the internationally recognized boundary of space.
“I’ve dreamt of going to space for 15 years, and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality,” Perry shared in a post on Instagram, accompanied by a video.
“I am so honoured to be alongside five other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first-ever all-female flight space crew!” she added.
In the video, Perry offered fans a sneak peek inside her space capsule and hinted at a musical performance during the flight.
“I think I’m gonna sing — I’ve got to sing in space,” she said.
Joining Perry on the mission are Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sanchez.
“This is the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo spaceflight in 1963,” Blue Origin stated.
Perry, one of the best-selling music artists of all time, is also known for her philanthropic efforts. Flynn is a film producer and philanthropist, while King and Sanchez are award-winning journalists.
Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist, will become the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman to travel to space.
Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and the CEO of STEMBoard, an engineering firm, is expected to conduct three research experiments, including studies on plant biology and human physiology — advancing her mission to explore space for the benefit of Earth.
This will be Blue Origin’s second mission of the year. To date, the company has flown 52 people beyond the Kármán line.

Title: Explained: What is Type-5 diabetes? Why the malnutrition-induced condition is back?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:15:59 +0000
Content: While blood sugar cases are significantly soaring worldwide, a lesser-known malnutrition-related form of diabetes — designated as Type-5 diabetes – is gaining global attention after decades.
Nearly 75 years after being first recorded, the condition that previously remained undefined was designated as Type- 5 diabetes at the recently held International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) World Diabetes Congress in Bangkok, Thailand.
The condition, occurring often in young and thin adults, was first reported in Jamaica in 1955, and then defined as J-type diabetes.
In the 1960s, the condition was reported in undernourished populations across India, Pakistan, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
While in 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the condition as a distinct form of diabetes, it removed the designation in 1999 as there were no proper follow-up studies and supporting evidence.
What is Type-5 diabetes?
It is a malnutrition-related diabetes, typically affecting lean and malnourished teenagers and young adults in low- and middle-income countries.
Type 5 diabetes is estimated to affect 20-to-25 million people worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Earlier findings had suggested that malnutrition-related diabetes stemmed from insulin resistance.
However, insulin injections, as in Type 1 diabetes patients, will not benefit these patients. In some cases, it can cause dangerously low blood sugar.
It is because “people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn’t recognised before. This finding has revolutionised how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” said Meredith Hawkins, Professor of Medicine at the Global Diabetes Institute at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, US.
In a 2022 study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, Hawkins, and her colleagues at Christian Medical College in Vellore, demonstrated that malnutrition-related diabetes is fundamentally different from Type-2 diabetes, typically, caused by obesity, and Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease.
However, the expert noted that “doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis”.
To better understand the condition and develop treatments, the IDF has constituted a working group.
What will the working group do?
According to Hawkins, the condition has “historically been vastly under-diagnosed and poorly understood”.
She said that “malnutrition-related diabetes is more common than tuberculosis and nearly as common as HIV/AIDS”.
“The lack of an official name has hindered efforts to diagnose patients or find effective therapies,” Hawkins said.
The working group has been tasked to develop formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 diabetes over the next two years.
It will define diagnostic criteria and develop guidelines for the management of the disease. It will also establish a global registry to facilitate research collaborations and develop education modules to train healthcare professionals worldwide.

Title: Centre issues draft rules for gas meters under Legal Metrology Act to ensure accuracy, consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:42:24 +0000
Content: In a major move to enhance consumer protection and promote fair trade practices, the Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, has released draft rules for gas meters under the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011. The new framework mandates that all gas meters used for domestic, commercial, and industrial purposes undergo testing, verification, and stamping before being deployed for trade or commerce.
According to an official statement from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, the proposed rules also require periodic re-verification of gas meters in use to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
The key objective behind the draft is to foster accuracy, transparency, and accountability in gas measurement. Verified and stamped meters will help prevent overcharging, under-measurement, and billing disputes, thus safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring fair billing. This initiative is also expected to lead to improved energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs for consumers, thanks to standardized and compliant devices.
The draft rules set out a structured compliance framework for manufacturers and gas distribution companies, aligning with international best practices and OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology) standards. The move is seen as a step toward bolstering India’s global trade credibility and encouraging innovation and quality assurance in domestic manufacturing.
The Legal Metrology Division, responsible for maintaining the accuracy of weights and measures, adopted a comprehensive and consultative approach to frame the rules. A technical committee comprising representatives from the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM), Regional Reference Standard Laboratories (RRSLs), industry experts, and Voluntary Consumer Organizations (VCOs) helped shape the draft. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) also reviewed the draft and provided scientific and technical inputs.
To ensure inclusive stakeholder participation, the draft rules were circulated widely among manufacturers, testing labs, City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies, and State Legal Metrology Departments. Feedback was thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the final draft. Several rounds of inter-departmental and stakeholder consultations ensured that the rules are both robust and practical.
The finalized rules include a transitional period to give adequate time for the industry and authorities to prepare for implementation, thereby avoiding any disruption in gas supply or undue burden on consumers and businesses.

Title: Delhi’s new anti-pollution moves: Will they be enough?
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:37:12 +0000
Content: Delhi’s recurring winter pollution crisis has become a case study in urban environmental mismanagement. While the government takes action during these peak months, the bigger question remains: Are we doing enough—and more importantly, are we doing it all year round?
Experts and environmentalists have long pointed out that Delhi’s approach to air pollution tends to be reactive. Most of the effort kicks in only when the situation turns severe—usually between October and November—rather than being part of a continuous, year-round plan.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is supposed to manage pollution based on severity levels, is often seen as a short-term band-aid. It doesn’t tackle the root causes or prepare the city for sudden spikes in pollution.
One of the major contributors to Delhi’s poor air quality is vehicular emissions. Despite moves like shifting public transport to CNG and enforcing BS6 norms, the impact has been limited. The city still has a massive number of vehicles on its roads—around 8 percent of the country’s total, concentrated in a relatively small area.
Add to that the traffic congestion, and it’s no surprise that pollution levels remain high. While electric vehicles (EVs) are being promoted as the next big solution, experts caution that they’re not a silver bullet—especially if the electricity that powers them comes from coal.
In response to growing pressure and criticism, the Delhi government recently announced a new set of policies. Chief Minister Rekha Gupta revealed that vehicles from other states will now be required to carry a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate when entering Delhi.
The idea is to tighten emissions checks and prevent highly polluting vehicles from adding to the city’s burden. This comes after a CAG report highlighted serious lapses in Delhi’s existing pollution control systems, pointing out weak enforcement and poor coordination between agencies.
Alongside this, the government is planning a major expansion of EV infrastructure. By 2026, Delhi aims to have 48,000 EV charging points across the city—18,000 publicly managed and 30,000 semi-private.
While this is a step in the right direction, experts stress that without strengthening public transport, these measures won’t go far. If people don’t have clean, affordable alternatives to driving, EVs alone won’t reduce the number of vehicles on the road or ease the traffic that slows the city to a crawl.
The government is also planning to set up six new air quality monitoring stations and an eco-park for processing electronic waste—another often overlooked source of pollution. These may seem like smaller steps, but they’re important pieces of a bigger puzzle. However, even the best city-level efforts can only go so far.
Delhi’s air doesn’t exist in isolation. Pollution flows in from surrounding states, carried by wind and weather. Experts say what’s needed now is a joint approach—an “air shed” model, where Delhi and its neighboring states work together, much like they would in managing a shared water system.
Only by addressing the issue regionally can real, lasting progress be made. Delhi’s latest announcements show that there is political will to act. But unless these plans are part of a bigger, long-term, and better-coordinated effort, it’s likely that come next winter, the smog will return—and with it, the same old questions.

Title: Crisil projects 6.5% GDP growth for India in FY26, flags US tariffs as key risk
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:47:49 +0000
Content: Global credit rating agency Crisil on Monday projected India’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in fiscal 2026, while cautioning that US tariff hikes remain a significant downside risk to the forecast.
Despite external headwinds, Crisil expects monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to offer some cushion, along with other positive domestic developments. “Interest rate cuts, income tax relief, and easing inflation are expected to boost consumption this fiscal. Additionally, a normal monsoon could support agricultural incomes,” the report stated.
Crisil also anticipates that a decline in global crude oil prices, potentially driven by a global slowdown, will provide further support to domestic economic activity.
However, US tariff hikes pose a major challenge, with uncertainties around their duration and frequent revisions likely to dampen investor sentiment and slow investments, the agency warned.
For the current fiscal (FY25), Crisil observed that the second half showed signs of improvement, particularly in capital, infrastructure, and construction goods output, indicating a gradual pickup in construction and capital expenditure activities.
High-frequency indicators further reinforce these growth prospects. The RBI’s latest Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey indicates sequential strengthening in demand during Q4 FY25, while the Consumer Confidence Survey shows improved sentiment in both rural and urban areas in March.
“A healthy rabi output and easing inflation in the fourth quarter also support stronger consumption demand,” Crisil added.
Industrial growth, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), moderated to 2.9% in February from 5.2% in January (revised from 5.0%), largely due to slower growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors, although the electricity sector recorded an uptick.
Overall, IIP growth averaged 4.0% in Q4 FY25, in line with 4.1% in Q3, with manufacturing sub-sectors like petroleum products, machinery, and textiles performing better in the second half of FY25.

Title: Indian Coast Guard, Gujarat ATS seize narcotics worth Rs. 1,800 crore in joint operation
Publication Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:18:45 +0000
Content: In a significant crackdown on drug trafficking, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), in a joint operation with the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), seized over 300 kg of methamphetamine valued at approximately Rs. 1,800 crore, according to a statement by the Ministry of Defence on Monday.
The overnight operation, conducted between April 12 and 13, was based on actionable intelligence provided by the Gujarat ATS. An ICG vessel from the Coast Guard Region (West), deployed on a multi-mission patrol off the North Maharashtra–South Gujarat coast, was redirected to intercept a suspicious boat near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Sensing the Coast Guard’s approach, the suspect vessel jettisoned its cargo into the sea and attempted to flee toward the IMBL. While the suspect boat managed to cross into international waters, evading apprehension, the ICG launched a sea boat and successfully recovered the dumped narcotics consignment after an intensive night-time search.
The seized drugs have since been transported to Porbandar for further investigation.
This successful bust marks the 13th major joint operation between the ICG and Gujarat ATS in recent years, showcasing the strength of inter-agency coordination in safeguarding national security and combating transnational crime.

Title: India’s rooftop solar capacity projected to reach 25–30 GW by FY27
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:08:38 +0000
Content: India’s rooftop solar energy capacity is expected to rise significantly from 17 GW to an estimated 25–30 GW between FY25 and FY27, according to a report released on Tuesday..
This projected surge is aligned with the country’s broader energy transition goals as solar power continues to emerge as a central pillar in India’s clean energy roadmap.
As per CareEdge Ratings, rooftop solar—especially in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment—is set to play a critical role in India’s renewable growth trajectory. The nation’s total renewable energy capacity stood at 220 GW as of FY25, with a target of reaching 300 GW of solar capacity by 2030.
Rooftop solar capacity reached 17.02 GW in FY25. Increased awareness among businesses about reducing operational costs and meeting sustainability goals is driving its rapid adoption.
The report highlights that government incentives, declining technology costs, and supportive policies—such as net metering and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes—are expected to further accelerate rooftop solar deployment.
“Rooftop solar installations in India have gained momentum. With the growing C&I demand backed by an improving policy ecosystem, we expect the market to reach nearly 25–30 GW over the next two years,” said Tanvi Shah, Director at CareEdge Advisory and Research.
The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, which aims to install rooftop solar in one crore households with subsidies up to Rs. 78,000, is poised to strengthen residential adoption. The scheme is designed to support low- and middle-income households by reducing electricity bills while also creating nearly 17 lakh jobs, thus boosting the entire solar value chain.
In a notable development, India’s rooftop solar initiative crossed the milestone of 10 lakh installations as of March 10.
Among states, Gujarat continues to lead the way through its ambitious ‘Surya Gujarat’ programme. Maharashtra is also witnessing strong C&I uptake, particularly from MSMEs and urban commercial centres.
The report notes that the rooftop segment currently accounts for around 20% of India’s total solar capacity. Its growing importance is attributed to its distributed nature and direct consumer engagement, despite utility-scale solar remaining the dominant contributor.

Title: Passenger vehicle sales soar to 4.3 million units in FY 2024-25, UVs drive growth: SIAM report
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:04:25 +0000
Content: Passenger vehicle sales in India reached an all-time high of 4.3 million units in the financial year 2024-25, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
This marks a 2% increase compared to the previous year, with Utility Vehicles (UVs) remaining the key growth driver in the passenger vehicle segment. Their share in overall sales rose to 65% in FY 2024-25, up from around 60% in the previous year.
The report also noted that new model launches with modern designs and advanced features attracted more buyers. Additionally, attractive discounts and promotional offers helped maintain demand.
According to the data, passenger vehicles also saw their highest-ever exports during the year, reaching 770,000 units. This represents a 14.6% increase compared to FY 2023-24. The rise in exports was driven by demand for global models manufactured in India, especially in Latin American and African markets. Some automakers even began exporting to developed countries.
Overall, the Indian automobile industry grew by 7.3% in domestic sales and saw a strong 19.2% increase in exports. SIAM attributed this performance to strong customer demand, government support, infrastructure investments, and a growing focus on sustainable mobility. Positive economic policies and strong market sentiment also contributed to sustaining the growth.
Two-wheeler sales experienced a solid recovery, with 19.6 million units sold in FY 2024-25, reflecting a growth of 9.1%. Improved rural demand and rising consumer confidence played a key role in this growth. The scooter segment led the way, supported by better connectivity in rural and semi-urban areas and the launch of new models with improved features.
Electric vehicles (EVs) also gained ground, with their share in total two-wheeler sales crossing 6% during the year. Two-wheeler exports grew strongly by 21.4%, reaching 4.2 million units. This growth was fueled by new product launches and increased demand in Africa and Latin America.
Looking ahead, SIAM expects the auto sector to continue its growth in FY 2025-26. Stable economic conditions, proactive government policies, and infrastructure spending are likely to support this growth. A normal monsoon, as forecasted, is also expected to boost demand, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.

Title: ICC considers tweaks to two-ball rule in ODIs to rebalance the format
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 05:28:35 +0000
Content: In a move that could significantly alter the dynamics of One Day Internationals (ODIs), the ICC men’s cricket committee, chaired by former India captain Sourav Ganguly, has proposed a change to the existing two-ball rule in a bid to restore a better balance between bat and ball in the 50-over format.
Currently, each ODI innings begins with two new balls—one from each end—which has been the norm since October 2011. However, at the ICC meetings held this week in Harare, the committee recommended a key alteration: from the 35th over of an innings, the fielding team would continue with only one of the two balls in use.
Proposed Rule Change
According to the recommendation, both balls will be used for the first 34 overs, as is currently the case. After 34 overs, the fielding side will be allowed to choose which of the two 17-over-old balls to continue with for the remainder of the innings. The unchosen ball will be retained as a spare and used only if necessary.
This adjustment is aimed at introducing more wear and tear on the ball in the latter stages of an innings, potentially aiding bowlers—particularly spinners and reverse-swing specialists—and rebalancing a format that has increasingly favored batters in recent years.
The committee had also weighed the idea of implementing the change earlier, around the 25th over, but that suggestion did not garner enough support. Instead, the consensus settled on allowing both balls to be used for 17 overs each, offering a more balanced approach.
Boards have been asked to provide feedback on the proposed tweak by the end of April. If there is a consensus, the change will be formalized at the ICC’s annual general meeting in July. Since this is a change to the playing conditions rather than the laws of the game, it does not require ICC Board approval.
Historical Context
The current two-ball rule was reintroduced in 2011, though similar conditions were in place during the 1992 World Cup and various periods prior. Between 2007 and 2011, ODIs featured a mandatory ball change after the 34th over, with a similarly used but cleaner ball replacing the original to aid visibility—especially under lights.
Stop Clock in Tests and U-19 Format Debate
In addition to the ODI rule change, the ICC is also weighing the introduction of a 60-second stop clock in Test cricket, a move already implemented in limited-overs formats to curb slow over-rates. Under the rule, teams exceeding the time limit for resuming play between overs face penalties such as bringing an additional fielder inside the 30-yard circle.
There was also discussion on converting the Under-19 Men’s World Cup from a 50-over format to T20, but no clear consensus was reached. Most members expressed reservations about the change, and such a shift would require formal approval by the ICC Board.
The also committee discussed the possibility of introducing bonus points in the World Test Championship, though the idea was met with skepticism due to concerns over its complexity.

Title: Blue Origin rocket carrying Katy Perry and all-female crew reaches edge of space, returns safely
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:39:54 +0000
Content: Pop star Katy Perry and five other women launched into space on a Blue Origin rocket and successfully returned to Earth on Monday, marking the first all-female spaceflight in more than 60 years.
The crew lifted off from West Texas at 9:31 a.m. ET (1331 GMT) and traveled to the edge of space, where they experienced a brief period of weightlessness before returning to Earth in a flight lasting around 11 minutes, according to a live broadcast by Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos.
The spaceflight was a high-profile success for Bezos’ New Shepard launch vehicle, which has been developed for space tourism.
The six-person crew also included Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sanchez, CBS host Gayle King, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, scientist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn.
King said that when the crew returned to their seats after weightlessness, Perry sang the Louis Armstrong song “What a Wonderful World.”
“I feel super connected to love,” Katy Perry said after landing back on Earth.
Perry was holding a daisy, a flower she took into space, to remind her of her daughter, Daisy.
Among celebrities in attendance at the launch pad were a tearful Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, and show business personalities Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian.
It was the first all-female spaceflight since Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova – the first woman in space – orbited Earth during a nearly three-day solo flight in 1963.
Blue Origin does not disclose the average cost of a seat on one of its rockets. On its website, the company says potential passengers have to pay $150,000 in the form of a refundable deposit to start the “order process.”
In 2021, the company revealed the highest bid for a seat on its New Shepard spacecraft was $28 million. That same year, “Star Trek” actor William Shatner flew free of charge as a guest of Blue Origin.
In 2018, Reuters reported the company was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride.
Blue Origin says on its website it aims to radically reduce the cost of access to space, with its rockets designed for reusability.
Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy and organization at Warwick Business School in Britain, estimates each launch of the New Shepard costs between $1 to $3 million.
“Even ignoring development cost, there are six seats so each passenger would have to pay around half a million USD for this to be a financially viable ongoing business,” Heracleous said. “It will take a long long time before space tourism can be a financially sustainable business available to the public at large.”

Title: IPL 2025: Dhoni’s finishing masterclass ends CSK’s five-match losing streak with five-wicket win over LSG
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 04:07:21 +0000
Content: Skipper MS Dhoni once again showcased his timeless brilliance, scripting a thrilling five-wicket win for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the ongoing IPL 2025 on Monday. The victory ended Chennai’s five-match losing streak and reaffirmed Dhoni’s stature as one of the finest finishers in the game.
Chasing 167, CSK rode on a vintage Dhoni cameo and a composed, unbeaten knock from Shivam Dube to cross the finish line with three balls to spare. Dhoni remained unbeaten on 26 off just 11 balls, striking four boundaries and a six, while Dube anchored the chase with 43* off 37 deliveries.
CSK got off to a flying start, thanks to a sizzling opening stand between debutant Shaik Rasheed and New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra. Ravindra set the tone with consecutive boundaries off Shardul Thakur in the opening over, and Rasheed followed suit by taking on Akash Deep with impeccable timing. Their 52-run partnership laid a solid platform before Rasheed (27) fell to Avesh Khan, who deceived the youngster with a slower delivery.
In his milestone 100th IPL match, Rahul Tripathi had a slice of luck when Abdul Samad dropped a sitter. However, he couldn’t capitalise, managing just 9 before falling to Ravi Bishnoi. Ravindra, after a brisk 37 off 22 balls, was trapped LBW by Aiden Markram, putting CSK on the backfoot.
Dube and Ravindra Jadeja attempted to stabilize the innings, but Bishnoi struck again, dismissing Jadeja near the boundary with Markram completing a sharp catch. Vijay Shankar’s quick exit added to Chennai’s troubles, leaving Dhoni to steer the chase.
Entering amidst a roaring crowd, Dhoni wasted no time. He struck two back-to-back boundaries to end the 16th over, then launched a one-handed six off the final ball of the 17th. With 24 needed off 12 balls, Dube unleashed an assault on Thakur, carving a boundary followed by a towering six, easing the pressure.
Lucknow’s fate was sealed when Bishnoi dropped Dhoni on 20—a straightforward chance that went begging. The CSK captain punished the lapse by slamming another boundary and finishing the over with 19 runs. Dube sealed the win in the final over, helping CSK snap their losing streak in style.
Earlier in the match, LSG, put into bat by CSK, struggled early. Khaleel Ahmed struck in the first over, dismissing Aiden Markram for 6 with Rahul Tripathi taking a fine diving catch. Anshul Kambhoj then removed the dangerous Nicholas Pooran for just 8, reducing LSG to 23/2 in four overs.
Mitchell Marsh and captain Rishabh Pant mounted a recovery, counterattacking the pacers. LSG reached 50 in the seventh over, with Pant reverse-scooping a six. Marsh was bowled by Jadeja for 30 (25), breaking a promising 50-run stand. At the halfway mark, LSG was 78/3.
Ayush Badoni gave LSG a boost with two consecutive sixes off Jamie Overton, but Dhoni’s sharp stumping off Jadeja ended his knock on 22 (17). Pant shifted gears, bringing up his first IPL 2025 fifty in 42 balls, including four boundaries and three sixes.
LSG collected 34 runs in the 18th and 19th overs, with Pant and Abdul Samad going big. However, the final over-swung back CSK’s way. Samad was run out for 20, and Pant fell for 63 (49) off Pathirana’s bowling. Pathirana then cleaned up Shardul Thakur off the last ball, restricting LSG to 166/7 in 20 overs.

Title: US steps up probes into pharmaceutical, chip imports, setting stage for tariffs
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 03:56:30 +0000
Content: The Trump administration is proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on grounds that extensive reliance on foreign production of medicine and chips is a national security threat, Federal Register filings on Monday showed.
The filings announce 21-day public comment periods and mark President Donald Trump’s latest use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 as justification for so-called sectoral tariffs aimed at boosting domestic production of goods he says are critical to national security.
Using the 232 provision, the Trump administration has started investigations into imports of copper and lumber, and probes completed during Trump’s first term formed the basis for 25% tariffs rolled out since his return to the White House in January on steel and aluminum and on the auto industry.
The filings, which indicate the administration began the investigations on April 1, follow exclusions unveiled over the weekend for smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China from Trump’s steep 125% reciprocal duties. Trump officials had said those products would soon be subject to Section 232 tariffs.
Section 232 probes need to be completed within 270 days of their initiation.
Trump has made use of tariffs a central plank of his administration’s economic and national security policies, rolling out a series of aggressive levies against trading partners that economists estimate have lifted the average import duty to around 25% from just 2.5% in matter of months.
The announcements have roiled financial markets, with most U.S. stock indexes now down 10% or more from record highs hit following Trump’s election win in November. Waves of economists have also downgraded their outlooks for the American economy, many foretelling higher joblessness and inflation in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.
A top Federal Reserve official – Governor Christopher Waller – earlier on Monday called Trump’s tariff policy “one of the biggest shocks to affect the U.S. economy in many decades.”
‘BREATHING ROOM AND VISIBILITY’
The U.S. began collecting baseline tariffs of 10% on most U.S. imports on April 5, and Trump on April 9 put on hold even stiffer levies aimed at goods at dozens of other trading partners, although the heftiest tariffs targeting China remain in place. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are exempt from those duties, but Trump has said they will face separate tariffs.
Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing tariffs on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector.
The U.S. relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, something former President Joe Biden sought to reverse during his term by granting billions of dollars in Chips Act awards to lure chipmakers to expand production in the United States.
The notices published on Monday showed the investigations will include both pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients as well as other derivative products.
Drugmakers have argued that tariffs could increase the chance of shortages and reduce access for patients. Still, Trump has pushed for the fees, arguing that the U.S. needs more drug manufacturing so it does not have to rely on other countries for its supply of medicines.
Companies in the industry have lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges and to allow time to shift manufacturing.
Large drugmakers have global manufacturing footprints, mainly in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and moving more production to the U.S. involves a major commitment of resources and could take years.
“This notice gives us some breathing room and visibility on when the tariffs might be expected, and we will be certainly looking out for the lobby actions that PHRMA and the industry CEOs will be engaging in over the next three weeks,” said Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen.
“We are bracing for announcement of tariffs around mid-May and see tariffs of 10-25% as being possible, with the industry angling for a slow ramping to these tariffs and potential carve-outs,” Breen said.
Gary Shapiro, CEO and Vice Chair of the Consumer Technology Association, said that Trump’s Friday exclusion on smartphones, computers and semiconductors recognized that his tariffs will hurt consumers.
“At the same time, the shift from IEEPA to Section 232 as a legal basis for tariffs reveals the Administration’s desire for a more durable justification,” Shapiro said in a statement. “But claiming that downstream consumer tech products qualify as ‘semiconductors’ is a stretch.”
He called for “a smarter, targeted trade strategy where we team up with allies to compete with China.”

Title: India targets 10% global market share in power tools, 25% in hand tools
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 16:41:38 +0000
Content: India is aiming to significantly expand its footprint in the global hand and power tools market, with a target of achieving $25 billion in exports over the next decade. According to a new report released by NITI Aayog on Tuesday, the country could potentially capture 10 percent of the global market in power tools and 25 percent in hand tools, generating approximately 35 lakh jobs in the process.
The report, titled “Unlocking $25+ Billion Export Potential – India’s Hand & Power Tools Sector,” lays out a detailed strategy to boost India’s competitiveness in this sector. Currently, the global trade in hand and power tools is valued at around $100 billion and is projected to grow to approximately $190 billion by 2035. Of this, hand tools are expected to expand from $34 billion to $60 billion, while power tools, including accessories, are set to grow from $63 billion to $134 billion.
China currently dominates the global export market, accounting for about half of the hand tools exports ($13 billion) and 40 percent of power tools exports ($22 billion). In contrast, India’s current exports stand at $600 million in hand tools and $470 million in power tools, translating to a modest market share of 1.8 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.
Despite its limited market share, the report suggests that India has the potential to significantly scale up its exports, targeting $25 billion over the next decade. Achieving this target could generate around 35 lakh jobs and help India capture 10 percent of the global power tools market and 25 percent of the hand tools market.
The report identifies a number of structural challenges that hinder India’s competitiveness, including a 14 to 17 percent cost disadvantage compared to China. These are attributed to higher raw material costs, lower labour productivity, elevated interest rates, and higher logistics costs, especially from inland production hubs to ports. Additionally, regulatory constraints such as restrictive overtime rules and complex export procedures further exacerbate these challenges.
To address these issues, the report recommends a set of strategic interventions. One major proposal is the development of world-class hand tool manufacturing clusters, spread over 4,000 acres and built under public-private partnerships. These clusters would offer modern infrastructure, including plug-and-play facilities, worker housing, and improved connectivity to support industrial growth.
It also calls for market reforms to reduce structural cost burdens. These include rationalizing import duties on critical raw materials, streamlining Quality Control Orders, simplifying the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme, and revising labour and building regulations.
The report emphasizes that if these reforms are effectively implemented, no additional government support would be necessary beyond current schemes such as Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) and duty drawbacks. However, in the absence of such reforms, it estimates a requirement of ₹8,000 crore in bridge cost support, which it frames as an investment likely to generate two to three times its value in tax revenues over five years.

Title: CT scan radiation risk comparable to alcohol and obesity: study
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:21:26 +0000
Content: Repeated exposure to unnecessary CT (computed tomography) scans may increase cancer risk to a level comparable with alcohol consumption and obesity, a new study has found.
The research, conducted by scientists at the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF), estimated that radiation from CT scans contributes to about 5% of all cancer cases annually.
The study identified infants, children, and adolescents—particularly those under one year old—as the most vulnerable to scan-related cancers. However, adults remain at risk too, since they are the primary recipients of such scans, the researchers noted, warning against overuse and excessive radiation exposure.
In children, the most likely cancers linked to CT scan radiation are thyroid, lung, and breast cancer. Among adults, common CT-associated cancers include those of the lung, colon, bladder, breast, and leukemia.
“CTs can save lives, but their potential harms are often overlooked,” said Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UCSF radiologist and lead author of the study.
“The findings place CT radiation exposure on par with other well-known cancer risks, such as alcohol use and excess body weight,” she added.
Published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the study estimated that around 103,000 cancer cases could result from the 93 million CT scans performed in the United States in 2023 alone. This is three to four times higher than earlier projections.
The researchers stressed that minimizing the number of CT scans, along with reducing radiation doses per scan, could help prevent thousands of cancer cases.
“Reducing both the frequency and intensity of CT imaging could save lives,” Smith-Bindman said.
While CT scans remain a crucial tool for diagnosing illnesses and detecting tumors, they expose patients to ionising radiation—a known carcinogen.
The findings were based on data from 93 million CT exams conducted on 61.5 million patients, with scan rates increasing significantly with age. Adults aged 60–69 accounted for the highest number of scans, while children represented 4.2% of the total scans conducted.

Title: Apple airlifted iPhones worth a record $2 billion from India in March as Trump tariffs loomed
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 14:53:35 +0000
Content: Apple’s main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the United States in March, an all-time high, as the U.S. company airlifted devices to bypass President Donald Trump’s impending tariffs, customs data shows.
The smartphone maker stepped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones to the United States to ensure sufficient inventory in one of its biggest markets on concern Trump’s tariffs would push up costs.
In April, the U.S. administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months.
Foxconn, Apple’s main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters.
This included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn’s total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion.
Exports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models.
Customs data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.
Trump latergranted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived.
To expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours.
At least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to “beat the tariffs”.

Content: The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) has reported a robust 49% increase in its net profit, reaching ₹502 crore for the January-March quarter of financial year 2024-25, compared to ₹337 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.
 
India’s leading green financing non-banking financial company (NBFC) also posted a revenue of ₹1,392 crore for the fourth quarter, marking a 37.7% rise from ₹1,011 crore in Q4 of FY 2023-24.
 
During the quarter, IREDA recorded a 27% growth in loan sanctions, amounting to ₹47,453 crore, while loan disbursements rose 20% year-on-year to ₹30,168 crore.
 
The company’s total loan book expanded significantly to ₹76,250 crore, reflecting a 28% increase from ₹59,698 crore reported at the end of the corresponding quarter last year.
 
In a move to boost its global presence, IREDA signed a loan agreement worth 26 billion Japanese yen with the Tokyo branch of State Bank of India (SBI) on March 28. The facility includes a green shoe option of an additional 10 billion yen. The five-year unsecured loan, structured with a bullet payment at maturity, is expected to carry a hedged cost of below 7%, making it more cost-effective than similar-tenure loans in the domestic market.
 
IREDA continues to maintain strong international credit ratings of ‘BBB-’ (long-term) and ‘A-3’ (short-term) with a ‘Stable’ outlook from S&P Global, reflecting its sound corporate governance and credibility in international markets.
 
In the previous quarter (October–December), the NBFC reported a 26.8% rise in net profit to ₹425.37 crore, up from ₹335.54 crore in the same period a year ago. Revenue during Q3 FY 2024 stood at ₹1,698.99 crore, marking a 35.57% increase from ₹1,253.20 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24.

Title: India’s exports hit record $820.93 billion in FY25 amid global headwinds
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:00:31 +0000
Content: India’s total exports of goods and services rose by 5.5% to a record $820.93 billion in the financial year ending March 31,  compared to $773 billion in the previous year, according to Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal. This growth comes despite global economic uncertainties and trade tensions.
 
Merchandise exports stood at $437.4 billion, while non-petroleum exports registered a 6% year-on-year increase, reaching $374.08 billion in FY25.
 
However, India’s trade deficit widened to $21.54 billion in March, up from $14.05 billion in February, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Merchandise exports rose marginally by 0.7% to $41.97 billion during the month, while imports surged by 11.3% to $63.51 billion, leading to the broader gap.
 
Compared to February, exports in March jumped 13.75%, while imports grew 24.6%.
 
These developments come amid rising tensions in global markets, particularly after the US hiked tariffs on several imports. India is currently engaged in talks with the United States to finalise a bilateral trade agreement, with the US agreeing to pause the tariff hikes for 90 days.
 
According to official sources, the first phase of the agreement is expected to be concluded within this pause period. The terms of reference have already been finalised, and negotiations are taking place primarily through video conferencing. If needed, Indian officials may travel to Washington, or US officials may visit New Delhi.
 
Authorities are also on alert to prevent any misuse of trade routes. A close watch is being maintained to ensure that other countries do not route their exports through India to evade US tariffs. Similarly, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has been instructed to monitor that Indian exporters do not use third countries to reroute goods.
 
Officials emphasized that India remains a trusted trade partner of the US, and any such circumvention could damage that reputation.
 
Speaking to journalists last week, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal described the ongoing negotiations with the US as “very good.” He said India offers a strong case for a trade deal, given its economic potential and demographic strengths.
 
“Considering the growth trajectory India is expected to follow over the next 25–30 years, with a young, aspirational population driving demand, we believe India presents a compelling case for a strong bilateral trade agreement with the United States,” Goyal said at a press conference.

Content: India’s annual retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to 3.34% in March 2025—the lowest level since August 2019—according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics on Tuesday.
Food inflation also slowed significantly during the month, dropping to 2.69%, its lowest since November 2021.
The notable decline in both headline and food inflation is primarily attributed to a reduction in the prices of key food items such as vegetables, eggs, pulses, meat and fish, cereals, and milk, the ministry noted.
Among the commodities with the sharpest year-on-year price drops in March were ginger (-38.11%), tomato (-34.96%), cauliflower (-25.99%), jeera (cumin) (-25.86%), and garlic (-25.22%).
Housing inflation stood at 3.03% in March, slightly higher than February’s 2.91%. Notably, the housing index is compiled only for the urban sector.
Fuel and light inflation was recorded at 1.48%, while education inflation for the month came in at 3.98%, the data showed.
Retail inflation in India has been on a downward trend in recent months. Reflecting this, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee recently revised its inflation forecast for 2025–26 to 4.0%, down from the earlier projection of 4.2%, citing improved prospects for food prices.
“Headline inflation moderated during January–February 2025 following a sharp correction in food inflation. The outlook for food inflation has turned decisively positive,” said RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra last week.
He noted that concerns regarding rabi crop output have eased significantly, with the second advance estimates pointing to record wheat production and higher pulse output compared to the previous year. These developments, along with robust kharif crop arrivals, are expected to contribute to a sustained softening of food prices.
“The sharp decline in inflation expectations in our latest survey—both for three months and one year ahead—will help anchor inflationary trends going forward,” Malhotra added.
The Governor also emphasized that falling global crude oil prices are favorable for the inflation outlook. However, he cautioned that global market uncertainties and potential weather-related supply disruptions remain as upside risks.
Assuming a normal monsoon, the RBI projects CPI inflation for the financial year 2025–26 at 4.0%, with quarterly estimates as follows: Q1: 3.6%, Q2: 3.9%, Q3: 3.8%, and Q4: 4.4%.
The risks to this outlook are considered evenly balanced.

Title: M&A, PE deals in consumer sector surge to 3-year high of $4 billion in Jan–March
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:21:43 +0000
Content: The value of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and private equity (PE) investments in India’s consumer and retail sector surged to a three-year high of nearly $4 billion in the January–March 2025 quarter, according to Grant Thornton Bharat’s latest quarterly deal tracker report.
Topping the deal charts were two mega investments: Temasek, the Singapore-based PE firm, invested $1 billion for a 10% stake in Haldiram Snacks, while Wilmar International increased its holding in Adani Wilmar (now renamed AWL Agri-Business after Adani Group’s exit) from 44% to nearly 75% through a $1.4 billion deal. These high-value investments underscore growing investor confidence in India’s food processing and consumer goods segments, the report noted.
The total deal value in Q1 2025 was three times higher than the $1.28 billion recorded in Q1 2023 and more than double the $1.74 billion seen in Q1 2024. The number of deals also climbed to 139, compared to 78 in Q1 2023 and 102 in Q1 2024.
“India’s consumer and retail sector is entering a dynamic phase of growth, with M&A and private equity investments surging across high-potential segments such as food & beverages, personal care, and e-commerce,” said Naveen Malpani, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat.
“In particular, the F&B space is seeing strong momentum, as consumers seek better products and brands embrace digital distribution to reach them. We expect strategic consolidation and capital inflows to continue, as businesses demonstrate resilience, digital agility, and strong consumer connect.”
The consolidation trend was evident in strategic acquisitions by major players: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) acquired D2C skincare brand Minimalist, ITC took over frozen foods brand Prasuma, and Adani Wilmar acquired GD Foods, the maker of Tops sauces and pickles.

Title: Indian markets rally on US tariff relief; Sensex surges over 1,500 points
Publication Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 10:53:43 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets witnessed a sharp rally on Tuesday, buoyed by the United States’ decision to provide a 90-day relief from reciprocal tariffs. The announcement lifted investor sentiment, especially amid expectations of similar relief for the automotive sector.
The BSE Sensex opened with a robust jump of nearly 1,700 points at 76,852 and soon touched the intra-day high of 76,908. Throughout the session, the index traded in a narrow range near its peak, supported by strong buying in private banks, metal stocks, IT firms, and infrastructure-related shares.
By the close of trade, the Sensex had gained 1,578 points, or 2.1%, ending at 76,735. Heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank contributed significantly to the gains, collectively adding around 750 points to the overall rally.
The NSE Nifty also mirrored the positive sentiment, opening at the day’s high of 23,368 and settling marginally lower at 23,329—up 500 points or 2.2% for the day.
Global cues, especially from the US, added to the upbeat mood in domestic markets. Investors responded positively to expectations that President Donald Trump could announce additional tariff exemptions, sparking optimism across major indices.
“Markets are adjusting to the new reality of daily Trump twists and turns,” said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital. “Markets tend to react positively when tariffs appear to be lifted temporarily and negatively when unexpected developments arise.”
On the Nifty, top gainers included IndusInd Bank, Shriram Finance, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Motors, and Axis Bank.
Broader market indices such as the Nifty 500, Midcap, and Smallcap also traded in the green, reflecting widespread buying interest.
Sector-wise, Realty, Automobiles, Metals, Financial Services, and Media stocks led the rally.
“Optimism was further boosted by reports that President Trump is considering similar tariff relief for the automotive sector,” said Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity.
The Indian rupee also strengthened against the US dollar, closing 28 paise higher at 85.77, compared to Friday’s close of 86.05.

Title: Australian politicians took $147,000 of match tickets while weighing sports betting ban
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:26:45 +0000
Content: Australian politicians were gifted about A$245,000 ($147,000) in match tickets over nearly two years by the country’s most popular sporting leagues as part of a lobbying campaign against a proposed ban on advertising of online gambling, according to Reuters calculations based on government documents.
Lobbying by the gambling industry against the ban has been reported previously in media but the calculation of the total value of tickets declared by politicians in the parliamentary gift register shows the role played by sporting bodies and provides a dollar amount for the first time. Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had promised a crackdown on gambling advertising following a 2023 parliamentary inquiry ordered by his government that recommended a “comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising for online gambling”.
But he took the issue off the legislative agenda late last year and has left it to be considered by a new parliament to be formed following a May 3 general election that his party is tipped to win by a narrow margin. Polls show that three-quarters of Australians want a ban.
“We know vested interests have been lobbying hard to prevent a ban and the level of soft diplomacy revealed by this analysis of declared gifts to politicians is deeply concerning,” said David Pocock, an independent senator.
“It is appalling that 18 months after the landmark report into online gambling harm, and after a full term of a Labor government, the prime minister has failed to take any meaningful action to ban gambling advertising.”
Albanese and the AFL did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The NRL declined comment.
Such lobbying is not illegal in Australia but individual gifts worth over A$300 received by parliamentarians must be reported to the prime minister’s office, which maintains the parliamentary gift register, a public database.
It shows that politicians from both Australia’s main parties received 312 free tickets between June 28, 2023, when the government report recommended a ban on online gambling advertisements, and March 28 this year when parliament was dissolved.
There was no price ascribed to the tickets but Reuters calculated their value based on the cheapest corporate box seat. The calculations were verified by Hunter Fujak, senior lecturer in sports management at Deakin University, and Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology, Sydney’s Centre for Sport, Business and Society.
“It’s a reasonable estimate, probably on the conservative side,” Harcourt said.
PM, OPPOSITION LEADER GIVEN TICKETS
Albanese received A$29,000 worth of tickets, mostly to grand finals and games played by his NRL home team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the gift register showed.
Peter Dutton, leader of the opposition conservative coalition, received A$21,350 of tickets during the period, the register shows.
Dutton’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
The gifted tickets over the 21-month period compared with tickets worth an estimated A$234,000 given to politicians in the previous parliamentary term from 2019 to 2022, although sports attendance at that time was impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns. Data before 2019 was not available.
Australians lose the most on gambling in the world on a per capita basis, government data shows. Consultancy H2 Gambling Capital estimates gamblers in Australia will lose A$34 billion in 2025. The country’s sports bodies benefit because, unlike in many other countries, they take a percentage cut of money gambled on their games. They also earn revenues from sponsorship and broadcast rights.
In a confidential submission to government, the NRL said the percentage cut it receives from gambling, currently about A$70 million a year, would be more than halved if the ban comes into force, said a person who saw the document. The source declined to be identified because the submission has not been released publicly.
The percentage cut, although a small portion of its A$745 million total revenue in 2024, is the NRL’s fastest-growing revenue stream after increasing fifteen-fold in a decade, the person said.
The NRL meanwhile attributes about one-third of the A$400 million a year it makes in broadcast rights – its main earner – to sports betting advertising, the person said.
Kate Chaney, an independent who was on the parliamentary committee that produced the 2023 report calling for the ban, said Australian sporting bodies were “addicted to gambling money” and “making decisions based on what’s good for their financial viability, not for sport in Australia”.
The government did not respond to questions about the submission and its consultation process, while the NRL declined comment.
LOBBYING GROUP After the report recommending reform was published, the Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports (COMPPS), a lobbying group for the NRL, the AFL and other sports bodies, coordinated a campaign to lobby politicians with consistent messaging against the ban, said three people familiar with the planning.
They declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the topic.
COMPPS members invited politicians to events and seated them close to sports body officials, mostly from the NRL and AFL, who were briefed on how to discuss the impact of the advertising ban, said two people involved in the planning.
The members shared information about which politicians to target based on who was influential in government or passionate about a particular sport, the people added.
COMPPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“You’re not just buying them a ticket in the box and giving them hospitality, you’ve got their ear for the length of the game,” said Charles Livingstone, an associate professor of public health at Monash University and member of the World Health Organisation’s Expert Group on Gambling.
“These guys are in a position to plant ideas and to influence politicians in ways that no one else can.”
Both the NRL and the AFL documented their opposition to the ban in messages to Albanese within days of grand final events attended by the prime minister and other senior politicians last year. The AFL proposed an “alternative … regulatory framework”, according to an October 1 email from the AFL to Albanese. Albanese’s office produced the email following a discovery request by Pocock, the independent senator.
Albanese’s office confirmed it had received the correspondence from both the NRL and AFL but did not give details.
Louis Francis, a public health academic at Curtin University, said the end result – gambling reform stalled in the face of overwhelming public support – was testament to the “friendships and connections” sporting bodies could make by inviting politicians to games.
Free tickets for politicians amounted to “a really small price to pay to get access to political decision makers,” she said. “And the return is great.”

Title: India’s FY25 exports up 5.5% to $821 billion; March sees 2.65% rise
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 06:44:37 +0000
Content: India’s cumulative exports for the financial year 2024–25 (April–March) rose by 5.5% to $820.93 billion, up from $778.13 billion in the previous year, driven by strong performances in key sectors, according to data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.
In March 2025, total exports of goods and services rose 2.65% year-on-year to $73.61 billion. Imports for the month climbed 4.9% to $77.23 billion.
Among the major contributors to merchandise export growth were electronic goods, coffee, tobacco, rice, jute products including floor coverings, meat, dairy and poultry products, tea, carpets, plastics and linoleum, readymade garments of all textiles, drugs and pharmaceuticals, cereal preparations and processed food items, mica, coal, minerals (including processed varieties), engineering goods, and fruits and vegetables.
Electronic goods exports saw a remarkable 32.47% jump, rising from $29.12 billion in FY2023-24 to $38.58 billion in FY2024-25. Coffee exports surged by 40.37%, from $1.29 billion to $1.81 billion, while tobacco exports climbed 36.53%, reaching $1.98 billion from $1.45 billion a year earlier.
Rice exports rose by 19.73% to $12.47 billion, compared to $10.42 billion in FY2023-24. Tea exports also showed positive growth, increasing by 11.84% to $0.92 billion.
Non-petroleum exports during FY2024-25 were valued at $374.08 billion, registering a 6 percent increase over $352.92 billion recorded in the previous year.
Other significant growth segments included meat, dairy, and poultry products, which rose by 12.57% to $5.1 billion; textiles, up by 10.03% to $15.99 billion; and drugs and pharmaceuticals, which recorded a 9.39% rise to $30.47 billion.

Title: India one of preferred markets with resilient macro conditions: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 06:38:48 +0000
Content: A Morgan Stanley report released on Wednesday identified India as one of its top equity market picks, citing resilient macroeconomic conditions and adequate stimulus support.
In the context of the “Brave New World” dynamic shaping the early phase of the new US administration, the global brokerage said, “Among the larger markets, we maintain our core overweight (OW) recommendations on domestic India, domestic Japan, Singapore, and the UAE,” among others.
“We remain most cautious on Taiwan and New Zealand, while we reduce the underweight on Korea and shift to an equal weight (EW) stance on Australia,” it added.
India and Australia have moderate levels of exports and total revenues in listed equities from the US, mainly concentrated in healthcare and IT services (India) and industrials (Australia).
The brokerage sees a relatively resilient outlook for financials earnings, supported by strong capital ratios and a positive asset quality outlook across most of its coverage.
“We particularly like financials in Singapore, India, Chile, the UAE, and Japan,” the report said.
For the most defensive recommendations, the firm advises focusing on markets with high domestic exposure and economies where macro conditions are seen as resilient or sufficiently buffered by stimulus. This includes India (75% domestic), the Philippines (91% domestic), and Malaysia (68% domestic). In contrast, the report expressed caution on domestic growth in Indonesia and Thailand.
According to another Morgan Stanley report released on Tuesday, India’s “low beta” is helping it significantly outperform amid the global selloff—even as the index may approach multi-month lows.
Key India-specific catalysts include continued dovish actions from the RBI, stimulus through GST rate cuts, and a potential trade deal with the US. Morgan Stanley also sees lower food inflation and declining oil prices keeping both food and non-food inflation at benign levels.

Title: US dismisses reports of NATO funding cuts
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 05:50:08 +0000
Content: US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce has rejected reports suggesting that the Trump administration plans to reduce US funding for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
During a press briefing on Tuesday, Bruce emphasized that the US remains committed to NATO and aims to strengthen the military alliance as a deterrent, not to help fight wars or fund them. She added that NATO was intended to be a collective defense mechanism to prevent bad actors from taking harmful actions.
“That’s from a story that looks at a memo that was leaked, not from an actual plan or suggestion. What I can tell you is that it concerns me when I see the word ‘eliminate.’ I traveled to NATO for that summit with the Secretary of State. Every meeting, every moment, every time we were on camera, and in every bilateral meeting with the Secretary-General, the one message—among several—was that the Secretary of State of the United States reiterated our full commitment to NATO, as did the President of the United , States”, Bruce said.
“Our commitment means that we want to ensure the nations within NATO can deliver on NATO’s mission, which is to serve as a deterrent. NATO is not meant to fund wars or help fight them; it was designed to prevent bad actors from doing bad things, because it would be too costly for them. At this point, we have nations that need to ramp up, share the burden, and increase their defense spending—not because we’re being difficult, but because we are committed to NATO”, she added.
“Reports claiming the US will end funding for NATO couldn’t be further from the truth. Such stories are nothing but ‘fear-mongering,’ which understandably causes concern. There will be ample opportunity to discuss this when President Trump sends his budget proposal to Congress.”
Bruce acknowledged that NATO members are increasing their defense budgets, recognizing the importance of shared commitment. She emphasized, “A story about eliminating funding for NATO is completely false. This is about strengthening NATO and, dare I say, making it great again. But fear-mongering about this issue is counterproductive and understandably upsets people.”
“As with our review of foreign aid, some things will change, but that doesn’t mean we’ve changed our commitment to NATO. It may look different. If other nations are raising their contributions, perhaps the American contribution could decrease, but NATO would remain stronger. That’s the kind of solution families and allies seek—looking out for each other and being honest”, she added.
Bruce’s comments came after reports suggested the Trump administration might reduce nearly 50 percent of the State Department’s funding for the next fiscal year, including cuts to international organizations like the UN, NATO, and peacekeeping operations.
The memo also proposed reducing funding for humanitarian assistance and global health programs by over 50 percent. It remained unclear whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio had endorsed the memo, which was dated April 10. The seriousness of the proposed cuts in Congress was also uncertain.
According to a US official familiar with the department’s review, the White House is expected to send Congress a budget proposal this spring that may align with the memo’s outline to push lawmakers to formalize ongoing reductions.

Title: Trump maintains position on Canada, believes it would benefit as 51st US state: White House
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 05:17:54 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump still believes Canada would benefit from becoming the 51st state of the United States, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Tuesday.
Responding to a question about whether Trump’s stance on Canada had changed, Leavitt said, “I would reject the notion that the president’s position on Canada has shifted. Perhaps he just hasn’t been asked about Canada recently by members of the press in the Oval Office, where they see him almost every day. However, the president still maintains his position on Canada. The United States has been subsidizing Canada’s national defense, and he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America.”
Trump had previously floated the idea of Canada joining the US and mockingly referred to former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the “Governor of Canada.”
Leavitt also addressed trade-related issues, noting there were no new announcements regarding support for automakers but emphasizing Trump’s flexible approach to negotiations. “His goal is fair trade that puts the American worker first,” she said, adding that the president has been in discussions with automakers and workers who support his efforts.
On Monday, Trump told reporters he was “looking into” potential part-specific tariff exemptions for carmakers, emphasizing the importance of flexibility as companies adjust their supply chains. His comments came shortly after the administration exempted electronic devices—such as smartphones and laptops—from reciprocal tariffs.
Speaking to reporters during a meeting with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele on Monday, Trump said, “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they are switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico, and other places. They’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time — so I’m talking about things like that.”
Trump reiterated his earlier remarks about the need for flexibility during ongoing tariff talks with various nations. “I’m a very flexible person. I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible — and you have to be,” Trump said. “You just can’t have a wall and only a wall. Sometimes, you have to go around it, under it, or above it.”
“There will maybe be things coming… I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to a position of greatness for our country”, the US President added.

Title: From the fringes in France to the heart of LA, shooting welcomes venue decision
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:50:21 +0000
Content: The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has welcomed the sport’s return to the “heart of the Olympic experience” at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles after being held away from the main venue in Paris last year.
The shooting events at the 2024 Games were staged 270km from Paris in Chateauroux, with current ISSF President Luciano Rossi saying it was “a big mistake” by his federation predecessors to accept that venue.
The Italian also vowed to lobby the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ensure shooting was staged within the host city only in 2028.
Olympic organisers announced the venues on Tuesday, with target shooting to take place in a temporary indoor range in Long Beach while the shotgun events will be held at the LA Clays Shooting Sports Park in El Monte – both in LA County.
Rossi said in a statement the shooting community should be “proud and grateful to see our venues right at the heart of the Olympic experience”.
“With determined efforts from my ISSF colleagues, and thanks to excellent co-operation with LA28 and the IOC, our shooting athletes will get the full Olympic Games experience and be at the heart of the action,” he added.
Shooting will have a full programme of 15 events in Los Angeles.

Title: Barcelona reach Champions League semis despite 3-1 loss at Dortmund
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:45:27 +0000
Content: Five-time European champions Barcelona reached their first Champions League semi-final in six seasons with a 5-3 aggregate victory despite being beaten 3-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.
Serhou Guirassy scored a hat-trick for Dortmund to condemn Barca to their first defeat across all competitions this year but it could not prevent the Catalans from reaching the last four.
Barcelona will play either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich, who face each other on Wednesday, in the last four.
“Dortmund did very well. We did not have our best day. I had a feeling something like that would happen today because I know the stadium well,” said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.
“Things didn’t go too well for us but Dortmund played very well. But congratulations to my team, we’re in the semi-finals. We’re happy. I’m really happy for the team and the club.”
The visitors found themselves on the back foot from the start with Dortmund shooting out of the blocks as they attempted to bounce back from last week’s 4-0 first-leg loss.
Dortmund, who drew 2-2 against Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday, had two golden chances in the opening minutes before Guirassy’s chipped penalty in the 11th minute gave them a deserved lead.
The Spaniards, unbeaten in 2025 going into the game, gradually fought their way back and could have levelled were it not for some sloppy finishing from Jules Kounde in the 40th.
After the break, however, Dortmund were again the stronger side at the start and Guirassy headed in after Ramy Bensebaini’s nod from a corner four minutes after the restart to ignite hopes of a potential record-matching comeback.
Dortmund’s attempt to match Barcelona’s Champions League record of overturning a four-goal first-leg deficit in a knockout stage was derailed by Bensebaini’s 54th-minute own goal that settled Spanish nerves.
Robert Lewandowski had put Bensebaini under pressure as he chased a cutback from Fermin Lopez, and the Dortmund player stabbed the ball into his own net.
Lopez then had a chance to score himself in the 64th but his shot missed the target.
Guirassy, the first Dortmund player to score 13 goals in a single Champions League campaign, completed his hat-trick in the 76th, pouncing on a defensive error.
But, with Dortmund, who are struggling in the Bundesliga and risk missing out on Champions League football next season, still needing two more goals to take the game to extra time, the hosts gradually ran out of steam.
“We wanted to play better and more courageously and support each other more on the pitch,” said Dortmund’s Pascal Gross.
“We did that today and it was a completely different game. It’s a shame we didn’t play like that in the first leg as we could have got something out of it.”

Title: After Harvard rejects US demands, Trump adds new threat
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:43:06 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status on Tuesday and said the university should apologize, a day after it rejected what it called unlawful demands to overhaul academic programs or lose federal grants.
Beginning with Columbia University, the Trump administration has rebuked universities across the country over their handling of the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled campuses last year following the 2023 Hamas-led attack inside Israel and the subsequent Israeli attacks on Gaza.
Trump has called the protests anti-American and antisemitic, accused universities of peddling Marxism and “radical left” ideology, and promised to end federal grants and contracts to universities that do not agree to his administration’s demands.
Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday he was mulling whether to seek to end Harvard’s tax-exempt status if it continued pushing what he called “political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?'”
He did not say how he would do this. Under the U.S. tax code, most universities are exempt from federal income tax because they are deemed to be “operated exclusively” for public educational purposes.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Trump wanted to see Harvard apologize for what she called “antisemitism that took place on their college campus against Jewish American students.”
She accused Harvard and other schools of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funding based on race or national origin.
Under Title VI, federal funds can be terminated only after a lengthy investigation and hearings as well as a 30-day notice to Congress, which has not happened at Columbia or Harvard.
Some professors and students have said the protests are being unfairly conflated with antisemitism as a pretext for an unconstitutional attack on academic freedoms.
Columbia, a private school in New York City, agreed to negotiations over demands to tighten its protest rules after the Trump administration said last month it had terminated grants and contracts worth $400 million, mostly for medical and other scientific research.
Harvard President Alan Garber in a letter on Monday said demands the Trump administration made of the Massachusetts university, including an audit to ensure the “viewpoint diversity” of its students and faculty and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs, were unprecedented “assertions of power, unmoored from the law” that violated constitutional free speech and the Civil Rights Act.
Like Columbia, he said Harvard had worked to fight antisemitism and other prejudice on its campus while preserving academic freedoms and the right to protest.
Hours after Garber’s letter, the Trump administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said it was freezing more than $2 billion in contracts and grants to Harvard, the country’s oldest and richest university. The administration did not respond to questions about which grants and contracts had been cut, and Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
Some Columbia professors have sued the Trump administration, saying the grant terminations violated Title VI and their constitutional speech and due process rights. A federal judge in New York ordered the Trump administration to reply by May 1.
After reading the Harvard president’s letter, Columbia’s interim president, Claire Shipman, said in a statement on Monday night that Columbia will continue “good faith discussions” and “constructive dialog” with the U.S. Justice Department’s antisemitism task force.
“We would reject any agreement in which the government dictates what we teach, research, or who we hire,” she wrote.
SUPPORT FROM OTHER SCHOOLS
A few of Harvard’s peer institutions lent support on Tuesday to the school’s stand against the Trump administration.
“Princeton stands with Harvard,” Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber wrote on social media, encouraging people to read the Harvard president’s rebuke of the government’s demands.
Stanford University President Jonathan Levin and Provost Jenny Martinez said in a statement they fully backed Harvard.
“Harvard’s objections to the letter it received are rooted in the American tradition of liberty, a tradition essential to our country’s universities, and worth defending,” the pair wrote.
They added that while universities need to “address legitimate concerns with humility and openness” it’s clear that “the way to bring about constructive change is not by destroying the nation’s capacity for scientific research…”
On Monday, a group of U.S. universities, including Princeton and the University of Illinois, sued the Department of Energy over steep cuts to federal research funding in areas like advanced nuclear technology, cybersecurity and novel radioactive drugs.
Trump, who took office on January 20, faces court challenges to his immigration policies and pushback from state attorneys general against his firing of government workers and suspension of trillions of dollars in federal grants, loans and financial support.

Title: PSG survive Aston Villa scare to reach Champions League semis
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:10:45 +0000
Content: Paris St Germain kept alive their dream of a first Champions League title on Tuesday by squeezing past Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate after a pulsating second leg of their quarter-final which the English side won 3-2.
Ahead 3-1 from the first leg, PSG appeared to have sealed the contest within the first half-hour as their marauding fullbacks Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes scored from two flowing counter-attacks to stun the Villa Park crowd.
But Youri Tielemans revived hope with a 34th-minute deflected goal before Villa stunned the visitors early in the second half with two goals in two minutes from John McGinn and Ezri Konsa.
Villa poured forward, drawing a string of outstanding saves from PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to preserve the aggregate win and enable his side to move into a semi-final against either Real Madrid or Arsenal, who play on Wednesday.
“Aston Villa made it difficult for us but we did what we had to do,” said PSG’s delighted captain Marquinhos.
“It’s such a difficult competition but we’re getting better and better, and we’re proving that we’re such a good team. It’s going to be such a difficult semi-final, whether it’s Arsenal or Real Madrid, but, of course, there is a belief that this Paris St Germain team can go all the way and win it.”
PSG had been hot favourites to win the quarter-final given their first-leg advantage and recent form, including sealing a fourth straight Ligue 1 title and reaching the final of the French Cup.
But Villa were not lacking belief themselves, especially at home where they were on a 17-match unbeaten run in all competitions. The hosts came out flying, nearly taking the lead from a corner in an early flurry of attacks.
FRANTIC FINALE
However, PSG struck first blood in the 11th minute when Hakimi stroked the ball in after Villa’s usually ultra-reliable goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez pushed it into his path.
Sixteen minutes later, Mendes curled in PSG’s second goal off the post at the end of another fast-flowing counter-attack.
Tielemans’s first-half goal inspired a Villa onslaught after the break, with McGinn letting fly from outside the box to score in the 55th minute, helped by a small deflection. Two minutes later, Konza struck Villa’s third on the night after being set up by a brilliant dribble from Marcus Rashford.
Villa’s highest-profile fan, Prince William, was on his feet and one more goal would have put them level on aggregate.
But Donnarumma brilliantly defied Rashford, Tielemans, and then substitute Marco Asensio — on loan from PSG — during a nerve-wracking finale.
“Very proud of the boys, of what we’ve done tonight,” said Konza. “Obviously, the two goals at the start killed us. But we showed great belief, the great character to get back into the game. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough.”
Villa fans gave their team a standing ovation for their sterling performance against the form team of Europe, as PSG’s boisterous away supporters danced and chanted into the rainy Birmingham night.

Title: ‘Not a single tree’: SC extends stay on deforestation near Hyderabad University
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:29:42 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Wednesday extended the stay on tree cutting in 400 acres of land at Kancha Gachibowli in Hyderabad for another month and directed the Wildlife Warden of Telangana to take steps to protect wildlife affected by deforestation in 100 acres.
The bench, consisting of Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih, scheduled the next hearing for May 15, after senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Telangana government, requested four weeks to respond to the report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC).
The CEC had visited the site and submitted its report in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order from April 3.
While granting the state government time to review and respond to the CEC report, the bench ordered that the status quo be maintained and emphasized that no trees should be cut.
The court also directed the Wildlife Warden to examine and implement immediate steps required to protect wildlife impacted by deforestation in the 100 acres.
It further warned that if state government officers attempt to oppose restoration efforts, they would face temporary imprisonment.
The Supreme Court had taken up the matter suo motu on April 3 and stayed further tree cutting.
Protests had erupted from students of Hyderabad Central University (HCU), environmental activists, and opposition parties after authorities began clearing the land near the university for an auction by the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC), intended for the development of IT parks.
The authorities faced criticism from protestors for destroying a crucial green space in the city and disrupting wildlife habitats.
During Wednesday’s hearing, the bench questioned the state government about whether it had obtained permission from the CEC for tree felling.
The bench also inquired about the urgency behind the development activity, which involved the removal of trees from the forest area.
The bench noted their surprise at seeing herbivorous animals in videos running for shelter and being attacked by stray dogs.
Instructing the authorities to present a restoration plan, the bench made it clear that it would go to great lengths to protect the environment.
When senior advocate K. Parameshwar, appearing as amicus curiae, informed the Court about the land being mortgaged to a private party for Rs 10,000 crore, and referenced the CEC report, the bench stated that their primary concern was how so many trees had been felled without permission.
It remarked that it was up to the state whether some of its officers would face temporary imprisonment and urged the state to prioritize the protection of wildlife.

Title: In a first in India, ATM installed onboard train on a trial basis
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:29:36 +0000
Content: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Indian Railways has installed an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) onboard the Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express in Maharashtra, as part of a trial run.
Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared a video of the onboard ATM on X, marking the beginning of the ATM on Wheels initiative. The project aligns with the Railway Board’s directive to explore innovative ways to boost non-fare revenue.
A meeting with potential vendors was held on March 25, during which the idea of installing mobile ATMs on trains was discussed. Following that, the first trial run was conducted on April 10, on the 12110 Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express. The train’s mini pantry space was converted into a secure ATM installation area by the mechanical team.
“The ATM was properly secured for its maiden journey using rubber pads and bolts to isolate vibrations. Two fire extinguishers have also been provided in the allocated space,” Indian Railways stated.
The initiative is part of Indian Railways’ broader transformation drive under Viksit Bharat 2047, aiming to modernize infrastructure, enhance passenger experience, and increase operational efficiency.
In 2024, Indian Railways achieved the complete renewal of 6,450 km of track, 8,550 turnout renewals, and upgraded train speeds to 130 kmph over 2,000 km. Additionally, 3,210 Route Kilometers (Rkm) were electrified, extending the electrified broad-gauge network to 97%, with renewable energy capacity reaching 2,014 MW.
Under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, 1,337 stations have been identified for redevelopment. The Railways also launched 136 Vande Bharat trains and introduced the first Namo Bharat Rapid Rail. During peak seasons, 21,513 special train trips were operated.
In the area of safety, 10,000 locomotives are being equipped with Kavach technology. So far, 9,000 technicians have been trained, and bids have been invited for 15,000 Rkm under the program.

Title: Sensex rises for third day; Nifty near 23,450 as banks lead rally
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:05:16 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets continued their upward trend for the third straight session on Wednesday, supported by strong buying in financial stocks, especially private banks, and select oil and gas shares.
The Sensex opened 262 points higher at 76,996 but briefly turned negative due to weak global cues amid rising US-China trade tensions. However, it recovered later in the day, rising 556 points from the day’s low to touch a high of 77,110. The index finally closed at 77,044, up 309 points or 0.4 per cent.
In the last three sessions, the Sensex has gained 3,197 points.
The Nifty followed a similar path. It touched a low of 23,273 and later rose to a high of 23,452. The index ended near its high at 23,433, up 104.60 points or 0.45 per cent. The Nifty has now risen by 1,038 points in three days.
Among the top gainers on the Nifty were IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Trent, ONGC, and Asian Paints. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, and Tata Motors were among the laggards.
Sector-wise, all indices ended in the green except auto. Media, PSU banks, and oil & gas sectors led the rally with gains of 1–2 per cent. The broader market also remained firm, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advancing 0.5 per cent each.
Global markets, however, faced pressure. Asian indices declined as investor sentiment was hit by US President Donald Trump’s warning of tariffs up to 245 per cent on Chinese imports. The Hang Seng and Taiwan indices fell nearly 2 per cent each, while Kospi and Nikkei dropped over 1 per cent.
“On the daily chart, the index has closed above the 100-EMA for the second consecutive session. Support is now placed at 23,300, and the positive momentum is likely to persist as long as it holds above this level,” said Rupak De of LKP Securities.
Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities noted that the rupee appreciated for the third consecutive day, supported by foreign inflows, a weaker US dollar, and encouraging economic data. The near-term trend remains bearish for USD-INR, with support at 85.40 and resistance at 86.05.

Title: Israel will keep Gaza buffer zone, minister says, as ceasefire efforts stall
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:55:37 +0000
Content: Israeli troops will remain in the buffer zones they have created in Gaza even after any settlement to end the war, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday, as efforts to revive a ceasefire agreement faltered.
Since resuming their operation last month, Israeli forces have carved out a broad “security zone” extending deep into Gaza and squeezing more than 2 million Palestinians into ever smaller areas in the south and along the coastline.
“Unlike in the past, the IDF is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,” Katz said in a statement following a meeting with military commanders, adding that “tens of percent” of Gaza had been added to the zone.
“The IDF will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and the communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza – as in Lebanon and Syria.”
In southern Gaza alone, Israeli forces have seized about 20% of the enclave’s territory, taking control of the border city of Rafah and pushing inland up to the so-called “Morag corridor” that runs from the eastern edge of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea between Rafah and the city of Khan Younis.
It already held a wide corridor across the central Netzarim area and has extended a buffer zone all around the border hundreds of metres inland, including the Shejaia area just to the east of Gaza City in the north.
Israel says its forces have killed hundreds of Hamas fighters, including many senior commanders of the Palestinian militant group, but the operation has alarmed the United Nations and European countries.
More than 400,000 Palestinians have been displaced since hostilities resumed on March 18 after two months of relative calm, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, and Israeli air strikes and bombardments have killed at least 1,630 people.
Medical charity MSF said Gaza had become a “mass grave” with humanitarian groups struggling to provide aid. “We are witnessing in real time the destruction and forced displacement of the entire population in Gaza,” Amande Bazerolle, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Gaza said in a statement.
Katz said Israel, which has blocked the delivery of aid supplies into the territory, was creating infrastructure to allow distribution through civilian companies at a later date. But he said the blockade on aid would remain in place.
He said Israel would push forward with a plan to allow Gazans who wished to leave the enclave to do so, although it remains unclear which countries would be willing to accept large numbers of Palestinians.
RED LINES
The comments from Katz, repeating Israel’s demand on Hamas to disarm, underscore how far away the two sides remain from any ceasefire agreement, despite efforts by Egyptian mediators to revive efforts to reach a deal.
Hamas has repeatedly described calls to disarm as a red line it will not cross and has said Israeli troops must withdraw from Gaza under any permanent ceasefire.
“Any truce lacking real guarantees for halting the war, achieving full withdrawal, lifting the blockade, and beginning reconstruction will be a political trap,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.
Two Israeli officials said this week that there had been no progress in the talks despite media reports of a possible truce to allow the exchange of some of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners.
Israeli officials have said the increased military pressure will force Hamas to release the hostages but the government has faced large demonstrations by Israeli protesters demanding a deal to stop the fighting and get them back.
Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the October 2023 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
The offensive has killed at least 51,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and devastated the coastal enclave, forcing most of the population to move multiple times and reducing broad areas to rubble.
On Wednesday, Palestinian medical authorities said an airstrike killed 10 people, including Fatema Hassouna, a well-known writer and photographer who had documented the war. A strike on another house further north killed three, they said.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israel’s suspension of the entry of fuel, medical, and food supplies since early March had begun to obstruct the work of the few remaining working hospitals, with medical supplies drying up.
“Hundreds of patients and wounded individuals are deprived of essential medications, and their suffering is worsening due to the closure of border crossings,” the ministry said.

Title: India has potential to become world’s second-largest economy: Mark Mobius
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:52:00 +0000
Content: India has the potential to become the world’s second-largest economy if it continues on its current path of resilience and policy continuity, according to billionaire investor Mark Mobius.
In recent years, India has surged from being the 11th-largest economy to the fifth-largest. As of 2025, it remains behind only the US, China, Germany, and Japan in terms of total GDP.
According to the latest IMF estimates, India’s real GDP is expected to reach $4.3 trillion in 2025—just behind Japan’s $4.4 trillion and Germany’s $4.9 trillion. On its current trajectory, India is projected to surpass Japan this year and overtake Germany by 2027.
Speaking to IANS, Mobius said India could potentially rise to the second spot globally.
“India now has a substantially larger population than China. It’s now estimated that China’s population may be 800 million or less, with an average age much higher than India’s 1.2 billion people,” he said.
He added that if India removes import restrictions—both tariff and non-tariff—the manufacturing sector could thrive, driving the economy forward.
Mobius, who runs the Mobius EM Opportunities Fund for emerging markets, also commented on India’s stock market performance amid global uncertainties. He noted that even before US trade restrictions came into play, the Indian market had undergone a significant correction.
“There will be a recovery in the market, so it’s a good time for investors to begin averaging into strong stocks. For those already holding, it’s best to wait and ride out the recovery,” he advised.
Indian markets made a remarkable comeback recently, with a single-day rally on Tuesday adding Rs 11 lakh crore to investors’ wealth—wiping out all losses triggered by the US tariff shock on April 2. The recovery was broad-based, driven by strong investor sentiment and upbeat global and domestic cues.

Title: Gold hits new high, climbs over Rs 95,000 on MCX
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:39:24 +0000
Content: Gold prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) surged to yet another record high on Wednesday, fueled by a weakening US dollar and escalating global trade tensions. As of 3:07 PM, gold was trading at ₹95,172 per 10 grams, after reaching an all-time high of ₹95,435.”
Gold prices globally have also been hitting fresh highs, surpassing USD 3,300 per ounce.
The latest rise in global gold prices is also attributed to strong demand, including investments from various central banks through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Persistent geopolitical tensions have further boosted gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.
Gold is often considered a hedge against uncertainty, and the returns in recent times have been remarkable.
Publicly available data shows that gold prices have surged at an unprecedented pace in 2025, rising over 20 per cent so far. Over the past year, they have climbed around 40 per cent.
According to Sachin Jain, Regional CEO (India) at the World Gold Council (WGC), the fundamentals of gold as an asset class remain ‘very strong’ and are expected to remain so throughout the year.

Title: Karad sets benchmark in sanitary waste management with 100% safe disposal
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:16:05 +0000
Content: Karad, a small city in Maharashtra’s Satara district, has achieved 100% segregation, collection, and processing of sanitary and biomedical waste, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs announced on Wednesday.
According to the statement, the city collects an average of 300 to 350 kg of sanitary waste daily—including sanitary napkins, diapers, and other hygiene products—from hospitals, clinics, households, and public facilities.
Women-led groups have played a key role in spreading awareness at the community level. Red bins placed in public toilets ensure proper disposal, while schools have installed sanitary pad vending machines, incinerators, and disposal systems to promote hygienic practices among adolescents.
Sanitary waste is collected through dedicated bins mounted on garbage vehicles and sent to a high-temperature incinerator run by the Karad Hospital Association. This Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) incinerates waste at up to 1200°C, under real-time monitoring by the State Pollution Control Board.
The initiative runs on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, where the municipal council manages collection and transport, and the hospital body operates the 600 kg/day incinerator. The facility is provided at no cost to citizens, ensuring sustainable and efficient waste management.

Title: China responds to 245% US tariff: “Ask US for details”
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:59:12 +0000
Content: Reacting to the White House’s claim that China now faces tariffs of up to 245% on exports to the United States, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged reporters to “ask the US side for specific tax rate figures.”
Addressing a press briefing on Wednesday, Lin reiterated China’s consistent position on the issue, saying that the tariff dispute was initiated by the US. He maintained that Beijing’s countermeasures were taken to safeguard its legitimate rights and uphold international fairness and justice, describing them as both “reasonable and legal.”
Lin emphasized that tariff and trade wars yield no winners. “China does not want to fight these wars, but we are not afraid of them,” he said. Reaffirming China’s stance, he added that the country remains committed to collaboration and removing trade barriers.
In a post on X, Lin said, “In a world full of uncertainties, China remains committed to joining hands, not throwing punches; removing barriers, not erecting walls; promoting connectivity, not pursuing decoupling.”
He also underscored China’s role in the global economy, saying, “China is the world’s market and a source of opportunities for every country.”
Lin’s comments came after the White House released a fact sheet claiming China’s retaliatory tariffs have led to an effective rate of up to 245% on exports to the US. Previously, Chinese exports faced a 145% tariff.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on several countries with which the US has trade deficits. However, following talks initiated by many nations, the administration paused the higher tariffs for 90 days—with the exception of China, which retaliated.
The White House noted that more than 75 countries have already engaged in discussions to negotiate new trade deals.
“As a result, the individualized higher tariffs are currently paused amid these discussions, except for China, which retaliated,” the fact sheet stated.
For now, a baseline tariff of 10% will apply to all US imports. Trump’s broader trade strategy, titled the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan,” aims to impose matching tariffs on countries with which the US has significant trade imbalances, citing national security and economic fairness as key concerns.
At Tuesday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed Trump’s stance on China. When asked whether the President would consider easing tariffs to facilitate the TikTok deal, Leavitt said, “The President has made his position on China quite clear.”
She read an additional comment from Trump, stating, “The ball is in China’s court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don’t have to make a deal with them.”
She added, “There’s no difference between China and any other country, except they are much larger. And China wants what we have — the American consumer. Or to put it another way, they need our money.”
Trump’s trade moves have triggered turbulence in global financial markets, with major sell-offs in both Asia and Europe. Analysts warn that prolonged trade tensions could lead to inflationary pressures and dampen global economic growth.
Since beginning his second term, President Trump has doubled down on his tariff reciprocity policy, including with nations like India, vowing to match any tariffs imposed on the US to ensure balanced trade relationships.

Content: US Vice President J.D. Vance and his Indian-origin wife Usha Vance will visit Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur during their upcoming trip to India, the White House announced on Wednesday.
The Vice President is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week.
This will be Vance’s first visit to India and the first by an American Vice President in 13 years. The last Vice Presidential visit to India was by Joe Biden in 2013, during his tenure under President Barack Obama.
India is the second stop in the Vances’ two-nation tour, which begins Friday and continues through April 24. Their first destination will be Italy.
“In India, the Vice President will visit New Delhi, Jaipur, and Agra,” Vance’s office said in a statement. “The Vice President will hold meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Vice President and the Second Family will also participate in engagements at cultural sites,” it added.
The statement made no mention of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and it is not immediately clear if or when he will travel to India. If confirmed, his visit would mark the third by a senior Trump administration official to India, following trips by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President Vance.
Vance first met Prime Minister Modi in Paris earlier this year on the sidelines of the AI Summit in February. The Second Lady and the couple’s two sons also met the Prime Minister at the time. However, Wednesday’s announcement did not clarify whether their children will accompany them on this visit.
Vice President Vance has emerged as a key member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet and is a vocal supporter of the President’s agenda. Trump often calls on Vance to speak during publicly aired meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries. One of Vance’s most prominent appearances was during a meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.
Usha Vance, née Usha Bala Chilukuri, was born in San Diego to parents who immigrated to the US from Andhra Pradesh.
Vice President Kamala Harris, Vance’s immediate predecessor, never visited India during her term, despite her Indian heritage — her mother’s family hails from Tamil Nadu. Similarly, Mike Pence, Vice President during Trump’s first term, had also expressed interest in visiting India but was unable to do so.

Title: Putin praises Elon Musk, compares him to father of Soviet space program
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 16:30:27 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised Elon Musk, comparing him to Sergei Korolev, the chief engineer behind the Soviet Union’s space success in the 1950s and 1960s, state news agency TASS reported.
 
TASS cited Putin, who was speaking on Russia’s space policy at a meeting with students, as saying: “You know, there’s a person who lives in the States, you could say that he’s absolutely crazy about Mars.”
 
It quoted him as drawing a comparison between Musk and Sergei Korolev, a Soviet engineer who was instrumental in the Soviet Union’s success in sending Yuri Gagarin on the world’s first crewed spaceflight in 1961.
 
According to TASS, Putin said: “Such people rarely appear in the human population, charged with a certain idea. Even though it may seem incredible to me today, after a time such ideas are often realised.”
 
Putin has previously praised Musk, whose business interests include the SpaceX space technology company, as “an outstanding person”.
 
Musk, a top advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Ukraine, which has been fighting against Russia since 2022, when the Kremlin ordered tens of thousands of troops into its neighbour’s territory.

Title: Bigger Middle Class, Richer Middle Class
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:30:38 +0000
Content: In 2015, the Kumars of Lucknow relied on public transport and an old scooter for their daily commute. Sanjay Kumar, a schoolteacher, and his wife, a small business owner, wished to buy a car—not just for comfort, but as a symbol of socioeconomic capital. Finally in 2023, after years of careful savings out of increased earnings, they proudly drove home a brand-new SUV. Their purchase meant more than just a transaction in national accounts — it was a testament to India’s evolving middle class, where aspirations have started turning into reality.
Discussions about India’s political economy often circle back to the notion that “the middle class is overlooked”. To defend or oppose this hypothesis, one needs to first define who belong to the middle-class. According to a 2021 report, 31 percent of the population who earn between 5 and 30 lakhs per annum, comprise the Indian middle class. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, on the other hand, suggests the middle 30 percent only spend around 2.3 lakhs annually. In response to the ambiguity in the definition of middle class, a 2012 Carnegie Endowment paper suggested a novel index – the Car Index. The underlying idea is that the middle class represents those who possess income beyond a certain threshold that allows them to purchase non-essentials like vehicles.
 
Understanding the car ownership metric
There is a positive relationship between per capita car ownership and per capita income levels – shown in Figure 1. The economic rationale is guided by Engel’s Law which states that as households become more affluent, the proportion of their income spent on necessary items declines, freeing up disposable income for discretionary spending. As nations move from low- to middle-income, the income elasticity of car ownership increases and eventually declines as they transition to high-income. In other words, car ownership grows faster than output in the middle-income stages. The macro-level transition mirrors the household-level dynamics, i.e., a higher share of middle-income households bolsters vehicle ownership in the country.
Figure 1: Car ownership (for every 1000 people) and GDP per capita of G20 countries

Source: World Population Review and IMF
Over the 2012-22 decade, number of registered motor vehicles in India grew at a CAGR of 8.3 percent, notwithstanding the pandemic. The CAGR of GDP was only around 5.5 percent during the same period, delineating income elastic car ownership. It might be argued that richer households played a significant role in this, given their capacity to purchase more than 1 vehicle. However, the CAGR of two-wheelers was also around 8.6 percent, indicating robust entry of lower-income buyers. Moreover, given the relatively low proportion of the rich in developing countries, their additional purchases can be safely absorbed into the margin of error of calculations. The projected CAGR of 3.1 percent in the second-hand car market further ensures that car ownership has picked up at lower levels of the income distribution.
 
The Prospering Middle in India
Further inspection of vehicle ownership reveals interesting trends about economic mobility. Over this last decade, car ownership has increased to 2.2-2.8x for the middle classes (3 middle quintiles) but only to 1.5x for the top quintile. During this same period, 2-wheeler ownership has increased over 9x for the bottom quintile, more than doubled for the middle classes and increased to only 1.4x for the top quintile. The conspicuously high difference between income classes indicates a structural transformation. Greater growth in vehicle ownership of middle-classes vis-à-vis the rich implies upward economic mobility – people have been able to meet their aspirations through higher income and employment.
Figure 2: Car and 2-wheeler ownership by income classes
 
                              Source: Data for India
Alternatively, if vehicle ownership is considered as an indicator of being middle-class, then the size of the middle class has grown. In the 2 years after the pandemic, passenger vehicles sales increased by 40 percent while 2-wheeler sales increased by 32 percent. Two forces are at action – the entry into middle class through purchase of 2-wheelers and upward movement within the middle class through purchase of 4-wheelers. Figure 2 shows how growth in two-wheeler ownership has been steeper than that in cars. This indicates that entry into the middle-class is faster than the transition to higher middle-income status – a phenomenon which is also seen across nations, leading to the issue of middle-income traps. The move to higher income levels is further corroborated by the fact that around 24.82 crore Indians escaped multidimensional poverty over the last 9 years.
Even among 4-wheeler purchases, there has been a distinct shift in preferences towards higher quality, more expensive cars. In the last 4 years, the share of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) in the market has doubled, dominating over half the market now. This can be attributed to higher disposable incomes, as well greater access to credit. Scheduled commercial bank credit for vehicle loans has more than doubled since January, 2019. However, the post-pandemic period saw relatively higher interest rates, making financing more costly. Rise in vehicle sales backed by auto loans indicates consumer confidence and increased purchasing power to offset future interest costs. Thus, it can be argued that the Indian middle class is growing, is richer and is confident about their future prospects.
 
Challenges Remain
While India has performed exceptionally in the post-pandemic period, as indicated by the Car Index, it is yet to catch up with developed nations. India has the lowest number of cars per capita among the G20 nations, while it performs much better in terms of two-wheelers. This could be due to two reasons. First, the relative price of cars is higher, suggesting that India is only in the initial stages of structural transformation. Second, besides affordability, consumers choose 2-wheelers for convenience. Traffic congestion and high commute times discourage 4-wheeler usage, as it also raises fuel consumption. These problems require long-term strategies for resolution.
The incentivisation of electric vehicles can assuage the concerns about increasing fuel cost. Greater access to finance in rural India can lower the relative cost of 4-wheelers and encourage new entrants. Maintaining the momentum in development of national roads and highways is imperative to make personal vehicles a viable choice. However, it should be noted that greater vehicle sales is just a metric. To boost that parameter, real, inclusive growth should be the means and the end.

Title: National Herald Case: Many Unanswered Questions Persist
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:07:45 +0000
Content: More than a decade has passed since the investigation into the National Herald case began, focusing primarily on Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. On the surface, the case appears straightforward, but the Congress party’s rhetoric and claims of victimhood, allegedly driven by its leaders, have undermined the principles of equality under Article 14. The political narrative has overshadowed the legal merits, complicating public understanding of the issue.
The National Herald case centres on allegations of financial misconduct by Congress leaders. According to the Enforcement Directorate’s chargesheet, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are among the primary accused.
Initiated in 2012 by Subramanian Swamy, the case alleges that Congress orchestrated a scheme to control valuable real estate owned by Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the publisher of the historic National Herald newspaper.
Congress allegedly loaned AJL Rs. 90.25 crore, which AJL could not repay, leading to the debt’s transfer to Young Indian Private Limited (YIL), a non-profit controlled by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.
YIL acquired 99% of AJL’s shares for Rs. 50 lakh, gaining influence over properties valued at Rs. 2,000–5,000 crore.
In essence, AJL had an outstanding interest-free debt of Rs. 90 crore owed to Congress by the late 2000s. In 2010, YIL was established with over 75% of its stake held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, raising questions about its purpose and shareholding structure.
The debt was then transferred from Congress to YIL, and AJL’s real estate assets, worth Rs. 2,000–5,000 crore, came under YIL’s control through a shareholding structure that appears designed to prioritize real estate over revival. Congress defends this as a legitimate effort to preserve a freedom-struggle legacy, emphasizing YIL’s non-profit status. Yet, more than a decade later, critical questions remain unanswered.
Why did AJL, despite its Rs. 90 crore debt and seven-decade legacy as a newspaper, fail to secure a bailout from any of its stakeholders, over a thousand in number, or attract promoters to sustain operations? Surely, a publication with such historical significance would have had enough well-wishers to step forward. Why did none emerge?
Was Young Indian Private Limited (YIL), established in 2010 during the UPA’s peak with nearly 75% of its stake held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, specifically created to address AJL’s debt owed to Congress, and why was the majority stake concentrated with one family? The shareholding patterns of AJL were opaque, but why did YIL allocate a 76% stake to only two shareholders from one family?
Why was the most obvious solution—liquidating assets—not pursued before converting the debt into equity? During the UPA’s tenure at the Centre and Congress rule in several states, why were some AJL properties not sold to sustain the newspaper, and couldn’t the government have addressed any restrictions on such sales to support its continuation? This could have prolonged the newspaper’s operations, yet it was overlooked. Why?
How did YIL, launched in 2010 with just Rs. 50 lakh in paid-up capital, convert AJL’s Rs. 90 crore debt into 9 crore shares, acquiring 99% of them, and why did this equity-for-debt swap prioritize control over resolving the debt? YIL appears to have focused on securing real estate assets rather than addressing the mounting debt.
Was the transaction involving AJL’s Rs. 90 crore interest-free loan a real estate deal or an insolvency arrangement, and given Congress’s presumed indirect shareholding in AJL with no notional loss except the principal, does this raise questions about the deal’s legitimacy? Many question Congress’s indirect role in AJL, followed by the creation of YIL, suggesting assets were transferred among entities controlled by the same individuals through a complex shareholding structure.
Section 25 indicates that Congress, as a non-profit, did not directly profit from the acquired properties, but with YIL, controlled by the Gandhi family, now directing AJL’s operations, how can one assume YIL could not influence how AJL spends its generated income? Did YIL ever direct AJL to donate to a political party or foundation? The movement of funds remains opaque, fuelling scepticism.
Is the 2010 acquisition of AJL by YIL, primarily tied to real estate and its income, indicative of a potential revival of the National Herald in 2025, and what role has YIL played in advancing the newspaper’s idealistic cause over the past 15 years? In 2025, the National Herald persists with a diminished presence. How should one evaluate YIL’s contributions?
Beyond the legal technicalities, which some experts view as clear-cut, the political rhetoric continues to escalate. While Congress maintains that no profits were pocketed, the opaque shareholding pattern—from AJL to Congress to YIL—raises concerns about financial misconduct. Courts have previously dismissed petitions from the Gandhis, and as the ED’s chargesheet provides further details, more clarity is expected.
Rahul Gandhi carries a copy of the Constitution during his political campaigns, emphasizing equality under Article 14. The National Herald case will test his commitment to those principles as the legal process unfolds.

Title: Finland President dials PM Modi, discusses ongoing collaboration in digitalization and mobility
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:46:07 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finland’s President Alexander Stubb reiterated their commitment to further strengthening and deepening the partnership between the two countries, especially in areas such as quantum technologies, 5G/6G, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity during a phone conversation on Wednesday.
“Had a fruitful conversation with President Alexander Stubb. Finland is an important partner country in the EU. We are committed to elevating our ties. Exchanged our perspectives on regional and global issues, including the situation in Ukraine,” PM Modi posted on X after the call.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the two leaders reviewed ongoing collaboration in key sectors including digitalization, sustainability, and mobility. They also exchanged views on various regional and global developments of mutual interest, notably the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
As both leaders agreed to remain in touch, President Stubb expressed Finland’s support for deeper India-EU relations and the early conclusion of a mutually beneficial Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
“Had a good phone conversation today with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi. We discussed, among other things, bilateral relations, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and the geopolitical shifts and their implications for the multilateral system. In these turbulent times, the friendship between Finland and India is more important than ever,” Stubb posted on X.

Title: ‘Not a single tree’: SC extends stay on deforestation near Hyderabad University
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:29:42 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Wednesday extended the stay on tree cutting in 400 acres of land at Kancha Gachibowli in Hyderabad for another month and directed the Wildlife Warden of Telangana to take steps to protect wildlife affected by deforestation in 100 acres.
The bench, consisting of Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih, scheduled the next hearing for May 15, after senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Telangana government, requested four weeks to respond to the report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC).
The CEC had visited the site and submitted its report in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order from April 3.
While granting the state government time to review and respond to the CEC report, the bench ordered that the status quo be maintained and emphasized that no trees should be cut.
The court also directed the Wildlife Warden to examine and implement immediate steps required to protect wildlife impacted by deforestation in the 100 acres.
It further warned that if state government officers attempt to oppose restoration efforts, they would face temporary imprisonment.
The Supreme Court had taken up the matter suo motu on April 3 and stayed further tree cutting.
Protests had erupted from students of Hyderabad Central University (HCU), environmental activists, and opposition parties after authorities began clearing the land near the university for an auction by the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC), intended for the development of IT parks.
The authorities faced criticism from protestors for destroying a crucial green space in the city and disrupting wildlife habitats.
During Wednesday’s hearing, the bench questioned the state government about whether it had obtained permission from the CEC for tree felling.
The bench also inquired about the urgency behind the development activity, which involved the removal of trees from the forest area.
The bench noted their surprise at seeing herbivorous animals in videos running for shelter and being attacked by stray dogs.
Instructing the authorities to present a restoration plan, the bench made it clear that it would go to great lengths to protect the environment.
When senior advocate K. Parameshwar, appearing as amicus curiae, informed the Court about the land being mortgaged to a private party for Rs 10,000 crore, and referenced the CEC report, the bench stated that their primary concern was how so many trees had been felled without permission.
It remarked that it was up to the state whether some of its officers would face temporary imprisonment and urged the state to prioritize the protection of wildlife.

Title: In a first in India, ATM installed onboard train on a trial basis
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:29:36 +0000
Content: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Indian Railways has installed an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) onboard the Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express in Maharashtra, as part of a trial run.
Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared a video of the onboard ATM on X, marking the beginning of the ATM on Wheels initiative. The project aligns with the Railway Board’s directive to explore innovative ways to boost non-fare revenue.
A meeting with potential vendors was held on March 25, during which the idea of installing mobile ATMs on trains was discussed. Following that, the first trial run was conducted on April 10, on the 12110 Manmad-CSMT Panchvati Express. The train’s mini pantry space was converted into a secure ATM installation area by the mechanical team.
“The ATM was properly secured for its maiden journey using rubber pads and bolts to isolate vibrations. Two fire extinguishers have also been provided in the allocated space,” Indian Railways stated.
The initiative is part of Indian Railways’ broader transformation drive under Viksit Bharat 2047, aiming to modernize infrastructure, enhance passenger experience, and increase operational efficiency.
In 2024, Indian Railways achieved the complete renewal of 6,450 km of track, 8,550 turnout renewals, and upgraded train speeds to 130 kmph over 2,000 km. Additionally, 3,210 Route Kilometers (Rkm) were electrified, extending the electrified broad-gauge network to 97%, with renewable energy capacity reaching 2,014 MW.
Under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, 1,337 stations have been identified for redevelopment. The Railways also launched 136 Vande Bharat trains and introduced the first Namo Bharat Rapid Rail. During peak seasons, 21,513 special train trips were operated.
In the area of safety, 10,000 locomotives are being equipped with Kavach technology. So far, 9,000 technicians have been trained, and bids have been invited for 15,000 Rkm under the program.

Content: Indian stock markets continued their upward trend for the third straight session on Wednesday, supported by strong buying in financial stocks, especially private banks, and select oil and gas shares.
The Sensex opened 262 points higher at 76,996 but briefly turned negative due to weak global cues amid rising US-China trade tensions. However, it recovered later in the day, rising 556 points from the day’s low to touch a high of 77,110. The index finally closed at 77,044, up 309 points or 0.4 per cent.
In the last three sessions, the Sensex has gained 3,197 points.
The Nifty followed a similar path. It touched a low of 23,273 and later rose to a high of 23,452. The index ended near its high at 23,433, up 104.60 points or 0.45 per cent. The Nifty has now risen by 1,038 points in three days.
Among the top gainers on the Nifty were IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Trent, ONGC, and Asian Paints. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, and Tata Motors were among the laggards.
Sector-wise, all indices ended in the green except auto. Media, PSU banks, and oil & gas sectors led the rally with gains of 1–2 per cent. The broader market also remained firm, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advancing 0.5 per cent each.
Global markets, however, faced pressure. Asian indices declined as investor sentiment was hit by US President Donald Trump’s warning of tariffs up to 245 per cent on Chinese imports. The Hang Seng and Taiwan indices fell nearly 2 per cent each, while Kospi and Nikkei dropped over 1 per cent.
“On the daily chart, the index has closed above the 100-EMA for the second consecutive session. Support is now placed at 23,300, and the positive momentum is likely to persist as long as it holds above this level,” said Rupak De of LKP Securities.
Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities noted that the rupee appreciated for the third consecutive day, supported by foreign inflows, a weaker US dollar, and encouraging economic data. The near-term trend remains bearish for USD-INR, with support at 85.40 and resistance at 86.05.

Title: Israel will keep Gaza buffer zone, minister says, as ceasefire efforts stall
Publication Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:55:37 +0000
Content: Israeli troops will remain in the buffer zones they have created in Gaza even after any settlement to end the war, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday, as efforts to revive a ceasefire agreement faltered.
Since resuming their operation last month, Israeli forces have carved out a broad “security zone” extending deep into Gaza and squeezing more than 2 million Palestinians into ever smaller areas in the south and along the coastline.
“Unlike in the past, the IDF is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,” Katz said in a statement following a meeting with military commanders, adding that “tens of percent” of Gaza had been added to the zone.
“The IDF will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and the communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza – as in Lebanon and Syria.”
In southern Gaza alone, Israeli forces have seized about 20% of the enclave’s territory, taking control of the border city of Rafah and pushing inland up to the so-called “Morag corridor” that runs from the eastern edge of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea between Rafah and the city of Khan Younis.
It already held a wide corridor across the central Netzarim area and has extended a buffer zone all around the border hundreds of metres inland, including the Shejaia area just to the east of Gaza City in the north.
Israel says its forces have killed hundreds of Hamas fighters, including many senior commanders of the Palestinian militant group, but the operation has alarmed the United Nations and European countries.
More than 400,000 Palestinians have been displaced since hostilities resumed on March 18 after two months of relative calm, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, and Israeli air strikes and bombardments have killed at least 1,630 people.
Medical charity MSF said Gaza had become a “mass grave” with humanitarian groups struggling to provide aid. “We are witnessing in real time the destruction and forced displacement of the entire population in Gaza,” Amande Bazerolle, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Gaza said in a statement.
Katz said Israel, which has blocked the delivery of aid supplies into the territory, was creating infrastructure to allow distribution through civilian companies at a later date. But he said the blockade on aid would remain in place.
He said Israel would push forward with a plan to allow Gazans who wished to leave the enclave to do so, although it remains unclear which countries would be willing to accept large numbers of Palestinians.
RED LINES
The comments from Katz, repeating Israel’s demand on Hamas to disarm, underscore how far away the two sides remain from any ceasefire agreement, despite efforts by Egyptian mediators to revive efforts to reach a deal.
Hamas has repeatedly described calls to disarm as a red line it will not cross and has said Israeli troops must withdraw from Gaza under any permanent ceasefire.
“Any truce lacking real guarantees for halting the war, achieving full withdrawal, lifting the blockade, and beginning reconstruction will be a political trap,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.
Two Israeli officials said this week that there had been no progress in the talks despite media reports of a possible truce to allow the exchange of some of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners.
Israeli officials have said the increased military pressure will force Hamas to release the hostages but the government has faced large demonstrations by Israeli protesters demanding a deal to stop the fighting and get them back.
Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the October 2023 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
The offensive has killed at least 51,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and devastated the coastal enclave, forcing most of the population to move multiple times and reducing broad areas to rubble.
On Wednesday, Palestinian medical authorities said an airstrike killed 10 people, including Fatema Hassouna, a well-known writer and photographer who had documented the war. A strike on another house further north killed three, they said.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israel’s suspension of the entry of fuel, medical, and food supplies since early March had begun to obstruct the work of the few remaining working hospitals, with medical supplies drying up.
“Hundreds of patients and wounded individuals are deprived of essential medications, and their suffering is worsening due to the closure of border crossings,” the ministry said.

Title: Indian electric cab service BluSmart suspends operations after co-founder probed
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 07:28:42 +0000
Content: Indian electric cab service BluSmart, seen as a rival to Uber, suspended services on Thursday, days after a market regulator’s investigation found a co-founder misused funds at an affiliate company and bought a luxury apartment with money allocated for electric vehicles.
BluSmart rode India’s clean energy boom but its sudden suspension puts the livelihood of thousands of drivers at risk. With more than 8,000 taxis, it set up charging hubs in cities like New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru to take on Uber and Ola, both ride-hailing services that largely use gasoline-powered fleets.
In an e-mail to customers on Thursday, BluSmart said: “We’ve decided to temporarily close bookings on the BluSmart app”, without giving any reasons.
Amid concerns expressed on social media about customer funds blocked in BluSmart wallets, the email said the company will only “initiate a refund within the next 90 days if services do not resume before then.”
India’s market regulator this week barred brothers Anmol and Puneet Jaggi from the stock market and ordered a forensic investigation of their listed solar energy company in Mumbai, Gensol, which used to procure electric vehicles and then lease them for the ride-hailing service.
Anmol Jaggi is one of several co-founders of BluSmart, and the managing director of Gensol.
There is “a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol … the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party,” the market regulator said in its order this week.
“Funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF,” it added, referring to one of India’s most expensive luxury apartment complexes.

Title: Delhi govt cracks down on dummy schooling; 10 schools served notice, de-recognition process begins
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:47:50 +0000
Content: The Delhi government has launched a crackdown on schools allegedly enrolling students without requiring regular attendance — a practice commonly referred to as ‘dummy schooling.’
Officials said that over 20 schools across the national capital are suspected of facilitating such irregular admissions. So far, notices have been issued to 10 schools, and the process of de-recognizing them is underway.
According to authorities, the crackdown follows growing concerns that such institutions are neglecting students from the Economically Weaker Section (EWS).
The move comes shortly after Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta ordered strict action against private schools accused of arbitrarily hiking fees.
“It is completely unacceptable for any school to mentally harass parents or students, threaten them with expulsion, or increase fees without following due process,” Gupta said during a Jan Samvaad held at her residence, where several parents raised complaints.
“There are rules and laws in place, which must be followed. If any school is found violating them, it will face consequences. We have issued notices to all schools against which we received complaints,” she added.

Title: Arsenal cruise past lacklustre Real Madrid to reach semis
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:31:38 +0000
Content: Arsenal snuffed out any chance of a famous Real Madrid comeback to reach the Champions League semi-finals after a 2-1 victory in the Bernabeu Stadium completed a 5-1 aggregate win on Wednesday.
Holders and 15-times winners Real never looked like clawing back a 3-0 deficit from last week’s quarter-final first leg and when Bukayo Saka scored for the visitors in the 65th minute their fate was effectively sealed.
Vinicius Junior seized on a rare defensive slip a couple of minutes later to rouse the home crowd, but it proved too little too late as Carlo Ancelotti’s side exited in feeble fashion.
Arsenal’s superiority over the two legs was underlined in stoppage time as Gabriel Martinelli burst through to score.
They will face Paris St Germain in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009.
“I think it’s such a special night for this club, it’s a historic night for this club,” said Arsenal’s Declan Rice, whose two sublime free kicks last week put his side in control.
“There was a lot of talk coming in about them coming back from the dead, they’ve done it so many times before. But we had so much belief and confidence from that first leg that we had enough to come here and win the game.”
A cacophony of noise greeted kickoff with the home fans fuelled by the hope of witnessing what would have been one of the greatest Champions League comebacks.
But Real’s knack of extricating themselves from difficult positions in a competition they won six times in the previous 11 seasons deserted them as they were comprehensively outplayed.
“Did we fall short of what we wanted in pure football terms? Perhaps,” Real captain Lucas Vazquez said. “They really are terrifically organised defensively.”
PENALTY MISS
Real needed a storming start and Mbappe had the ball in the Arsenal net in the opening minutes but was clearly offside when chesting in a Vinicius cross.
Arsenal were in no mood to simply sit and protect their lead though and Saka forced a great save from Courtois. They were handed the chance to kill off the tie when Raul Asencio needlessly hauled down Mikel Merino from a corner and referee Francois Letexier eventually awarded a penalty after checking a pitch-side VAR monitor.
Saka opted for a Panenka-style chipped penalty and Courtois clawed away the ball.
It looked like a potentially pivotal moment and when Letexier pointed to the penalty spot at the other end after Kylian Mbappe tumbled under minimal contact from Rice, Arsenal’s night looked like taking a turn for the worse.
After five painstaking minutes, however, Letexier was again invited by VAR to view the monitor and to a chorus of whistles from the home fans, overturned his original decision.
That scare aside, Arsenal coped easily with Real Madrid’s famed frontline who were given little to work with.
Arsenal keeper David Raya was not required to make a save before halftime as Real’s predilection for hopeful crosses into the area proved easy pickings for the visiting defence.
Real’s Mbappe barely had a sniff of a chance as Arsenal showed great control and Saka made up for his first-half miss with a clinical finish after being sent clear by Merino.
William Saliba gifted Real a lifeline when he was caught in possession on the edge of his area, allowing Vinicius to score, but there was never any sense of panic in the visiting ranks.
Martinelli put the icing on the cake in added time, again from a Merino assist, to send Arsenal’s fans into raptures.

Title: “A leader who put nation first”: PM Modi pays tribute to Chandrashekhar on his birth anniversary
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:14:24 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar on his birth anniversary, remembering him as a statesman who prioritized the national interest over politics. 
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “Humble tribute to former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar Ji on his birth anniversary. He always placed the nation’s interest above all in his political journey. His efforts toward social harmony and nation-building will always be remembered.” 
Born on July 1, 1927, in Ibrahimpatti village in Uttar Pradesh’s Ballia district, Chandrashekhar was drawn to politics from an early age. Known for his fiery speeches and revolutionary zeal, he rose to prominence as a dynamic leader of his time. 
He began his parliamentary career in 1962, elected from Uttar Pradesh on a Praja Socialist Party (PSP) ticket. After joining the Indian National Congress in 1964, he broke ranks during the Emergency in 1975, when he was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act. During his imprisonment, he penned his notable Jail Diary. 
Chandrashekhar was honoured with the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award in December 1995. As president of the Janata Party, he led a landmark padayatra from Kanyakumari to Rajghat between January and June 1983, advocating for social justice, equality, and the upliftment of the underprivileged. 
He was sworn in as Prime Minister on November 10, 1990, following the resignation of Vishwanath Pratap Singh, with outside support from the Congress. However, his tenure was short-lived, ending in March 1991 after Congress withdrew its support. 
Chandrashekhar passed away in New Delhi on July 8, 2007, at the age of 80.

Title: BCCI cracks whip: Abhishek Nayar and fielding coach T Dilip sacked after disappointing Australia tour
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 05:53:27 +0000
Content: Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to part ways with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar and fielding coach T Dilip after India’s lackluster performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 against Australia.
As per BCCI sources cited by ANI, assistant batting coach Abhishek Nayar, fielding coach T Dilip, and strength and conditioning coach Soham Desai have been dismissed following India’s poor performance in the BGT series and alleged dressing room leaks.
India suffered a disappointing 3-1 defeat to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25, which also cost them the chance to qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final at Lord’s.
Skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli were criticized for their underwhelming performances in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the overall disappointing 2024/25 Test cricket season.
Sharma scored only 31 runs in three matches and five innings, at an average of 6.20, while Kohli managed just 190 runs in five matches and nine innings, at an average of 23.75, despite a century. Kohli particularly struggled with the outside-off-stump trap, being dismissed four times by pacer Scott Boland during the series.
India began the series with a historic win in Perth but failed to maintain their momentum, ultimately losing the series 3-1.
Abhishek Nayar’s role came under scrutiny, as the Board expressed dissatisfaction with what was perceived as a ‘Kolkata Knight Riders’ influence within the team management. Former Indian all-rounder Nayar and former Netherlands star Ryan Ten Doeschate had joined Team India’s support staff as assistant coaches during the white-ball tour of Sri Lanka. Nayar and Doeschate were also assistant coaches at KKR, where they worked with Gautam Gambhir.
In January, the BCCI had issued strict guidelines for the Senior Men’s Cricket Team to improve discipline, streamline logistics, and foster team unity during both domestic and international tours.
The new guidelines covered aspects such as travel, baggage limits, family visits, and team dynamics. Players are now required to travel with the team for all matches and practice sessions. Separate travel arrangements for players and their families are discouraged, aiming to maintain discipline and team cohesion. Any exceptions to this policy must be pre-approved by the head coach and the chairman of the selection committee.

Title: Type 5 Diabetes Officially Recognized: A type impacting the malnourished
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 05:34:55 +0000
Content: Last Week, at the 75th Diabetes World Congress in Bangkok, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) officially classified Type 5 diabetes as a distinct form of the disease affecting lean, undernourished young adults in low- and middle-income countries. “The recognition of type 5 diabetes marks a historic shift in how we approach diabetes globally. For too long, this condition has gone unrecognized, affecting millions of people and depriving them of access to adapted care,” said IDF President Peter Schwarz, while announcing the new classification. This landmark decision brings attention to a condition impacting an estimated 25 million people globally. The long misdiagnosed or overlooked, Type 5 diabetes now stands as a critical public health priority, offering hope for better diagnosis and treatment. Here is everything you need to know about it:
A Decade-Long Struggle for the recognition and final-definition
The roots of Type 5 diabetes trace back to 1955, when it was first identified in Jamaica as “J-type diabetes.” In 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) termed it “malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus,” but the label was dropped in 1999 due to insufficient evidence. Cases persisted in countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, where malnutrition is widespread. A 2023 meta-analysis in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology solidified the link between malnutrition and impaired pancreatic function, prompting the IDF to reclassify the condition as Type 5 diabetes in January 2025, with formal endorsement in April. This recognition marks a pivotal step toward addressing a long-neglected health crisis.
Type 5 diabetes primarily affects lean teenagers and young adults with a body-mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m². Unlike Type 1 diabetes, driven by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, or Type 2, characterized by insulin resistance, Type 5 stems from malnutrition-induced damage to pancreatic beta cells. This leads to insulin secretion levels up to 70% lower than in healthy individuals. It is important to understand that what sets type 5 diabetes apart is that people with type 5 diabetes are insulin “deficient”, but not insulin “resistant”.
Key indicators include extreme fatigue, weight loss, and frequent infections, often mistaken for other diabetes types. Body scans show fat percentages as low as 10-12%, compared to 20-25% in healthy adults. Dietary assessments reveal deficiencies in proteins, zinc, and vitamin A, nutrients essential for pancreatic health. Unlike other diabetes forms, Type 5 lacks autoimmune or genetic triggers, making it a unique challenge.
Malnutrition’s lasting Impact
The concept of type 5 diabetes refers to severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), characterized by elevated levels of insulin deficiency and poor metabolic control. Type 5 diabetes often originates in the womb, where maternal malnutrition impairs fetal pancreatic development. A 2022 WHO report notes that 200 million children under five in low-income countries suffer from stunting due to chronic malnutrition, a major risk factor. Historical famines in regions like South Asia and ongoing food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa amplify this issue. While urbanization has driven Type 2 diabetes through overeating, persistent undernourishment, both before and after birth fuels Type 5, highlighting the dual burden of malnutrition in low-resource settings.
Managing Type 5 diabetes centers on reversing malnutrition. High-protein diets, including affordable sources like legumes or fish, are critical for weight gain and blood sugar control. Carbohydrates and healthy fats are adjusted based on BMI and activity levels. Medications like metformin or low-dose insulin are prescribed depending on blood glucose levels, but nutrition remains the cornerstone. Previously, misdiagnosis led to ineffective treatments, such as high-dose insulin causing dangerous hypoglycemia. With Type 5’s recognition, the IDF is developing standardized protocols to improve outcomes.

Implications and the way forward
The official recognition of Type 5 diabetes by the International Diabetes Federation at the 75th Diabetes World Congress in Bangkok marks a turning point in global health. This distinct form of diabetes, affecting an estimated 25 million lean, undernourished young adults in low- and middle-income countries, has long been misdiagnosed or ignored. Rooted in malnutrition-induced pancreatic damage, Type 5 diabetes highlights the enduring impact of food insecurity, from maternal malnutrition to chronic undernourishment. Its classification as severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) paves the way for tailored treatments, emphasizing high-protein diets and precise medication protocols over ineffective high-dose insulin. This milestone offers hope to millions in regions like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where malnutrition remains rampant. By prioritizing accurate diagnosis and accessible care, the IDF’s decision transforms Type 5 diabetes from a neglected crisis into a public health priority. As standardized protocols emerge, the global health community is poised to address this unique challenge, ensuring better outcomes for vulnerable populations and reinforcing the fight against the dual burdens of malnutrition and diabetes in resource-constrained settings.

Title: The Domino Effect of U.S. Tariffs: Why the World Can’t Ignore Trump’s Tariff War
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:53:09 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump’s latest tariff salvo has ignited a fierce global trade war, slapping a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports, with steeper “reciprocal” duties of 104% on China, 49% on Cambodia, 46% on Vietnam, and 20% on the EU, targeting trade surpluses and alleged unfair practices. Once considered allies, countries like Canada face 25% tariffs, prompting swift retaliation and fears of economic fallout. Trump defends the moves as vital for national security and American jobs where tariffs are a tool for correcting trade imbalances. Hence, it becomes imperative to understand why these tariffs matter so much for the world and how past tariffs imposed by the U.S. have fared.
Why Do the Tariffs Imposed by the U.S. Impact the World So Much?
Tariffs imposed by the U.S. have a significant global impact because of the country’s massive economic influence. The U.S. is the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP, accounting for roughly 20-25% of global output. As a linchpin in the global economic market, when the U.S. imposes tariffs on goods, it ripples through supply chains, markets, and economies worldwide. The U.S. is a huge consumer market. It imports over $3 trillion worth of goods annually, including electronics from China, cars from Japan, and oil from Canada. Tariffs hike the cost of those imports, which can reduce demand for foreign goods. Countries that rely on exporting to the U.S. are significantly impacted as their sales drop, which can slow their economies. The impact of U.S. tariffs is worsened by the fact that global supply chains are deeply intertwined. For example, in the case of a tariff on steel, U.S. manufacturers might face a higher cost, which then increases prices for everything from cars to construction worldwide. Foreign companies that depend on U.S. markets are impacted in a domino effect. Evidently, in the past, when Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, it didn’t just hurt China; it disrupted Europe, Japan, and others tied into the same production networks.
Indirect Effects and Historical Context
The impact of the tariff wars is not just direct, but also has several indirect effects. The U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency amplifies the impact. Tariffs can shift trade balances, strengthen the dollar, and make it pricier for other countries to pay debts or buy essentials like oil (priced in dollars). Emerging markets, especially, can get hammered if investors pull back from riskier regions amid trade tensions. There’s also a psychological and political angle. U.S. tariffs signal protectionism, spooking markets and prompting retaliation. The history of tariffs imposed by the United States reveals a saga of economic protectionism, global retaliation, and evolving trade relationships.
The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Debacle: In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, the Great Depression gripped the world. In June 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Act, initially aimed at protecting U.S. farmers but expanded to impose a 20% tariff on agricultural and industrial goods. Named for Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Hawley, the act triggered swift trade wars. Canada, France, and Spain retaliated, with Canada targeting 16 U.S. products, cutting a third of U.S. exports, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. By 1933, U.S. exports had crashed 61%, deepening the economic crisis. Hoover lost the 1932 election to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, in 1934, signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, securing deals with 19 countries by 1939 to reverse the damage.
The Transatlantic Chicken War: The 1960s saw the U.S. and Europe clash in the “Chicken War.” Post-World War II, America’s poultry boom, spurred by wartime rationing, flooded Europe with cheap chicken, alarming local farmers. In 1962, the European Economic Community (EEC) imposed a 13.43-cent-per-pound tariff (about $1.40 today) on U.S. poultry, slashing U.S. global exports by 30% between 1962 and 1963, per the USDA. President Lyndon B. Johnson retaliated in 1963 with tariffs on European goods, including brandy at $5 per gallon ($51.30 now) and a 25% levy on trucks over $1,000 ($10,267 today). The “chicken tax” on light trucks endures, influencing foreign automakers, especially Japanese, to build U.S. factories.
Reagan’s Japanese Auto Tariffs: In 1987, President Ronald Reagan levied 100% tariffs on $300 million in Japanese imports, notably automobiles, after Japan breached a 1986 semiconductor deal. Japan opted against retaliation, but its economy faltered, a stronger yen and a 1990s recession followed. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan dipped from $55 billion in 1986 to $43 billion by 1991, though it later rose to $72 billion in 2023.
The Banana Split with Europe: The 1993 “Banana Split” arose when the EU favored its ex-colonies with tariffs on Latin American bananas, many grown by U.S. firms. After multiple WTO rulings favored the U.S., retaliatory tariffs hit European goods like French cheese. The 2009 Geneva Banana Agreement and a 2012 deal phased out the dispute, cutting tariffs by 2017.
Bush’s Steel Tariff Gambit: In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed 8-30% tariffs on foreign steel (exempting Mexico and Canada) to aid U.S. producers. Imports from targeted nations fell 28% in 2002 and 37% in 2003, per CEPII, but shifted to exempt countries. Europe threatened $2.2 billion in counter-tariffs, prompting Bush to lift the tariffs in 2003.
Trump’s Tariff Offensive in His First Term: In 2018, President Donald Trump launched tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, and 25% duties on over 800 Chinese products, plus steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico, and the EU. Retaliation followed as China hit U.S. soybeans and planes, before a 2020 truce. Biden extended some tariffs into 2023, underscoring their lasting impact.
Hence, as Trump’s tariffs reshape global trade, the USA’s echoing history of retaliation and economic disruption throws light on the interconnections between the economic landscape and the delicate balance of power.

Title: World Bank’s Banga urges developing nations to lower tariffs, focus on regional trade
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:45:05 +0000
Content: World Bank President Ajay Banga urged developing countries on Wednesday to liberalize trade, saying many maintained higher tariffs than advanced economies and lowering them could offset the risk of reciprocal import taxes.
Banga told reporters that global uncertainty – triggered in recent months by U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures announced by China and other countries – was contributing to a more cautious business and economic environment.
He said the impact would vary country by country, but that global growth is expected to slow from the level forecast several months ago. Banga gave no specific forecast.
In January, the global development bank forecast flat global economic growth of 2.7% in 2025 and 2026, the same as in 2024, and warned that developing economies now faced their weakest long-term growth outlook in 25 years.
At the time, it warned that U.S. across-the-board tariffs of 10% could reduce already lackluster global growth in 2025 by 0.3 percentage points if America’s trading partners retaliated with tariffs of their own.
U.S. President Donald Trump has upended the global trading system by imposing a new baseline 10% U.S. tariff on goods from all economies, and higher rates for some countries, although those have been paused for 90 days to allow negotiations.
Banga said countries should negotiate and engage in dialogue on trade issues, noting there was also untapped potential in deeper regional integration for developing countries.
“Countries need to care about negotiating and dialogue. It’s going to be really important in this phase, and the quicker we do it, the better that will be,” he said.
Countries should also work with willing partners to keep regional and bilateral trade flowing, Banga said, noting that global trade had nearly quadrupled over the past two decades, with developing countries nearly doubling their share of that trade to two-fifths.
“Many developing economies still maintain higher tariffs than advanced economies, on the average, several percentage points higher on key imports,” Banga said. “I think that creates a real risk of reciprocal tariffs and, most importantly, lost competitiveness.”
Broad-based liberalization, along with more efficient border processes, clear rules of origin, and less friction, could help offset these risks and actually expand market access, he said. “History shows that more open economies tend to grow faster and they withstand stocks and shocks more effectively.”
Banga acknowledged that trade tensions were dampening businesses’ appetite for investment, but it was unclear how long the current paralysis would endure.
“If you get to good resolutions through that negotiation that I’m encouraging … then I think you could get through this relatively quickly,” he said.
Asked about huge cuts to foreign development aid by the Trump administration and some European countries, Banga said it was critical to note that foreign aid was intended as temporary help, not a long-term strategy. Developing countries needed to create the right regulatory framework to encourage private sector investments that could boost job creation.
Banga said the World Bank was continuing its reforms to focus on job creation, noting that some 1.2 billion young people were expected to enter the workforce in developing nations over the next decade, but only 420 million jobs were on the horizon.
“That gap is not just an economic issue. I think it’s a global risk, because without opportunity, the forces of fragility, of illegal migration, of instability, these forces grow stronger,” he said.

Title: Trump officials could face criminal contempt over deportations, judge says
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:44:08 +0000
Content: Trump administration officials could face criminal contempt charges for violating a U.S. federal judge’s order halting deportations of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang who had no chance to challenge their removals, the judge said on Wednesday.
In a written ruling, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington found “probable cause” to hold officials in criminal contempt of court, saying the administration demonstrated “willful disregard” for his March 15 order barring the deportations to El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.
Many of the migrants’ lawyers and family members say those deported are not gang members and were never given a chance to contest the U.S. government’s assertion that they were.
Wednesday’s ruling is the closest any court has come to suggesting punishing the administration since President Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, and escalates the confrontation between the judicial and executive branches.
The U.S. Justice Department appealed the ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Boasberg said the administration could still avoid being held in contempt by taking steps to comply with his order – namely, by allowing the migrants to challenge their removals in court. He gave the administration until April 23 to outline what steps it would take, or to identify the officials who decided to disregard his order so they could potentially be prosecuted.
The judge noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had retweeted an X post in which El Salvador President Nayib Bukele shared a link to a news story about Boasberg’s order blocking deportations and said, “Oopsie…Too late.”
“Boasts by Defendants intimated that they had defied the Court’s Order deliberately and gleefully,” the judge wrote.
White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said on X the administration would seek immediate appellate relief.
A Justice Department spokesperson said: “His (Boasberg’s) underhanded attempt to maintain power over this case is a judicial power grab that the Department of Justice will fight by all means necessary.”
‘STRONG REBUKE’
The Trump administration faces more than 150 legal challenges to its policies. Democrats and some legal analysts say officials in some cases are dragging their feet in complying with unfavorable court orders, signaling a potential willingness to disobey an independent, coequal branch of government.
On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland said she would ramp up an inquiry into whether the administration violated an order that it secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man the administration has acknowledged was wrongly deported to El Salvador, but said she would not hold the administration in contempt just yet.
On Wednesday, the Justice Department appealed Xinis’ order, which would require officials to face questioning on the steps they had taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.
Boasberg’s order goes further. He wrote that if the administration does not purge its contempt, he could require officials to submit sworn declarations or face questioning under oath. The judge said he could order that a government prosecutor take up the case, or potentially appoint another lawyer to act as a prosecutor if the government refuses.
“It’s a very strong rebuke to the administration,” said Professor Jonathan Hafetz at the Seton Hall University School of Law.
Trump called for Boasberg’s impeachment over his blocking of the deportations. That prompted a rare rebuke from U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who said appeals, not impeachments, were the proper response to disagreements with court orders.
The judiciary is not the only U.S. institution to come under pressure. The Trump administration has targeted others that have long cherished their independence from partisan politics, such as universities and law firms.
‘OOPSIE’
The case stems from Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. It is best known for its use to intern and deport people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two. Some were U.S. citizens.
Lawyers for the migrants in El Salvador have told Reuters they have not been able to visit, speak to or learn about the whereabouts and conditions of their clients.
“Today’s decision affirms what we have long known: the government’s conduct in this case is unlawful and a threat to people and our Constitution,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, an advocacy group for migrants in the case.
It was unclear whether the threat of contempt would compel the administration to comply with Boasberg’s order. In general, the threat has been enough to get government officials to comply. Government officials are rarely found in contempt and threatened with jail time.
The president may pardon people convicted of criminal contempt, says the U.S. Congressional Research Service, an independent entity that provides policy analysis to lawmakers.
In 2017, during his first term in office, Trump pardoned former Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio less than a month after he was convicted of criminal contempt in a case involving racial profiling.

Title: Trump administration says Harvard may lose ability to enroll foreign students
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:37:29 +0000
Content: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Harvard University will lose its ability to enroll foreign students if it does not meet demands from the Trump administration to share information on some visa holders, marking the government’s latest escalation against the educational institution.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also announced on Wednesday the termination of two DHS grants totaling more than $2.7 million to Harvard.
Noem said she wrote a letter to Harvard demanding records on what she called the “illegal and violent activities” of Harvard’s foreign student visa holders by April 30.
“And if Harvard cannot verify it is in full compliance with its reporting requirements, the university will lose the privilege of enrolling foreign students,” Noem said in a statement.
A Harvard spokesperson said the university was aware of Noem’s letter “regarding grant cancellations and scrutiny of foreign student visas.”
The spokesperson said the university stood by its statement earlier in the week to “not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights” while saying it will comply with the law.
President Donald Trump’s administration has threatened universities with federal funding cuts over pro-Palestinian campus protests against U.S. ally Israel’s devastating military assault on Gaza after a deadly October 2023 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants.
Trump casts the protesters as foreign policy threats who are antisemitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the Trump administration wrongly conflates their advocacy for Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza with support for extremism and antisemitism.
The Trump administration is also attempting to deport some foreign protesters and has revoked hundreds of visas across the country.
“With a $53.2 billion endowment, Harvard can fund its own chaos – DHS won’t,” Noem said, adding an “anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology” existed at Harvard.
Harvard has previously said it worked to fight antisemitism and other prejudice on its campus while preserving academic freedoms and the right to protest.
TRUMP’S CRACKDOWN
The Trump administration said late last month it was reviewing $9 billion in federal contracts and grants to Harvard and later called for restrictions – including a mask ban and removal of diversity, equity and inclusion programs – to be put in place for the university to continue receiving federal money.
Harvard on Monday rejected numerous demands that it said would cede control to the government. The Trump administration subsequently said it was freezing $2.3 billion in funding.
Trump also threatened on Tuesday to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status. CNN reported on Wednesday the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status of Harvard and that a final decision was expected soon.
Harvard said there was no legal basis to rescind its tax-exempt status, saying such an action will be unprecedented, will diminish its financial aid for students and will lead to abandonment of some critical medical research programs.
Human rights advocates have raised free speech and academic freedom concerns over the crackdown by the government.
The Trump administration has frozen or canceled some funding for universities like Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Cornell and Northwestern as well.
It has also threatened to withhold funding over culture war issues such as DEI programs and transgender policies.
Rights advocates have also raised concerns about Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias during the Israel-Gaza war. The Trump administration has not announced steps in response.

Title: Indian telescope uncovers elusive intermediate-mass black hole
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:37:12 +0000
Content: Indian astronomers have detected and measured the properties of an elusive intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) located in a faint galaxy about 4.3 million light-years away, offering new insights into the mysterious “middleweight” class of black holes.
The discovery was made using India’s largest optical telescope, the 3.6-metre Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), operated by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology (DST). The telescope enabled researchers to trace gas clouds orbiting the black hole at a distance of 125 light-minutes—roughly 2.25 billion kilometres—with a velocity dispersion of 545 kilometres per second.
The black hole, situated in the galaxy NGC 4395, has been found to weigh about 22,000 times the mass of the Sun. This precise measurement makes it one of the best-studied intermediate-mass black holes to date. These IMBHs, with masses between 100 and 100,000 times that of the Sun, are considered vital to understanding how black holes grow and evolve. However, due to their faint emissions and residence in relatively dim galaxies, they have remained difficult to detect.
NGC 4395 hosts one of the faintest actively feeding black holes ever observed. To study it, the research team, led by Shivangi Pandey, used not only the 3.6-metre DOT and its indigenously developed spectrograph and camera ADFOSC but also the smaller 1.3-metre Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT), also located at ARIES’s Devasthal Observatory.
Because the region surrounding a black hole is too small to be directly resolved by most telescopes, the team used a technique known as spectrophotometric reverberation mapping. This method measures the time lag between light emitted from the black hole’s accretion disk and the light echoed by surrounding gas clouds, allowing astronomers to estimate the region’s size and the black hole’s mass.
The study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, also confirms the size-luminosity relationship for black holes in low-luminosity active galaxies and offers a more accurate mass estimate than previous studies. The findings contribute a critical benchmark for future research on black hole growth and evolution.
Dr Suvendu Rakshit, a scientist at ARIES and co-author of the study, said that the search for intermediate-mass black holes is still ongoing. He said that upcoming observations using larger telescopes and more advanced instruments will be essential in identifying and understanding these cosmic objects.

Title: Fitch projects India’s GDP growth at 6.4% for FY26, retains 6.3% for FY27
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:16:55 +0000
Content: Fitch Ratings on Thursday revised India’s GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.4%, citing global economic uncertainties, while maintaining its projection of 6.3% for FY27.
The global ratings agency also lowered its estimates for FY25 and FY26 by 10 basis points to 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, attributing the downgrade to rising concerns over a potential global trade war.
Fitch retained its outlook for FY27 at 6.3%, reflecting expectations of relative stability in India’s economic performance over the medium term.
The agency also downgraded global growth projections for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points, while reducing forecasts for the US and China by 0.5 percentage points from its March outlook.
“It is difficult to predict US trade policy with any confidence. Massive policy uncertainty is hurting business investment prospects, equity price declines are reducing household wealth, and US exporters will be hit by retaliation,” Fitch noted in a special update to its quarterly Global Economic Outlook.
For 2025, US GDP growth is expected to remain positive at 1.2%, while China’s growth is projected to fall below 4% in both 2025 and 2026. The eurozone’s growth is forecast to stay well below 1% during the same period.
Despite global headwinds, Fitch believes that India’s large domestic market will shield it from the brunt of global trade disruptions, including the impact of US tariff hikes.
A recent report by Morgan Stanley echoed this sentiment, identifying India as the “best-placed country in Asia” amid global uncertainties triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. The report cited India’s low goods exports-to-GDP ratio and strong economic fundamentals as key insulating factors.
“While India is exposed to direct tariff risks, we believe it is less vulnerable to a global goods trade slowdown, considering it has the lowest goods exports-to-GDP ratio in the region,” the report stated.
India’s economy regained momentum in Q3 of FY25, expanding by 6.2%, after dipping to a near two-year low of 5.6% in the July-September quarter.

Title: Sensex jumps over 1,500 points, Bank Nifty near record high
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:05:59 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed sharply higher on Thursday, marking the fourth consecutive session of gains, driven by strong buying in banking stocks.
The Sensex, which marked its 150th anniversary on April 17, opened slightly lower at 76,968 and dipped to an early low of 76,666. However, it quickly rebounded and surged to an intra-day high of 78,617 — a remarkable recovery of 1,951 points. By the end of the trading session, the Sensex had gained 1,509 points, or 1.96%, to settle at 78,553.
The Nifty 50 index mirrored this strong performance. After hitting a low of 23,299 in early trade, it climbed to a high of 23,872 before closing at 23,852 — up 414 points or 1.8%.
Top gainers on the Nifty included Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, Sun Pharma, and Eternal. Meanwhile, stocks such as Wipro, Hero MotoCorp, Tech Mahindra, and JSW Steel faced profit booking and ended in the red.
All major sectors witnessed buying interest. Notably, telecom, PSU banks, oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, auto, energy, and private banks posted gains ranging between 1% and 2%.
The broader markets also remained positive, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rising by around 0.5% each.
Ruchit Jain, Vice President of Technical Research at Motilal Oswal, said the rally appears to be more than just a short-term bounce, as it is supported by broad-based participation across sectors, especially from large-cap and financial stocks.
“The Bank Nifty index is now trading close to its all-time high, reflecting strong sectoral support,” Jain added.
The Indian rupee also strengthened, closing 31 paise higher at 85.37 against the US dollar, compared to Wednesday’s close of 85.68.
Despite global concerns, market experts noted that domestic sentiment remained optimistic, bolstered by heavy buying in blue-chip stocks and expectations of economic stability.

Title: ISSF World Cup: Suruchi and Saurabh Chaudhary clinch gold
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:59:51 +0000
Content: India’s Suruchi and Saurabh Chaudhary struck gold in style at the ISSF World Cup Rifle/Pistol/Shotgun in Lima, Peru, winning the 10m Air Pistol Mixed Team title with a commanding 17-9 victory over China’s Yao Qianxun and Hu Kai.
This marks Suruchi’s third ISSF World Cup gold and Saurabh’s ninth, including his fifth gold in the mixed team event, adding to a previous silver in the same category.
The Indian duo entered the gold medal match with a combined qualification score of 580, with the teenage Suruchi outshooting her experienced partner by a couple of points. The Chinese team had topped the qualification charts with 585.
In the final at the Las Palmas Shooting Range, the Chinese started strong, taking early leads of 6-2 and 8-4. However, a timely timeout by coach Samaresh Jung turned the tide in India’s favour. Suruchi remained consistent throughout, and whenever she missed the 10-ring, Tokyo Olympian Saurabh responded with precision, including a spectacular 10.9 on his first hit.
After tying the scores at 9-9 in the eighth series, the Indians surged ahead in the 10th, taking an 11-9 lead and never looked back. They sealed the win in the next three series, capitalising on errors by the Chinese under pressure. Fittingly, they closed the match with high scores of 10.6 (Suruchi) and 10.5 (Saurabh), while both Chinese shooters faltered outside the 10-ring.
Meanwhile, the second Indian pair, Manu Bhaker and Ravinder Singh, finished fourth, losing 6-16 to the second Chinese duo Zhang Yifan and Ma Qianke in the bronze medal match. They had also placed fourth in qualification with a combined total of 579.

Title: The Urban Naxals: Understanding their Strategies and Tactics
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:54:55 +0000
Content: PM Modi during his speech at Kevadia on  October 30, 2024, while celebrating Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary celebrations has remarked that, “As naxalism in ending in jungles, a new model of urban Naxals is raising its head. Today, urban Naxals target even those who say that you will remain safe if you remain united. We have to identify urban Naxals and unmask them .”
 
The statement by PM Modi clearly underscores the fact that he has understood the evolved feature of Naxalism in the light of changing landscape of warfare methods . 
 
With the emergence of Fifth Generation Warfare (5GW) the Naxals have also adopted strategical changes to destabilise the Bhartiya Society by creating making conditions suitable to carry out anarchic violence in the name of revolution and finish off the credibility of the Bhartiya State. 
 
The naxals in their fight against Bharat’s society have started to target our urban spaces. Naxals, through, propaganda and tactical alliances with the other elements of ‘bleed India Brigade’ are preparing to wage a war against the Bhartiya State . 
 
Recently, PM Modi has critically questioned the ideological status of country’s grand old party by stating that Naxal Elements have entered in to their system . Recently, a controversy has been fuelled by the statement of our Leader of Opposition’s (Lok Sabha) statement where he stated that they are fighting against the “Indian State”.
 
However, in order to understand the evolved tactics of this naxal strategy there is a need to critically analyse the naxal documents and compare them with the recent years events aimed to destabilise the country, so that we could get a glimpse of their new ways of working and understanding of the country’s state apparatus. 
 
Strategies and Tactics of Indian Revolution (STIR) :
 
In 2004, with the merger of Peoples’ War Group (PWG) and Maoist Communist Centre (MCCI), the Communist Party of India (Maoist) came into existence. After extensive discussions, a document titled Strategies and Tactics of Indian Revolution (STIR) came into existence.
 
The STIR is a guiding document needed to be implemented for achieving the goals of Maoist activities aimed to disturb the Bharat’s social fabric. The document underlines the need for Maoists to operate in a secret manner, increase the work in urban spaces by targeting groups like youths, students, women, religious minorities etc by infusing a sense of ‘victimhood’ in their psyche through propaganda and other means. It also underscores the need to create organisations which should work legally but their actual aim should be to conduct activities which destabilise the Bhartiya Society. 
 
Understanding Strategies and Tactics of Indian Revolution (STIR) : A Critical Evaluation : 
 
There are various points in this document which provides a clear framework for our understanding that what’s going around us in the name of activism and how the urban naxals are converting our urban spaces into a battlefield !
 
In a section titled ‘Class Analysis of Indian State’, the document reads  “From a concrete class analysis of the Indian society and state we find that, under the signboard of the so-called Republic and the Parliamentary democracy, India is nothing but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state under neo-colonial form of indirect rule, exploitation and control.
 
It is the armed forces, judiciary, prisons, bureaucracy, etc. of the state machinery that execute the actual business of the state and the principal organ of this state machinery is its armed forces. The present Indian state machinery is the instrument of class repression, class exploitation and class rule of the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and big landlords who subserve the imperialists.”
 
And now let’s compare the statement made by Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha i.e. they are fighting against the Indian State has made it clear that Maoist logic to create a ecosystem against the Bhartiya State has been already in work. 
 
Later in in order to create strong bases in urban areas the document further states that there is a need to increase the work among the ‘Intellectuals and Students’ and addressing the ‘Professionals’ which includes doctors, professionals etc it states that “These sections of petty bourgeoisie are reliable motive forces in the revolution. Their weakness is that some of them are easily influenced by the bourgeoisie and hence we must carry on revolutionary propaganda and constant organisational work among them.” Thus it guided the cadres to make propaganda a tool to expand their work in the middle of the se working groups.
 
Later on in order to create anarchy in the society the strategy was to intensify the social and cultural faultlines of this country it directed that “We will have to mobilise people into class struggle more skillfully and cautiously based on class line and mass line.” (Page no19).
 
The Maoists need a secured urban fort so that sufficient logistical resources could be provided to them for their notorious aims “The urban movement is one of the main sources, which provides cadres and leadership having various types of capabilities essential for the people’s war and for the establishment of liberated areas. 
 
Moreover, the responsibility for the provision of supplies, technology, expertise, information and other logistical support to the people’s war too, lies on the shoulders of the urban revolutionary movement itself.” (Page no.30)
In 2019, with the passing of Citizenship Ammendment Act in Parliament a propaganda was popularised among the masses of the country that the bill carrying a legislative retrospective power aims to target the Religious minorities of this country, thus the propaganda aimed to intensify the social faultline of religion for the benefit of the motives of this Bleeding India brigade ! And we see that movements like Shaheen Bagh came to our socio-political discourse . Later on, the official investigation revealed the sinister plan of this brigade in these protests i.e. to thwart the internal security of the country . However this is also a plan mentioned in the document “Moreover, we should not belittle the importance of the fact that the urban areas are strong centres of the enemy.
 
 Building up of a strong urban revolutionary movement means that our Party should build a struggle network capable of waging struggle consistently, by sustaining itself until the protracted people’s war reaches the stage of strategic offensive .” (Page no. 30)
 
The document also disclosed that their is a need to align with the other anti-Bharat forces and form should form United fronts . The stress was to make tactical alliances so that they can carry out their mission to destabilise Bharat . The document stressed to form tactical alliances  with other groups on the basis of a common minimum programme “The aim of the united front is to isolate, weaken and destroy the main enemies one by one and win over the maximum possible forces opposed to the main enemies. Hence, the Party has to pay particular attention to build as broad a front as possible by uniting with all those classes, groups, parties, individuals and forces that aspire to achieve the common aim of the United Front, however weak and vacillating the constituents of the United Front may be .” (Page no. 33)
 
On critically examining the Prime Minister’s statement regarding the grand old party that urban naxals have infiltrated in the organisation of the political party , this has been the strategy devised in the document that the ideological cadre of the party must infiltrate in the mass organisations and it devises that “The Party part-timers and whole-timers in the mass organizations, cooperatives, organs of people’s political power and their various wings, people’s militia and the various mass fronts should remain secret, but at the same time, appear as members and leaders of these organizations. The Party members in the mass organizations should maintain the utmost secrecy. The Party members in the working class, youth, women, petty bourgeoisie and other sections in the urban areas should work strictly underground keeping the strategic perspective in mind.” (Page no.37)
 
The document further on in its section titled “Work in Urban Areas” has put forward three basic aims for its cadre in the urban areas :
 
1. Mobilise and Organise the Basic Masses
2. Building the United Front 
3. To send the cadres to rural areas so to carry out armed operations . 
 
And describing the aim of the urban work the document reads “…we should work with the aim of creating an upsurge of people’s movements against the stranglehold of imperialism and the repressive policies of the Indian State. To achieve this, we should concentrate our work mainly on the vast section of the working class and other democratic sections .” (Page no.60)
 
Strategies in Work :
 
It is important to note that the excerpts from the document mentioned above are not mere statements rather the guidelines which are now visible that the are already placed in work . 
 
On June 27,2018 the Ministry of Home Affairs had written a letter to the then DGP of Jharkhand stating that their has been a alignment of the Maoists alongwith Popular Front of India (PFI), banned Islamist radical organisation . The letter states “There is a growing convergence between the Maoist affiliates and the Popular Front of India. 
 
Following ban imposed by the Jharkhand Government of Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti (MSS), a CPI (Maoist) front, and PFI consequently, both sides have echoed each other causes and in the process targeted the ‘Hindutva’ State Government .”
 
Later on the letter further states that “ In the past, convergence between Maoist affiliates and PFI/NCHRO (National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations) was witnessed in Kerala in the aftermath of the killing (24th November, 2016) of to senior Maoist leaders in the district Mallapuram. Anti-Fake Encounter Front and Anti-Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were formed by both sides to progress anti-government propaganda. As part of the if strategy, Maoist affiliates have attempted to form “Tactical United Fronts” with like-minded organisations across different theatres to push the it narrative .” 
 
It’s pertinent to note that it was the same CPI (Maoist) which was among the first ones to issue a statement in favour of Popular Front of India (PFI) when of was banned in 2022. 
 
The CPI (Maoist) signalled their opposition to the Modi government during an Eastern Regional Bureau (ERB) meeting held from December 21-24, 2015, where they passed a resolution against Modi’s leadership.
 
The opening paragraph of this resolution notes that since the loss of the Sonia-Manmohan-led Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI (Maoist) and their allies have faced significant challenges. This isn’t the only document hinting at an alliance between Naxals and the Congress Party.
 
letter dated January 2, 2018, written by Comrade M to Rona Wilson, highlights the relationship. It states: “Senior Comrades from the CPI (Maoist) urban leadership have had prior talks with our friends in Congress, who suggested ramping up Dalit mobilisation efforts. They are ready to provide legal and financial assistance through intermediary (Jignesh). Dalit sentiments are clearly against BJP/RSS, and this should be converted into large-scale mobilisation and unrest.”
 
The letter further mentions, “Congress friends have assured assistance for the release of senior political prisoners, including Com. Kobad and Com. Sai.”
 
Conclusion :
 
The Maoist have changed their strategies in the changing warfare landscape . Now urban naxals are the new form of Maoist movement . Now, Urban Naxals is equal to Naxalism minus AK-47 . The new means of carrying out anti-Bharat agenda is now to create propaganda ecosystem so to distort the Bharat’s rising image . The creation of protests like Shaheen Bagh to interrupt our development agenda has been a clear indication that Naxals have changed their means to achieve their ends  . It’s also alarming that a major political party and that too our grand old party is shaking hands with this Anti-Bharat , Bleeding India Brigade to gain political successes by utilising the faultline a of our society ! It’s up to the people of Bharat to give appropriate reply to this Bleed India Brigade who are making all efforts to hinder our journey of creating a Developed nation by 2047.

Title: Soft Power, Carved in Stone
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:31:03 +0000
Content: This cultural momentum was on vivid display in June 2023, when Prime Minister Modi led a yoga session at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Performing pranayama on the UN lawn alongside diplomats and UN officials, Modi helped set a Guinness World Record with participants from 135 countries doing yoga together. 
 
“Yoga is unifying and truly universal. It is for all ethnicities, faiths and cultures,” Modi told the gathering, emphasizing its role in bridging global divides. The image of India’s leader championing an ancient Indian practice at the world’s preeminent multilateral stage was a powerful symbol of cultural diplomacy coming full circle, heritage as an instrument of international unity.
 
India’s heritage is a living, breathing force sculpted in sandstone, whispered through temple bells, and etched across millennia of civilizational memory. Walk through the corridors of Hampi, where the remnants of the Vijayanagara Empire stand like verses of forgotten poetry carved in granite. Or witness the geometry of devotion in the Sun Temple of Konark, where the chariot of the sun god rides across stone wheels frozen in motion.
 
In the north, the Taj Mahal remains India’s most photographed tear on the cheek of time, while in the northeast, the living roots of Meghalaya speak of a harmony between people and nature few nations can match. Each monument is a story, each sculpture a symbol, from the cave paintings of Bhimbetka, some of the oldest human expressions on Earth, to the marble latticework of Rajasthan’s havelis, which breathe opulence and art.
 
Tourism in India has become more than a commercial enterprise; it’s now a strategy to protect, project, and popularize heritage with purpose. Government programs like Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD are not just about building circuits and infrastructure, they’re about narrative crafting. They’re designed to take tourists off the beaten path, into the heartlands of civilizational wealth, like the Ramayana Circuit, which reimagines ancient epics as immersive journeys, or the Buddhist Circuit, linking sites from Lumbini to Sarnath. Cities like Varanasi have undergone sensitive restoration to balance spiritual sanctity with modern tourism needs, while Hampi and Mahabalipuram now host international cultural festivals that draw visitors beyond the curious into the culturally invested.
 
Indian festivals are evolving, focusing less on their locations and more on their reinterpretations. Holi, for example, has become a global spring celebration, taking place in venues like Berlin warehouses and vibrant music festivals in Brazil. Navratri has gained traction in Western cities such as Leicester and Edison, attracting thousands of dancers, many of whom are not Indian. Classical dance is also breaking out of its traditional confines; Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and Odissi troupes now perform as main attractions at European festivals. This shift illustrates a process of cultural normalization rather than simple cultural export.
 
Importantly, there’s a visible push toward responsible tourism, local guides are being trained in storytelling, heritage hotels are being incentivized to preserve architecture, and digital tools like QR-coded plaques at UNESCO sites are helping tourists access layered historical context. Whether it’s walking the ancient ghats or navigating the desert forts of Jaisalmer, the experience is increasingly curated not just for visual awe, but for emotional imprint.
 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, more than any of his predecessors, has deliberately made India’s cultural heritage a calling card in diplomacy. He often says that in the 21st century, India’s role as a “Vishwa Guru” (world teacher) will come not from its economic might alone, but from its cultural ethos and knowledge traditions. Modi’s own words and actions on the world stage underscore this conviction. In a 2015 address at UNESCO in Paris, he affirmed, “Culture must connect, not divide, our world. It should be a bridge to greater respect and understanding between people.” Standing in that temple of culture and education, he thanked UNESCO for helping preserve India’s heritage and championed India’s civilizational contributions. “We are grateful for UNESCO’s support for the preservation of our cultural heritage,” Modi noted, linking it to a duty India owes the world. He frequently invokes the Sanskrit maxim “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (the world is one family) to frame India’s global cultural outlook.
 
The Indian state has refined the stagecraft of soft power, from the banks of the Seine to the streets of Sydney, Indian festivals are becoming fixtures of cultural calendars far from home. Events like Namaste France, Festival of India in Russia, and India by the Nile in Egypt are less about nostalgia and more about narrative control. Designed by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and coordinated with local embassies, these festivals serve a diplomatic function in silk and sound, showcasing India’s classical arts, crafts, and contemporary culture in curated capsules. Whether through a Kathakali performance in Moscow or a sari-weaving demo in Cairo, the idea is to replace outdated stereotypes with direct cultural engagement, intimate, high-quality, and often deliberately unexpected.
 
Modi has also walked the talk by infusing cultural elements into high diplomacy. His mass rallies with the Indian diaspora in cities like New York, London, and Sydney, the likes of the “Howdy Modi” event in Texas (2019), are peppered with cultural performances, from phanga troupes to spiritual music, presenting a vibrant image of Indian culture to foreign dignitaries present. On state visits, he often gifts foreign leaders replicas of Indian relics or texts (such as handing over an ancient Tamil manuscript to the leader of Singapore, or the Bhagavad Gita to the Japanese emperor), subtly spreading awareness of India’s civilizational depth. Under Modi’s watch, International Yoga Day became a showcase annual event in virtually every embassy. His government also pushed for global recognition of practices like Ayurveda and traditional medicine, and in 2023 spearheaded a UN resolution declaring 2023 the International Year of Millets, spotlighting a traditional Indian grain on the world stage (a point Jaishankar highlighted as soft power in action).
 
While yoga studios dot every cosmopolitan skyline, another ancient Indian practice is making its way into global consciousness, but with institutional backing this time. In 2022, the World Health Organization, in partnership with India, launched its first Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in Gujarat. The move signaled not just global recognition of Ayurveda, but a willingness to subject it to serious scientific frameworks. Unlike yoga’s grassroots spread, Ayurveda’s global journey is now part of a formal wellness economy, one that includes Ayurvedic clinics in Europe, cosmeceuticals in Japan, and integrative medicine departments in American hospitals. India is no longer pitching Ayurveda as heritage alone but as a viable contender in the global health marketplace.
 
Crucially, Modi’s cultural diplomacy has been backed by considerable state investment. Cultural exchange budgets have risen, new museums and heritage conservation projects have been launched domestically (such as a major restoration of Varanasi, the ancient holy city, to make it more tourist-friendly), and there is a strong cultural component in India’s foreign aid – for example, helping renovate temples in neighbouring countries or language scholarships for foreigners. In international forums like the G20 (which India chaired in 2023), India has advocated for incorporating culture into the global development agenda, arguing that “culture is as much a driver of sustainable development as economics.”
 
UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay, during a recent visit to India, acknowledged India’s “strong commitment” to UNESCO’s mandate and noted that India hosting the upcoming World Heritage Committee session was a testament to its leadership in cultural preservation. Modi often articulates a philosophical underpinning to these efforts: that India’s heritage is not just about the past, but a resource for global harmony. “This resolve of India regarding heritage is linked with the feeling of serving the entire humanity,” he said at a heritage event, “Indian culture talks about us, not just me”.
 
The cumulative impact of these initiatives and organic trends is visible in India’s bolstered global image. International surveys by consulting firms note that India’s cultural appeal (its food, music, Bollywood, etc.) consistently ranks high among the foreign public, even if opinions on its politics vary. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once quipped, “India’s soft power indeed makes it the ‘curry’ nation, acquiring a taste is only a matter of time.”
 
Rann Utsav and Durga Puja have both received UNESCO recognition, highlighting two very different Indian festivals: one steeped in tradition and the other in innovation. In 2021, Durga Puja in Kolkata was recognized not only for its grandeur but also for its rich ecosystem of craftsmanship, street art, music, and community involvement. On the other hand, Rann Utsav in Kutch, Gujarat, presents a contrasting model. It is a festival that emerged not from ancient texts but from contemporary tourism policies. Featuring desert installations, local artisan markets, and curated eco-lodging, Rann Utsav exemplifies how cultural spectacles can energize rural economies.
 
Together, these festivals represent a significant shift in perspective: Indian festivals are no longer just celebrations but are now seen as strategic cultural assets on a global stage.
 
India’s cultural diplomacy increasingly does travel with speeches, but also with scaffolding and conservation crews. Over the past few years, the Indian government has quietly expanded its footprint in heritage restoration across Asia, as a stakeholder. In Cambodia, Indian teams have taken lead roles in restoring segments of Angkor Wat, one of the world’s most revered temple complexes, where Hindu and Buddhist iconography meet in monumental stonework. Similar archaeological collaborations are underway in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, where remnants of ancient Indic influence are excavated and stabilized. Perhaps the most symbolic of these is the revival of Nalanda University, not as a museum piece, but as a functioning modern campus, a project backed by multiple Asian nations, rooted in the idea that intellectual heritage, too, can be a form of infrastructure.
 
These restoration projects are just one part of a broader reawakening, it seeks to reconnect with cultural sinews. The subtext of India’s relationship with Southeast Asia is increasingly cultural, and the script is older than modern diplomacy. The spread of epics like the Ramayana and architectural lineages shared between Indian and Southeast Asian temples have long been studied by historians, now, they’re being utilized by strategists. 
 
Through the Act East Policy, New Delhi is embedding culture into policy, sending Sanskrit scholars to Thai universities, co-hosting Ramayana re-enactments in Cambodia, and investing in language chairs and research fellowships across Southeast Asia. These aren’t sentimental gestures; they’re signals. India isn’t just tracing its cultural DNA in the region, it’s reactivating it as geopolitical soft tissue in an increasingly contested Asia.
 
Today, that lighthearted prediction seems truer than ever, from Capitol Hill to a village in Africa, one is likely to find people practising yoga, watching an Indian web series, or enjoying a cup of chai. Global brands and institutions are also leaning in. The United Nations has embraced multiple Indian-led cultural resolutions (Yoga Day, Year of Millets), and foreign universities are expanding Hindi and Indology departments. In 2022, Oxford University Press noted that “Namaste”, the Indian greeting, had entered common global usage, especially after it got popularized as a no-contact greeting during the pandemic.
 
Endorsements of Indian culture now come in the form of collaborations and accolades. When the Academy Awards saw Indian talent on stage, or when luxury Maison Dior declares that its lavish Mumbai show “spotlights the extraordinary craftsmanship of India’s artisans,” it validates India’s cultural capital on the world stage. At Times Square’s Diwali festival mentioned earlier, New York’s Mayor joined the revellers, stating, “What better place to celebrate the festival of lights than in the Crossroads of the World?” and spoke of “pushing away darkness and welcoming light across our city”. Such moments, where foreign leaders participate in Indian traditions, symbolize acceptance and respect for Indian culture in the global mainstream.
 
As India marches forward, challenges remain in fully converting cultural clout to geopolitical influence. Soft power can be fragile, it requires continual nurturing of a positive narrative. Events that conflict with the image of a pluralistic, open India can dampen the soft power sheen. Yet, there is a growing recognition that India’s “culture of unity in diversity” is itself a compelling message at a time of global divisions. Diplomacy veterans suggest India could further institutionalize cultural diplomacy by partnering more with its 30-million-strong diaspora, many of whom act as informal cultural ambassadors. There are also calls for India to invest in global media or entertainment platforms to amplify its voice (for instance, an “Indian Netflix” for the world). Still, the progress of the last decade is evident and remarkable.
 
In a world hungry for authentic connections, India’s heritage offers a feast, and New Delhi has learned to serve it with style. The past ten years, especially under the Modi administration, have shown how ancient soft power assets can be repurposed for modern statecraft. India’s classical dances and digital tech coexist in its toolkit of influence. As Soft Power Index rankings climb and Holi powders fly across foreign skies, India might well be entering what one analyst termed “a golden age of cultural diplomacy.” In Prime Minister Modi’s words, “The heritage of India is the heritage of the world”, and by championing culture as a unifying force, India is steadily turning that principle into palpable global goodwill. The stage is set, the world’s a willing audience, and India’s cultural soft power show is only just beginning.

Title: Migration in North-East and Inner Line Permit System
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:30:00 +0000
Content: Northeast India often makes headlines due to conflicts and political tensions because of the rising influx of migrants within the states. We have heard of the case of Tripura and the heavy news of instability coming from Manipur very recently. For the Northeast region, hoisting several indigenous groups rooted in unique cultures and traditions carrying the history of civilizations, the influx of migrants within the state often is not only perceived as a threat but also comes with huge sacrifices indeed! Migration, by definition, simply means movement of people from one place to another. There can be various factors leading to migration, such as better opportunities for work and livelihood, conflict, and even large-scale persecutions. It can be either internal migration within a country or international migration between countries. The very act of migration often is facilitated by an increase in transport, feasible communication links, urbanization, and industrialization.
While there has been a lag in the study of migration as far as Northeast India is concerned, a lot of troubles and tension brimming around the region are also catalyzed by rapid increases in migration. The constitution of India gives its citizens the right to move freely in any part of the country. A proper analysis of migration patterns also helps study the momentum of changes taking place economically, socially, and politically in the country. It also acts as a future path to understand population redistribution in the country alongside considering factors of the number of births and deaths.
Going back to the official status regarding the stance of migration, decades of understanding migration patterns have been considered by considering key changes of birthplace as the factor. Before 1951, a person was a migrant when he changed his birthplace district to another or state. Ten years later, since 1961, a person is a migrant if his birthplace is different from the place of his enumeration. A need to include last place of residence was mandated for the collection of migration data, and hence, since 1971, another ten years later, censuses have provided that a person is considered a migrant if either his place of birth or his last place of residence differs from the place of enumeration.
Northeast states often lack proper research and available data when it comes to reliable data on migration. Often only when tension arises out of the issue is when the country learns about its facets in the Northeast. The concern for the Northeast majorly is the problem of a huge influx of migrants from other states of India and immigration from other countries, especially Bangladesh, Myanmar, and even Nepal.
The Northeast region consists of the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and Sikkim. While India as a country accounts for 37% migrants in its total population, the Northeast, seemingly the most static region, no doubt has seen various changes in the past decades. According to the census of 2011, 14.9 million migrants, accounting for about 33% of the total population of the Northeast, are migrants.
With a significant increase in number from the 2001 census, the Northeast region has been a pooling region for migrants increasingly. For example, the state of Arunachal Pradesh is the only state in the Northeast experiencing a whopping percentage of 45% of total migration, much higher than the national average. Considering 22% of the total migrants of Arunachal Pradesh constitute interstate migration, the state of Tripura experiences the highest number of immigrant populations, accounting for 72% of the total migrant population. The Northeast region constitutes hundreds of indigenous communities sharing a unique history of civilization, culture, and traditions. With the alarming influx of migrants, efforts to assert regional and indigenous identities have become increasingly prominent.
The agency of migration often leads to assimilation. This assimilation often contributes to subversive population polarization, often leading to conflicts arising out of political aspirations and insecurities. A huge influx of migrants poses a certain threat for a region like the Northeast with small indigenous communities that can get easily engulfed by the majority migrants. This will mean the extinction of a facet of civilization having dynamic culture, traditions, and practices. It will mean rooting out centuries of heritage, wisdom, and knowledge from the face of the earth.
Other than concerns of an increase in crime and conflicts, sensitive regions such as the Northeast, bordering several counties often brimming with a lack of trust against the Indian government, can fall into the hands of bigger powers who can use them as leverage to incite turmoil by pitting one against another, therefore bringing about security concerns for the country.
As far as interstate migration is concerned, there has been an overwhelming anxiety built across Northeast states due to the heavy influx of migrants from other states of the country. Around 42% of migrants in the Northeast region are from various states of Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, the Andaman Islands, Odisha, and even Sikkim. Major states, except for Tripura and Assam, have a high number of migrants from other states. And the Inner Line Permit System has thus become a common call of approach to take up in the region to keep check on this interstate migration.
Back during the British era, a policy was established by the British to regulate their stronghold of the North-East Frontier; it was also the first policy in the region referred to as the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation or the Inner Line Regulation of 1873. Although the policy was established to secure the region for commercialization largely, after the independence, the government of India relieved the policy by integrating several changes into the Inner Line Permit system in the 1950s.
By simple understanding, the ILP is a travel document issued for visiting any protected or restricted areas of the country. It can be of several types, one issued for tourists and another for extended stays, mainly for work. The system is introduced in regions that need protection against any form of exploitation in the name of travel and tourism. To ensure that the indigenous element, including the social, cultural, customary laws, administration of justice, religion, land ownership, etc., stays protected, the permit with a limited timespan of stay, after which a renewal is required, also serves as a method to control the influx of migrants. The documents are issued by state governments that have implemented the ILP system, and currently in the Northeast, three states—namely Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Although ILP has been demanded in almost all the states of the Northeast, states like Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura surprisingly have not implemented ILP so far.
While India has been taking up considerable efforts to check interstate migration towards the Northeast, it has been lenient about its policy towards the immigrants. With its welcoming approach, the rise of immigrants in the Northeast also needs a serious check. Immigration or entry of foreigners is governed under the 1958 Foreigners (Protected Area) Order under the Foreigners Act of 1946 and the Passport (Entry into India) Act 1920. Immigration, especially from countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, is posing an equal threat if India’s stand for indigenous safeguard is considered. States like Assam have considered adopting the NRC, or the National Register of Citizens, to keep on record genuine Indian citizens. This record has been monitored and mandated by the Supreme Court in 2014.
The NRC, with its nodal agency Registrar General and Centre Commissioner, aims to document legal citizens in Assam residing as of March 1971. This identification was also promised under the Assam Accord signed between leaders of Assam and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Following this assurance alongside the Citizenship Act of 1955, updating of the NRC to identify illegal immigrants and help deport them was therefore carried out in spite of the many concerns of the NRC regarding documentation verification and discriminatory criticisms being highlighted.
India’s Northeast has significantly evolved in trade and development, and in return has variably espoused concerns about interstate migration, but major states of the region, except Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Meghalaya, have a higher number of immigrants than the national average. The highest is Tripura, with 72% immigrants, followed by Mizoram, Assam, and Manipur. Although there has been a significant slowdown in the inflow of immigrants after 2011 as compared to 2001, community concerns still pose a huge threat involving aggressive identity assertion leading to socio-political conflicts arising out of insecurities to seek political power and resources.
Therefore, a mass call for NRC to check illegal immigrants has become a movement for the region and the rest of India too. A fair understanding of migration in the Northeast and its concerns should also involve looking into the outflow migration from the region owing to a lesser number of opportunities in the region. Manipur and Assam have the highest number of out-migration. Manipur has the largest number of outflows per inflow, while the state of Assam has a balanced outflow per inflow. Other states have significant gains in the number of migrants. But what is significantly evident in the migration of the Northeast is that when the momentum of migration is often alarmingly ill-balanced, we often find instability. Tripura sets a big example with the tension arising since the late 1990s, with political and administrative space taken up largely by immigrants pushing the indigenous people towards the periphery.
Manipur’s instability today also stems from huge concerns about illegal immigration from the neighboring country Myanmar. Hence, if India’s genuine concern is to protect indigenous rights, uphold social justice, and address national security concerns, NRC and ILP hand-in-hand and not individually can be a way forward. But these policies by far should ensure the discrepancies in them are not overlooked, and human rights are upheld through inclusivity and not marginalization and discrimination.
Lastly, these policies should be kept in check to not completely isolate the Northeast from the rest of the country or restrict the region completely through a comprehensive, fair, and transparent approach so as to keep the spirit of India’s democracy intact.

Title: Centre seeks seven days to file reply in Waqf Act case
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:27:17 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Thursday recorded the Centre’s request for more time to respond to petitions challenging the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the bench that a preliminary reply, along with relevant documents, would be submitted within seven days. He argued that the Act is a considered piece of legislation and cautioned that imposing a stay on the entire law would be an “extreme step.”
The three-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justices PV Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan, took note of Mehta’s assurance that no appointments to Waqf Boards or the Central Waqf Council would be made until the next hearing.
The apex court reiterated its earlier stance that it does not favor a blanket stay on the legislation but is considering targeted interim measures to balance competing interests.
On Wednesday, the SC had indicated its intent to stay certain controversial provisions of the amended law, including the inclusion of non-Muslims in Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council, the powers conferred on district collectors to decide Waqf property disputes, and the provisions allowing for the de-notification of properties already declared as Waqf by courts
The court had nearly dictated the interim order on Wednesday, but deferred doing so after the Solicitor General and other counsels defending the law requested to be heard further.
During the hearing, the Chief Justice observed that the government “cannot rewrite history” through the amendments, specifically referring to the provisions that allow for de-notifying properties declared as Waqf.
The court also directed that existing Waqf properties—whether declared through notification, user, or court orders—will not be reclassified or de-notified while the matter is sub judice.
On the controversial inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards and the Council, Justice Viswanathan remarked: “Whenever it comes to Hindu endowments, it would be Hindus who would be governing,” drawing a parallel with the Hindu Charitable Endowments Act.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing one of the petitioners, argued that vesting District Collectors with the authority to determine whether a property is Waqf makes them “judges in their own cause”—a move he called “per se unconstitutional.” He also criticized the inclusion of non-Muslims in Waqf bodies, saying it represents a “parliamentary usurpation of the faith of 200 million persons.”
Toward the end of the hearing, the bench expressed concern over reports of violence in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district in connection with the Act. “The one thing that is very disturbing is the violence that is taking place. The issue is before the court, and we will decide,” the CJI noted.
Multiple petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Waqf (Amendment) Act, with petitioners contending that the law discriminates against the Muslim community and infringes upon their constitutional rights.
President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, on April 5, following heated debates and the bill’s passage in both Houses of Parliament.

Title: Nudging Bharat: The Modi Model of Transformation by Engineering a Shift in Perception
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:54:08 +0000
Content: The hands that held a broom on the ghats of Varanasi were also offering arghya to the sun in worship in the lap of the Ganga. Two moments, two acts—one symbolic, one sacred—both capturing an essential shift that Bharat has witnessed over the last decade under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A shift nudged into being by the man who has become the face of aspirational transformation.
 
This ‘nudge’ is not loud. It does not dictate. It persuades, suggests, and subtly steers. It is an effort consciously directed at reshaping Bharat’s vision of itself, at reawakening the spirit of a nation that was, for decades, conditioned to believe that it must wait for change rather than create it.
 
For over seventy years, and even before that under imperialist rule, India was made to think of itself as a follower, not a leader. The ‘nudge’ we now see at play is a corrective force—gently yet decisively reminding a civilization of its innate power, urging 140 crore people to dream beyond limitations imposed by history and reclaim their rightful place on the world stage.
 
This is a nudge to move from being passive consumers to active creators. From being subjects of a system to being its stakeholders. It is a push to reframe how India views itself—not as a country in need of development, but as a nation already capable of shaping its own destiny.
 
The Power of a Name
 
Critics dismiss these efforts as mere optics or clever branding. But in a land where names hold meaning—where gods have a thousand names, each telling a different story—words carry weight. They shape thought. They inspire action. And those who sought to distort our history knew this better than those who now bristle at every colonial cloak being shed.
 
When Narendra Modi took office in 2014, India stood at a crossroads. The economy was sluggish, corruption scandals had eroded trust, and there was an air of resigned cynicism. The IT revolution had given many a ticket to better opportunities, yet within the country, ambition had begun to shrink. Families nudged their children towards ‘safe’ careers, risk-taking was discouraged, and the entrepreneurial spirit that once defined Bharat had started to fade.
 
Numbers Do the Talking
 
And then came a different kind of nudge. The Mera Desh Badal Raha Hai campaign (2016) coincided with Modi’s push to restore faith in India’s potential, urging people to shift from a survival mindset to a growth mindset. Instead of waiting for change, Bharat was told to build it.
 
The numbers speak for themselves. In 2014, India had just four unicorn startups. Today, there are 111, with a combined valuation of over $350 billion. A shift in mindset has translated into a shift in action. India’s Ease of Doing Business ranking improved from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in 2020, making entrepreneurship not just an option, but an opportunity.
 
Over 10 lakh jobs have been created within India’s startup ecosystem. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has drawn investments exceeding ₹3 lakh crore, propelling industries like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles into the global spotlight.
 
The Chaiwala who became Prime Minister didn’t just introduce reforms; he redefined aspiration itself. And a nation that once sought job security is now taking risks, building businesses, and reclaiming its natural instinct to innovate.
 
Modi’s Personalization of the Nudge
 
Modi doesn’t just announce policies—he embodies them. His leadership style is deeply personal, using visual storytelling and cultural cues to nudge public behavior. From getting vaccinated on camera to instill trust, to using UPI payments to normalize digital transactions, to draping a gamcha in Assam or donning a paghadi in Rajasthan, every gesture is a carefully placed nudge towards transformation.
 
Take his redefining of labor dignity: by washing the feet of Shramik working on the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, by personally honoring construction workers, by consistently using the term Vishwakarma to celebrate artisans, he has engineered a cultural shift where those who build the nation are recognized as its backbone.
 
When Maldives acted funny, he didn’t retaliate with words. He took a walk along the beaches of Lakshadweep. No aggressive marketing campaign could have done what that simple act did—it nudged people to rethink their travel choices, realigning tourism patterns in a way that was swift and organic. Indians worldwide nudged themselves into reconsidering where they spent their travel dollars. The Maldives’ tourism took a hit, and interest in Lakshadweep skyrocketed.
 
Interestingly, while there was once talk of setting up a dedicated ‘nudge unit’ within NITI Aayog, PM Modi has made this behavioral shift his personal endeavor. Through his actions, his presence, and his words, he has made nudging Bharat a leader-driven movement.
 
The Global Nudge: Bharat’s Cultural Ambassadors
 
Before 2014, NRIs largely viewed India as a nostalgic homeland but not necessarily a place for investment or return. That changed when Modi, addressing a packed Madison Square Garden, flipped the script. He didn’t just ask for their support; he made them feel like co-architects of a new Bharat. When he declared, “India is not a land of snake charmers. We are a land of talent and technology,” it wasn’t just a speech—it was a nudge for them to own their Indian identity with pride.
 
From Bharat Dekho to Chalo India, Modi has continuously nudged the diaspora to be active participants in the nation’s rise. At Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, he framed NRIs as Bharat’s cultural ambassadors, urging them to shape global narratives about India.
 
His approach isn’t just about policy; it’s personal. Whether it is embracing the Indian flag at the Sydney SuperDome or leading chants of Bharat Mata Ki Jai in Houston, Modi’s interactions stir an emotional and psychological shift—one that transforms NRIs from passive well-wishers to engaged stakeholders in Bharat’s growth story.
 
Viksit Bharat: The Next Big Leap
 
And once again, in his third term as PM, he has planted the seed of Viksit Bharat. Once again, he is orchestrating a fundamental shift in how India perceives itself and, in turn, how the world perceives India.
Viksit – comes loaded not with hope but with trust and determination. With hope comes an element of fear and the possibility of non-realisation. But ‘Viksit’ is a dream already realised in a different time from now and all of us are empowered architects of this dream-come-true in a tomorrow that we know will arrive.
 
A carefully calibrated strategy of nation-building, where words, symbolism, and presence are leveraged as instruments of transformation defines PM Narendra Modi’s leadership. And the shift is visible across multiple dimensions—from how Indians see their own heritage, to how they engage with governance, and how they redefine their aspirations, India is unapologetically shedding its colonial cloak to embrace a Bharateeyata that dares.

Title: Timeless Tales, Modern Minds: Importance of Cultural Heritage and Children’s Contemporary Literature
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:50:24 +0000
Content: In a world racing toward the future, where screens flicker faster than turning pages, storytelling remains a powerful tool for shaping young minds. Even in today’s fast-paced world of instant visuals and fleeting attention, where things are often taken for granted, the timeless power of stories continues to leave a lasting impact on the minds of the readers. Stories are not for entertainment only; they create empathy, fantasize, and develop values that will guide children through a lifetime. Loss due to the preference the publishing trade has placed on marketability over meaning has deprived the audience of the soul of storytelling — that soul which is deeply rooted in cultural heritage and moral lessons. For stories, which carry tales of gods, kings, and other common folks, are like bridges that link the past with the present. This piece highlights the urgent need to revive meaningful, value-rich stories in children’s literature in a big way to shape character, culture, and deeper connections.
Brain and Beyond
According to neuroscientists, stories wire the brain. Research says that stories engage different sections of the brain simultaneously, therefore enhancing memory, emotional intelligence, and cognitive development. Reading about characters who experience difficulties causes emotional reflections to flow through the brain in a similar way, which may stimulate empathy and resilience. A lasting impact throughout someone’s life can be created with a well-told story whose imprint shapes the moral compass for a child.
More Than Just Fiction
In the Bharatiya tradition, stories are not entertainment alone: they are wisdom. Children learn by observation, but what if they could also learn by visualization? Stories brimmed with moral lessons do more than tell: they inspire. A story about a courageous girl conquering injustice might propel a child farther than a hundred lectures. They are part of life; a guiding light for all of us. Stories have a cultural pulse in India. From Ramayana to folk tales echoing in the villages, stories set children in deep heritage and give wings to their spirit, enabling them to soar high only to return home with new experiences.
The Root of Identity
Heritage is the pillar holding up an identity of any society. Stories that portray culture and tradition nourish the very being of the child. These stories speak to a child about his/her culture and traditions, he/she gets to know who he/she is. In India, stories serve more in the sense of narrating history; they become value-impregnated tools for imparting respect, duty, and resilience through the timeless tales of Rama, Krishna, local folklore and the like.
The Global View
Stories do not isolate cultures; they celebrate them. Most of the cultures of the world use stories to preserve their identity. A child in Japan may grow up knowing Manga while a child in Germany may be familiar with Fix and Foxy. Courage and loyalty are tied to Momotaro in Japan, while the Native French (and UK) speak of harmony through stories of Astrix. It is all about cultural diversity within children’s literature that underpins and grounds them in roots yet opens the door to inclusivity.
Globalization has opened the doors of the world to the stories but largely at the expense of local stories. It is very good for the child to read about Harry Potter, but equally, they should hear the simple yet beautiful stories of Sudha Murthy that are rooted in kindness and in reality. Maintaining a balance between global and local literature allows the child to embrace different environments without forgetting their culture.
The Moral Compass
Moral development in childhood lays the foundation for a child’s sense of right and wrong, guiding his or her behaviour and decisions. The development of key virtues such as empathy, responsibility, and integrity, which are the bedrock of social relationships and personal development, comes later. Strong moral development influences children at an early stage in building their resilience, making right choices, and contributing positively to society. Stories are an easy way to talk about such thoughts. For instance, the stories from the Mahabharata, the epic combat between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, teach us about the consequences of greed and standing up for what is right.
Moral lessons, or morality upon which stories are written, can be explored in very subtle realms. Modern literature has forayed into more complicated moral landscapes where characters face life-like dilemmas. The authors of today often weave in characters that can be identified with, faced with moral choices that are part of their very existence, thus making lessons much more powerful.
Blending Culture and Morality in Modern Contexts
Tradition itself doesn’t become stagnant, but it can risk being perceived as outdated if not adapted or reinterpreted for modern times. Newer stories should be created to address contemporary challenges—tales of Lord Shiva’s meditative power can inspire mindfulness, while the resilience of Draupadi can empower young girls. Teenagers can learn the importance of making the right kind of friendships from the stories of Duryodhana and Karna, and Krishna and Sudhama. Stories of Hanuman’s unwavering devotion can teach perseverance, while Yudhishthira’s commitment to truth can instil integrity. Similarly, the resourcefulness of Tenali Rama can inspire creativity in young minds.
Examples of cultural evolution in stories are plenty. Amar Chitra Katha has adapted the mythological stories to appeal to the present-day reader with bold and colourful illustrations along with a simple, accessible style of writing. Tinkle, with plotlines featuring everyday moral lessons told with humour, encourages children to read. Across the globe, The Little Prince brings insights on life, all wrapped in simple storytelling. Anansi the Spider, A Tale from the Ashanti (Gerald McDermott, USA) is a vibrant retelling of an African folklore about Anansi, the trickster spider, teaching problem-solving and wisdom to young readers.
The State of Today’s Childhood
Digital distractions and short attention spans are a common complaint often heard from parents and teachers regarding the condition of children today. It is hard to hold a child’s attention in this TikTok world—with all the distractions from video games in their lives. Storytelling must update itself and find new ways of expression that do not compromise on the depth. Interactive storytelling sessions, audiobooks, and graphic novels present novel ways to keep children engaged.
Battling the Myths About Moral Storytelling
Myth 1: Moral Stories Are Boring
The assumption that moral tales preach rather than entertain is an outdated one. The tales of the Panchatantra demonstrate in plenty that moral lessons can be packed full of wit, humour, and clever twists.
Myth 2: Cultural Stories Are Irrelevant
Cultural stories are the reflections of ever-changing human emotions. With the stories of the Ramayana or the Mahabharata on righteousness, duty, loyalty and sacrifice being equally applicable today as they were centuries ago, these narratives can be given modern settings in order to make them more relatable without losing any of their substance.
Myth 3: Fun and Values Can’t Go Hand in Hand
Fun and values do not have to be in opposition to one another when telling a story well. Chhota Bheem is an excellent example of a series with entertaining adventures interwoven with values of friendship and courage.
Role of Educators, Parents, and Publishers
Teachers play a vital part in introducing children to good stories. Storytelling sessions that prompt discussions allow children to imbibe values much better than when they are just reading. In fact, educators act as the gatekeepers.
Probably, a parent is usually the first storyteller for any child. Bedtime stories are great opportunities to impart values in a subtle manner. Grandparents’ stories bring in layers of bonding and cultural transmission.
If viewed critically, the publishers have the power to decide what children get to read. When publishers support authors writing stories with cultural richness and value-oriented message structures, good literature can reach the young audience. This is also the need of the day.
Real-Life Effects
In all these years, The Panchatantra has given age-old lessons of solving problems and wisdom, inspiring many modern adaptations across the world. Wings of Fire has fuelled the dreams of millions, instilling in children willpower and ambition to persevere. Its root lies in the everyday India speaking profound things with simplicity and compassion. Meanwhile, Coelho’s The Alchemist has been inspiring countless readers around the globe to dare to dream and follow their destinies. These stories, from different cultures and ages, have ensured that the key messages of resilience, wisdom, and hope were imparted, shaping minds and changing lives.
What is Ahead: The Future of Storytelling
The future of storytelling lies at the junction of tradition and technology; classic tales are being revived through modern means such as audiobooks, storytelling apps, and virtual reality. While the format may change, the spirit of these stories remains the same. It must also create a children’s literature world in which every child feels seen, heard, and valued. Stories ought to reflect diverse experiences so that young readers can identify with characters who share their struggles, aspirations, and cultural perspectives. Genuine inclusivity in literature inspires empathy and widens outlook, thereby making storytelling an essential instrument for social connectedness.
Stories have thus become vessels of culture. The moral fabric of a society is woven by such threads of bravery, compassion, and resilience and is as valid today as it was yesterday. Each one has a collective responsibility to pass these timeless narratives, so that they may continue to inspire and guide the future generations. By preserving and adapting these stories, we enrich both our heritage and our future, keeping the wisdom of the past alive in meaningful ways.
Conclusion
Stories are more than just words on paper, they are architects of children’s vision. Such an environment becomes so rapidly changing, it more than ever necessitates the story in cultural heritage and moral wisdom. Bharatiya literature, with its multi-textured ranges of epics, folklore, and ordinary tales, is a rich treasure store of timeless lessons. Balancing these with global narratives ensures that children grow up with both roots and wings. As we write the next chapter of children’s literature, let it be one that tells not just of heroes and adventures but of values that last a lifetime.

Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:38:03 +0000
Content: A delegation from the Dawoodi Bohra community met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to express their gratitude for the recently enacted Waqf Amendment Act.
 
During the meeting, the community members extended their full support to the new legislation, describing it as a long-standing demand that has finally been fulfilled. They also reiterated their faith in Prime Minister Modi’s vision of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, and voiced optimism that the reforms brought in through the amended Waqf law would help address past shortcomings and improve the conditions of the Muslim community at large.
 
The Bohra community’s support for the amended legislation comes at a time when several Muslim organizations, clerics, and ulemas have opposed the law, calling it an infringement on religious rights. Some of these groups have also approached the Supreme Court, challenging its constitutional validity.
 
Union Minister for Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju was also present at the meeting. He later shared photos from the event on X.
 
“The Dawoodi Bohra community met PM Modi to express their heartfelt gratitude for the Waqf Amendment Act, fulfilling a long-pending demand,” Rijiju said. “Their trust in PM Modi’s vision of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas was deeply moving,” he added.
 
The Dawoodi Bohras are a sect within the Shia Ismaili branch of Islam, with a significant population in India and in over 40 countries worldwide. Last year, the community had submitted a representation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, seeking exemption from the purview of the Waqf Board. They argued that the proposed legislation did not take into account their distinct status within the broader Muslim community.

Title: SC allows West Bengal govt to retain ‘untainted’ teachers for now
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:57:55 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted “untainted” assistant teachers in West Bengal—whose appointments were cancelled due to widespread irregularities in the 2016 recruitment process—to continue in their roles until the completion of a fresh selection process.
Emphasising that students must not suffer as a result of the administrative lapses, a bench led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna extended temporary relief exclusively to Class 9 to 12 teachers whose names have not been linked to any wrongdoing.
The bench directed the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to issue fresh recruitment advertisements by May 31, and to conclude the entire process by December 31, 2025.
However, the top court made it clear that the relief will not apply to Group C and Group D employees. It also warned that if there is any delay in the recruitment timeline, the interim relief granted to the assistant teachers would be withdrawn.
Last week, the Supreme Court upheld a Calcutta High Court order that had cancelled 25,753 appointments to teaching and non-teaching posts made by the WBSSC in 2016, citing large-scale irregularities.
In April last year, the Calcutta High Court had scrapped these appointments, directing the candidates hired from expired panels to return the full salary earned during their tenure, with 12 per cent annual interest.
However, the apex court recently set aside the part of the High Court’s order that had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the creation of supernumerary posts in state-run schools—positions suspected to have enabled the illegal recruitment of ineligible candidates.
The Supreme Court clarified that while the CBI cannot examine the legitimacy of the creation of these posts, it is not barred from investigating other elements of the ongoing school jobs scam, as outlined in the High Court’s ruling.

Title: India strengthens Heritage Preservation efforts on World Heritage Day
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:42:38 +0000
Content: India marked World Heritage Day on April 18 with renewed focus on safeguarding its cultural and natural legacy. Observed globally, the day aims to honour and protect sites of historical, cultural, and environmental value. The theme for this year—“Heritage under Threat from Disasters and Conflicts: Preparedness and Learning from 60 Years of ICOMOS Actions”—emphasises the urgency of protecting heritage in vulnerable zones, drawing from the work of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).
World Heritage Day, also known as the International Day for Monuments and Sites, was proposed by ICOMOS in 1982 and officially adopted by UNESCO in 1983. Since then, the day has served as a global reminder of the need to protect human heritage and recognise the contributions of those involved in its preservation.
The World Heritage Convention, adopted by UNESCO member states in 1972, plays a key role in identifying and conserving cultural and natural sites deemed valuable to all of humanity. India ratified the Convention in November 1977. As of October 2024, there are 1,223 sites on the World Heritage List across 196 countries, including 952 cultural, 231 natural, and 40 mixed sites.
India currently has 43 World Heritage Sites and 62 sites on UNESCO’s Tentative List. In July 2024, “Moidams: The Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty” in Assam was added to the list as a cultural property. India’s journey in this regard began in 1983 with the inclusion of Agra Fort, the Taj Mahal, Ajanta Caves, and Ellora Caves.
The Ministry of Culture, through the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), has undertaken several major initiatives to promote and preserve India’s heritage. Among these is the retrieval of antiquities from abroad. Since 1976, India has brought back 655 antiquities, with 642 of them recovered after 2014.
In 2017, the government launched the “Adopt A Heritage” scheme, revamped in 2023 as “Adopt A Heritage 2.0.” Under this programme, public and private entities can adopt monuments and contribute towards their maintenance and facility development using Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. To date, 21 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed under the scheme across multiple states.
India also played host to the 46th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Delhi from July 21 to 31, 2024. Organised by the Ministry of Culture and the ASI, the session was inaugurated by the Prime Minister and attended by nearly 2,900 delegates from over 140 countries. The event marked a significant moment in India’s engagement with global heritage preservation efforts.
The ASI is responsible for the conservation of 3,697 ancient monuments and archaeological sites of national importance. These sites are being upgraded with amenities such as interpretive signage, accessibility features for differently-abled visitors, and improved visitor services, including souvenir shops and sound and light shows.
Major redevelopment projects have also been undertaken to rejuvenate key religious and cultural centres. Projects such as the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi, Mahakaal Lok in Ujjain, Ma Kamakhya Corridor in Guwahati, and the Chardham Road Project aim to enhance pilgrim experiences and boost cultural tourism. Conservation efforts in Somnath and the development of the Kartarpur Corridor have also contributed to heritage accessibility and preservation.
To promote awareness of heritage sites, the ASI launched the “Must-See Monuments and Archaeological Sites of India” portal. This digital platform offers comprehensive details on around 100 prominent sites, including World Heritage and Tentative List properties, along with panoramic views, historical backgrounds, and access information.
Efforts in digitisation continue under the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA), which was established in 2007. The mission has documented over 12.3 lakh antiquities and more than 11,400 heritage sites. For the financial year 2024–25, ₹20 lakh was allocated to support this mission. In addition, the Indian Heritage in Digital Space (IHDS) initiative is leveraging immersive technologies to digitally preserve and present India’s cultural assets.
On the linguistic front, the Government of India granted classical language status to Assamese, Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, and Bengali on October 3, 2024. With this recognition, India now has 11 officially recognised classical languages, reinforcing the country’s dedication to preserving its ancient linguistic traditions.
India’s efforts also include the development of cultural institutions such as the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar, inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on January 16, 2025. Built at a cost of ₹298 crore, the museum spans 12,500 square metres and offers visitors an immersive view into Vadnagar’s 2,500-year-old history.
Another key addition is the new museum at Humayun’s Tomb in New Delhi. Inaugurated on July 29, 2024, the museum spans 100,000 square feet and presents an in-depth look at the site’s architectural and conservation history.
In a major literary achievement, three Indian texts—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahrdayāloka-Locana—were inscribed into the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) Regional Register on May 8, 2024. The inclusion of these works underlines India’s continued contribution to global literature and scholarship.

Title: Bose Institute team shares $3 million breakthrough prize for contributions to CERN’s ALICE
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:26:27 +0000
Content: Scientists from the Bose Institute’s Experimental High Energy Physics (HEP) group have been awarded the prestigious 2025 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. The recognition comes as part of their contribution to the ALICE collaboration at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.
The $3 million prize has been jointly awarded to over 13,500 researchers across four LHC experiments—ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb—for their collective work on data collected during LHC Run 2 (2015–2024). The ALICE collaboration, in which the Bose Institute has played a leading role from India, was allocated $500,000 of the total prize money. The funds will be used to support a Breakthrough Prize studentship programme, which will allow selected PhD students to pursue research at CERN for up to two years.
Bose Institute, Kolkata, an autonomous research institute under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, is the only such institution from the country involved in the ALICE experiment. The current HEP group at the institute comprises Prof. Supriya Das, Dr. Sidharth Kumar Prasad, Dr. Saikat Biswas, Dr. Sanchari Thakur, and senior research fellow Mintu Haldar. The group’s contributions span detector hardware development, simulation, data-taking, operations, and physics analysis.
The ALICE experiment is dedicated to studying quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang. Bose Institute joined the ALICE collaboration under the leadership of former director Prof. Sibaji Raha, who served as the Principal Investigator.
In a statement, Prof. Kaustuv Sanyal, Director of Bose Institute, congratulated the team, calling it a proud moment for the entire Indian high-energy physics community. “This is a great achievement not only for the Bose Institute team but also for the entire community of Indian high energy physicists working in mega-science projects such as ALICE at CERN. Such awards will encourage young minds to join this kind of complex and large experimental programs for exploration of new physics,” he said.
Among the notable contributions from the Bose Institute is the development and deployment of an indigenously built Photon Multiplicity Detector (PMD) based on a proportional counter. This detector played a key role in measuring inclusive photons at forward rapidity and was active in ALICE’s data-taking efforts from 2008 to 2018. Faculty members and students from the institute also led data clean-up, calibration, and quality assurance processes for the PMD dataset.
In addition, the institute participated in the upgrade of ALICE’s Time Projection Chamber (TPC), which now operates using Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) technology to handle high-luminosity environments. The upgraded read-out chambers, consisting of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils, offer low ion backflow, improved energy resolution, and long-term stability.
Faculty members and trainees from Bose Institute have also led six ALICE publications and contributed significantly to several others, marking their influence across various areas of the experiment’s physics programme.
Congratulating the entire ALICE team, spokesperson Prof. Marco Van Leeuwen said, “I would like to congratulate the entire collaboration and the LHC community for this well-deserved recognition of the scientific advancements achieved through our collective efforts.”

Title: Indian telescope uncovers elusive intermediate-mass black hole
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:37:12 +0000
Content: Indian astronomers have detected and measured the properties of an elusive intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) located in a faint galaxy about 4.3 million light-years away, offering new insights into the mysterious “middleweight” class of black holes.
The discovery was made using India’s largest optical telescope, the 3.6-metre Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), operated by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology (DST). The telescope enabled researchers to trace gas clouds orbiting the black hole at a distance of 125 light-minutes—roughly 2.25 billion kilometres—with a velocity dispersion of 545 kilometres per second.
The black hole, situated in the galaxy NGC 4395, has been found to weigh about 22,000 times the mass of the Sun. This precise measurement makes it one of the best-studied intermediate-mass black holes to date. These IMBHs, with masses between 100 and 100,000 times that of the Sun, are considered vital to understanding how black holes grow and evolve. However, due to their faint emissions and residence in relatively dim galaxies, they have remained difficult to detect.
NGC 4395 hosts one of the faintest actively feeding black holes ever observed. To study it, the research team, led by Shivangi Pandey, used not only the 3.6-metre DOT and its indigenously developed spectrograph and camera ADFOSC but also the smaller 1.3-metre Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT), also located at ARIES’s Devasthal Observatory.
Because the region surrounding a black hole is too small to be directly resolved by most telescopes, the team used a technique known as spectrophotometric reverberation mapping. This method measures the time lag between light emitted from the black hole’s accretion disk and the light echoed by surrounding gas clouds, allowing astronomers to estimate the region’s size and the black hole’s mass.
The study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, also confirms the size-luminosity relationship for black holes in low-luminosity active galaxies and offers a more accurate mass estimate than previous studies. The findings contribute a critical benchmark for future research on black hole growth and evolution.
Dr Suvendu Rakshit, a scientist at ARIES and co-author of the study, said that the search for intermediate-mass black holes is still ongoing. He said that upcoming observations using larger telescopes and more advanced instruments will be essential in identifying and understanding these cosmic objects.

Title: Fitch projects India’s GDP growth at 6.4% for FY26, retains 6.3% for FY27
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:16:55 +0000
Content: Fitch Ratings on Thursday revised India’s GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.4%, citing global economic uncertainties, while maintaining its projection of 6.3% for FY27.
The global ratings agency also lowered its estimates for FY25 and FY26 by 10 basis points to 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, attributing the downgrade to rising concerns over a potential global trade war.
Fitch retained its outlook for FY27 at 6.3%, reflecting expectations of relative stability in India’s economic performance over the medium term.
The agency also downgraded global growth projections for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points, while reducing forecasts for the US and China by 0.5 percentage points from its March outlook.
“It is difficult to predict US trade policy with any confidence. Massive policy uncertainty is hurting business investment prospects, equity price declines are reducing household wealth, and US exporters will be hit by retaliation,” Fitch noted in a special update to its quarterly Global Economic Outlook.
For 2025, US GDP growth is expected to remain positive at 1.2%, while China’s growth is projected to fall below 4% in both 2025 and 2026. The eurozone’s growth is forecast to stay well below 1% during the same period.
Despite global headwinds, Fitch believes that India’s large domestic market will shield it from the brunt of global trade disruptions, including the impact of US tariff hikes.
A recent report by Morgan Stanley echoed this sentiment, identifying India as the “best-placed country in Asia” amid global uncertainties triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. The report cited India’s low goods exports-to-GDP ratio and strong economic fundamentals as key insulating factors.
“While India is exposed to direct tariff risks, we believe it is less vulnerable to a global goods trade slowdown, considering it has the lowest goods exports-to-GDP ratio in the region,” the report stated.
India’s economy regained momentum in Q3 of FY25, expanding by 6.2%, after dipping to a near two-year low of 5.6% in the July-September quarter.

Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:05:59 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed sharply higher on Thursday, marking the fourth consecutive session of gains, driven by strong buying in banking stocks.
The Sensex, which marked its 150th anniversary on April 17, opened slightly lower at 76,968 and dipped to an early low of 76,666. However, it quickly rebounded and surged to an intra-day high of 78,617 — a remarkable recovery of 1,951 points. By the end of the trading session, the Sensex had gained 1,509 points, or 1.96%, to settle at 78,553.
The Nifty 50 index mirrored this strong performance. After hitting a low of 23,299 in early trade, it climbed to a high of 23,872 before closing at 23,852 — up 414 points or 1.8%.
Top gainers on the Nifty included Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, Sun Pharma, and Eternal. Meanwhile, stocks such as Wipro, Hero MotoCorp, Tech Mahindra, and JSW Steel faced profit booking and ended in the red.
All major sectors witnessed buying interest. Notably, telecom, PSU banks, oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, auto, energy, and private banks posted gains ranging between 1% and 2%.
The broader markets also remained positive, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rising by around 0.5% each.
Ruchit Jain, Vice President of Technical Research at Motilal Oswal, said the rally appears to be more than just a short-term bounce, as it is supported by broad-based participation across sectors, especially from large-cap and financial stocks.
“The Bank Nifty index is now trading close to its all-time high, reflecting strong sectoral support,” Jain added.
The Indian rupee also strengthened, closing 31 paise higher at 85.37 against the US dollar, compared to Wednesday’s close of 85.68.
Despite global concerns, market experts noted that domestic sentiment remained optimistic, bolstered by heavy buying in blue-chip stocks and expectations of economic stability.

Title: NASA rover finds fresh evidence of the warm and wet past of Mars
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A mineral called siderite found abundantly in rock drilled by a NASA rover on the surface of Mars is providing fresh evidence of the planet’s warmer and wetter ancient past when it boasted substantial bodies of water and potentially harbored life.
The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012 to explore whether Earth’s planetary neighbor was ever able to support microbial life, found the mineral in rock samples drilled at three locations in 2022 and 2023 inside Gale crater, a large impact basin with a mountain in the middle.
Siderite is an iron carbonate mineral. Its presence in sedimentary rocks formed billions of years ago offers evidence that Mars once had a dense atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that would have warmed the planet through the greenhouse effect to the point that it could sustain bodies of liquid water on its surface.
There are features on the Martian landscape that many scientists have interpreted as signs that liquid water once flowed across its surface, with potential oceans, lakes and rivers considered as possible habitats for past microbial life.
Carbon dioxide is the main climate-regulating greenhouse gas on Earth, as it is on Mars and Venus. Its presence in the atmosphere traps heat from the sun, warming the climate.
Until now, evidence indicating the Martian atmosphere previously was rich in carbon dioxide has been sparse. The hypothesis is that when the atmosphere – for reasons not fully understood – evolved from thick and rich in carbon dioxide to thin and starved of this gas, the carbon through geochemical processes became entombed in rocks in the planet’s crust as a carbonate mineral.
The samples obtained by Curiosity, which drills 1.2 to 1.6 inches (3-4 centimeters) down into rock to study its chemical and mineral composition, lend weight to this notion. The samples contained up to 10.5% siderite by weight, as determined by an instrument onboard the car-sized, six-wheeled rover.
“One of the longstanding mysteries in the study of Martian planetary evolution and habitability is: if large amounts of carbon dioxide were required to warm the planet and stabilize liquid water, why are there so few detections of carbonate minerals on the Martian surface?” said University of Calgary geochemist Benjamin Tutolo, a participating scientist on NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover team and lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science.
“Models predict that carbonate minerals should be widespread. But, to date, rover-based investigations and satellite-based orbital surveys of the Martian surface had found little evidence of their presence,” Tutolo added.
 
Because rock similar to that sampled by the rover has been identified globally on Mars, the researchers suspect it too contains an abundance of carbonate minerals and may hold a substantial portion of the carbon dioxide that once warmed Mars.
The Gale crater sedimentary rocks – sandstones and mudstones – are thought to have been deposited around 3.5 billion years ago, when this was the site of a lake and before the Martian climate underwent a dramatic change.
“The shift of Mars’ surface from more habitable in the past, to apparently sterile today, is the largest-known environmental catastrophe,” said planetary scientist and study co-author Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago and Astera Institute.
“We do not know the cause of this change, but Mars has a very thin carbon dioxide atmosphere today, and there is evidence that the atmosphere was thicker in the past. This puts a premium on understanding where the carbon went, so discovering a major unsuspected deposit of carbon-rich materials is an important new clue,” Kite added.
The rover’s findings offer insight into the carbon cycle on ancient Mars.
On Earth, volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and the gas is absorbed by surface waters – mainly the ocean – and combines with elements such as calcium to form limestone rock. Through the geological process called plate tectonics, this rock is reheated and the carbon is ultimately released again into the atmosphere through volcanism. Mars, however, lacks plate tectonics.
“The important feature of the ancient Martian carbon cycle that we outline in this study is that it was imbalanced. In other words, substantially more carbon dioxide seems to have been sequestered into the rocks than was subsequently released back into the atmosphere,” Tutolo said.
“Models of Martian climate evolution can now incorporate our new analyses, and in turn, help to refine the role of this imbalanced carbon cycle in maintaining, and ultimately losing, habitability over Mars’ planetary history,” Tutolo added.

Title: Pollution biggest challenge, says Delhi CM Rekha Gupta
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 06:33:51 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has reflected on the challenges of her high-profile assignment, stating that the “decay” in the city caused by the previous Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will take time to reverse.
Speaking to IANS, CM Gupta said: “There are challenges in every field. The previous governments have pushed the city into such a poor state that we need to work on all aspects, including broken roads, blocked sewers, and drains.”
Highlighting pollution as a priority area, she said: “The government is working overtime to implement a year-long plan to fight pollution. Until the results of these efforts begin to bring about a perceptible change, we will have to bear with the existing conditions in the city.”
She emphasized that there is no escaping the harsh reality that Delhi is suffering due to pollution.
“The previous governments never acted in the direction of addressing the pollution problem,” she said, while highlighting steps taken by the BJP government for dust mitigation and controlling vehicular emissions.
She added that to clean the city’s air, the government is also promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs).
“We want more and more people to use EVs,” she said.
Earlier on Thursday, CM Gupta attended a meeting at the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where he reviewed Yamuna cleaning efforts. She suggested the use of space technology and community engagement to rejuvenate the holy river and provide a memorable experience for Chhath devotees.
Criticizing AAP leaders for what she called a “politics of falsehood,” the Chief Minister said: “They are good storytellers and are trying to build a false narrative around power cuts.”
She said there are no public complaints about power outages and that the situation is completely under control, dismissing as a “gimmick” the candlelight dinner photos posted on social media by AAP leaders to exaggerate claims of rampant power cuts in the city under the Bharatiya Janata Party government.

Title: Kuwait backs India for UN Security Council seat
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 06:03:27 +0000
Content: Kuwait’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Co-Chair of the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN), Tareq Albanai, has expressed support for India’s bid for permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). He referred to India as a “main player on the world stage” and emphasized that India would be a strong contender if the Council were to be expanded.
Addressing a press briefing on the status of the UN General Assembly’s Intergovernmental Negotiations on Security Council reform on Thursday, Albanai recalled his visit to India with fellow Co-Chair Alex Marschik. Kuwait and Austria currently co-chair the Intergovernmental Negotiations on UNSC reform.
When asked what must be ensured for UNSC reform to take place, Albanai said, “I had the pleasure last year, along with my distinguished co-chair Axel Marschik, to visit India and engage in high-level discussions. The goal of a reformed council must be to ensure representativeness. India is undoubtedly a major player on the global stage today. But we must also consider the views of all 193 member states.”
He added, “If the decision is made to expand the Council to anywhere between 21 to 27 members, India will surely be a strong contender. However, this will ultimately be subject to the consensus of the wider UN membership.”
Earlier, on April 1, the French Embassy in India reiterated its support for India’s permanent seat on the UNSC. As France assumed the monthly presidency of the Council, it pledged to prioritize discussions on global peace, security, and humanitarian concerns, while also advocating for UNSC reform.
In a post on X, the Embassy said: “Today, France assumes the monthly presidency of @UN Security Council. It will steer key discussions on global peace and security with a focus on humanitarian impacts. To reflect today’s world, France reiterates the need for a #UNSC reform that also gives India a permanent seat.”
India has long sought a permanent seat on the Security Council to better represent the interests of the developing world. This ambition has been gaining support from several influential nations in recent years.
The United Nations Security Council currently comprises 15 member states: five permanent members with veto power (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the UN General Assembly.

Title: US citizen attempts to hijack plane in Belize, shot dead by passenger
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 05:52:09 +0000
Content: A knife-wielding US citizen attempted to hijack a small Tropic Air plane in Belize on Thursday, injuring three people before being shot dead by a fellow passenger, the New York Post reported, citing officials.
The incident occurred mid-air on a flight bound for San Pedro, when the 49-year-old suspect began attacking passengers with a knife.
The assailant was later identified as Akinyela Sawa Taylor, a US citizen, according to Belize Commissioner of Police Chester Williams.
Commissioner Williams praised the passenger who intervened and shot Taylor, calling them a “hero,” as reported by the New York Post.
Authorities said that it remains unclear how Taylor managed to bring a knife onto the plane.
Belizean officials have contacted the US Embassy for assistance in the ongoing investigation.

Title: May the spirit of peace and togetherness always prevail: PM Modi on Good Friday
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 04:27:17 +0000
Content: On Good Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remembered the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and urged people to embrace kindness and compassion, praying that the spirit of peace and togetherness always prevails. 
Taking to social media, PM Modi shared a heartfelt message, acknowledging the spiritual significance of the day
“On Good Friday, we remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This day inspires us to cherish kindness and compassion and always be large-hearted. May the spirit of peace and togetherness always prevail,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
Good Friday, also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, or Black Friday, commemorates the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ at Calvary.
It is observed by Christians across the globe as a day of mourning, reflection, and prayer. The day falls on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday and holds deep religious and emotional importance, symbolising Jesus Christ’s suffering, sacrifice, and ultimate act of redemption for humanity.
Union Minister Kiren Rijiju also remembered the profound sacrifice of Christ and reflected on the values Jesus stood for. In a post on X, he said, “On this solemn day, I join everyone in remembering the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. His life is a timeless call to serve with humility and embrace compassion in our everyday actions.”
Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X, “May this Good Friday fill every heart with compassion, kindness, and love, and bring peace to all.”
According to the New Testament, Good Friday marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by Roman authorities under the governance of Pontius Pilate. Jesus was accused of blasphemy by the Jewish religious leaders for claiming to be the Son of God and was eventually sentenced to death by crucifixion.

Title: United States eases port fees on China-built ships after industry backlash
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 03:22:12 +0000
Content: The Trump administration shielded on Thursday domestic exporters and vessel owners servicing the Great Lakes, the Caribbean and U.S. territories from port fees to be levied on China-built vessels, aiming to revive U.S. shipbuilding and counter China’s maritime dominance.
The Federal Register notice posted by the U.S. Trade Representative was watered down from a February proposal for fees on China-built ships of up to $1.5 million per port call that sent a chill through the global shipping industry.
Ocean shipping executives feared virtually every carrier could face stacking fees that made U.S. export prices unattractive and foisted annual import costs of $30 billion on American consumers.
“Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement.
“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships.”
Still, the fees on Chinese-built ships add another irritant to swiftly rising trade tension between the world’s two largest economies as President Donald Trump seeks to draw China into talks on his new tariffs of 145% on many of its goods.
The revisions tackle major concerns voiced in a tsunami of opposition from the global maritime industry, including domestic port and vessel operators as well as U.S. shippers of everything from coal and corn to bananas and concrete.
They grant some requested carve-outs, while phasing in fees that reflect the fact U.S. shipbuilders, which turn out about five vessels annually, will need several years to compete with China’s output of more than 1,700 a year.
As a result, companies such as U.S.-based carriers Matson and Seaboard Marine would dodge the fees. Also exempt are empty ships arriving at U.S. ports to load up with exports such as wheat and soybeans.
The agency, which will implement the levies in 180 days, also declined to impose fees based on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in a fleet or on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as originally proposed.
The fees will be applied once each voyage on affected ships a maximum of six times a year.
Executives of global container ship operators, such as MSC and Maersk, which visit multiple ports during each sailing to the United States, warned the fees would quickly pile up.
Instead of a flat individual fee on large vessels, the USTR instead opted to levy fees based on net tonnage or each container unloaded.
From October 14, Chinese-built and owned ships will be charged $50 a net ton, a rate that will increase by $30 a year over the next three years.
That will apply if the fee is higher than an alternative calculation method that charges $120 for each container discharged, rising to $250 after three years.
Chinese-built ships owned by non-Chinese firms will be charged $18 a net ton, with annual fee increases of $5 over the same period.
It was not immediately clear how high the maximum fees would run for large container vessels, but the new rules give non-Chinese shipping companies a clear edge over operators such as China’s COSCO.
The notice comes on the one-year anniversary of the launch of the USTR’s investigation into China’s maritime activities under former President Joe Biden.
In January, the agency concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate global shipping.
The actions by both the Biden and Trump administrations reflect rare bipartisan consensus on the need to revive U.S. shipbuilding and strengthen naval readiness.
At a May 19 hearing, the USTR will discuss proposed tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, chassis that carry containers and chassis parts. China dominates the manufacture of port cranes, which the USTR plans to hit with a tariff of 100%.
The Federal Register did not say if the funds raised by the fees and proposed crane and container tariffs would be dedicated to fund a revival of U.S. shipbuilding.

Title: Dawoodi Bohra delegation meets PM Modi, expresses gratitude for Waqf Amendment Act
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:38:03 +0000
Content: A delegation from the Dawoodi Bohra community met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to express their gratitude for the recently enacted Waqf Amendment Act.
 
During the meeting, the community members extended their full support to the new legislation, describing it as a long-standing demand that has finally been fulfilled. They also reiterated their faith in Prime Minister Modi’s vision of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, and voiced optimism that the reforms brought in through the amended Waqf law would help address past shortcomings and improve the conditions of the Muslim community at large.
 
The Bohra community’s support for the amended legislation comes at a time when several Muslim organizations, clerics, and ulemas have opposed the law, calling it an infringement on religious rights. Some of these groups have also approached the Supreme Court, challenging its constitutional validity.
 
Union Minister for Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju was also present at the meeting. He later shared photos from the event on X.
 
“The Dawoodi Bohra community met PM Modi to express their heartfelt gratitude for the Waqf Amendment Act, fulfilling a long-pending demand,” Rijiju said. “Their trust in PM Modi’s vision of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas was deeply moving,” he added.
 
The Dawoodi Bohras are a sect within the Shia Ismaili branch of Islam, with a significant population in India and in over 40 countries worldwide. Last year, the community had submitted a representation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, seeking exemption from the purview of the Waqf Board. They argued that the proposed legislation did not take into account their distinct status within the broader Muslim community.

Title: India’s economic fundamentals strong, growth outlook bright: industry leaders
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 15:31:23 +0000
Content: India’s economic growth story is set to gain further momentum, underpinned by strong fundamentals, robust policymaking, and a skilled workforce, according to top industry leaders.
On the sidelines of the 120th anniversary celebrations of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), the leaders voiced confidence in the country’s economic trajectory under the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.
Raghupati Singhania, Chairman and Managing Director of JK Tyre & Industries Limited, said, “So far, so good—and I’m confident the momentum will continue. Our economic fundamentals are sound and stable.”
He noted the government’s commitment to strengthening international relations. “The government is actively working to forge strong bilateral ties and explore opportunities for global collaboration,” Singhania added.
PHDCCI President Hemant Jain echoed similar sentiments, stating that India currently holds a “sweet spot” in the global economic landscape.
“Inflation is under control, markets are performing well, and we have one of the most stable governments in the region. India has become a focal point of global attention,” he said.
Jain also emphasized the importance of strong diplomatic relationships, particularly between Prime Minister Modi and global leaders, including those in the United States, in driving forward trade relations.
He expressed confidence that India will continue to benefit from evolving global trade patterns. “India already possesses the talent and knowledge base to emerge as a global leader in AI. The key is to channel this potential into creating platforms and assuming leadership in the tech space,” he added.
Suman Jyoti Khaitan, Founder and Managing Partner of Khaitan & Co, underscored that India’s continued growth is anchored in solid economic fundamentals and supportive policies.
“India is witnessing significant improvements in infrastructure, guided by focused policymaking and powered by entrepreneurial energy. We are well-positioned to reap the benefits of global economic shifts,” Khaitan said.
He also praised the government’s initiatives on skill development and internship programs. “These efforts will help close the gap between academic learning and industry requirements, ultimately creating a stronger, job-ready workforce,” he said.

Title: SC allows West Bengal govt to retain ‘untainted’ teachers for now
Publication Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:57:55 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted “untainted” assistant teachers in West Bengal—whose appointments were cancelled due to widespread irregularities in the 2016 recruitment process—to continue in their roles until the completion of a fresh selection process.
Emphasising that students must not suffer as a result of the administrative lapses, a bench led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna extended temporary relief exclusively to Class 9 to 12 teachers whose names have not been linked to any wrongdoing.
The bench directed the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) to issue fresh recruitment advertisements by May 31, and to conclude the entire process by December 31, 2025.
However, the top court made it clear that the relief will not apply to Group C and Group D employees. It also warned that if there is any delay in the recruitment timeline, the interim relief granted to the assistant teachers would be withdrawn.
Last week, the Supreme Court upheld a Calcutta High Court order that had cancelled 25,753 appointments to teaching and non-teaching posts made by the WBSSC in 2016, citing large-scale irregularities.
In April last year, the Calcutta High Court had scrapped these appointments, directing the candidates hired from expired panels to return the full salary earned during their tenure, with 12 per cent annual interest.
However, the apex court recently set aside the part of the High Court’s order that had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the creation of supernumerary posts in state-run schools—positions suspected to have enabled the illegal recruitment of ineligible candidates.
The Supreme Court clarified that while the CBI cannot examine the legitimacy of the creation of these posts, it is not barred from investigating other elements of the ongoing school jobs scam, as outlined in the High Court’s ruling.

Title: US will abandon Ukraine peace push if no progress ‘within a matter of days,’ Rubio says
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:55:49 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump will walk away from trying to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs that a deal can be done, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday.
 
“We’re not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end. So we need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks,” Rubio said in Paris after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders.
 
“If it’s not possible, if we’re so far apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president is probably at a point where he’s going to say, ‘well, we’re done’.”
 
There was no immediate comment from Paris, London, Berlin or Kyiv on Rubio’s statement. Three European diplomatic sources told Reuters Rubio’s comments reflected growing frustration in the White House over Russian intransigence to end the war.
 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said some progress on a peace settlement had already been made but that contacts with Washington were difficult. He said Russia was striving to resolve the conflict while ensuring its own interests. Moscow remained open to dialogue with the United States, he added.
 
Rubio’s threats came amid signs of some progress in U.S. talks with Ukraine.
 
Trump said on Thursday he expected to sign a minerals deal with Kyiv next week after an attempt in February fell apart following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Oval Office clash with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
 
The talks in Paris on Thursday were the first substantive, high level and in-person talks on Trump’s peace push that have included European powers. Rubio said a U.S. peace framework he presented received an “encouraging reception.” Zelenskiy’s office called the talks constructive and positive.
 
GROWING FRUSTRATIONS AS PEACE DEALS PROVE ELUSIVE
 
It was unclear why Rubio’s tone shifted so dramatically overnight. Still, his comments on Friday underline mounting frustrations in the White House over a lack of progress in pushes to settle a growing list of geopolitical challenges.
 
Trump promised during his election campaign to end the war in Ukraine within his first 24 hours in the White House. He moderated that claim on taking office, suggesting a deal by April or May as obstacles mounted.
 
He has pressured both sides to come to the negotiating table, threatening tougher sanctions on Russia or an end to billions of dollars in U.S. military support for Kyiv.
 
Both Ukraine and Russia showed up for U.S.-brokered talks in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in a partial ceasefire, but nothing more. Meanwhile, the war has continued, including a recent Russian missile attack that hit Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, killing 35 people – an attack Trump called a “mistake”.
 
If Washington walks away, efforts to broker a peace would likely founder because no other nation is able to bring similar pressure on both Moscow and Kyiv.
 
Other impacts are unclear. The United States could keep its current policy on the conflict unchanged, maintaining sanctions on Russia and keeping U.S. aid flowing to Kyiv. Alternatively, Trump could decide to halt payments to Ukraine.
 
Rubio said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the “constructive” Paris talks and briefed him on “some of the elements of” the U.S. peace framework.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. Kyiv says those demands are tantamount to demanding its capitulation.
 
DROPPING EUROPEAN SANCTIONS PART OF PEACE DEAL?
 
Rubio said the Europeans had a central role to play in any peace pact, especially as their Russia sanctions over which Washington has no control would likely need to be lifted to secure an accord.
 
Rubio said the issue of U.S. security guarantees came up in the Paris talks, saying they were an issue “we can fix in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.” But, he cautioned, “we have bigger challenges that we need to figure out.”
 
He said it was clear that a peace deal would be difficult to strike but there needed to be signs it could be done soon.
 
“There’s no one saying this can be done in 12 hours. But we want to see how far apart it is,” he said. “We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on.”

Title: Article 142: The Supreme Power or Judicial Overreach?
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:19:53 +0000
Content: When the Indian Constitution was drafted, it gave the Supreme Court an extraordinary tool—Article 142—to ensure “complete justice” in any matter before it. But in recent times, this clause has moved from a safety valve to a superpower, raising concerns about judicial overreach and constitutional balance.
From the Tamil Nadu Governor vs State Government standoff to the collegium appointment deadlocks, Article 142 is now at the center of a serious constitutional debate.
What is Article 142?
At its core, Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to:
“pass any decree or make any order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.”
Originally envisioned as an extraordinary remedy, it was meant to fill gaps where laws were silent, or justice would otherwise be denied. But today, it’s being used in routine governance disputes, often against elected governments and executive offices.
The Tamil Nadu Bill Controversy
In 2024, the Tamil Nadu government passed 11 bills which the Governor withheld or delayed assent to—violating the spirit of Article 200 of the Constitution.
Rather than let the matter escalate to the President or trigger constitutional mechanisms, the Supreme Court stepped in under Article 142 and “deemed the bills passed.”
Why does this matter?
– The Governor is the President’s appointee.
– Bypassing the Governor indirectly pressurizes the President, sidestepping the Union’s constitutional role.
– It sets a precedent: the Court can override delays or objections by elected or appointed executive authorities.
This wasn’t a judicial review—it was judicial enforcement, almost legislative in nature.
Judiciary vs President: A Shadow Tussle
Though the case didn’t name the President, the implications are clear. If a Governor chooses to withhold a bill and send it to the President for advice, Article 142 can now short-circuit that process.
It leads to a serious constitutional question:
Can the Supreme Court enforce its version of justice over the Union’s decision-making authority?
The answer remains murky—but the implications are alarming.
The Collegium Conflict: Another 142 Stretch
In the 2015 NJAC judgment, the Supreme Court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission, reinstating the collegium system. When the Centre delayed appointments, the Court threatened to invoke Article 142 to enforce its judicial selections.
By 2023, the SC was openly saying:
“We may be compelled to use Article 142 if appointments are not acted upon.”
This undermines the President’s role as the constitutional appointer of judges under Article 124. What’s left is a rubber-stamp presidency, where judiciary proposes and enforces, leaving no room for executive consultation.
Can the Union Government Push Back?
Yes—but the tools are limited and slower:
– Article 131: Used for Centre vs State constitutional disputes.
– Articles 256 & 257: Direct state governments to comply with Union laws.
– Attorney General: Can file for compliance or contempt.
But these take time, while Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to act immediately, often without accountability.
Federalism at Risk?
India’s democracy rests on a balance—Centre, States, Judiciary, and the President all play defined roles. But if Article 142 becomes the norm, the judiciary starts to dominate:
– Interpreting laws
– Enforcing its own judgments
– Bypassing executive and legislative will
This transforms the Supreme Court from an interpreter of the Constitution into a de facto super-government.
Conclusion: Justice or Supremacy?
Article 142 is meant to be a fire alarm—used only in exceptional emergencies. But if it’s pulled every time there’s a disagreement between the judiciary and executive, it ceases to be exceptional.
As a citizen and observer of constitutional democracy, I ask:
“What happens to the President’s authority when every judicial blow lands indirectly on their shoulders?”
This is not just about legal turf wars—it’s about preserving the structure of our Republic.

Title: With the End of ‘Waqf by User’, A Historic Wrong is Being Corrected
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:58:09 +0000
Content: The Waqf Amendment Act (2025) made its way to the apex court, as several petitions challenge the constitutionality of the new law. After 12 years, the Waqf framework has undergone significant legal changes, with the last set of amendments introduced in 2013 to the principal act of 1995. Before 1995, the Nehru government introduced the Waqf Act of 1954, thus repealing every single law that was made during British rule. 
The Supreme Court, in its observations, was fixated on the ‘Waqf by User’. A classic case of missing the forest for the trees, perhaps. Even the legal team, representing the Waqf side, was overtly keen on debating the ‘Waqf by User’ clause. Ironically, the legal team of the Waqf side included a sitting Rajya Sabha parliamentarian. Should the ‘Waqf by User’ properties remain, or should they be confiscated altogether is the million-dollar question everyone is asking. 
Before making sense of the observations and objectives of the apex court and the government, it is important to understand the legal framework in which ‘Waqf by User’ thrived. Put simply, ‘Waqf by User’ means ‘verbal declarations. Land parcels or properties that were assumed to be used for religious purposes and charitable purposes could be proclaimed as Waqf properties. No documentation, no deed, and no paperwork were necessary. The ’assumption’ part, while being subjective, was also ambiguous in its interpretation, thus opening Pandora’s box for land disputes. 
Seven years after the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1954, the Nehru Government introduced the Waqf Act, which included the theological concept of ‘Waqf by User’. Hindus and Sikhs, amongst hundreds of other minority communities, had given up their lands in a bloodied partition for Pakistan, where Muslims could live as per their customs. Yet, India’s first Prime Minister desired a law that would create another social partition within India based on real estate. 
Over the next forty years, scattered deliberations around the Waqf Act continued. The government attempted another set of amendments in 1984, but it took another decade for the formulation of the 1995 Act. Introduced under the PV Narasimha Rao government, the new act included the contentious Section 40. 
Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995, empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally determine if a property was Waqf property, granting them significant authority to collect information and conduct inquiries without judicial oversight. This provision allowed the Board to declare properties, including those registered under other laws like the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, as Waqf after inquiry, with decisions final unless modified by a Waqf Tribunal. Further, the decision of the tribunal was also declared final in the 1995 Act, leaving the victims without any legal escape route. 
This legal thrust empowered the Waqf ecosystem. Combining the concept of ‘Waqf by User’ and Section 40, the Waqf Boards across states could now claim land parcels easily. The Modi Government, through the 2025 amendments, omitted Section 40 altogether. Even the legal team representing the petitioners did not challenge the omission of Section 40. 
In 2013, the law was further tweaked to give more thrust to the Waqf ecosystem. The definition of those making a dedication to the Waqf was changed to include all non-Muslims. The definition of encroachers was also changed to include government properties. This is where the Waqf Boards started becoming a nightmare for the government and Hindus, amongst other minority communities (Jain, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, Christians, etc). 
In the final months of the Congress government, when the communal violence bill and the minority sub-quota for Muslims were attempted, without success, the Waqf ecosystem was awarded three critical lifelines. These were covered in Sections 104, 107, and 108. 
Under a clause in Section 104, the government had to vacate a property in six months if the Waqf ordered it to do so. If vacating was not an option, the government was required to give the relevant Waqf board a rent as per the market value of the land or property parcel, along with compensation, if needed. 
Under Section 107, the Limitation Act of 1963 did not apply to the claims of the Waqf. While ordinary citizens could file a legal suit for their illegally occupied property only until twelve years after the takeover, the Waqf was not bound by any such time limit. Today, when Kapil Sibal, representing the Waqf side, asks how deeds for a 3000-year-old property will be produced, the non-applicability of the Limitation Act must be recalled. While the clause was introduced in the 1995 Act, no changes were made in 2013. 
Under a clause in Section 108, the Waqf law was the overriding law in case of a legal dispute. Therefore, other prevailing laws relating to land transfers, property transactions, and so forth were going to be superseded by the Waqf law if a case went to the court. On one hand, people were being left at the mercy of the tribunals, skewed towards one side, and on the other, their legal options were being restricted. 
The 2025 amendments do away with Sections 104 and 108 in their entirety. Further, Section 107 has been altered to ensure the applicability of the Limitation Act of 1963. Section 40 is also gone. The definition of those who can make a dedication to the Waqf is now changed to those who have been practising Islam for five years, which is similar to the definition in the Act of 1954. But the most important change has been made to the ‘Waqf by User’ clause. 
The Waqf Amendment Act 2025 secures government properties, even retrospectively, from the Waqf boards. Irrespective of how they were claimed, no government property can be claimed as a Waqf property anymore. This addresses the 2013 change in the definition of encroachers. On ‘Waqf by User’, the law is clear. Properties registered before or on the date of the commencement of the act will continue to remain as Waqf properties. In their exuberance, many observers and commentators have underestimated the insertion of the word ‘registered’ in both the act and the apex court’s observation. 
Of the 8.72 Lakh Waqf properties, over 4 Lakh properties have been classified under ‘Waqf by User’. In terms of area, the ‘Waqf by User’ properties encompass over 22 Lakh acres of the total 37 Lakh acres. However, because ‘Waqf by User’ means verbal declarations, most of these 4 Lakh properties were without paperwork or deeds, which means no possible registration or gazetted notification. The lack of registration was confirmed by the legal team representing the petitioners. 
The 2025 Act is crystal clear. If not registered, the claimed properties will not be accepted as Waqf properties. This does address, retrospectively, a lot of claims that were made by the Waqf without any deed in place, like the village in Tamil Nadu or an office building in Gujarat. 
In the Lok Sabha, Home Minister Amit Shah stressed how the Waqf properties increased by 21 Lakh acres in the last ten years. This was due to the misuse of ‘Waqf by User’, Sections 40, 104, 107, and 108. All these sections have been addressed in the amendments of 2025. Further, Hindus and non-Muslims are now excluded from the dedication process as well. 
The Supreme Court’s observations also stress registered properties. As per the apex court, ‘Waqf by User’ properties that are registered or notified (via gazette) will be under status quo while the hearings go on. This is no different from what the government has already dictated in the new Act. No verbal claims, current or retrospective, are being accepted by the government or the apex court. This gives the government a comfortable edge over the petitioners in the apex court. 
Contrary to popular belief, the Waqf Amendment Act is not solving or creating a religious problem, but improving the real estate situation in this country, which will have economic consequences. The dilution of the power of the Waqf boards, given a free run under the previous governments, was necessary while respecting their cultural sensitivities, and that is precisely what the government has been able to achieve. All historical mistakes are now undone.

Title: PM Modi holds talks with Elon Musk on strengthening India-US ties in technology and innovation
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:50:58 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a telephonic conversation with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on a range of topics, including the immense potential for collaboration in technology and innovation.
“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
The Prime Minister had previously met Musk during his visit to Washington in February this year.
“Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington DC. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance,’” PM Modi had said on X after that meeting.
In another post, the Prime Minister shared candid moments with Musk’s children, captioning it, “It was also a delight to meet Mr. Elon Musk’s family and to talk about a wide range of subjects!”
PM Modi’s latest conversation with Musk comes at a time when Tesla is reportedly poised to enter the Indian market. The development also coincides with ongoing negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement between India and the US.
On Wednesday, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal also met with top executives from Elon Musk’s Starlink in Delhi to discuss the company’s investment plans in India.
“Met a delegation from Starlink, comprising Vice President Chad Gibbs and Senior Director Ryan Goodnight. Discussions covered Starlink’s cutting-edge technology platform, their existing partnerships, and future investment plans in India,” Goyal said on X.
This meeting comes amid reports that domestic telecom majors such as Airtel are in discussions with US companies for the possible launch of satellite telecom services in India. Vodafone Idea has also indicated that it is in talks with Starlink to provide satellite communication services in the country.
Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has emphasized the need for satellite internet in India, particularly in rural and remote areas.
He noted that many corners of the country are difficult to reach with fiber or mobile connectivity, and satellite internet could help ensure 100 percent coverage. Stressing that these services are complementary—not competitive—Scindia reiterated India’s commitment to offering terrestrial, fiber, and satellite communication to consumers.
He also pointed out that satellite communication can play a crucial role in emergencies when natural disasters damage telecom towers and fiber networks.
Starlink, owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is still awaiting a regulatory license to begin operations in India, pending the government’s new rules on spectrum pricing.
Scindia has stated that any company can apply for a license, provided it complies with Indian regulations.
Starlink is a satellite internet service that aims to deliver high-speed connectivity worldwide. SpaceX, the parent company, is the first private firm to have delivered astronauts to and from the International Space Station and has also completed an all-civilian mission to orbit.

Title: World Heritage Day 2025: India champions timeless treasures amid threats
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:14:12 +0000
Content: As the world celebrates World Heritage Day today, the spotlight shines on preserving humanity’s cultural and natural legacy under the 2025 theme, “Heritage under Threat from Disasters and Conflicts: Preparedness and Learning from 60 years of ICOMOS Actions.” This annual event, marked every April 18, underscores the urgency of safeguarding irreplaceable treasures like India’s 43 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, from the majestic Taj Mahal to the ancient Ajanta and Ellora Caves. Initiated in 1982 by the International Council on Monuments and Sites and adopted by UNESCO in 1983, World Heritage Day—also known as the International Day for Monuments and Sites —celebrates the shared consciousness of humanity embedded in historic sites, folk songs, and ancient scripts. This year’s theme highlights the need to protect heritage from natural disasters and conflicts, drawing on six decades of ICOMOS expertise to guide global efforts.
The World Heritage Convention: A Global Commitment
At the heart of these efforts lies the World Heritage Convention, established by UNESCO in 1972 to identify and protect sites of universal value. As of October 2024, the World Heritage List boasts 1,223 sites across 196 countries, including 952 cultural, 231 natural, and 40 mixed properties. India, a signatory since 1977, proudly contributes 43 sites, with recent additions like Moidams: The Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty in Assam, inscribed in July 2024. Prime Minister Narendra Modi aptly noted, “Heritage is not only history. Rather a shared consciousness of humanity.” India’s journey began in 1983 with the listing of Agra Fort, Taj Mahal, Ajanta Caves, and Ellora Caves. With 62 more sites on UNESCO’s Tentative List, the nation continues to champion preservation as a bridge between past and future.
India’s Robust Heritage Initiatives
India’s commitment to its cultural and natural legacy is evident in a slew of innovative initiatives led by the Ministry of Culture and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Since 2014, the government has retrieved 642 antiquities from foreign countries, part of a total 655 recovered since 1976. The Adopt a Heritage 2.0 program, revamped in 2023, has seen 21 MoUs signed with organizations to enhance facilities at protected monuments using CSR funds. In July 2024, India hosted the 46th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Delhi, attended by 2,900 delegates from over 140 countries. The event, inaugurated by PM Modi, reinforced India’s global leadership in heritage conservation. Meanwhile, the ASI oversees 3,697 monuments of national importance, ensuring accessibility with amenities like pathways, signages, and facilities for differently-abled visitors. Revival projects like the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, Mahakaal Lok, and Ma Kamakhya Corridor enhance pilgrim experiences, while the Chardham Road Project improves connectivity to sacred sites. The Must See Portal (asimustsee.nic.in) showcases nearly 100 prominent sites, offering history, access details, and panoramic views to global visitors.
Digitizing and Celebrating Heritage
The National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA), launched in 2007, has digitized over 12.3 lakh antiquities and 11,406 heritage sites, with ₹20 lakh allocated for 2024–25. The Indian Heritage in Digital Space (IHDS) initiative leverages immersive technology to preserve and present India’s legacy. On October 3, 2024, Assamese, Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, and Bengali were granted classical language status, bringing the total to 11 and affirming India’s linguistic heritage. India’s literary heritage also shone globally when Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahrdayāloka-Locana were inscribed on the MOWCAP Regional Register in May 2024, cementing their universal significance.
Historic moment for Bharat’s civilisational heritage
The Shrimad Bhagavad Gita & Bharat Muni’s Natyashastra are now inscribed in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register. The inclusion of the Gita and Natyashastra in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register is a global recognition of our timeless wisdom and rich culture. With this, we now 14 inscriptions from our country on this international register.
A Shared Responsibility
World Heritage Day 2025 reminds us that preserving heritage is a collective duty. From ancient monuments to timeless literature, India’s efforts—through national initiatives and global collaboration—ensure these treasures continue to inspire and educate. As threats loom, the nation’s proactive measures, from digitization to disaster preparedness, safeguard the stories of who we were for generations yet to come.

Title: Focus on protecting rights of own minorities: India slams Bangladesh on Bengal violence comment
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:05:48 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday firmly rejected Bangladesh’s remarks regarding the recent violence in West Bengal, calling them unwarranted and misleading.
The comments from Dhaka followed protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, during which Bangladesh urged Indian authorities to ensure the safety of the minority Muslim population in the state.
In a strong rebuttal, the MEA advised Bangladesh to focus on its own human rights situation rather than commenting on India’s internal affairs.
Responding to media queries about statements made by Bangladeshi officials, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We reject the remarks made by the Bangladesh side with regard to the incidents in West Bengal. This is a barely disguised and disingenuous attempt to draw a parallel with India’s concerns over the ongoing persecution of minorities in Bangladesh, where the criminal perpetrators of such acts continue to roam free.”
“Instead of making unwarranted comments and indulging in virtue signalling, Bangladesh would do better to focus on protecting the rights of its minorities,” the statement added.
The statement comes amid heightened political tensions in West Bengal, where protests erupted against the new legislation.
The unrest led to isolated incidents of violence, prompting a political war of words and drawing international attention.
Bangladesh’s call for the protection of minorities in India was met with criticism from Indian authorities, who described the move as an attempt to deflect from ongoing human rights issues in Bangladesh itself, particularly those involving religious minorities.

Title: NASA rover finds fresh evidence of the warm and wet past of Mars
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:08:36 +0000
Content: A mineral called siderite found abundantly in rock drilled by a NASA rover on the surface of Mars is providing fresh evidence of the planet’s warmer and wetter ancient past when it boasted substantial bodies of water and potentially harbored life.
The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012 to explore whether Earth’s planetary neighbor was ever able to support microbial life, found the mineral in rock samples drilled at three locations in 2022 and 2023 inside Gale crater, a large impact basin with a mountain in the middle.
Siderite is an iron carbonate mineral. Its presence in sedimentary rocks formed billions of years ago offers evidence that Mars once had a dense atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that would have warmed the planet through the greenhouse effect to the point that it could sustain bodies of liquid water on its surface.
There are features on the Martian landscape that many scientists have interpreted as signs that liquid water once flowed across its surface, with potential oceans, lakes and rivers considered as possible habitats for past microbial life.
Carbon dioxide is the main climate-regulating greenhouse gas on Earth, as it is on Mars and Venus. Its presence in the atmosphere traps heat from the sun, warming the climate.
Until now, evidence indicating the Martian atmosphere previously was rich in carbon dioxide has been sparse. The hypothesis is that when the atmosphere – for reasons not fully understood – evolved from thick and rich in carbon dioxide to thin and starved of this gas, the carbon through geochemical processes became entombed in rocks in the planet’s crust as a carbonate mineral.
The samples obtained by Curiosity, which drills 1.2 to 1.6 inches (3-4 centimeters) down into rock to study its chemical and mineral composition, lend weight to this notion. The samples contained up to 10.5% siderite by weight, as determined by an instrument onboard the car-sized, six-wheeled rover.
“One of the longstanding mysteries in the study of Martian planetary evolution and habitability is: if large amounts of carbon dioxide were required to warm the planet and stabilize liquid water, why are there so few detections of carbonate minerals on the Martian surface?” said University of Calgary geochemist Benjamin Tutolo, a participating scientist on NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover team and lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science.
“Models predict that carbonate minerals should be widespread. But, to date, rover-based investigations and satellite-based orbital surveys of the Martian surface had found little evidence of their presence,” Tutolo added.
 
Because rock similar to that sampled by the rover has been identified globally on Mars, the researchers suspect it too contains an abundance of carbonate minerals and may hold a substantial portion of the carbon dioxide that once warmed Mars.
The Gale crater sedimentary rocks – sandstones and mudstones – are thought to have been deposited around 3.5 billion years ago, when this was the site of a lake and before the Martian climate underwent a dramatic change.
“The shift of Mars’ surface from more habitable in the past, to apparently sterile today, is the largest-known environmental catastrophe,” said planetary scientist and study co-author Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago and Astera Institute.
“We do not know the cause of this change, but Mars has a very thin carbon dioxide atmosphere today, and there is evidence that the atmosphere was thicker in the past. This puts a premium on understanding where the carbon went, so discovering a major unsuspected deposit of carbon-rich materials is an important new clue,” Kite added.
The rover’s findings offer insight into the carbon cycle on ancient Mars.
On Earth, volcanoes spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and the gas is absorbed by surface waters – mainly the ocean – and combines with elements such as calcium to form limestone rock. Through the geological process called plate tectonics, this rock is reheated and the carbon is ultimately released again into the atmosphere through volcanism. Mars, however, lacks plate tectonics.
“The important feature of the ancient Martian carbon cycle that we outline in this study is that it was imbalanced. In other words, substantially more carbon dioxide seems to have been sequestered into the rocks than was subsequently released back into the atmosphere,” Tutolo said.
“Models of Martian climate evolution can now incorporate our new analyses, and in turn, help to refine the role of this imbalanced carbon cycle in maintaining, and ultimately losing, habitability over Mars’ planetary history,” Tutolo added.

Title: Iran says nuclear deal is possible if Washington is realistic
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:30:40 +0000
Content: Iran believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the United States is possible as long as Washington is realistic, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday on the eve of a second round of talks with the Trump administration.
 
“If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow after talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia.
 
Iran had noted the United States’ seriousness during a first round of talks on the deal, which took place in Oman last week, Araqchi said. The second round is set for Saturday in Rome and will be held through Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said.
 
“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various U.S. officials over the past few days, we expect the U.S. side to first provide an explanation in this regard and to remove the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions and seriousness,” Baghaei told state media without elaborating.
 
Iran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed water-tight guarantees that President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.
 
Trump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.
 
“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” Trump told reporters on Friday when asked if he would consider letting Tehran keep a civil nuclear programme.
 
Lavrov said Russia was “ready to assist, mediate and play any role that will be beneficial to Iran and the U.S.A.”
 
Moscow has played a role in Iran’s nuclear negotiations in the past as a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and signatory to an earlier deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent Araqchi to Moscow with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about the negotiations. Araqchi will also visit Beijing within the next few days, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported on Friday, without providing further details.
 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Friday that the U.S. administration is looking for a peaceful solution with Iran but will never tolerate the country developing a nuclear weapon.

Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
 
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
 
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
 
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
 
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
 
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
 
Some robots completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
 
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
 
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
 
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
 
“(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,” he said.
 
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
 
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.

Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:18:35 +0000
Content: The Shri Kedarnath Dham will reopen to devotees on May 2, and the Shri Badrinath Dham will follow on May 4, a spokesperson for the Shri Badrinath‑Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC) announced on Saturday.
 
“This evening, the advance team of the Shri Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee reached Shri Kedarnath Dham. The doors of Shri Kedarnath Dham are set to open on May 2,” the spokesperson said.
 
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, on April 10, reiterated the state government’s commitment to ensuring a safe and smooth Char Dham Yatra, emphasizing its importance to the local economy.
 
“The preparations for the Char Dham Yatra are underway. I also chaired a meeting to review the arrangements. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our pilgrims. The Char Dham Yatra is the backbone of our state’s economy,” he said.
 
In addition to Kedarnath and Badrinath, the portals of Shri Madmaheshwar Temple — the second Kedar — will open on May 21, while the third Kedar, Shri Tungnath Temple, will reopen on May 2.
 
Earlier this week, BKTC Chief Executive Officer Vijay Prasad Thapliyal attended a meeting at Shri Omkareshwar Temple in Ukhimath, where the date for reopening Shri Madmaheshwar Temple was finalised. He was welcomed by members of the Kedar Sabha and commended for his collaborative work with Tirthpurohits.
 
On Tuesday, Thapliyal conducted an on-site inspection of several key locations associated with the temple committee, including Maa Barahi Temple (Sansari), Masta Narayan Koti, Shri Triyuginarayan Temple, Gauramaata Temple, Gaurikund, the Temple Committee Rest House at Sonprayag, and the Sanskrit College at Shonitpur (Guptkashi).
 
The Char Dham Yatra is one of the most revered pilgrimages in Hinduism, encompassing four sacred Himalayan shrines: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath.

Title: US will abandon Ukraine peace push if no progress ‘within a matter of days,’ Rubio says
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:55:49 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump will walk away from trying to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs that a deal can be done, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday.
 
“We’re not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end. So we need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks,” Rubio said in Paris after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders.
 
“If it’s not possible, if we’re so far apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president is probably at a point where he’s going to say, ‘well, we’re done’.”
 
There was no immediate comment from Paris, London, Berlin or Kyiv on Rubio’s statement. Three European diplomatic sources told Reuters Rubio’s comments reflected growing frustration in the White House over Russian intransigence to end the war.
 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said some progress on a peace settlement had already been made but that contacts with Washington were difficult. He said Russia was striving to resolve the conflict while ensuring its own interests. Moscow remained open to dialogue with the United States, he added.
 
Rubio’s threats came amid signs of some progress in U.S. talks with Ukraine.
 
Trump said on Thursday he expected to sign a minerals deal with Kyiv next week after an attempt in February fell apart following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Oval Office clash with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
 
The talks in Paris on Thursday were the first substantive, high level and in-person talks on Trump’s peace push that have included European powers. Rubio said a U.S. peace framework he presented received an “encouraging reception.” Zelenskiy’s office called the talks constructive and positive.
 
GROWING FRUSTRATIONS AS PEACE DEALS PROVE ELUSIVE
 
It was unclear why Rubio’s tone shifted so dramatically overnight. Still, his comments on Friday underline mounting frustrations in the White House over a lack of progress in pushes to settle a growing list of geopolitical challenges.
 
Trump promised during his election campaign to end the war in Ukraine within his first 24 hours in the White House. He moderated that claim on taking office, suggesting a deal by April or May as obstacles mounted.
 
He has pressured both sides to come to the negotiating table, threatening tougher sanctions on Russia or an end to billions of dollars in U.S. military support for Kyiv.
 
Both Ukraine and Russia showed up for U.S.-brokered talks in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in a partial ceasefire, but nothing more. Meanwhile, the war has continued, including a recent Russian missile attack that hit Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, killing 35 people – an attack Trump called a “mistake”.
 
If Washington walks away, efforts to broker a peace would likely founder because no other nation is able to bring similar pressure on both Moscow and Kyiv.
 
Other impacts are unclear. The United States could keep its current policy on the conflict unchanged, maintaining sanctions on Russia and keeping U.S. aid flowing to Kyiv. Alternatively, Trump could decide to halt payments to Ukraine.
 
Rubio said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the “constructive” Paris talks and briefed him on “some of the elements of” the U.S. peace framework.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. Kyiv says those demands are tantamount to demanding its capitulation.
 
DROPPING EUROPEAN SANCTIONS PART OF PEACE DEAL?
 
Rubio said the Europeans had a central role to play in any peace pact, especially as their Russia sanctions over which Washington has no control would likely need to be lifted to secure an accord.
 
Rubio said the issue of U.S. security guarantees came up in the Paris talks, saying they were an issue “we can fix in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.” But, he cautioned, “we have bigger challenges that we need to figure out.”
 
He said it was clear that a peace deal would be difficult to strike but there needed to be signs it could be done soon.
 
“There’s no one saying this can be done in 12 hours. But we want to see how far apart it is,” he said. “We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on.”

Title: Article 142: The Supreme Power or Judicial Overreach?
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:19:53 +0000
Content: When the Indian Constitution was drafted, it gave the Supreme Court an extraordinary tool—Article 142—to ensure “complete justice” in any matter before it. But in recent times, this clause has moved from a safety valve to a superpower, raising concerns about judicial overreach and constitutional balance.
From the Tamil Nadu Governor vs State Government standoff to the collegium appointment deadlocks, Article 142 is now at the center of a serious constitutional debate.
What is Article 142?
At its core, Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to:
“pass any decree or make any order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.”
Originally envisioned as an extraordinary remedy, it was meant to fill gaps where laws were silent, or justice would otherwise be denied. But today, it’s being used in routine governance disputes, often against elected governments and executive offices.
The Tamil Nadu Bill Controversy
In 2024, the Tamil Nadu government passed 11 bills which the Governor withheld or delayed assent to—violating the spirit of Article 200 of the Constitution.
Rather than let the matter escalate to the President or trigger constitutional mechanisms, the Supreme Court stepped in under Article 142 and “deemed the bills passed.”
Why does this matter?
– The Governor is the President’s appointee.
– Bypassing the Governor indirectly pressurizes the President, sidestepping the Union’s constitutional role.
– It sets a precedent: the Court can override delays or objections by elected or appointed executive authorities.
This wasn’t a judicial review—it was judicial enforcement, almost legislative in nature.
Judiciary vs President: A Shadow Tussle
Though the case didn’t name the President, the implications are clear. If a Governor chooses to withhold a bill and send it to the President for advice, Article 142 can now short-circuit that process.
It leads to a serious constitutional question:
Can the Supreme Court enforce its version of justice over the Union’s decision-making authority?
The answer remains murky—but the implications are alarming.
The Collegium Conflict: Another 142 Stretch
In the 2015 NJAC judgment, the Supreme Court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission, reinstating the collegium system. When the Centre delayed appointments, the Court threatened to invoke Article 142 to enforce its judicial selections.
By 2023, the SC was openly saying:
“We may be compelled to use Article 142 if appointments are not acted upon.”
This undermines the President’s role as the constitutional appointer of judges under Article 124. What’s left is a rubber-stamp presidency, where judiciary proposes and enforces, leaving no room for executive consultation.
Can the Union Government Push Back?
Yes—but the tools are limited and slower:
– Article 131: Used for Centre vs State constitutional disputes.
– Articles 256 & 257: Direct state governments to comply with Union laws.
– Attorney General: Can file for compliance or contempt.
But these take time, while Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to act immediately, often without accountability.
Federalism at Risk?
India’s democracy rests on a balance—Centre, States, Judiciary, and the President all play defined roles. But if Article 142 becomes the norm, the judiciary starts to dominate:
– Interpreting laws
– Enforcing its own judgments
– Bypassing executive and legislative will
This transforms the Supreme Court from an interpreter of the Constitution into a de facto super-government.
Conclusion: Justice or Supremacy?
Article 142 is meant to be a fire alarm—used only in exceptional emergencies. But if it’s pulled every time there’s a disagreement between the judiciary and executive, it ceases to be exceptional.
As a citizen and observer of constitutional democracy, I ask:
“What happens to the President’s authority when every judicial blow lands indirectly on their shoulders?”
This is not just about legal turf wars—it’s about preserving the structure of our Republic.

Title: Gita and Natyashastra included in UNESCO’s Memory of World Register, PM Modi calls it ‘proud moment’
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 10:50:02 +0000
Content: The Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a noted Hindu scripture, and the Natyashastra, an Indian treatise on performing arts, have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the development as a proud moment for every Indian.  
The news was shared by Union Minister of Culture and Tourism Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. He took to X and informed, “The Shrimad Bhagavad Gita & Bharat Muni’s Natyashastra are now inscribed in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register.”  
He also described it as a historic moment for Bharat’s civilisational heritage and added, “This global honour celebrates India’s eternal wisdom & artistic genius.”  
He emphasized that these works are more than literary masterpieces — they are philosophical and aesthetic foundations that have profoundly influenced India’s worldview and modes of thought, emotion, expression, and living.  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the development as “a proud moment for every Indian across the world.”  
“The inclusion of the Gita and Natyashastra in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register is a global recognition of our timeless wisdom and rich culture. The Gita and Natyashastra have nurtured civilisation and consciousness for centuries. Their insights continue to inspire the world,” he said in a post on X.  
The UNESCO Memory of the World Register honours documentary heritage that is deemed to hold exceptional universal value. It includes texts, manuscripts, and documents that have significantly shaped human history and continue to influence generations.  
With this addition, India now has 14 entries in the prestigious Memory of the World Register.  
The Bhagavad Gita, a sacred dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, forms a part of the Mahabharata. Comprising 700 verses across 18 chapters, the text addresses profound philosophical questions, encouraging action, selflessness, and devotion. It synthesises key elements from Vedic, Buddhist, Jain, and Carvaka traditions, making it a cornerstone of India’s intellectual and spiritual heritage. The Gita has been studied and translated across the globe for centuries.  
The Natyashastra, attributed to the sage Bharat Muni, is the foundational treatise on Indian performing arts, encompassing theatre, dance, and music. It has shaped classical art traditions across centuries and remains a guiding text for artists and scholars alike.

Title: With the End of ‘Waqf by User’, A Historic Wrong is Being Corrected
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:58:09 +0000
Content: The Waqf Amendment Act (2025) made its way to the apex court, as several petitions challenge the constitutionality of the new law. After 12 years, the Waqf framework has undergone significant legal changes, with the last set of amendments introduced in 2013 to the principal act of 1995. Before 1995, the Nehru government introduced the Waqf Act of 1954, thus repealing every single law that was made during British rule. 
The Supreme Court, in its observations, was fixated on the ‘Waqf by User’. A classic case of missing the forest for the trees, perhaps. Even the legal team, representing the Waqf side, was overtly keen on debating the ‘Waqf by User’ clause. Ironically, the legal team of the Waqf side included a sitting Rajya Sabha parliamentarian. Should the ‘Waqf by User’ properties remain, or should they be confiscated altogether is the million-dollar question everyone is asking. 
Before making sense of the observations and objectives of the apex court and the government, it is important to understand the legal framework in which ‘Waqf by User’ thrived. Put simply, ‘Waqf by User’ means ‘verbal declarations. Land parcels or properties that were assumed to be used for religious purposes and charitable purposes could be proclaimed as Waqf properties. No documentation, no deed, and no paperwork were necessary. The ’assumption’ part, while being subjective, was also ambiguous in its interpretation, thus opening Pandora’s box for land disputes. 
Seven years after the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1954, the Nehru Government introduced the Waqf Act, which included the theological concept of ‘Waqf by User’. Hindus and Sikhs, amongst hundreds of other minority communities, had given up their lands in a bloodied partition for Pakistan, where Muslims could live as per their customs. Yet, India’s first Prime Minister desired a law that would create another social partition within India based on real estate. 
Over the next forty years, scattered deliberations around the Waqf Act continued. The government attempted another set of amendments in 1984, but it took another decade for the formulation of the 1995 Act. Introduced under the PV Narasimha Rao government, the new act included the contentious Section 40. 
Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995, empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally determine if a property was Waqf property, granting them significant authority to collect information and conduct inquiries without judicial oversight. This provision allowed the Board to declare properties, including those registered under other laws like the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, as Waqf after inquiry, with decisions final unless modified by a Waqf Tribunal. Further, the decision of the tribunal was also declared final in the 1995 Act, leaving the victims without any legal escape route. 
This legal thrust empowered the Waqf ecosystem. Combining the concept of ‘Waqf by User’ and Section 40, the Waqf Boards across states could now claim land parcels easily. The Modi Government, through the 2025 amendments, omitted Section 40 altogether. Even the legal team representing the petitioners did not challenge the omission of Section 40. 
In 2013, the law was further tweaked to give more thrust to the Waqf ecosystem. The definition of those making a dedication to the Waqf was changed to include all non-Muslims. The definition of encroachers was also changed to include government properties. This is where the Waqf Boards started becoming a nightmare for the government and Hindus, amongst other minority communities (Jain, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, Christians, etc). 
In the final months of the Congress government, when the communal violence bill and the minority sub-quota for Muslims were attempted, without success, the Waqf ecosystem was awarded three critical lifelines. These were covered in Sections 104, 107, and 108. 
Under a clause in Section 104, the government had to vacate a property in six months if the Waqf ordered it to do so. If vacating was not an option, the government was required to give the relevant Waqf board a rent as per the market value of the land or property parcel, along with compensation, if needed. 
Under Section 107, the Limitation Act of 1963 did not apply to the claims of the Waqf. While ordinary citizens could file a legal suit for their illegally occupied property only until twelve years after the takeover, the Waqf was not bound by any such time limit. Today, when Kapil Sibal, representing the Waqf side, asks how deeds for a 3000-year-old property will be produced, the non-applicability of the Limitation Act must be recalled. While the clause was introduced in the 1995 Act, no changes were made in 2013. 
Under a clause in Section 108, the Waqf law was the overriding law in case of a legal dispute. Therefore, other prevailing laws relating to land transfers, property transactions, and so forth were going to be superseded by the Waqf law if a case went to the court. On one hand, people were being left at the mercy of the tribunals, skewed towards one side, and on the other, their legal options were being restricted. 
The 2025 amendments do away with Sections 104 and 108 in their entirety. Further, Section 107 has been altered to ensure the applicability of the Limitation Act of 1963. Section 40 is also gone. The definition of those who can make a dedication to the Waqf is now changed to those who have been practising Islam for five years, which is similar to the definition in the Act of 1954. But the most important change has been made to the ‘Waqf by User’ clause. 
The Waqf Amendment Act 2025 secures government properties, even retrospectively, from the Waqf boards. Irrespective of how they were claimed, no government property can be claimed as a Waqf property anymore. This addresses the 2013 change in the definition of encroachers. On ‘Waqf by User’, the law is clear. Properties registered before or on the date of the commencement of the act will continue to remain as Waqf properties. In their exuberance, many observers and commentators have underestimated the insertion of the word ‘registered’ in both the act and the apex court’s observation. 
Of the 8.72 Lakh Waqf properties, over 4 Lakh properties have been classified under ‘Waqf by User’. In terms of area, the ‘Waqf by User’ properties encompass over 22 Lakh acres of the total 37 Lakh acres. However, because ‘Waqf by User’ means verbal declarations, most of these 4 Lakh properties were without paperwork or deeds, which means no possible registration or gazetted notification. The lack of registration was confirmed by the legal team representing the petitioners. 
The 2025 Act is crystal clear. If not registered, the claimed properties will not be accepted as Waqf properties. This does address, retrospectively, a lot of claims that were made by the Waqf without any deed in place, like the village in Tamil Nadu or an office building in Gujarat. 
In the Lok Sabha, Home Minister Amit Shah stressed how the Waqf properties increased by 21 Lakh acres in the last ten years. This was due to the misuse of ‘Waqf by User’, Sections 40, 104, 107, and 108. All these sections have been addressed in the amendments of 2025. Further, Hindus and non-Muslims are now excluded from the dedication process as well. 
The Supreme Court’s observations also stress registered properties. As per the apex court, ‘Waqf by User’ properties that are registered or notified (via gazette) will be under status quo while the hearings go on. This is no different from what the government has already dictated in the new Act. No verbal claims, current or retrospective, are being accepted by the government or the apex court. This gives the government a comfortable edge over the petitioners in the apex court. 
Contrary to popular belief, the Waqf Amendment Act is not solving or creating a religious problem, but improving the real estate situation in this country, which will have economic consequences. The dilution of the power of the Waqf boards, given a free run under the previous governments, was necessary while respecting their cultural sensitivities, and that is precisely what the government has been able to achieve. All historical mistakes are now undone.

Title: PM Modi holds talks with Elon Musk on strengthening India-US ties in technology and innovation
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:50:58 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a telephonic conversation with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on a range of topics, including the immense potential for collaboration in technology and innovation.
“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
The Prime Minister had previously met Musk during his visit to Washington in February this year.
“Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington DC. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance,’” PM Modi had said on X after that meeting.
In another post, the Prime Minister shared candid moments with Musk’s children, captioning it, “It was also a delight to meet Mr. Elon Musk’s family and to talk about a wide range of subjects!”
PM Modi’s latest conversation with Musk comes at a time when Tesla is reportedly poised to enter the Indian market. The development also coincides with ongoing negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement between India and the US.
On Wednesday, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal also met with top executives from Elon Musk’s Starlink in Delhi to discuss the company’s investment plans in India.
“Met a delegation from Starlink, comprising Vice President Chad Gibbs and Senior Director Ryan Goodnight. Discussions covered Starlink’s cutting-edge technology platform, their existing partnerships, and future investment plans in India,” Goyal said on X.
This meeting comes amid reports that domestic telecom majors such as Airtel are in discussions with US companies for the possible launch of satellite telecom services in India. Vodafone Idea has also indicated that it is in talks with Starlink to provide satellite communication services in the country.
Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has emphasized the need for satellite internet in India, particularly in rural and remote areas.
He noted that many corners of the country are difficult to reach with fiber or mobile connectivity, and satellite internet could help ensure 100 percent coverage. Stressing that these services are complementary—not competitive—Scindia reiterated India’s commitment to offering terrestrial, fiber, and satellite communication to consumers.
He also pointed out that satellite communication can play a crucial role in emergencies when natural disasters damage telecom towers and fiber networks.
Starlink, owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is still awaiting a regulatory license to begin operations in India, pending the government’s new rules on spectrum pricing.
Scindia has stated that any company can apply for a license, provided it complies with Indian regulations.
Starlink is a satellite internet service that aims to deliver high-speed connectivity worldwide. SpaceX, the parent company, is the first private firm to have delivered astronauts to and from the International Space Station and has also completed an all-civilian mission to orbit.

Content: As the world celebrates World Heritage Day today, the spotlight shines on preserving humanity’s cultural and natural legacy under the 2025 theme, “Heritage under Threat from Disasters and Conflicts: Preparedness and Learning from 60 years of ICOMOS Actions.” This annual event, marked every April 18, underscores the urgency of safeguarding irreplaceable treasures like India’s 43 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, from the majestic Taj Mahal to the ancient Ajanta and Ellora Caves. Initiated in 1982 by the International Council on Monuments and Sites and adopted by UNESCO in 1983, World Heritage Day—also known as the International Day for Monuments and Sites —celebrates the shared consciousness of humanity embedded in historic sites, folk songs, and ancient scripts. This year’s theme highlights the need to protect heritage from natural disasters and conflicts, drawing on six decades of ICOMOS expertise to guide global efforts.
The World Heritage Convention: A Global Commitment
At the heart of these efforts lies the World Heritage Convention, established by UNESCO in 1972 to identify and protect sites of universal value. As of October 2024, the World Heritage List boasts 1,223 sites across 196 countries, including 952 cultural, 231 natural, and 40 mixed properties. India, a signatory since 1977, proudly contributes 43 sites, with recent additions like Moidams: The Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty in Assam, inscribed in July 2024. Prime Minister Narendra Modi aptly noted, “Heritage is not only history. Rather a shared consciousness of humanity.” India’s journey began in 1983 with the listing of Agra Fort, Taj Mahal, Ajanta Caves, and Ellora Caves. With 62 more sites on UNESCO’s Tentative List, the nation continues to champion preservation as a bridge between past and future.
India’s Robust Heritage Initiatives
India’s commitment to its cultural and natural legacy is evident in a slew of innovative initiatives led by the Ministry of Culture and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Since 2014, the government has retrieved 642 antiquities from foreign countries, part of a total 655 recovered since 1976. The Adopt a Heritage 2.0 program, revamped in 2023, has seen 21 MoUs signed with organizations to enhance facilities at protected monuments using CSR funds. In July 2024, India hosted the 46th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Delhi, attended by 2,900 delegates from over 140 countries. The event, inaugurated by PM Modi, reinforced India’s global leadership in heritage conservation. Meanwhile, the ASI oversees 3,697 monuments of national importance, ensuring accessibility with amenities like pathways, signages, and facilities for differently-abled visitors. Revival projects like the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, Mahakaal Lok, and Ma Kamakhya Corridor enhance pilgrim experiences, while the Chardham Road Project improves connectivity to sacred sites. The Must See Portal (asimustsee.nic.in) showcases nearly 100 prominent sites, offering history, access details, and panoramic views to global visitors.
Digitizing and Celebrating Heritage
The National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA), launched in 2007, has digitized over 12.3 lakh antiquities and 11,406 heritage sites, with ₹20 lakh allocated for 2024–25. The Indian Heritage in Digital Space (IHDS) initiative leverages immersive technology to preserve and present India’s legacy. On October 3, 2024, Assamese, Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, and Bengali were granted classical language status, bringing the total to 11 and affirming India’s linguistic heritage. India’s literary heritage also shone globally when Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahrdayāloka-Locana were inscribed on the MOWCAP Regional Register in May 2024, cementing their universal significance.
Historic moment for Bharat’s civilisational heritage
The Shrimad Bhagavad Gita & Bharat Muni’s Natyashastra are now inscribed in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register. The inclusion of the Gita and Natyashastra in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register is a global recognition of our timeless wisdom and rich culture. With this, we now 14 inscriptions from our country on this international register.
A Shared Responsibility
World Heritage Day 2025 reminds us that preserving heritage is a collective duty. From ancient monuments to timeless literature, India’s efforts—through national initiatives and global collaboration—ensure these treasures continue to inspire and educate. As threats loom, the nation’s proactive measures, from digitization to disaster preparedness, safeguard the stories of who we were for generations yet to come.

Title: Global biopharma IPOs surge to $8.52 billion in 2024 amid market rebound
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:54:29 +0000
Content: The global biopharmaceutical sector witnessed a sharp rebound in 2024, with initial public offerings (IPOs) rising by 68.4 per cent to reach $8.52 billion, according to a new report by GlobalData.
 
A total of 50 IPOs were completed during the year, compared to $5.06 billion raised in 2023. This marks the highest IPO value recorded since 2021, driven in part by interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.
 
The report noted a growing appetite among investors, particularly for companies with strong clinical data—signaling a renewed confidence in public markets and a shift toward more advanced-stage biopharmaceutical firms.
 
IPOs that raised more than $100 million nearly doubled, from $4.39 billion across 15 deals in 2023 to $7.88 billion across 24 deals in 2024.
 
“The increase in high-value IPOs in 2024 indicates that while investors remain selective, improved capital availability due to interest rate cuts has supported investments in biopharma companies with a strong value proposition,” said Alison Labya, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.
 
The largest IPO of the year came from Switzerland-based dermatology firm Galderma, which raised $2.48 billion. Galderma had previously planned an IPO in February 2022 that was cancelled, and another attempt was postponed in March 2023 due to market volatility.
 
Despite the overall uptick, early-stage companies—particularly those in the discovery and preclinical phases—saw a significant decline in IPO activity. The total raised by these firms dropped nearly fourfold, from $490.6 million in 2023 to just $112.5 million in 2024. This underscores the shift in investor focus toward companies further along in development.

Title: Delhi-NCR to see more thunderstorms as temperatures hold steady
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:50:37 +0000
Content: A day after several parts of Delhi-NCR witnessed sudden thunderstorms, lightning, and rain, bringing much-needed relief from the scorching heat, the weather department has forecast more such weather conditions over the weekend and into the coming week.
On Friday evening, many areas in the national capital, including Central, Southern, and Western Delhi—such as Burari, Rohini, Badli, Model Town, and Karawal Nagar—experienced light to moderate rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature on April 19 is expected to be around 38 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius. Thunderstorms and lightning are likely to continue across the Delhi-NCR region.
The IMD has predicted cloudy skies for Sunday, April 20, with temperatures remaining steady—maximum at 38 degrees Celsius and minimum at 25 degrees Celsius. Cloudy conditions are expected to persist until Monday, with the maximum temperature rising slightly to 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum staying at 25 degrees Celsius.
Strong winds are forecast for April 22, although temperatures will remain high, with the maximum at 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 25 degrees Celsius.
However, this brief relief from the heatwave will not last long. After April 23, the maximum temperature is expected to climb to 40 degrees Celsius, marking a return to hotter conditions.
The recent high-speed winds and rainfall also caused power outages in several parts of Delhi-NCR due to falling trees and broken branches. In parts of Western Uttar Pradesh, the storm led to the collapse of billboards and walls, resulting in casualties. Police and state administration teams are actively engaged in relief and rescue operations.

Title: 24 students score perfect 100 percentile in JEE Main 2025; results declared by NTA
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:41:04 +0000
Content: The National Testing Agency (NTA) on Saturday announced the results of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main 2025 Paper 1 (B.E./B.Tech), with 24 candidates securing a perfect 100 percentile.
 
The exam was conducted in two sessions — January and April — witnessing a massive turnout. A total of 15,39,848 unique candidates registered across both sessions, of which 14,75,103 appeared. In the January session alone, 13,11,544 students registered and 12,58,136 appeared, while the April session saw 10,61,840 registrations and 9,92,350 actual participants.
 
The computer-based examination was held in 13 languages across 300 cities, including 15 international centres such as Dubai, Singapore, Doha, and Washington DC.
 
Among the 24 candidates who scored a perfect 100 percentile, Rajasthan accounted for the highest number with seven students, followed by Maharashtra and Telangana with four each. Uttar Pradesh had three toppers, West Bengal had two, and Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh had one each.
 
Two female candidates featured among the top scorers: Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal and Sai Manogna Guthikonda from Andhra Pradesh.
 
The NTA also released the category-wise cut-off percentiles for eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced 2025. The cut-off for the unreserved (UR) category was 93.10 percentile. For the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), it was 80.38; for OBC-NCL, 79.43; for Scheduled Castes (SC), 61.15; and for Scheduled Tribes (ST), 47.90. For Persons with Benchmark Disability (PwBD) in the UR category, the cut-off stood at 0.0079 percentile.
 
To ensure the integrity of the examination process, NTA implemented advanced security measures including AI-based video analytics, 5G jammers, live CCTV surveillance, and biometric attendance systems. Despite these efforts, results of 110 candidates were withheld due to the use of unfair means, while results of another 23 were withheld due to identity verification discrepancies.
 
Now that the JEE Main results are out, eligible candidates will move forward to the JEE Advanced — the gateway to securing admission in the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
 
Notably, 8,33,536 candidates registered for both sessions of the exam, and 7,75,383 appeared in both. For those who appeared in both sessions, the higher of the two scores was considered for the final result.

Title: Four dead, several trapped after building collapses in Delhi’s Mustafabad
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:34:55 +0000
Content: At least four people have died and 14 others have been rescued after a four-storey building collapsed in the Mustafabad area of Delhi early Saturday morning. Police said around eight people are still feared trapped under the debris.
 
Sandeep Lamba, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East District), confirmed the incident occurred around 3 a.m.
 
“Fourteen people were rescued, but unfortunately four of them succumbed to their injuries. The rescue operation is still ongoing, and 8–10 individuals are feared to be trapped under the rubble,” Lamba told reporters.
 
Officials said teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Delhi Police, and the Delhi Fire Service are at the site, working to rescue those still trapped.
 
Rajendra Atwal, Divisional Fire Officer, said they received a distress call around 2:50 a.m. about the building collapse.
 
“When we arrived, we found that the entire building had collapsed and several people were trapped. Rescue operations are underway with the help of the NDRF and fire service teams,” he said.
 
This incident comes just days after a similar mishap on April 11, when one person died and two others were injured after a wall of an under-construction building collapsed during a dust storm near the Madhu Vihar police station.

Title: White House launches COVID website that criticizes WHO, Fauci and Biden
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 03:26:37 +0000
Content: Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House launched a COVID-19 website on Friday in which it blamed the origins of the coronavirus on a lab leak in China while criticizing Democratic former President Joe Biden, former top U.S. health official Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization.
 
The website was also critical of steps like social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns.
 
Trump began a 12-month process of withdrawing the U.S. – by far the WHO’s largest financial backer – from the agency when he took office in January.
 
Soon after taking office, Trump also said that Fauci, who has faced threats since leading the country’s COVID-19 response, should hire his own security and ended U.S. security for him.
 
A CIA spokesperson said in January that the CIA has assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to have emerged from a lab than from nature. The CIA had said it had “low confidence” in its assessment and that both scenarios – lab origin and natural origin – remain plausible.
 
China’s government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19’s origin, and has accused Washington of politicizing the matter, especially because of efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate.
 
Beijing has said there was no credibility to claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic.

Title: Iran says nuclear deal is possible if Washington is realistic
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:30:40 +0000
Content: Iran believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the United States is possible as long as Washington is realistic, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday on the eve of a second round of talks with the Trump administration.
 
“If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow after talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia.
 
Iran had noted the United States’ seriousness during a first round of talks on the deal, which took place in Oman last week, Araqchi said. The second round is set for Saturday in Rome and will be held through Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said.
 
“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various U.S. officials over the past few days, we expect the U.S. side to first provide an explanation in this regard and to remove the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions and seriousness,” Baghaei told state media without elaborating.
 
Iran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed water-tight guarantees that President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.
 
Trump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.
 
“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” Trump told reporters on Friday when asked if he would consider letting Tehran keep a civil nuclear programme.
 
Lavrov said Russia was “ready to assist, mediate and play any role that will be beneficial to Iran and the U.S.A.”
 
Moscow has played a role in Iran’s nuclear negotiations in the past as a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and signatory to an earlier deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent Araqchi to Moscow with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about the negotiations. Araqchi will also visit Beijing within the next few days, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported on Friday, without providing further details.
 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Friday that the U.S. administration is looking for a peaceful solution with Iran but will never tolerate the country developing a nuclear weapon.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:24:06 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
 
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
 
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
 
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
 
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
 
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
 
Some robots completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
 
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
 
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
 
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
 
“(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,” he said.
 
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
 
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.

Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:18:35 +0000
Content: The Shri Kedarnath Dham will reopen to devotees on May 2, and the Shri Badrinath Dham will follow on May 4, a spokesperson for the Shri Badrinath‑Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC) announced on Saturday.
 
“This evening, the advance team of the Shri Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee reached Shri Kedarnath Dham. The doors of Shri Kedarnath Dham are set to open on May 2,” the spokesperson said.
 
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, on April 10, reiterated the state government’s commitment to ensuring a safe and smooth Char Dham Yatra, emphasizing its importance to the local economy.
 
“The preparations for the Char Dham Yatra are underway. I also chaired a meeting to review the arrangements. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our pilgrims. The Char Dham Yatra is the backbone of our state’s economy,” he said.
 
In addition to Kedarnath and Badrinath, the portals of Shri Madmaheshwar Temple — the second Kedar — will open on May 21, while the third Kedar, Shri Tungnath Temple, will reopen on May 2.
 
Earlier this week, BKTC Chief Executive Officer Vijay Prasad Thapliyal attended a meeting at Shri Omkareshwar Temple in Ukhimath, where the date for reopening Shri Madmaheshwar Temple was finalised. He was welcomed by members of the Kedar Sabha and commended for his collaborative work with Tirthpurohits.
 
On Tuesday, Thapliyal conducted an on-site inspection of several key locations associated with the temple committee, including Maa Barahi Temple (Sansari), Masta Narayan Koti, Shri Triyuginarayan Temple, Gauramaata Temple, Gaurikund, the Temple Committee Rest House at Sonprayag, and the Sanskrit College at Shonitpur (Guptkashi).
 
The Char Dham Yatra is one of the most revered pilgrimages in Hinduism, encompassing four sacred Himalayan shrines: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath.

Title: US will abandon Ukraine peace push if no progress ‘within a matter of days,’ Rubio says
Publication Date: Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:55:49 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump will walk away from trying to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs that a deal can be done, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday.
 
“We’re not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end. So we need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks,” Rubio said in Paris after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders.
 
“If it’s not possible, if we’re so far apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president is probably at a point where he’s going to say, ‘well, we’re done’.”
 
There was no immediate comment from Paris, London, Berlin or Kyiv on Rubio’s statement. Three European diplomatic sources told Reuters Rubio’s comments reflected growing frustration in the White House over Russian intransigence to end the war.
 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said some progress on a peace settlement had already been made but that contacts with Washington were difficult. He said Russia was striving to resolve the conflict while ensuring its own interests. Moscow remained open to dialogue with the United States, he added.
 
Rubio’s threats came amid signs of some progress in U.S. talks with Ukraine.
 
Trump said on Thursday he expected to sign a minerals deal with Kyiv next week after an attempt in February fell apart following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Oval Office clash with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
 
The talks in Paris on Thursday were the first substantive, high level and in-person talks on Trump’s peace push that have included European powers. Rubio said a U.S. peace framework he presented received an “encouraging reception.” Zelenskiy’s office called the talks constructive and positive.
 
GROWING FRUSTRATIONS AS PEACE DEALS PROVE ELUSIVE
 
It was unclear why Rubio’s tone shifted so dramatically overnight. Still, his comments on Friday underline mounting frustrations in the White House over a lack of progress in pushes to settle a growing list of geopolitical challenges.
 
Trump promised during his election campaign to end the war in Ukraine within his first 24 hours in the White House. He moderated that claim on taking office, suggesting a deal by April or May as obstacles mounted.
 
He has pressured both sides to come to the negotiating table, threatening tougher sanctions on Russia or an end to billions of dollars in U.S. military support for Kyiv.
 
Both Ukraine and Russia showed up for U.S.-brokered talks in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in a partial ceasefire, but nothing more. Meanwhile, the war has continued, including a recent Russian missile attack that hit Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, killing 35 people – an attack Trump called a “mistake”.
 
If Washington walks away, efforts to broker a peace would likely founder because no other nation is able to bring similar pressure on both Moscow and Kyiv.
 
Other impacts are unclear. The United States could keep its current policy on the conflict unchanged, maintaining sanctions on Russia and keeping U.S. aid flowing to Kyiv. Alternatively, Trump could decide to halt payments to Ukraine.
 
Rubio said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the “constructive” Paris talks and briefed him on “some of the elements of” the U.S. peace framework.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants Ukraine to drop its ambitions to join NATO, Russia to control the entirety of four Ukrainian regions it has claimed as its own, and the size of the Ukrainian army to be limited. Kyiv says those demands are tantamount to demanding its capitulation.
 
DROPPING EUROPEAN SANCTIONS PART OF PEACE DEAL?
 
Rubio said the Europeans had a central role to play in any peace pact, especially as their Russia sanctions over which Washington has no control would likely need to be lifted to secure an accord.
 
Rubio said the issue of U.S. security guarantees came up in the Paris talks, saying they were an issue “we can fix in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.” But, he cautioned, “we have bigger challenges that we need to figure out.”
 
He said it was clear that a peace deal would be difficult to strike but there needed to be signs it could be done soon.
 
“There’s no one saying this can be done in 12 hours. But we want to see how far apart it is,” he said. “We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on.”

Content: Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Saturday said it was an honour to speak with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and confirmed that he looks forward to visiting India later this year.
The conversation between the billionaire entrepreneur and the Prime Minister revolved around potential collaborations in technology and innovation.
“It was an honour to speak with PM Modi. I am looking forward to visiting India later this year,” Musk posted on X.
PM Modi also shared details of the interaction, saying he spoke with Musk on various matters, building on discussions they had during a meeting in Washington, D.C. earlier this year.
“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” the Prime Minister said in a post on X.
During PM Modi’s visit to the US in February, he had met with Musk and discussed a broad range of topics, including space, mobility, and innovation.
“Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington, D.C. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance,’” PM Modi had posted following the meeting.
This renewed engagement comes as Tesla is reportedly preparing to enter the Indian market. It also aligns with ongoing discussions on a bilateral trade agreement between India and the United States.
Meanwhile, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal met with senior executives from Musk’s satellite venture, Starlink, in Delhi earlier this week.
“Met a delegation from Starlink, comprising Vice President Chad Gibbs and Senior Director Ryan Goodnight. Discussions covered Starlink’s cutting-edge technology platform, their existing partnerships, and future investment plans in India,” Goyal shared on X.

Title: Luke Skywalker’s planet orbited two stars. How about brown dwarfs instead?
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:14:45 +0000
Content: In a memorable image from the 1977 film “Star Wars,” the young hero Luke Skywalker gazes at two suns setting above the horizon on his desert planet Tatooine. Astronomers since then indeed have discovered worlds, called circumbinary planets, orbiting two stars.
 
But for sheer exoticism, it would be hard to top a newly described circumbinary planet located relatively nearby in our Milky Way galaxy. It orbits not two stars but two brown dwarfs – celestial objects too small to be a star and too big to be a planet. And its orbit is unlike any other such planet on record.
 
Brown dwarfs could be considered wannabe stars that during their formative stages did not reach the mass necessary to ignite nuclear fusion at their core like a star. But they are more massive than the biggest planets and are modestly luminous.
 
Using the European Southern Observatory’s Chile-based Very Large Telescope, researchers have found evidence of a planet roughly 120 light-years away – probably a gas planet at least four or five times the mass of Earth – orbiting two brown dwarfs, each about 35 times more massive than Jupiter. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). Jupiter is our solar system’s largest planet.
 
The two brown dwarfs are gravitationally bound and orbit near to each other – as close as just 4% of the distance between Earth and the sun. The planet, named 2M1510 (AB) b, orbits around this pair. Another brown dwarf is present in this system, but is too far away – about 250 times the distance between Earth and the sun – for its gravitational pull to measurably disturb the other two.
 
Of the approximately 5,800 planets beyond our solar system – called exoplanets – confirmed to date, only 16 are circumbinary. And until now, none of those were found to be orbiting brown dwarfs, rather than regular stars.
 
The nature of this planet’s orbit also is unique. Rather than following the plane established for the orbit of the two brown dwarfs, the planet instead orbits almost nearly perpendicular from the plane – called a polar orbit – in a journey lasting at least 100 days.
 
“A satellite on a polar orbit around the Earth is one that would pass over the north and south pole. It would therefore be on an orbit that is inclined at 90 degrees to the rotation axis of the Earth,” said Thomas Baycroft, a doctoral student in astronomy at the University of Birmingham in England and lead author of the study published in the journal Science Advances.
 
No planet in our solar system has a polar orbit. The several exoplanets known to follow such a path orbit only a single star.
 
When two stars, or in this case two brown dwarfs, orbit each other, it is called a binary system, like the fictional one in “Star Wars.” The view by an observer from this planet, however, would be unlike the one that Luke Skywalker saw.
 
“This would be different from the Tatooine image. Both brown dwarfs would be identical and red. Since they are brown dwarfs they are fainter than the sun in general, though how bright they would appear in the sky also depends on how close the planet is to them,” Baycroft said.
 
These binary brown dwarfs each have a mass approximately 4% that of the sun and are only about 0.1% as luminous.
 
“This appears like an exotic configuration for a planetary system. Probably the most important discovery since the first exoplanet has been how diverse planetary systems are. They seem to defy our expectations, which is great – they present a fantastic opportunity to learn,” said University of Birmingham astrophysicist and study co-author Amaury Triaud.
 
While scientists previously had hypothesized the existence of exoplanets in a polar orbit around a binary system, this is the first good evidence of that, Triaud said.

Title: PM Modi to visit Saudi Arabia from April 22-23
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:05:43 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will embark on a two-day official visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from April 22 to 23. The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. 
 
This will be Prime Minister Modi’s third visit to Saudi Arabia, following his previous visits in 2016 and 2019. The upcoming trip follows Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s State Visit to New Delhi in September 2023, during which he attended the G20 Summit and co-chaired the first meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council.
 
In a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), it was said that India and Saudi Arabia share long-standing and friendly ties rooted in strong socio-cultural and trade links. Over the past decade, the bilateral relationship has evolved into a robust strategic partnership spanning a wide range of sectors.
 
“As strategic partners, India and Saudi Arabia have developed strong cooperation across multiple domains, including political, defence, security, trade, investment, energy, technology, health, education, culture, and people-to-people ties,” the MEA said.
 
The ministry highlighted that India’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has deepened considerably in recent years, with increased investment commitments, enhanced defence collaboration, and frequent high-level exchanges between the two countries.
 
Prime Minister Modi’s visit is expected to further advance this comprehensive partnership and foster deeper engagement between the two nations. “The visit reflects the importance India places on its bilateral relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It will provide an opportunity to strengthen the multi-faceted ties and exchange views on key regional and international developments of mutual interest,” the MEA added.

Title: Global biopharma IPOs surge to $8.52 billion in 2024 amid market rebound
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:54:29 +0000
Content: The global biopharmaceutical sector witnessed a sharp rebound in 2024, with initial public offerings (IPOs) rising by 68.4 per cent to reach $8.52 billion, according to a new report by GlobalData.
 
A total of 50 IPOs were completed during the year, compared to $5.06 billion raised in 2023. This marks the highest IPO value recorded since 2021, driven in part by interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.
 
The report noted a growing appetite among investors, particularly for companies with strong clinical data—signaling a renewed confidence in public markets and a shift toward more advanced-stage biopharmaceutical firms.
 
IPOs that raised more than $100 million nearly doubled, from $4.39 billion across 15 deals in 2023 to $7.88 billion across 24 deals in 2024.
 
“The increase in high-value IPOs in 2024 indicates that while investors remain selective, improved capital availability due to interest rate cuts has supported investments in biopharma companies with a strong value proposition,” said Alison Labya, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.
 
The largest IPO of the year came from Switzerland-based dermatology firm Galderma, which raised $2.48 billion. Galderma had previously planned an IPO in February 2022 that was cancelled, and another attempt was postponed in March 2023 due to market volatility.
 
Despite the overall uptick, early-stage companies—particularly those in the discovery and preclinical phases—saw a significant decline in IPO activity. The total raised by these firms dropped nearly fourfold, from $490.6 million in 2023 to just $112.5 million in 2024. This underscores the shift in investor focus toward companies further along in development.

Title: Delhi-NCR to see more thunderstorms as temperatures hold steady
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:50:37 +0000
Content: A day after several parts of Delhi-NCR witnessed sudden thunderstorms, lightning, and rain, bringing much-needed relief from the scorching heat, the weather department has forecast more such weather conditions over the weekend and into the coming week.
On Friday evening, many areas in the national capital, including Central, Southern, and Western Delhi—such as Burari, Rohini, Badli, Model Town, and Karawal Nagar—experienced light to moderate rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature on April 19 is expected to be around 38 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius. Thunderstorms and lightning are likely to continue across the Delhi-NCR region.
The IMD has predicted cloudy skies for Sunday, April 20, with temperatures remaining steady—maximum at 38 degrees Celsius and minimum at 25 degrees Celsius. Cloudy conditions are expected to persist until Monday, with the maximum temperature rising slightly to 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum staying at 25 degrees Celsius.
Strong winds are forecast for April 22, although temperatures will remain high, with the maximum at 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 25 degrees Celsius.
However, this brief relief from the heatwave will not last long. After April 23, the maximum temperature is expected to climb to 40 degrees Celsius, marking a return to hotter conditions.
The recent high-speed winds and rainfall also caused power outages in several parts of Delhi-NCR due to falling trees and broken branches. In parts of Western Uttar Pradesh, the storm led to the collapse of billboards and walls, resulting in casualties. Police and state administration teams are actively engaged in relief and rescue operations.

Title: 24 students score perfect 100 percentile in JEE Main 2025; results declared by NTA
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:41:04 +0000
Content: The National Testing Agency (NTA) on Saturday announced the results of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main 2025 Paper 1 (B.E./B.Tech), with 24 candidates securing a perfect 100 percentile.
 
The exam was conducted in two sessions — January and April — witnessing a massive turnout. A total of 15,39,848 unique candidates registered across both sessions, of which 14,75,103 appeared. In the January session alone, 13,11,544 students registered and 12,58,136 appeared, while the April session saw 10,61,840 registrations and 9,92,350 actual participants.
 
The computer-based examination was held in 13 languages across 300 cities, including 15 international centres such as Dubai, Singapore, Doha, and Washington DC.
 
Among the 24 candidates who scored a perfect 100 percentile, Rajasthan accounted for the highest number with seven students, followed by Maharashtra and Telangana with four each. Uttar Pradesh had three toppers, West Bengal had two, and Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh had one each.
 
Two female candidates featured among the top scorers: Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal and Sai Manogna Guthikonda from Andhra Pradesh.
 
The NTA also released the category-wise cut-off percentiles for eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced 2025. The cut-off for the unreserved (UR) category was 93.10 percentile. For the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), it was 80.38; for OBC-NCL, 79.43; for Scheduled Castes (SC), 61.15; and for Scheduled Tribes (ST), 47.90. For Persons with Benchmark Disability (PwBD) in the UR category, the cut-off stood at 0.0079 percentile.
 
To ensure the integrity of the examination process, NTA implemented advanced security measures including AI-based video analytics, 5G jammers, live CCTV surveillance, and biometric attendance systems. Despite these efforts, results of 110 candidates were withheld due to the use of unfair means, while results of another 23 were withheld due to identity verification discrepancies.
 
Now that the JEE Main results are out, eligible candidates will move forward to the JEE Advanced — the gateway to securing admission in the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
 
Notably, 8,33,536 candidates registered for both sessions of the exam, and 7,75,383 appeared in both. For those who appeared in both sessions, the higher of the two scores was considered for the final result.

Title: Four dead, several trapped after building collapses in Delhi’s Mustafabad
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:34:55 +0000
Content: At least four people have died and 14 others have been rescued after a four-storey building collapsed in the Mustafabad area of Delhi early Saturday morning. Police said around eight people are still feared trapped under the debris.
 
Sandeep Lamba, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East District), confirmed the incident occurred around 3 a.m.
 
“Fourteen people were rescued, but unfortunately four of them succumbed to their injuries. The rescue operation is still ongoing, and 8–10 individuals are feared to be trapped under the rubble,” Lamba told reporters.
 
Officials said teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Delhi Police, and the Delhi Fire Service are at the site, working to rescue those still trapped.
 
Rajendra Atwal, Divisional Fire Officer, said they received a distress call around 2:50 a.m. about the building collapse.
 
“When we arrived, we found that the entire building had collapsed and several people were trapped. Rescue operations are underway with the help of the NDRF and fire service teams,” he said.
 
This incident comes just days after a similar mishap on April 11, when one person died and two others were injured after a wall of an under-construction building collapsed during a dust storm near the Madhu Vihar police station.

Title: White House launches COVID website that criticizes WHO, Fauci and Biden
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 03:26:37 +0000
Content: Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House launched a COVID-19 website on Friday in which it blamed the origins of the coronavirus on a lab leak in China while criticizing Democratic former President Joe Biden, former top U.S. health official Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization.
 
The website was also critical of steps like social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns.
 
Trump began a 12-month process of withdrawing the U.S. – by far the WHO’s largest financial backer – from the agency when he took office in January.
 
Soon after taking office, Trump also said that Fauci, who has faced threats since leading the country’s COVID-19 response, should hire his own security and ended U.S. security for him.
 
A CIA spokesperson said in January that the CIA has assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to have emerged from a lab than from nature. The CIA had said it had “low confidence” in its assessment and that both scenarios – lab origin and natural origin – remain plausible.
 
China’s government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19’s origin, and has accused Washington of politicizing the matter, especially because of efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate.
 
Beijing has said there was no credibility to claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic.

Title: Iran says nuclear deal is possible if Washington is realistic
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:30:40 +0000
Content: Iran believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the United States is possible as long as Washington is realistic, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday on the eve of a second round of talks with the Trump administration.
 
“If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow after talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia.
 
Iran had noted the United States’ seriousness during a first round of talks on the deal, which took place in Oman last week, Araqchi said. The second round is set for Saturday in Rome and will be held through Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said.
 
“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various U.S. officials over the past few days, we expect the U.S. side to first provide an explanation in this regard and to remove the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions and seriousness,” Baghaei told state media without elaborating.
 
Iran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed water-tight guarantees that President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.
 
Trump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.
 
“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” Trump told reporters on Friday when asked if he would consider letting Tehran keep a civil nuclear programme.
 
Lavrov said Russia was “ready to assist, mediate and play any role that will be beneficial to Iran and the U.S.A.”
 
Moscow has played a role in Iran’s nuclear negotiations in the past as a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and signatory to an earlier deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent Araqchi to Moscow with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about the negotiations. Araqchi will also visit Beijing within the next few days, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported on Friday, without providing further details.
 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Friday that the U.S. administration is looking for a peaceful solution with Iran but will never tolerate the country developing a nuclear weapon.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:24:06 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
 
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
 
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
 
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
 
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
 
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
 
Some robots completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
 
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
 
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
 
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
 
“(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,” he said.
 
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
 
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.

Content: The global biopharmaceutical sector witnessed a sharp rebound in 2024, with initial public offerings (IPOs) rising by 68.4 per cent to reach $8.52 billion, according to a new report by GlobalData.
 
A total of 50 IPOs were completed during the year, compared to $5.06 billion raised in 2023. This marks the highest IPO value recorded since 2021, driven in part by interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.
 
The report noted a growing appetite among investors, particularly for companies with strong clinical data—signaling a renewed confidence in public markets and a shift toward more advanced-stage biopharmaceutical firms.
 
IPOs that raised more than $100 million nearly doubled, from $4.39 billion across 15 deals in 2023 to $7.88 billion across 24 deals in 2024.
 
“The increase in high-value IPOs in 2024 indicates that while investors remain selective, improved capital availability due to interest rate cuts has supported investments in biopharma companies with a strong value proposition,” said Alison Labya, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.
 
The largest IPO of the year came from Switzerland-based dermatology firm Galderma, which raised $2.48 billion. Galderma had previously planned an IPO in February 2022 that was cancelled, and another attempt was postponed in March 2023 due to market volatility.
 
Despite the overall uptick, early-stage companies—particularly those in the discovery and preclinical phases—saw a significant decline in IPO activity. The total raised by these firms dropped nearly fourfold, from $490.6 million in 2023 to just $112.5 million in 2024. This underscores the shift in investor focus toward companies further along in development.

Title: Delhi-NCR to see more thunderstorms as temperatures hold steady
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 05:50:37 +0000
Content: A day after several parts of Delhi-NCR witnessed sudden thunderstorms, lightning, and rain, bringing much-needed relief from the scorching heat, the weather department has forecast more such weather conditions over the weekend and into the coming week.
On Friday evening, many areas in the national capital, including Central, Southern, and Western Delhi—such as Burari, Rohini, Badli, Model Town, and Karawal Nagar—experienced light to moderate rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature on April 19 is expected to be around 38 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius. Thunderstorms and lightning are likely to continue across the Delhi-NCR region.
The IMD has predicted cloudy skies for Sunday, April 20, with temperatures remaining steady—maximum at 38 degrees Celsius and minimum at 25 degrees Celsius. Cloudy conditions are expected to persist until Monday, with the maximum temperature rising slightly to 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum staying at 25 degrees Celsius.
Strong winds are forecast for April 22, although temperatures will remain high, with the maximum at 39 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 25 degrees Celsius.
However, this brief relief from the heatwave will not last long. After April 23, the maximum temperature is expected to climb to 40 degrees Celsius, marking a return to hotter conditions.
The recent high-speed winds and rainfall also caused power outages in several parts of Delhi-NCR due to falling trees and broken branches. In parts of Western Uttar Pradesh, the storm led to the collapse of billboards and walls, resulting in casualties. Police and state administration teams are actively engaged in relief and rescue operations.

Title: 24 students score perfect 100 percentile in JEE Main 2025; results declared by NTA
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:41:04 +0000
Content: The National Testing Agency (NTA) on Saturday announced the results of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main 2025 Paper 1 (B.E./B.Tech), with 24 candidates securing a perfect 100 percentile.
 
The exam was conducted in two sessions — January and April — witnessing a massive turnout. A total of 15,39,848 unique candidates registered across both sessions, of which 14,75,103 appeared. In the January session alone, 13,11,544 students registered and 12,58,136 appeared, while the April session saw 10,61,840 registrations and 9,92,350 actual participants.
 
The computer-based examination was held in 13 languages across 300 cities, including 15 international centres such as Dubai, Singapore, Doha, and Washington DC.
 
Among the 24 candidates who scored a perfect 100 percentile, Rajasthan accounted for the highest number with seven students, followed by Maharashtra and Telangana with four each. Uttar Pradesh had three toppers, West Bengal had two, and Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh had one each.
 
Two female candidates featured among the top scorers: Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal and Sai Manogna Guthikonda from Andhra Pradesh.
 
The NTA also released the category-wise cut-off percentiles for eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced 2025. The cut-off for the unreserved (UR) category was 93.10 percentile. For the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), it was 80.38; for OBC-NCL, 79.43; for Scheduled Castes (SC), 61.15; and for Scheduled Tribes (ST), 47.90. For Persons with Benchmark Disability (PwBD) in the UR category, the cut-off stood at 0.0079 percentile.
 
To ensure the integrity of the examination process, NTA implemented advanced security measures including AI-based video analytics, 5G jammers, live CCTV surveillance, and biometric attendance systems. Despite these efforts, results of 110 candidates were withheld due to the use of unfair means, while results of another 23 were withheld due to identity verification discrepancies.
 
Now that the JEE Main results are out, eligible candidates will move forward to the JEE Advanced — the gateway to securing admission in the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
 
Notably, 8,33,536 candidates registered for both sessions of the exam, and 7,75,383 appeared in both. For those who appeared in both sessions, the higher of the two scores was considered for the final result.

Title: Four dead, several trapped after building collapses in Delhi’s Mustafabad
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:34:55 +0000
Content: At least four people have died and 14 others have been rescued after a four-storey building collapsed in the Mustafabad area of Delhi early Saturday morning. Police said around eight people are still feared trapped under the debris.
 
Sandeep Lamba, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East District), confirmed the incident occurred around 3 a.m.
 
“Fourteen people were rescued, but unfortunately four of them succumbed to their injuries. The rescue operation is still ongoing, and 8–10 individuals are feared to be trapped under the rubble,” Lamba told reporters.
 
Officials said teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Delhi Police, and the Delhi Fire Service are at the site, working to rescue those still trapped.
 
Rajendra Atwal, Divisional Fire Officer, said they received a distress call around 2:50 a.m. about the building collapse.
 
“When we arrived, we found that the entire building had collapsed and several people were trapped. Rescue operations are underway with the help of the NDRF and fire service teams,” he said.
 
This incident comes just days after a similar mishap on April 11, when one person died and two others were injured after a wall of an under-construction building collapsed during a dust storm near the Madhu Vihar police station.

Title: White House launches COVID website that criticizes WHO, Fauci and Biden
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 03:26:37 +0000
Content: Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House launched a COVID-19 website on Friday in which it blamed the origins of the coronavirus on a lab leak in China while criticizing Democratic former President Joe Biden, former top U.S. health official Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization.
 
The website was also critical of steps like social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns.
 
Trump began a 12-month process of withdrawing the U.S. – by far the WHO’s largest financial backer – from the agency when he took office in January.
 
Soon after taking office, Trump also said that Fauci, who has faced threats since leading the country’s COVID-19 response, should hire his own security and ended U.S. security for him.
 
A CIA spokesperson said in January that the CIA has assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to have emerged from a lab than from nature. The CIA had said it had “low confidence” in its assessment and that both scenarios – lab origin and natural origin – remain plausible.
 
China’s government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19’s origin, and has accused Washington of politicizing the matter, especially because of efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate.
 
Beijing has said there was no credibility to claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic.

Title: Iran says nuclear deal is possible if Washington is realistic
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:30:40 +0000
Content: Iran believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the United States is possible as long as Washington is realistic, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday on the eve of a second round of talks with the Trump administration.
 
“If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow after talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia.
 
Iran had noted the United States’ seriousness during a first round of talks on the deal, which took place in Oman last week, Araqchi said. The second round is set for Saturday in Rome and will be held through Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said.
 
“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various U.S. officials over the past few days, we expect the U.S. side to first provide an explanation in this regard and to remove the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions and seriousness,” Baghaei told state media without elaborating.
 
Iran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed water-tight guarantees that President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.
 
Trump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.
 
“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific,” Trump told reporters on Friday when asked if he would consider letting Tehran keep a civil nuclear programme.
 
Lavrov said Russia was “ready to assist, mediate and play any role that will be beneficial to Iran and the U.S.A.”
 
Moscow has played a role in Iran’s nuclear negotiations in the past as a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and signatory to an earlier deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent Araqchi to Moscow with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about the negotiations. Araqchi will also visit Beijing within the next few days, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported on Friday, without providing further details.
 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Friday that the U.S. administration is looking for a peaceful solution with Iran but will never tolerate the country developing a nuclear weapon.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 02:24:06 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
 
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
 
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
 
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
 
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
 
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
 
Some robots completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
 
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
 
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
 
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
 
“(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,” he said.
 
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
 
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.

Title: Scientists create novel method to identify healthy and cancerous cells
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:24:59 +0000
Content: Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan on Saturday said they have found that the motion of unlabelled cells can be used to tell whether they are cancerous or healthy.
They observed malignant fibrosarcoma cells and healthy fibroblasts on a dish and found that tracking and analysis of their paths can be used to differentiate them with up to 94 per cent accuracy.
Beyond diagnosis, their technique may also shed light on cell motility related functions, like tissue healing, according to the study published in the journal PLOS One.
The team of researchers, led by Professor Hiromi Miyoshi, came up with a way of tracking cells using phase-contrast microscopy, one of the most common ways of observing cells.
Phase-contrast microscopy is entirely label free, allowing cells to move about on a petri dish closer to their native state, and is not affected by the optical properties of the plastic petri dishes through which cells are imaged.
Through innovative image analysis, they were able to extract trajectories of many individual cells. They focused on properties of the paths taken, like migration speed, and how curvy the paths were, all of which would encode subtle differences in deformation and movement.
As a test, they compared healthy fibroblast cells, the key component of animal tissue, and malignant fibrosarcoma cells, cancerous cells which derive from fibrous connective tissue.
They were able to show that the cells migrated in subtly different ways, as characterised by the “sum of turn angles” (how curvy the paths were), the frequency of shallow turns, and how quickly they moved. In fact, by combining both the sum of turn angles and how often they made shallow turns, they could predict whether a cell was cancerous or not with an accuracy of 94 per cent.
The team’s work not only promises a new way to discriminate cancer cells, but applications to research of any biological function based on cell motility, like the healing of wounds and tissue growth, said the study.

Title: India’s forex, money markets have doubled in last 4 years: RBI Governor
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:06:37 +0000
Content: India’s financial markets have developed into a dynamic and resilient force to fuel economic growth with an almost doubling of the foreign exchange market from $32 billion in 2020 to $60 billion in 2024 and the average daily volumes in the overnight money markets surging from about Rs 3 lakh crore to over Rs 5.4 lakh in this four-year period, according to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.
There has also been a 40 per cent surge in average daily volumes in the government securities (G-secs) markets to Rs 66,000 crore over the same period.
Addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI annual conference in Bali this weekend, Malhotra said the levels of transparency in Indian markets are at par with the best in the world.
“With recent regulatory reforms, we have seen greater product and participant diversity, and the onshore and offshore markets have become tightly integrated,” he pointed out.
Malhotra said all the financial market segments of the country, including Forex, G-sec, and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the Rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground.
The foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads. There is growing transparency in this market. All FX derivatives are reported to the Trade Repository, and reporting of cash and spot transactions has commenced. A bulk of FX spot transactions are traded on electronic trading platforms (ETPs). Authorised trading platforms are also available for forward transactions, but there appears to be a preference for such trades to take place bilaterally. Trading on ETPs enhances transparency and market efficiency. We would like to see an increasing share of transactions done on ETPs, he said..
Malhotra further stated that fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continue to engage the RBI’s attention.
“Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers is far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. FX-Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking FX transactions, has witnessed a lukewarm response, and our feedback is that this is largely due to the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers,” The RBI governor said.
He highlighted that there are regulations in place to ensure transparency in pricing for retail customers, including a mandate for disclosing the mid-market or interbank rate to customers. As an industry, there is a need for market-makers to introspect and assess in what ways they can effectively deliver on these regulatory and fiduciary mandates, he added.
Malhotra further stated that the RBI has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.
He urged all the financial market participants, including Authorised Dealers, to extend their full cooperation in ensuring that the pilot is implemented smoothly and successfully.
He red-flagged the use of banking channels for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. “This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,” the RBI Governor said.

Title: Iran, US task experts with framework for a nuclear deal after ‘progress’ in talks
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:31:43 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States agreed on Saturday to begin drawing up a framework for a potential nuclear deal, Iran’s foreign minister said, after talks that a U.S. official described as yielding “very good progress.”
U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers during his first term in 2018, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
At their second indirect meeting in a week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi negotiated for four hours in Rome with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff through an Omani official who shuttled messages between them.
Speaking on state TV after the talks, Araqchi described the engagement as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
“We were able to make some progress on a number of principles and goals, and ultimately reached a better understanding,” Araqchi said.
“It was agreed that negotiations will continue and move into the next phase, in which expert-level meetings will begin on Wednesday in Oman. The experts will have the opportunity to start designing a framework for an agreement,” he said.
The top negotiators would meet again in Oman next Saturday to “review the experts’ work and assess how closely it aligns with the principles of a potential agreement,” he added.
Echoing cautious comments last week from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, he said: “We cannot say for certain that we are optimistic. We are acting very cautiously. There is no reason either to be overly pessimistic.”
Iran, which calls its nuclear programme peaceful, says it is willing to discuss limited curbs to its atomic work in return for lifting international sanctions.
A Trump administration official confirmed that the two sides agreed to meet again next week.
“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” the official said.
Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”
Washington’s ally Israel, which opposed the 2015 agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned in 2018, has not ruled out an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.
Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.
A senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity on Friday, listed its red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal.

A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s 1810.HK robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.
Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.
“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.
SOME ROBOTS STRUGGLE
Some robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.

Title: Red notice sought from Interpol against Hasina, 11 others: Bangladesh Police
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:28:57 +0000
Content: The National Central Bureau (NCB) of Bangladesh Police has submitted a request to Interpol seeking a ‘red notice’ against 12 people, including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; former road transport and bridges minister and Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader; and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan.
Confirming the development, Enamul Haque Sagor, Assistant Inspector General (Media) at the Police Headquarters, said on Saturday that the NCB branch makes such requests to Interpol based on appeals received from courts, public prosecutors, or investigating agencies, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
“These applications are filed in connection with allegations that emerge during investigations or through ongoing case proceedings,” he said.
Interpol plays a key role in identifying the locations of fugitives residing abroad. Once the whereabouts of any absconding individual are confirmed, that information is relayed to Interpol, the AIG added.
The request for the Red Notice is currently under process, he noted.
Meanwhile, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of the International Crimes Tribunal, Dhaka in November last year formally requested the Police Headquarters to seek Interpol’s assistance in arresting Sheikh Hasina and others deemed fugitives, reports UNB.

Title: Russia’s Putin declares unilateral Easter ceasefire in Ukraine
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:22:06 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a surprise one-day ceasefire in Ukraine on Saturday for Easter, but Kyiv said Russian forces continued artillery fire and called instead for an extended true halt to hostilities.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had rejected just such a proposal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump last month and could not be trusted.
Putin’s unilateral move, to last for 30 hours, followed Washington’s announcement that it could abandon peace talks within days unless Moscow and Kyiv showed they were serious about negotiating.
Putin ordered fighting to stop as of 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday night.
“Based on humanitarian considerations … the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,” Putin told Valery Gerasimov, Chief of Russia’s General Staff, at a televised meeting.
“We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.”
Shortly after the announcement, around an hour before it was due to take effect, air raid sirens rang out in Kyiv. Another warning was put in place briefly in Kyiv and the region around the capital about four hours after the ceasefire deadline.
Zelenskiy dismissed the proposal as “yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives”. As of 45 minutes before the truce was meant to start, Ukrainian planes were repelling Russian air strikes, Zelenskiy said in a post on X.
In a post on social media platform X, Zelenskiy quoted Ukraine’s top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, as saying that Russian assault operations “continue on several frontline sectors, and Russian artillery fire has not subsided.”
“Therefore, there is no trust in words coming from Moscow.”
Zelenskiy later expanded on Syrskyi’s report, saying that Putin’s ceasefire did not apply to Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, border areas where Ukrainian forces have made incursions and where hostilities were still going on.
“Fighting continues, Russian strikes continue,” he wrote, without providing evidence.
Zelenskiy said that in some areas along the front, “Russian artillery still sounds, rather than any promise of silence from the Russian leader. Russian drones are being used. In some sectors it is quieter.”
He recalled that Russia last month rejected the U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire and said that if Moscow agreed to “truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly — mirroring Russia’s actions”.
“If a complete ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond the Easter day of April 20,” Zelenskiy wrote.
In Brussels, a European Union spokesperson expressed caution over the proclaimed ceasefire, saying: “Russia has a track record as an aggressor, so first we need to see any actual halt of the aggression and clear deeds for a lasting ceasefire.”
A British foreign ministry spokesperson said: “Ukraine has committed to a full ceasefire. We urge Russia to do the same.”
LITTLE FAITH
Kyiv residents expressed little faith in the ceasefire, saying similar past moves by Putin had had little effect.
“This man is not capable of reaching any sort of a deal. He does not know how to do that,” said Tetiana Solovei, 65. “Tonight, in Ukraine and especially in Kyiv, we expect missiles. There will be no ceasefire.”
Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation, said Russian forces continued to fire on Ukrainian positions after the truce was meant to have taken effect.
The governor of southern Ukraine’s Kherson province said Russian air strikes began shortly before the truce was to start and continued after. He posted a picture of a damaged building.
“Unfortunately, we are not seeing any sort of calm here. The shelling continues and our civilians are under fire,” he wrote on Telegram.
Reuters could not independently verify the situation at the front.
Ukrainian bloggers who cover the war said firing continued along the entire line of contact. But public broadcaster Suspilne quoted servicemen on the eastern front as saying the number of Russian attacks had declined.
Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said on Friday the United States would walk away from efforts to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal unless there were clear signs of progress soon.
Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy for Putin who travelled to Washington this month, posted news of the ceasefire on X, adding: “One step closer to peace” and an emoji of a dove.
Trump has vowed to bring a swift end to the war, while shifting U.S. policy from firmly supporting Kyiv towards accepting Moscow’s account of the conflict.
Last month, after Ukraine accepted Trump’s proposal for a 30-day truce but Moscow rejected it, the sides agreed only to limited pauses of attacks on energy targets and at sea, which each accuses the other of breaking.
Putin announced his Easter truce a week after a Russian missile attack killed 35 people and wounded nearly 120 in the Ukrainian city of Sumy, including Christians heading to celebrate Palm Sunday.
That attack, the deadliest against civilians of the year so far, spurred Kyiv and its European allies to press Washington to take a tougher line towards Moscow.
Putin has proclaimed unilateral pauses in fighting in the past with little impact, including a 36-hour proposed truce for Orthodox Christmas in January 2023, which Kyiv rejected.

Title: ‘New hope, new beginnings’, Prez Murmu, PM Modi extend Easter greetings
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 04:10:43 +0000
Content: On the occasion of Easter Sunday, President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended heartfelt greetings to citizens, emphasising the festival’s universal message of new beginnings.
Taking to the social media platform X, President Murmu shared a message celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ and its enduring significance.
“Easter greetings to all! On this occasion, we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This festival inspires the spirit of new hope and new beginnings. The teachings of Jesus Christ inspire humanity to follow the path of love and sacrifice. May this festival of joy and hope bring peace and prosperity to all,” the President wrote.
Easter, also known as Resurrection Sunday, is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, marking the belief in Jesus Christ’s resurrection after crucifixion.
PM Modi also extended his wishes, saying this Easter is special as the Jubilee Year is being observed. He also prayed that this occasion inspires hope in all.
H wrote on X, “Wishing everyone a blessed and joyous Easter. This Easter is special because world over, the Jubilee Year is being observed with immense fervour. May this sacred occasion inspire hope, renewal and compassion in every person. May there be joy and harmony all around.”
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also extended his wishes through X, highlighting the spiritual meaning behind the resurrection.
“Our warmest greetings on the joyous occasion of Easter which symbolises renewal of hope for a better tomorrow. The eternal significance of Jesus Christ’s resurrection is that compassion is stronger than hatred and truth triumphs over evil. As we celebrate Easter Sunday, may joy, peace, amity and harmony illuminate our path ahead,” he posted.
Christians worldwide observe this day with religious services, Easter Mass, family gatherings, and traditions such as Easter egg hunts and festive meals. The occasion represents the triumph of life over death and good over evil and offers a message of forgiveness and renewal to the faithful.
Easter is rooted in the New Testament of the Bible, which recounts how Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities for claiming to be the “Son of God”.
He was subsequently sentenced to death by the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate on Good Friday. Jesus’ resurrection, which occurred three days after his crucifixion, is celebrated on Easter Sunday.
According to the New Testament, Jesus rose from the dead on the third day following his burial, after being crucified by the Romans at Calvary.
Easter also marks the conclusion of the 40-day Lent liturgical season, a period characterised by penance, prayer, and fasting. Additionally, Easter is closely associated with the Jewish holiday of Passover.

Title: Honour to speak with PM Modi, will visit India later this year: Elon Musk
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:47:27 +0000
Content: Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Saturday said it was an honour to speak with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and confirmed that he looks forward to visiting India later this year.
The conversation between the billionaire entrepreneur and the Prime Minister revolved around potential collaborations in technology and innovation.
“It was an honour to speak with PM Modi. I am looking forward to visiting India later this year,” Musk posted on X.
PM Modi also shared details of the interaction, saying he spoke with Musk on various matters, building on discussions they had during a meeting in Washington, D.C. earlier this year.
“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” the Prime Minister said in a post on X.
During PM Modi’s visit to the US in February, he had met with Musk and discussed a broad range of topics, including space, mobility, and innovation.
“Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington, D.C. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology, and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance,’” PM Modi had posted following the meeting.
This renewed engagement comes as Tesla is reportedly preparing to enter the Indian market. It also aligns with ongoing discussions on a bilateral trade agreement between India and the United States.
Meanwhile, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal met with senior executives from Musk’s satellite venture, Starlink, in Delhi earlier this week.
“Met a delegation from Starlink, comprising Vice President Chad Gibbs and Senior Director Ryan Goodnight. Discussions covered Starlink’s cutting-edge technology platform, their existing partnerships, and future investment plans in India,” Goyal shared on X.

Title: Luke Skywalker’s planet orbited two stars. How about brown dwarfs instead?
Publication Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:14:45 +0000
Content: In a memorable image from the 1977 film “Star Wars,” the young hero Luke Skywalker gazes at two suns setting above the horizon on his desert planet Tatooine. Astronomers since then indeed have discovered worlds, called circumbinary planets, orbiting two stars.
 
But for sheer exoticism, it would be hard to top a newly described circumbinary planet located relatively nearby in our Milky Way galaxy. It orbits not two stars but two brown dwarfs – celestial objects too small to be a star and too big to be a planet. And its orbit is unlike any other such planet on record.
 
Brown dwarfs could be considered wannabe stars that during their formative stages did not reach the mass necessary to ignite nuclear fusion at their core like a star. But they are more massive than the biggest planets and are modestly luminous.
 
Using the European Southern Observatory’s Chile-based Very Large Telescope, researchers have found evidence of a planet roughly 120 light-years away – probably a gas planet at least four or five times the mass of Earth – orbiting two brown dwarfs, each about 35 times more massive than Jupiter. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). Jupiter is our solar system’s largest planet.
 
The two brown dwarfs are gravitationally bound and orbit near to each other – as close as just 4% of the distance between Earth and the sun. The planet, named 2M1510 (AB) b, orbits around this pair. Another brown dwarf is present in this system, but is too far away – about 250 times the distance between Earth and the sun – for its gravitational pull to measurably disturb the other two.
 
Of the approximately 5,800 planets beyond our solar system – called exoplanets – confirmed to date, only 16 are circumbinary. And until now, none of those were found to be orbiting brown dwarfs, rather than regular stars.
 
The nature of this planet’s orbit also is unique. Rather than following the plane established for the orbit of the two brown dwarfs, the planet instead orbits almost nearly perpendicular from the plane – called a polar orbit – in a journey lasting at least 100 days.
 
“A satellite on a polar orbit around the Earth is one that would pass over the north and south pole. It would therefore be on an orbit that is inclined at 90 degrees to the rotation axis of the Earth,” said Thomas Baycroft, a doctoral student in astronomy at the University of Birmingham in England and lead author of the study published in the journal Science Advances.
 
No planet in our solar system has a polar orbit. The several exoplanets known to follow such a path orbit only a single star.
 
When two stars, or in this case two brown dwarfs, orbit each other, it is called a binary system, like the fictional one in “Star Wars.” The view by an observer from this planet, however, would be unlike the one that Luke Skywalker saw.
 
“This would be different from the Tatooine image. Both brown dwarfs would be identical and red. Since they are brown dwarfs they are fainter than the sun in general, though how bright they would appear in the sky also depends on how close the planet is to them,” Baycroft said.
 
These binary brown dwarfs each have a mass approximately 4% that of the sun and are only about 0.1% as luminous.
 
“This appears like an exotic configuration for a planetary system. Probably the most important discovery since the first exoplanet has been how diverse planetary systems are. They seem to defy our expectations, which is great – they present a fantastic opportunity to learn,” said University of Birmingham astrophysicist and study co-author Amaury Triaud.
 
While scientists previously had hypothesized the existence of exoplanets in a polar orbit around a binary system, this is the first good evidence of that, Triaud said.

Title: Bhutan turns to ‘green’ cryptocurrency to fuel economy
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:18:29 +0000
Content: The Himalayan nation of Bhutan is exploring ways to mine and leverage green cryptocurrencies using hydropower to boost its economy and create jobs to reduce brain drain, the chief executive of its sovereign wealth fund said.
Green cryptocurrencies are digital currencies mined using clean energy resources such as wind, hydro or solar power instead of fossil fuel.
Sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, Bhutan has earned millions of dollars in recent years by investing in some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies and used some of its profit to pay government salaries for two years, two senior officials in Thimphu, the capital said.
“We are a nation that runs 100% on hydropower, and every digital coin we mine in Bhutan using hydropower offsets that coin which gets mined using fossil fuels,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, the CEO of the fund, Druk Holding and Investments Ltd.
“So a coin mined in Bhutan will contribute to the green economy,” he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Dahal said the fund, which controls Bhutan’s only power generation utility, began adding cryptocurrencies to its portfolio in 2019, seeing virtual currencies as a tactical investment and a gamechanger for the country.
Bhutan is famed for its Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, an economic gauge that incorporates factors ignored by the usual measures of gross domestic product, such as recreation, emotional well-being and sustainability.
It uses hydropower to operate energy-guzzling supercomputers to create digital assets that can be added to the blockchain.
Officials are exploring whether large conglomerates could buy Bhutan’s “green” coins to meet their targets on environmental, social and governance (ESG) norms.
“Bitcoin has not just given more value to hydropower energy, it has also increased access to liquidity in foreign currency,” said Dahal, who added that training Bhutan’s young people in blockchain and AI techniques would fuel jobs.
The nation of about 800,000 is battling an exodus of young, educated people. The government estimates that more than a tenth of its young people sought greener pastures between 2022 and 2023, taking unemployment in that age group to 16.5% in 2024.
Analysts said Bhutan’s ambitious plan to become the capital of green digital currency depends on expanding its hydropower generation to a potential of 33 gigawatts versus existing capacity of about 3.5 gigawatts.
“We have plans to generate 15 gigawatts in the next 10 to 15 years,” Dahal added.

Title: Soccer-Saudi Arabia open to 64-team World Cup in 2034
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:50:53 +0000
Content: Saudi Arabia would be ready and willing to host a 64-team World Cup in 2034 if FIFA accepts a controversial proposal to expand the tournament from 48, according to the kingdom’s sports minister.
South America’s CONMEBOL has officially suggested staging the centenary 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with 64 teams but the idea has been opposed by some other continental confederations.
Next year’s tournament hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico will have 48 countries participating, up from 32 in 2022.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told a select group of reporters at the Saudi Arabian Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah that his country would have no objection to an increase in the numbers for 2034.
“We’re ready, or we will be ready, inshallah (God willing). If that’s a decision that FIFA takes and thinks that that’s a good decision for everyone, then we’re more than happy to deliver on it,” he said.
He pointed to the infrastructure already in place for Islamic pilgrims, with four million people attending Mecca for Umrah during Ramadan this year and five million expected for the Hajj.
The global soccer governing body officially announced Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 men’s World Cup in December, a bid that was uncontested but strongly criticised by rights organisations.
The Kingdom has invested heavily in sport over the last few years but critics accuse it of ‘sportswashing’ its human rights record. The country denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The bid book pledged 15 stadiums, new or refurbished, by 2032 and which are expected to be completed with the help of migrant labour.
Al-Faisal said worker safety was of the highest priority and Saudi organisers were talking regularly with FIFA and 2022 hosts and neighbours Qatar, the first World Cup in the region, to learn from their experience.
He said the death, reported last month, of a worker at the Aramco Stadium construction site in Al Khobar had come after millions of hours without issue.
“Every incident we take seriously, we file an investigation, we look what went wrong,” said the minister. “Unfortunately, in construction, these things happen.”
He said Saudi Arabia was part of the International Labour Organisation and a 2021 Labour Reform Act had abolished the kafala system that binds migrant workers to one employer and prevents them from leaving without the employer’s approval.
Alcohol, prohibited for observant Muslims, is banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Faisal confirmed the World Cup would be dry.
“The law now here in Saudi is that there’s no alcohol. Will that change in the future? We don’t know. But I don’t see it really affecting our sporting events at all,” he said.
“We’ve had more than 100 international events so far. We’ve had people come from all over the world to attend these sporting events. And everyone’s happy with the hospitality, the setup, the experience that they get.
“I don’t see it as an issue, to be honest. So I hope it’s not going to be an issue”.
Alcohol was not sold at stadiums in Qatar, where drinking in public is illegal, in 2022 but beer was available at designated fan zones and in some hotels.

Title: Scientists create novel method to identify healthy and cancerous cells
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:24:59 +0000
Content: Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan on Saturday said they have found that the motion of unlabelled cells can be used to tell whether they are cancerous or healthy.
They observed malignant fibrosarcoma cells and healthy fibroblasts on a dish and found that tracking and analysis of their paths can be used to differentiate them with up to 94 per cent accuracy.
Beyond diagnosis, their technique may also shed light on cell motility related functions, like tissue healing, according to the study published in the journal PLOS One.
The team of researchers, led by Professor Hiromi Miyoshi, came up with a way of tracking cells using phase-contrast microscopy, one of the most common ways of observing cells.
Phase-contrast microscopy is entirely label free, allowing cells to move about on a petri dish closer to their native state, and is not affected by the optical properties of the plastic petri dishes through which cells are imaged.
Through innovative image analysis, they were able to extract trajectories of many individual cells. They focused on properties of the paths taken, like migration speed, and how curvy the paths were, all of which would encode subtle differences in deformation and movement.
As a test, they compared healthy fibroblast cells, the key component of animal tissue, and malignant fibrosarcoma cells, cancerous cells which derive from fibrous connective tissue.
They were able to show that the cells migrated in subtly different ways, as characterised by the “sum of turn angles” (how curvy the paths were), the frequency of shallow turns, and how quickly they moved. In fact, by combining both the sum of turn angles and how often they made shallow turns, they could predict whether a cell was cancerous or not with an accuracy of 94 per cent.
The team’s work not only promises a new way to discriminate cancer cells, but applications to research of any biological function based on cell motility, like the healing of wounds and tissue growth, said the study.

Title: India’s forex, money markets have doubled in last 4 years: RBI Governor
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:06:37 +0000
Content: India’s financial markets have developed into a dynamic and resilient force to fuel economic growth with an almost doubling of the foreign exchange market from $32 billion in 2020 to $60 billion in 2024 and the average daily volumes in the overnight money markets surging from about Rs 3 lakh crore to over Rs 5.4 lakh in this four-year period, according to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.
There has also been a 40 per cent surge in average daily volumes in the government securities (G-secs) markets to Rs 66,000 crore over the same period.
Addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI annual conference in Bali this weekend, Malhotra said the levels of transparency in Indian markets are at par with the best in the world.
“With recent regulatory reforms, we have seen greater product and participant diversity, and the onshore and offshore markets have become tightly integrated,” he pointed out.
Malhotra said all the financial market segments of the country, including Forex, G-sec, and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the Rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground.
The foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads. There is growing transparency in this market. All FX derivatives are reported to the Trade Repository, and reporting of cash and spot transactions has commenced. A bulk of FX spot transactions are traded on electronic trading platforms (ETPs). Authorised trading platforms are also available for forward transactions, but there appears to be a preference for such trades to take place bilaterally. Trading on ETPs enhances transparency and market efficiency. We would like to see an increasing share of transactions done on ETPs, he said..
Malhotra further stated that fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continue to engage the RBI’s attention.
“Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers is far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. FX-Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking FX transactions, has witnessed a lukewarm response, and our feedback is that this is largely due to the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers,” The RBI governor said.
He highlighted that there are regulations in place to ensure transparency in pricing for retail customers, including a mandate for disclosing the mid-market or interbank rate to customers. As an industry, there is a need for market-makers to introspect and assess in what ways they can effectively deliver on these regulatory and fiduciary mandates, he added.
Malhotra further stated that the RBI has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.
He urged all the financial market participants, including Authorised Dealers, to extend their full cooperation in ensuring that the pilot is implemented smoothly and successfully.
He red-flagged the use of banking channels for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. “This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,” the RBI Governor said.

Title: Iran, US task experts with framework for a nuclear deal after ‘progress’ in talks
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:31:43 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States agreed on Saturday to begin drawing up a framework for a potential nuclear deal, Iran’s foreign minister said, after talks that a U.S. official described as yielding “very good progress.”
U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers during his first term in 2018, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
At their second indirect meeting in a week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi negotiated for four hours in Rome with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff through an Omani official who shuttled messages between them.
Speaking on state TV after the talks, Araqchi described the engagement as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere.
“We were able to make some progress on a number of principles and goals, and ultimately reached a better understanding,” Araqchi said.
“It was agreed that negotiations will continue and move into the next phase, in which expert-level meetings will begin on Wednesday in Oman. The experts will have the opportunity to start designing a framework for an agreement,” he said.
The top negotiators would meet again in Oman next Saturday to “review the experts’ work and assess how closely it aligns with the principles of a potential agreement,” he added.
Echoing cautious comments last week from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, he said: “We cannot say for certain that we are optimistic. We are acting very cautiously. There is no reason either to be overly pessimistic.”
Iran, which calls its nuclear programme peaceful, says it is willing to discuss limited curbs to its atomic work in return for lifting international sanctions.
A Trump administration official confirmed that the two sides agreed to meet again next week.
“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” the official said.
Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”
Washington’s ally Israel, which opposed the 2015 agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned in 2018, has not ruled out an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.
Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.
A senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity on Friday, listed its red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal.

Title: China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 06:27:10 +0000
Content: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidUP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.
The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s 1810.HK robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.
Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.
“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.
SOME ROBOTS STRUGGLE
Some robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires “AI breakthroughs”, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
“Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
“Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,” Fern said.
Tang, the robotic centre’s CTO, said: “A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”

Title: Red notice sought from Interpol against Hasina, 11 others: Bangladesh Police
Publication Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 05:28:57 +0000
Content: The National Central Bureau (NCB) of Bangladesh Police has submitted a request to Interpol seeking a ‘red notice’ against 12 people, including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; former road transport and bridges minister and Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader; and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan.
Confirming the development, Enamul Haque Sagor, Assistant Inspector General (Media) at the Police Headquarters, said on Saturday that the NCB branch makes such requests to Interpol based on appeals received from courts, public prosecutors, or investigating agencies, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
“These applications are filed in connection with allegations that emerge during investigations or through ongoing case proceedings,” he said.
Interpol plays a key role in identifying the locations of fugitives residing abroad. Once the whereabouts of any absconding individual are confirmed, that information is relayed to Interpol, the AIG added.
The request for the Red Notice is currently under process, he noted.
Meanwhile, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office of the International Crimes Tribunal, Dhaka in November last year formally requested the Police Headquarters to seek Interpol’s assistance in arresting Sheikh Hasina and others deemed fugitives, reports UNB.
