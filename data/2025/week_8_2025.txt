Title: River systems similar to blood vessels of our body, says UP CM at ‘Faith of Kumbh’ conclave
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:20:06 +0000
Content: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that more than 52 crore devotees have taken a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam during the ongoing Mahakumbh Mela.
This has been the largest congregation in human history for a religious event.
Speaking at the inauguration of a climate conclave that saw the role of religious leaders in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, CM Yogi Adityanath “emphasised saving nature as it faces dire challenges like pollution, over-extraction, and climate change”.
He expressed concern over the drying of rivers and called for urgent collective action to rejuvenate the rivers and their ecosystem.
“River systems are similar to the blood vessels of our body. If the vessels get choked, or toxic, the body will die. And if the tributaries and the rivers get toxic or choked, they will die,” he said and asked the faith leaders, scientists, and researchers how can we control the siltation and pollution of the rivers.
The Chief Minister said the government has channelised and dredged the Sangam bank by adopting mechanical methods.
“The flow of the river at Triveni Sangam has multiplied.”
Triveni Sangam is a sacred confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the ‘mystical’ Saraswati.
Triveni Sangam is located in Prayagraj.
Officials told IANS that ahead of the Mahakumbh 2025 the three streams of the Ganga were unified into a single flow which made Sangam more than just a river, a lifeline for millions of people, a symbol of cultural and spiritual heritage, besides a crucial ecological system that sustains life.
CM Yogi Adityanath said the government has carried out several sapling plantation drives to increase the forest cover.
“A total of 210 crore saplings were planted across the state in eight years with the survival rate of 70-80 per cent,” the Chief Minister added.
He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ban on single-use plastics.
Advocating for the need to save nature as its deterioration leads to the abnormal rise in natural calamities, CM Yogi Adityanath said two years ago 90 people died owing to lightning in just a few hours from Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) to Bihar.
“We have installed weather early warning systems, but more need to be installed.”
The Mahakumbh 2025, the world’s largest spiritual gathering, hosted the first-ever conclave.
Organised by the state Directorate of Environment and supported by the environment research organisation, iFOREST, the event titled ‘Faith of Kumbh and Climate Change’ saw more than 1,000 participants and 30 speakers representing religious institutions, government bodies, civil society, and academia.
The climate conclave comes at a time when climate change and environmental degradation are intensifying globally.
With its deep connection to sacred rivers and spiritual traditions, the Kumbh Mela offers an extraordinary platform to influence societal consciousness.
Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to galvanise climate action, the Uttar Pradesh government organised the event.
“Our Upanishads teach us that the entire world is a creation of the Almighty. We should use it, not exploit it. “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” sees the world as one. Our rivers, animals, forests, every life form in this entire ecosystem not only take but give back to the environment. Even the small creatures like bees give back,” said Swami Mukundananda, Founder, Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust.
“At a time like this, when climate crisis is impacting every part of the world, religious and spiritual leaders must play a pivotal role in inspiring sustainable practices and climate action,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, Chief Secretary, while releasing the ‘Mahakumbh Declaration on Climate Change’.
The conclave seeks to bridge the sacred and the sustainable, recognising that faith communities, with their moral authority and grassroots reach, are indispensable allies in the fight against the climate crisis.
“We have worshipped the creator for so long, let us not forget the creation. We must preserve and protect it. If we go on like this, we will neither have the Ganga nor the Yamuna. These will be mere stories. Our nation can only progress if our environment progresses,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, President of Paramarth Niketan.
“Religion and faith hold immense power to influence society. Climate action cannot succeed unless it resonates culturally and emotionally with the masses. Unlike scientists or policymakers, faith leaders know how to take a message to the people,” said Chandra Bhushan, President and CEO of iFOREST.
A cornerstone of the conclave is the Uttar Pradesh government’s pledge to “green” religious institutions.
The state envisions religious centres and shrines becoming models of sustainability. This includes installing solar panels, implementing rainwater harvesting systems, recycling waste, banning single-use plastics, and creating green zones around sacred spaces.
The state’s pledge also includes funding faith-based organisations to promote environmental and climate education, campaigns, and actionable practices.
Initiatives like eco-friendly pilgrimages, green festivals, and sustainable temple management can reduce the carbon footprint of religious practices.

Title: India, Japan joint military exercise to begin at Mount Fuji from Feb 25
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:05:27 +0000
Content: The sixth edition of Joint Military Exercise Dharma Guardian, between India and Japan, is scheduled at Mount Fuji, Japan from February 25 to March 9, the Indian Army said on Sunday.
The exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the two forces while undertaking joint urban warfare and counter-terrorism operations under UN mandate, said the Additional Directorate General of Public Information, IHQ of MoD (Army) in a social media post.
“Building on the momentum of the Chief of the Army Staff’s (COAS) successful visit to Japan from October 14 to 17, 2024, Exercise Dharma Guardian 2025 will further strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation between India and Japan,” it said.
Earlier on February 11, special forces of India and Egypt commenced the ‘Cyclone III’ exercise at Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in Rajasthan. An official said that the exercise would conclude on February 23.

Title: Champions Trophy: Batting-sorted India look favourites for title despite no Bumrah (SWOT Analysis)
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:44:34 +0000
Content: India, the reigning ICC Men’s T20 World Cup winners, enter the Champions Trophy with a 3-0 series sweep over England. The batters impressed with their scintillating knocks, while the bowlers were at their proficient best to bamboozle the England batters.
With all their matches in Dubai, India will be keen to continue the good momentum they have right now into going all the way towards the Champions Trophy. Here’s a SWOT analysis from IANS on the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team taking part in the Champions Trophy happening for the first time after 2017.
Strength: Undoubtedly, India’s main strength lies in their top four powerful batters. Captain Rohit Sharma showed parks of his ultra-attacking way of playing in the first ten overs while hitting 119 in Cuttack, while Shubman Gill stepped up to hit a fine century in Ahmedabad. The Rohit-Gill opening combination has been the most productive pairing for India.
Since joining forces in 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus stands, making for a highly useful opening combination for the Indian team in 50-over cricket.
Virat Kohli also got a fifty in Ahmedabad to add more confidence in India’s ability to control middle overs with the bat, while Shreyas Iyer has stepped up as a very solid number four batter. With Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja batting deep and in good current all-round form, it augurs well for the Indian team in their quest to register competitive scores in Dubai.
Weakness: With no Jasprit Bumrah, it means India are without a game-changing fast-bowling force who could turn around the game in a jiffy in any phase of the game. His absence is a body blow for India, as they would look up to Pandya, Mohammed Shami, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh to step up.
Another pocket of weakness India have is diluting the powers of KL Rahul. It’s no secret that Rahul has been a handy run-scorer at number five. But with head coach Gautam Gambhir’s liking for left-right combination taking precedence, it has meant Axar has batted at that slot.
Rahul, meanwhile, has been pushed to number six, a place where his recent returns have gone down. A decision like this might backfire if India collapses like a pack of cards in the quest of getting fast runs in their batting innings.
Opportunity: India last won the Champions Trophy in 2013, when MS Dhoni was at the helm. Since then, they have reached two semi-finals and as many finals in 50-over ICC events. While they missed a home ODI World Cup win in 2023 and another Champions Trophy triumph in 2017, they now have a golden chance to make up for it in Dubai.
A Champions Trophy triumph will give Rohit another ICC trophy after winning T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies last year, while the win will also ensure a big result is in Gambhir’s kitty after having a tumultuous time in his coaching stint so far.
Threat: By picking five spinners in Axar, Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, India have decided to keep all options open in terms of bowling composition. It’s clear that they are going in with an intention to play three spinners in their playing eleven, especially with Dubai coming off hosting ILT20 matches earlier this month.
But what if they are asked to defend totals, and dew sets in the evening in Dubai, it would mean that their spin-pronged strategy would backfire, which then poses a big threat to their chances of winning the tournament.
India squad: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakravarthy.

Title: Nerveless Niemann overhauls Ancer to win LIV Golf Adelaide title
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:33:54 +0000
Content: Joaquin Niemann hit a stunning seven-under par final round of 65 to claim the LIV Golf Adelaide title on Sunday, finishing on 13-under par to win by three shots as Sergio Garcia’s Fireballs quartet claimed victory in the team event.
The Chilean trailed a trio of players that included Abraham Ancer by three shots at the start of the day’s play at the Grange Golf Club, prevailing in a battle with the 33-year-old down the back nine to win his third LIV Golf event.
“I’m starting to feel the chills now because I didn’t want to get out of the game rhythm because you never know what could happen, but now I feel that relief and it feels awesome,” Niemann said.
Niemann started the day on six-under par but had pulled himself into contention by the time he reached the turn, picking up four shots to put pressure on Ancer, who had been flawless after birdying the first two holes to take a clear lead.
Another birdie at the 12th by Niemann, his fifth of the round, saw him draw level with Ancer, and he responded with a birdie of his own to go back in front.
But the pressure on Ancer started to tell on the par-three 14th when the Mexican-American put his tee shot into a greenside bunker before dropping his first shot of the day.
And while Ancer reclaimed that shot on the 16th, he missed his first fairway of the day on the 17th, going on to drop out of the lead with another bogey.
Niemann held his nerve to birdie the last, prompting Ancer to bogey the 18th and slip into a share for second with Carlos Ortiz.
Ancer at least had the consolation of securing victory with Garcia, Luis Masaveu and David Puig as the Fireballs finished six shots ahead of Legion XIII to claim the team title.
“It’s bittersweet with Abe (Ancer), the way he played, he was there the whole day and it would’ve been nice to get the double,” Garcia said. “Super proud of the way they all fought in tricky conditions.”

Title: WPL: DC’s victory was largely driven by Shafali and Niki’s crucial innings, opines Mithali Raj
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:45:32 +0000
Content: Former India captain Mithali Raj opined that Delhi Capitals nerve-wracking last-ball victory in the WPL match was largely driven by Shafali Verma and Niki Parsad’s crucial innings.
Delhi Capitals registered a two-wicket win over Mumbai Indians at the BCA Stadium. Mumbai posted total of 164 on the back of Nat Sciver-Brunt’s efforts (80 not out off 59) and a fiery cameo from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (42 off 22).
Shafali was in her element from the get-go in the run-chase, hitting a six and four boundaries off the innings’ second over from Saika Ishaque. It was the Shafali show as DC scored 60 in the powerplay.
Speaking about the high-intensity match on Jio Hotstar, Mithali said, “What can I say? The kind of match we witnessed today was remarkable. Last evening’s game was high-scoring, with a chase of 201 and big hits. But today, it was all about intensity. The momentum kept shifting between the teams so frequently that until the last ball, no one could predict the winner.”
Commenting on Niki’s performance, Mithali said the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain stepped into a high-pressure match and and managed it with impressive composure.
“Delhi Capitals’ victory was largely driven by Shafali Verma’s strong start, but Niki Prasad’s crucial 35-run innings was equally significant. When wickets were falling around her, she remained at the crease, providing stability. It was her first game, and coming fresh from the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain, she stepped into a high-pressure match and handled it with remarkable poise. There must have been nerves, but she fought through them brilliantly.
“Though we didn’t see much of it, her innings today was mature beyond her years. She had solid support from Alice Capsey and Sarah Bryce. In the end, as the game came down to two runs off two balls, she went for a big shot, which will come with experience. But what she has done today for Delhi Capitals is massive,” she said.
Reflecting on Shafali’s show, the former skipper added, “I think anyone stepping into Shafali Verma’s shoes would acknowledge how she has never shown a defensive approach. Right from the second ball, she started scoring runs, playing her shots with her usual flair. That’s just her style. The only way to dismiss her today was to outthink her, and I understand that feeling because I’ve been in that situation myself.
“At one point, she had too much time and wasn’t sure where to place the ball. Just before her dismissal, the fielding side adjusted their setup, bringing mid-on up and pushing deep square leg back because she had found boundaries there. She instinctively aimed to clear mid-on but ended up playing into the fielder’s hands, resulting in a crucial wicket.”
Former West Indian cricketer Stacy-Ann King commented on Niki Prasad’s brilliant innings, saying, “We saw what she could do in terms of India Under-19 team. But she didn’t have much chance to bat because of G Trisha and of course Kamalini, who were exceptional. After she started off a little shaky, she eventually just played her shots, and it was amazing.”
Stacy-Ann also shared her insights on the Mumbai Indians’ performance and said, The Harmanpreet-led side made a critical mistake during those five balls when MI didn’t complete their full 20 overs.
“When Harmanpreet spoke, she mentioned that those five balls where MI didn’t bat the full 20 overs were a critical mistake. Even scoring a single run in that phase could have made a difference. This is an opportunity for them to reassess their approach, particularly in handling their spinners,” she said.
“Hayley Matthews picked up key wickets, including Shafali and Sarah, but conceded 15 runs before that. Both teams can take valuable lessons from each other on how they approach their innings and how their bowlers strategise moving forward,” the West Indian added.

Title: Heart has ‘sweet taste’ receptors, can sense artificial sweeteners: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:11:20 +0000
Content: Researchers have found that the heart possesses “sweet taste” receptors, similar to those on our tongues, and stimulating these receptors with sweet substances can modulate the heartbeat.
The discovery opens new avenues for understanding heart function and potentially for developing novel treatments for heart failure.
The new research found that these receptors are not just present on heart muscle but also functional.
When the researchers stimulated these receptors in both human and mouse heart cells using aspartame, a common artificial sweetener, they observed a significant increase in the force of heart muscle contraction and accelerated calcium handling – key processes for a healthy heartbeat.
While taste receptors are traditionally associated with the tongue and our ability to perceive flavours, recent studies have shown that these receptors exist in other parts of the body, where they likely play different roles.
This new study is the first to identify specific “sweet taste” receptors, known as TAS1R2 and TAS1R3, on the surface of heart muscle cells.
“After you eat a meal, it’s been shown that your heart rate and blood pressure actually are increasing,” said Micah Yoder, a graduate student in the lab of Jonathan Kirk at Loyola University Chicago.
Previously, this was thought to be a neural axis that’s being signaled.
“But we’re proposing a more direct consequence, where we have a spike in our blood sugar after eating a meal, and that’s binding to these sweet taste receptors on the heart muscle cells, causing a difference in the heartbeat,” he added.
Intriguingly, the researchers also found that these receptors are more abundant in the hearts of patients with heart failure, suggesting a possible link to disease.
Further investigation revealed that stimulating the receptors triggers a cascade of molecular events within the heart cells, involving key proteins that control calcium flow and muscle contraction.
Additionally, their research may explain why high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is linked to arrhythmogenesis, or an irregular heartbeat.
Not only are these sweet taste receptors particularly stimulated by artificial sweeteners like aspartame, overstimulation of these sweet taste receptors lead to a an increase in arrhythmic like behaviour in the heart cells, researchers found.
However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of stimulating these receptors in the heart as well as how these receptors might be targeted to strengthen the heart in the case of heart failure.
The work was set to be presented at the 69th Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Los Angeles. The Biophysical Society has been established to lead development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics.

Title: US says website update routine, after removal of reference to Taiwan independence
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:28:34 +0000
Content: The U.S. State Department said it has made a routine update to the Taiwan section of its website, after the removal of previous wording saying it did not support Taiwan’s formal independence, among other changes that cheered the government in Taipei.
The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.
But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence”, the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organisations “where applicable”.
The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, was sworn in to his second term in the White House.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time.
“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the spokesperson said, referring to Washington’s officially taking no position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the subject.
“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.
“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”
China’s foreign ministry has yet to respond to requests for comment on the changes in the website’s wording.
On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations”.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island’s people can decide their future.
Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up the People’s Republic of China.

Boxing legend Mary Kom reflected on overcoming societal expectations. “In the beginning, it was very difficult because boxing is not considered a women’s sport. I just wanted to prove myself in front of all the girls and women in the country. In doing so, I have brought glory to the nation by becoming a World Champion multiple times,” she said
Two-time Paralympic champion shooter Avani Lekhara shared how knowledge helped her conquer fear: “We fear things that we don’t have knowledge about. I started gaining knowledge and improving myself, and in this way, my fear gradually decreased.”

Title: Mauritius’ former Prime Minister gets bail on money laundering charges
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:56:43 +0000
Content: A court in Mauritius has released former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on bail following his arrest on charges of money laundering, a magistrate at the court said.
Last month, the country’s former central bank governor was detained and released on bail after being charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.
An Indian Ocean archipelago, Mauritius is an offshore financial centre that markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia.
“He (Jugnauth) shall not interfere directly or indirectly with any witness or potential witness,” Rishan Chineah, the magistrate at the bail and remand court in the capital, Port Louis, said on Sunday.
The magistrate also barred Jugnauth from communicating about the case with anyone, except for investigation authorities or the court itself, and ordered him to appear on Monday to complete the bail process.
Jugnauth’s lawyer, Raouf Gulbul, told reporters his client denied the charges.
Jugnauth was provisionally charged with money laundering, the director of public prosecution told the court in a charge sheet.
In November, Mauritius’ new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam announced an audit of public finances days after questioning the accuracy of some government data compiled by the previous administration.

Title: China’s Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium was attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S.
Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, BYD’s  Wang Chuanfu, Unitree’s Wang Xingxing, and CATL’s Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed.
Meituan’s Wang Xing, China Feihe’s  Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed.
Tencent’s 0700.HK Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country’s business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said.
The symposium also comes as DeepSeek’s AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China’s broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets.
Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development.
But China’s efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities.
“It’s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.”
Tech shares in Hong Kong have roared higher in recent weeks on a combination of optimism about the DeepSeek AI breakthrough and a thawing of authorities’ approach to internet giants.
The Hang Seng technology index. HSTECH hit a three-year high in morning trade on Monday, having rallied on Friday after Reuters reported Xi was to chair Monday’s symposium. It slipped in volatile afternoon trade and was last down 1.3%.
Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
“Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis.
“Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.” (Reuters)

Title: Maddison earns Tottenham 1-0 victory over Man Utd

Content: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison’s early goal proved enough for the hosts to edge a 1-0 victory over fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United on Sunday.
Maddison, back in the starting lineup after injury, tapped home a rebound from close range in the 13th minute to settle a contest in which both sides showed their frailties.
Victory eased the pressure on Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou with his side moving above United into 12th place with 30 points. United dropped to 15th with 29 points.
It was another underwhelming display by Ruben Amorim’s United although they did have their chances with Alejandro Garnacho wasting a golden opportunity in the first half.

Title: Liverpool edge past Wolves to go seven points clear at top
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:52:51 +0000
Content: Premier League leaders Liverpool extended their advantage to seven points with a trickier-than-expected 2-1 win over lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield on Sunday courtesy of goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah.
Arne Slot’s team had looked to be cruising at 2-0 after Diaz bundled in on 15 minutes and won a penalty later in the half for strike partner Salah to convert with ease – a 23rd league goal for the league’s leading marksman.
But Wolves, fighting for their lives near the bottom, gave them a few frights and punished Liverpool for a sloppy second half when Matheus Cunha curled a low shot brilliantly past Alisson in the 67th minute.
In an edgy finale, Liverpool held on for the win, taking them to 60 points and still on track for the title with nearest rivals Arsenal on 53. Both have 13 games left.
“We just managed to dig deep,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said. “The second half was a slog … everyone gets nervous. But it’s a massive win for us and another game down.”
Wolves are 17th on 19 points, two above the drop zone.
Although Liverpool were far from their best, especially in a nervy second half, victory was a huge relief after a week of unusual slip-ups including an FA Cup defeat by second-tier Plymouth and a last-gasp equaliser for Everton against them in the league.
“We’d love to dominate for the full 90 minutes but it is the Premier League and Wolves can punish you and create dangerous moments against you. It says a lot we kept fighting and kept going and got the three points,” said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk.
“At times we were sloppy as well and we couldn’t keep the ball as well as we can.”
ALL-ACTION DIAZ
In the first half, the Reds looked comfortable after Diaz slotted home when Toti Gomes’ attempted clearance dropped kindly for him. The speedy Colombian was then brought down by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa for Salah to do what he always does – score easily from the spot – in the 37th minute.
Cunha was by far Wolves’ best player and had put a free kick just over before his glorious effort from outside the box had the away fans dreaming of a comeback.
Wolves’ recently-signed midfielder Marshall Munetsi, who saw a shot superbly saved by Alisson when one-on-one, said the players were proud of their second-half performance.
“We created a lot of chances and made them uncomfortable … the second half was the identity of the team, this is what the coach wants. This is something we have to keep doing.”
With a colossal fight against relegation to come, Wolves’ coach Vitor Pereira echoed that after so nearly matching the Premier League’s best team.
“We must play the first half as we played the second half, this is what I want to see in my team – the personality, courage and identity,” he said. “Even the best players in the world, if you press them they make mistakes.”

Jaishankar emphasized India’s commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and ensuring a stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
During the visit, Jaishankar held bilateral talks with Oman’s Foreign Minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi. Both leaders reviewed the “full spectrum of India-Oman relations” and discussed ways to enhance collaboration in areas of mutual interest, the MEA said.
As part of their meeting, Jaishankar and Albusaidi launched a logo commemorating 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and Oman. The MEA noted that the logo symbolizes the “long-standing partnership” based on shared history, culture, and strong people-to-people ties.
Additionally, the two leaders unveiled the book Mandvi to Muscat: Indian Community and the Shared History of India and Oman. Brought out by the Indian Embassy in Muscat, the book highlights the deep historical connections between the Indian diaspora and Oman, underscoring centuries-old ties that continue to influence bilateral relations.
On the sidelines of the conference, Jaishankar also met with the foreign ministers of Brunei, Bangladesh, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Nepal to discuss key regional and global issues of mutual interest.

Title: Brazilian youngster Fonseca triumphs at Argentina Open

Content: Joao Fonseca became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP tournament on Sunday after the 18-year-old captured the Argentina Open title with a 6-4 7-6(1) win over home favourite Francisco Cerundolo.
Fonseca has established himself as one of the game’s most exciting young talents with his victory at the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah in December and his win over ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the first round of the Australian Open last month.
He lost to Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego in five sets in the second round at Melbourne Park.
“It is a dream, I work every day for these moments. Playing a final away from home, in Argentina, is difficult,” said Fonseca after denying fifth seed Cerundolo the title in front of a raucous crowd in Buenos Aires.
“It’s very special and I’ve taken another step forward in my career and I’m closer to my dream of becoming world number one,” he told a press conference.
Fonseca also defeated Argentines Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Federico Coria and Mariano Navone in the earlier rounds before beating Serbian Laslo Djere in the last four.
Cerundolo had stunned top seed Alexander Zverev of Germany in the quarter-finals before knocking out Spain’s Pedro Martinez in the semis. (Reuters)

Title: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured

Content: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured
Papal selection thriller “Conclave” and period drama “The Brutalist” were the big winners at the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, winning four prizes each.
“Conclave”, which had led nominations with 12 nods, won the night’s most coveted award, best film, as well as outstanding British film, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
“We live in a time of a crisis of democracy and institutions that are usually used to bring us together are used to pull us apart,” “Conclave” director Edward Berger said in his acceptance speech for the outstanding British film award.
“And sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith in that situation but that’s why we make movies and that’s why we made this movie.”
“The Brutalist”, a three-and-a-half hour tale about a Hungarian immigrant architect trying to rebuild his life in the United States post-World War Two, had also been considered a frontrunner for best film. It won best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for its star, Adrien Brody.
“This film is really about this pursuit of leaving something meaningful and I think that is something we can all relate to,” Brody said in his acceptance speech.
“The Brutalist” also won original score and cinematography.
In one of the big surprises of the night, Mikey Madison won the leading actress category for portraying an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch’s son in “Anora”.
Many had considered the frontrunners to be Demi Moore, who has received multiple honours for her performance in body horror “The Substance”, and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in “Hard Truths”.
“I really wasn’t expecting this,” Madison said.
“I want to take to a moment to recognise the sex worker community … you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be your friend.”
“Anora”, considered a strong awards season contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month’s Academy Awards, was also up for best film, as was Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown”.
SALDANA, CULKIN WIN
Fellow best film nominee “Emilia Perez”, which mixes the diverse genres of musical and crime, triumphed in the film not in the English language category.
“This is too nice, you shouldn’t have done that,” director Jacques Audiard said, accepting his award. “This award is not just for me but everyone who worked tirelessly on this film.”
He thanked the film’s cast members, including an absent Karla Sofia Gascon, who had been nominated for leading actress.
Zoe Saldana won supporting actress for her portrayal of a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman.
“Emilia Perez”, had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.
In the supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin won for dramedy “A Real Pain”. The movie also picked up best original screenplay for writer-director Jesse Eisenberg.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:35:09 +0000
Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty bounce back to end 8-day losing streak
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:55:23 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices rebounded on Monday, snapping an eight-day losing streak and closing the trading session in positive territory.
The Sensex rose by 57.65 points, or 0.08 percent, finishing at 75,996.86, while the Nifty gained 30.25 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 22,959.50.
Of the 50 stocks comprising the Nifty index, 34 ended the day in the green, with Adani Enterprises leading the gains, surging 4 percent.
Among the top gainers were Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Power Grid and IndusInd Bank.
On the other hand, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank were among the major losers, with their shares falling as much as 3.45 percent.
The broader markets also saw a recovery in the second half of the trading day.
The Nifty Midcap100 index closed with a gain of 0.39 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index ended with a marginal increase of 0.04 percent.
Among the sectors on the NSE, Pharma, Banks, Financial Services, Healthcare, OMCs, Consumer Durables, and Metals showed positive movements.
The Nifty Pharma index was the top performer, which rose 1.27 percent during the session, with Glenmark Pharma and Ajanta Pharma leading the gains.
However, the Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Media indices ended lower, with declines of up to 0.71 percent.
According to experts, recent shifts in global policies, especially those emerging from the US, are invoking a sense of uncertainty among foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which in turn is reshaping their investment strategies in dynamic markets like India.
Additionally, the prevailing high valuations in the Indian stock market have added to the caution among investors, said Vipul Bhowar of Waterfield Advisors.
Last week, both indices ended their two-week winning streak with significant losses.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs and expands SWAMIH fund
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:52:41 +0000
Content: The Centre on Monday launched the ‘Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs’, which was announced in the Union Budget 2025-26 to boost the micro, small, and medium enterprises.
The scheme facilitates collateral-free loans to MSMEs by providing loans up to Rs 100 crore for the purchase of plant, machinery, or equipment.
The scheme would provide 60 per cent guarantee coverage by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) to member lending institutions (MLIs) for a credit facility up to Rs 100 crore, sanctioned to eligible MSMEs under MCGS-MSME for the purchase of equipment/machinery.
Launching the scheme here, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also distributed sanction letters to MSMEs eligible under the scheme in Mumbai.
The scheme is expected to facilitate easy availability of credit for MSMEs and give a major boost to the manufacturing sector in India.
Under the scheme, the borrower must be an MSME with a valid Udyam Registration Number. The guaranteed loan amount will not exceed Rs 100 crore, although the total project cost can be higher. Additionally, at least 75% of the project cost must be for purchasing equipment or machinery.
FM Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary also handed over the keys to homebuyers who have benefitted due to the SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing) Fund during the post-Budget interaction programme with stakeholders here.
As of January 24, the SWAMIH Fund has successfully delivered over 50,000 homes, with a commitment to deliver an additional 20,000 homes each year for the next three years.
As announced in Union Budget 2025-26, SWAMIH Fund 2 will be established as a blended finance facility with contributions from the government, banks, and private investors.
This fund of Rs 15,000 crore will aim for expeditious completion of another 1 lakh units.
At a media interaction during the event, the Finance Minister said that the last three Budgets focused on improving MSMEs, including the government-guaranteed loan in the current Budget.
She stressed that the government’s focus has not shifted from capital expenditure to consumption expenditure.
FM Sithraraman further stated that the Centre is working on more reforms in the insurance sector, in which 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) has been allowed.
The current Budget proposes to raise the FDI cap for the insurance sector from 74 per cent to 100 per cent.
Guardrails are being put so that citizens’ money towards premium payment for insurance is kept within the country, she said.

Title: Government actively considering raising deposit insurance limit beyond Rs 5 lakh
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:49:57 +0000
Content: The Union Government is actively considering a proposal to raise the deposit insurance limit beyond ₹5 lakh, confirmed M Nagaraju, Secretary, Department of Financial Services (DFS), during a press conference in Mumbai on Monday.
“As and when the government approves, we will notify it. This is under the consideration of the government,” Nagaraju stated when questioned about the ongoing crisis at New India Cooperative Bank. He emphasized that the increase in deposit insurance coverage remains under active review.
India introduced deposit insurance in 1962, becoming the second country globally after the United States to implement such a scheme. The measure was a response to banking crises worldwide, highlighting the need for robust depositor protection. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) currently insures deposits up to ₹5 lakh, a limit that was last raised from ₹1 lakh on February 4, 2020.
Regarding the troubled Mumbai-based New India Cooperative Bank, Nagaraju declined to comment on its status, stating, “The RBI is seized of the matter… we are not going to comment on that.” He advised depositors to contact the bank or visit the DICGC website for updates on their deposit insurance claims.
The crisis at New India Cooperative Bank escalated on February 14, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the bank’s Board of Directors for 12 months, citing “material concerns due to poor governance standards.” This action followed the central bank’s decision on February 13 to impose severe restrictions on the lender’s operations. The RBI barred the bank from granting loans, accepting new deposits, or making payments without its prior approval. Withdrawals from savings or current accounts were also frozen, with limited exceptions for loan settlements.
The restrictions triggered panic among customers, leading to large crowds outside the bank’s branches in Mumbai, Thane, Surat, and Pune. Depositors voiced fears about their savings and locker access. Bank officials assured customers that access to lockers would be maintained.
New India Cooperative Bank, established with multi-state status in 1999, operates 30 branches across Maharashtra and Gujarat. It achieved scheduled bank status on November 1, 1990. The current crisis marks a significant setback in the bank’s four-decade history.

Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent his foreign minister and a senior Kremlin adviser to meet U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss restoring relations and possible talks to end the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said after a call with Putin on Wednesday that they would begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine immediately, and that they had also discussed the Middle East, energy, the U.S. dollar and Artificial Intelligence.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due in Saudi Arabia to meet Russian officials alongside Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, and Steve Witkoff, White House Middle East envoy.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister since 2004, and Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy advisor, were flying to Riyadh at the request of Putin.
“They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,” Peskov said.
“It will also be devoted to the preparation of possible negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement and the organisation of a meeting between the two presidents.”
Peskov declined to comment on a Reuters report that Kirill Dmitriev, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund chief, would also meet the U.S. delegation.
He also declined to comment when asked if Putin and Trump would meet face-to-face in Saudi Arabia later this month. (Reuters)

Title: Israeli military says it killed Hamas official in southern Lebanon
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 15:34:31 +0000
Content: The Israeli military on Monday killed a Hamas leader in southern Lebanon’s Sidon area, it said in a statement.
The army said Muhammad Shaheen was the head of the operations department of Hamas in Lebanon and that he had recently been involved in promoting “terrorist plots” with Iranian direction and funding from Lebanese territory against Israeli citizens.
An Israeli strike on a car in Lebanon’s southern port city of Sidon targeted an official in the Palestinian militant group, two Lebanese security sources told Reuters earlier.
Lebanon’s state news agency said rescuers had removed one body from the car but did not identify the victim.
The Israeli military has been carrying out strikes against members of Hamas, allied Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and other factions in Lebanon, in parallel with the Gaza war.
Those armed groups have launched rockets, drones and artillery attacks across the border into northern Israel.
Under a truce brokered by Washington in November, Israeli troops were granted 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon where they had waged a ground offensive against fighters from Iran-backed Hezbollah since early October.
That deadline was later extended to February 18, but Israel’s military requested that it keep troops in five posts in southern Lebanon, sources told Reuters last week.

Title: India showcases food industry strength at Gulfood 2025

Content: Gulfood 2025, one of the world’s largest food and beverage trade exhibitions, has commenced at the Dubai World Trade Centre, featuring over 5,500 exhibitors from 129 countries. Spanning 24 halls and 1.3 million square feet, the event highlights more than one million products, reinforcing Dubai’s role as a global food trade hub.
India has a significant presence at the event, with 370 companies participating, including 122 under six key industry associations and 248 independent exhibitors. Leading organizations such as the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India, Assocham, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), and the Indian Oilseeds & Produce Export Promotion Council (IOPEPC) are spearheading India’s representation.
Chirag Paswan, India’s Minister for Food Processing Industries, inaugurated the Indian Pavilion in the presence of Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan and other dignitaries. Speaking at the event, Paswan emphasized India’s commitment to global partnerships in food processing.
“Under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is fostering global collaborations in the food processing sector, encouraging investments, and integrating digital technologies to develop a future-ready food ecosystem,” he stated during his keynote address at the Leadership Summit in Dubai.
He further added, “India’s presence at Gulfood 2025 is a testament to our commitment to becoming a global leader in food processing and agri-exports. This event will showcase India’s strengths in food processing and value addition while fostering new collaborations and innovative food solutions. Our participation will help expand India’s footprint in new markets and establish sustainable supply chains that benefit both producers and consumers worldwide.”
Highlighting India’s growing role in the global food industry, Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan remarked, “India’s strengthened trade ties are reflected in its expanding role in global food supply chains. The country’s leadership in pulses, cereals, and grains is a testament to its ability to meet rising global demand for sustainable and nutritious food.”
This year, India’s participation at Gulfood 2025 emphasizes sustainability, technology-driven supply chains, and product diversification. With the Gulf region being a key market, the Indian Consulate in Dubai has actively supported Indian businesses by facilitating B2B meetings, networking events, and trade delegations.
The Indian Mission, in collaboration with NAFED, APEDA, and FIEO, provides exhibitors with branding support, market insights, regulatory guidance, and access to buyers and distributors. Additionally, interactive knowledge sessions with business delegations, including the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and IGTD Exim Chamber of Commerce, aim to enhance market understanding for Indian producers.
The demand for specific Indian products in the Gulf region continues to grow, driven by the large Indian diaspora and strong bilateral trade relations. Spices, rice, ready-to-eat meals, and Ayurvedic products remain highly sought after, alongside textiles, jewelry, and emerging sectors like electronics and IT.
The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has further boosted trade flows, with e-commerce platforms such as Amazon UAE and Noon expanding market access for Indian brands.
In 2023, India exported $1.61 billion worth of processed food and agricultural products to the UAE, underscoring the strong trade relationship between the two nations. With India’s dynamic presence at Gulfood 2025, the country is poised to further strengthen its footprint in the global food industry.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow

Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.
Under the government’s Deep Ocean Mission initiatives, the Ministry of Earth Sciences has entrusted the National Institute of Ocean Technology with the ambitious task of designing and developing the Matsya-6000, as part of the Samudrayan Project.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”
