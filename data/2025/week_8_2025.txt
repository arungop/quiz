Title: River systems similar to blood vessels of our body, says UP CM at ‘Faith of Kumbh’ conclave
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:20:06 +0000
Content: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that more than 52 crore devotees have taken a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam during the ongoing Mahakumbh Mela.
This has been the largest congregation in human history for a religious event.
Speaking at the inauguration of a climate conclave that saw the role of religious leaders in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, CM Yogi Adityanath “emphasised saving nature as it faces dire challenges like pollution, over-extraction, and climate change”.
He expressed concern over the drying of rivers and called for urgent collective action to rejuvenate the rivers and their ecosystem.
“River systems are similar to the blood vessels of our body. If the vessels get choked, or toxic, the body will die. And if the tributaries and the rivers get toxic or choked, they will die,” he said and asked the faith leaders, scientists, and researchers how can we control the siltation and pollution of the rivers.
The Chief Minister said the government has channelised and dredged the Sangam bank by adopting mechanical methods.
“The flow of the river at Triveni Sangam has multiplied.”
Triveni Sangam is a sacred confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the ‘mystical’ Saraswati.
Triveni Sangam is located in Prayagraj.
Officials told IANS that ahead of the Mahakumbh 2025 the three streams of the Ganga were unified into a single flow which made Sangam more than just a river, a lifeline for millions of people, a symbol of cultural and spiritual heritage, besides a crucial ecological system that sustains life.
CM Yogi Adityanath said the government has carried out several sapling plantation drives to increase the forest cover.
“A total of 210 crore saplings were planted across the state in eight years with the survival rate of 70-80 per cent,” the Chief Minister added.
He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ban on single-use plastics.
Advocating for the need to save nature as its deterioration leads to the abnormal rise in natural calamities, CM Yogi Adityanath said two years ago 90 people died owing to lightning in just a few hours from Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) to Bihar.
“We have installed weather early warning systems, but more need to be installed.”
The Mahakumbh 2025, the world’s largest spiritual gathering, hosted the first-ever conclave.
Organised by the state Directorate of Environment and supported by the environment research organisation, iFOREST, the event titled ‘Faith of Kumbh and Climate Change’ saw more than 1,000 participants and 30 speakers representing religious institutions, government bodies, civil society, and academia.
The climate conclave comes at a time when climate change and environmental degradation are intensifying globally.
With its deep connection to sacred rivers and spiritual traditions, the Kumbh Mela offers an extraordinary platform to influence societal consciousness.
Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to galvanise climate action, the Uttar Pradesh government organised the event.
“Our Upanishads teach us that the entire world is a creation of the Almighty. We should use it, not exploit it. “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” sees the world as one. Our rivers, animals, forests, every life form in this entire ecosystem not only take but give back to the environment. Even the small creatures like bees give back,” said Swami Mukundananda, Founder, Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust.
“At a time like this, when climate crisis is impacting every part of the world, religious and spiritual leaders must play a pivotal role in inspiring sustainable practices and climate action,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, Chief Secretary, while releasing the ‘Mahakumbh Declaration on Climate Change’.
The conclave seeks to bridge the sacred and the sustainable, recognising that faith communities, with their moral authority and grassroots reach, are indispensable allies in the fight against the climate crisis.
“We have worshipped the creator for so long, let us not forget the creation. We must preserve and protect it. If we go on like this, we will neither have the Ganga nor the Yamuna. These will be mere stories. Our nation can only progress if our environment progresses,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, President of Paramarth Niketan.
“Religion and faith hold immense power to influence society. Climate action cannot succeed unless it resonates culturally and emotionally with the masses. Unlike scientists or policymakers, faith leaders know how to take a message to the people,” said Chandra Bhushan, President and CEO of iFOREST.
A cornerstone of the conclave is the Uttar Pradesh government’s pledge to “green” religious institutions.
The state envisions religious centres and shrines becoming models of sustainability. This includes installing solar panels, implementing rainwater harvesting systems, recycling waste, banning single-use plastics, and creating green zones around sacred spaces.
The state’s pledge also includes funding faith-based organisations to promote environmental and climate education, campaigns, and actionable practices.
Initiatives like eco-friendly pilgrimages, green festivals, and sustainable temple management can reduce the carbon footprint of religious practices.

Title: India, Japan joint military exercise to begin at Mount Fuji from Feb 25
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:05:27 +0000
Content: The sixth edition of Joint Military Exercise Dharma Guardian, between India and Japan, is scheduled at Mount Fuji, Japan from February 25 to March 9, the Indian Army said on Sunday.
The exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the two forces while undertaking joint urban warfare and counter-terrorism operations under UN mandate, said the Additional Directorate General of Public Information, IHQ of MoD (Army) in a social media post.
“Building on the momentum of the Chief of the Army Staff’s (COAS) successful visit to Japan from October 14 to 17, 2024, Exercise Dharma Guardian 2025 will further strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation between India and Japan,” it said.
Earlier on February 11, special forces of India and Egypt commenced the ‘Cyclone III’ exercise at Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in Rajasthan. An official said that the exercise would conclude on February 23.

Title: Champions Trophy: Batting-sorted India look favourites for title despite no Bumrah (SWOT Analysis)
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:44:34 +0000
Content: India, the reigning ICC Men’s T20 World Cup winners, enter the Champions Trophy with a 3-0 series sweep over England. The batters impressed with their scintillating knocks, while the bowlers were at their proficient best to bamboozle the England batters.
With all their matches in Dubai, India will be keen to continue the good momentum they have right now into going all the way towards the Champions Trophy. Here’s a SWOT analysis from IANS on the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team taking part in the Champions Trophy happening for the first time after 2017.
Strength: Undoubtedly, India’s main strength lies in their top four powerful batters. Captain Rohit Sharma showed parks of his ultra-attacking way of playing in the first ten overs while hitting 119 in Cuttack, while Shubman Gill stepped up to hit a fine century in Ahmedabad. The Rohit-Gill opening combination has been the most productive pairing for India.
Since joining forces in 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus stands, making for a highly useful opening combination for the Indian team in 50-over cricket.
Virat Kohli also got a fifty in Ahmedabad to add more confidence in India’s ability to control middle overs with the bat, while Shreyas Iyer has stepped up as a very solid number four batter. With Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja batting deep and in good current all-round form, it augurs well for the Indian team in their quest to register competitive scores in Dubai.
Weakness: With no Jasprit Bumrah, it means India are without a game-changing fast-bowling force who could turn around the game in a jiffy in any phase of the game. His absence is a body blow for India, as they would look up to Pandya, Mohammed Shami, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh to step up.
Another pocket of weakness India have is diluting the powers of KL Rahul. It’s no secret that Rahul has been a handy run-scorer at number five. But with head coach Gautam Gambhir’s liking for left-right combination taking precedence, it has meant Axar has batted at that slot.
Rahul, meanwhile, has been pushed to number six, a place where his recent returns have gone down. A decision like this might backfire if India collapses like a pack of cards in the quest of getting fast runs in their batting innings.
Opportunity: India last won the Champions Trophy in 2013, when MS Dhoni was at the helm. Since then, they have reached two semi-finals and as many finals in 50-over ICC events. While they missed a home ODI World Cup win in 2023 and another Champions Trophy triumph in 2017, they now have a golden chance to make up for it in Dubai.
A Champions Trophy triumph will give Rohit another ICC trophy after winning T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies last year, while the win will also ensure a big result is in Gambhir’s kitty after having a tumultuous time in his coaching stint so far.
Threat: By picking five spinners in Axar, Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, India have decided to keep all options open in terms of bowling composition. It’s clear that they are going in with an intention to play three spinners in their playing eleven, especially with Dubai coming off hosting ILT20 matches earlier this month.
But what if they are asked to defend totals, and dew sets in the evening in Dubai, it would mean that their spin-pronged strategy would backfire, which then poses a big threat to their chances of winning the tournament.
India squad: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakravarthy.

Title: Nerveless Niemann overhauls Ancer to win LIV Golf Adelaide title
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:33:54 +0000
Content: Joaquin Niemann hit a stunning seven-under par final round of 65 to claim the LIV Golf Adelaide title on Sunday, finishing on 13-under par to win by three shots as Sergio Garcia’s Fireballs quartet claimed victory in the team event.
The Chilean trailed a trio of players that included Abraham Ancer by three shots at the start of the day’s play at the Grange Golf Club, prevailing in a battle with the 33-year-old down the back nine to win his third LIV Golf event.
“I’m starting to feel the chills now because I didn’t want to get out of the game rhythm because you never know what could happen, but now I feel that relief and it feels awesome,” Niemann said.
Niemann started the day on six-under par but had pulled himself into contention by the time he reached the turn, picking up four shots to put pressure on Ancer, who had been flawless after birdying the first two holes to take a clear lead.
Another birdie at the 12th by Niemann, his fifth of the round, saw him draw level with Ancer, and he responded with a birdie of his own to go back in front.
But the pressure on Ancer started to tell on the par-three 14th when the Mexican-American put his tee shot into a greenside bunker before dropping his first shot of the day.
And while Ancer reclaimed that shot on the 16th, he missed his first fairway of the day on the 17th, going on to drop out of the lead with another bogey.
Niemann held his nerve to birdie the last, prompting Ancer to bogey the 18th and slip into a share for second with Carlos Ortiz.
Ancer at least had the consolation of securing victory with Garcia, Luis Masaveu and David Puig as the Fireballs finished six shots ahead of Legion XIII to claim the team title.
“It’s bittersweet with Abe (Ancer), the way he played, he was there the whole day and it would’ve been nice to get the double,” Garcia said. “Super proud of the way they all fought in tricky conditions.”

Title: WPL: DC’s victory was largely driven by Shafali and Niki’s crucial innings, opines Mithali Raj
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:45:32 +0000
Content: Former India captain Mithali Raj opined that Delhi Capitals nerve-wracking last-ball victory in the WPL match was largely driven by Shafali Verma and Niki Parsad’s crucial innings.
Delhi Capitals registered a two-wicket win over Mumbai Indians at the BCA Stadium. Mumbai posted total of 164 on the back of Nat Sciver-Brunt’s efforts (80 not out off 59) and a fiery cameo from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (42 off 22).
Shafali was in her element from the get-go in the run-chase, hitting a six and four boundaries off the innings’ second over from Saika Ishaque. It was the Shafali show as DC scored 60 in the powerplay.
Speaking about the high-intensity match on Jio Hotstar, Mithali said, “What can I say? The kind of match we witnessed today was remarkable. Last evening’s game was high-scoring, with a chase of 201 and big hits. But today, it was all about intensity. The momentum kept shifting between the teams so frequently that until the last ball, no one could predict the winner.”
Commenting on Niki’s performance, Mithali said the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain stepped into a high-pressure match and and managed it with impressive composure.
“Delhi Capitals’ victory was largely driven by Shafali Verma’s strong start, but Niki Prasad’s crucial 35-run innings was equally significant. When wickets were falling around her, she remained at the crease, providing stability. It was her first game, and coming fresh from the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain, she stepped into a high-pressure match and handled it with remarkable poise. There must have been nerves, but she fought through them brilliantly.
“Though we didn’t see much of it, her innings today was mature beyond her years. She had solid support from Alice Capsey and Sarah Bryce. In the end, as the game came down to two runs off two balls, she went for a big shot, which will come with experience. But what she has done today for Delhi Capitals is massive,” she said.
Reflecting on Shafali’s show, the former skipper added, “I think anyone stepping into Shafali Verma’s shoes would acknowledge how she has never shown a defensive approach. Right from the second ball, she started scoring runs, playing her shots with her usual flair. That’s just her style. The only way to dismiss her today was to outthink her, and I understand that feeling because I’ve been in that situation myself.
“At one point, she had too much time and wasn’t sure where to place the ball. Just before her dismissal, the fielding side adjusted their setup, bringing mid-on up and pushing deep square leg back because she had found boundaries there. She instinctively aimed to clear mid-on but ended up playing into the fielder’s hands, resulting in a crucial wicket.”
Former West Indian cricketer Stacy-Ann King commented on Niki Prasad’s brilliant innings, saying, “We saw what she could do in terms of India Under-19 team. But she didn’t have much chance to bat because of G Trisha and of course Kamalini, who were exceptional. After she started off a little shaky, she eventually just played her shots, and it was amazing.”
Stacy-Ann also shared her insights on the Mumbai Indians’ performance and said, The Harmanpreet-led side made a critical mistake during those five balls when MI didn’t complete their full 20 overs.
“When Harmanpreet spoke, she mentioned that those five balls where MI didn’t bat the full 20 overs were a critical mistake. Even scoring a single run in that phase could have made a difference. This is an opportunity for them to reassess their approach, particularly in handling their spinners,” she said.
“Hayley Matthews picked up key wickets, including Shafali and Sarah, but conceded 15 runs before that. Both teams can take valuable lessons from each other on how they approach their innings and how their bowlers strategise moving forward,” the West Indian added.

Title: Heart has ‘sweet taste’ receptors, can sense artificial sweeteners: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:11:20 +0000
Content: Researchers have found that the heart possesses “sweet taste” receptors, similar to those on our tongues, and stimulating these receptors with sweet substances can modulate the heartbeat.
The discovery opens new avenues for understanding heart function and potentially for developing novel treatments for heart failure.
The new research found that these receptors are not just present on heart muscle but also functional.
When the researchers stimulated these receptors in both human and mouse heart cells using aspartame, a common artificial sweetener, they observed a significant increase in the force of heart muscle contraction and accelerated calcium handling – key processes for a healthy heartbeat.
While taste receptors are traditionally associated with the tongue and our ability to perceive flavours, recent studies have shown that these receptors exist in other parts of the body, where they likely play different roles.
This new study is the first to identify specific “sweet taste” receptors, known as TAS1R2 and TAS1R3, on the surface of heart muscle cells.
“After you eat a meal, it’s been shown that your heart rate and blood pressure actually are increasing,” said Micah Yoder, a graduate student in the lab of Jonathan Kirk at Loyola University Chicago.
Previously, this was thought to be a neural axis that’s being signaled.
“But we’re proposing a more direct consequence, where we have a spike in our blood sugar after eating a meal, and that’s binding to these sweet taste receptors on the heart muscle cells, causing a difference in the heartbeat,” he added.
Intriguingly, the researchers also found that these receptors are more abundant in the hearts of patients with heart failure, suggesting a possible link to disease.
Further investigation revealed that stimulating the receptors triggers a cascade of molecular events within the heart cells, involving key proteins that control calcium flow and muscle contraction.
Additionally, their research may explain why high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is linked to arrhythmogenesis, or an irregular heartbeat.
Not only are these sweet taste receptors particularly stimulated by artificial sweeteners like aspartame, overstimulation of these sweet taste receptors lead to a an increase in arrhythmic like behaviour in the heart cells, researchers found.
However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of stimulating these receptors in the heart as well as how these receptors might be targeted to strengthen the heart in the case of heart failure.
The work was set to be presented at the 69th Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Los Angeles. The Biophysical Society has been established to lead development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics.

Title: US says website update routine, after removal of reference to Taiwan independence
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:28:34 +0000
Content: The U.S. State Department said it has made a routine update to the Taiwan section of its website, after the removal of previous wording saying it did not support Taiwan’s formal independence, among other changes that cheered the government in Taipei.
The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.
But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence”, the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organisations “where applicable”.
The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, was sworn in to his second term in the White House.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time.
“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the spokesperson said, referring to Washington’s officially taking no position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the subject.
“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.
“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”
China’s foreign ministry has yet to respond to requests for comment on the changes in the website’s wording.
On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations”.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island’s people can decide their future.
Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up the People’s Republic of China.

Boxing legend Mary Kom reflected on overcoming societal expectations. “In the beginning, it was very difficult because boxing is not considered a women’s sport. I just wanted to prove myself in front of all the girls and women in the country. In doing so, I have brought glory to the nation by becoming a World Champion multiple times,” she said
Two-time Paralympic champion shooter Avani Lekhara shared how knowledge helped her conquer fear: “We fear things that we don’t have knowledge about. I started gaining knowledge and improving myself, and in this way, my fear gradually decreased.”

Title: Mauritius’ former Prime Minister gets bail on money laundering charges
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:56:43 +0000
Content: A court in Mauritius has released former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on bail following his arrest on charges of money laundering, a magistrate at the court said.
Last month, the country’s former central bank governor was detained and released on bail after being charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.
An Indian Ocean archipelago, Mauritius is an offshore financial centre that markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia.
“He (Jugnauth) shall not interfere directly or indirectly with any witness or potential witness,” Rishan Chineah, the magistrate at the bail and remand court in the capital, Port Louis, said on Sunday.
The magistrate also barred Jugnauth from communicating about the case with anyone, except for investigation authorities or the court itself, and ordered him to appear on Monday to complete the bail process.
Jugnauth’s lawyer, Raouf Gulbul, told reporters his client denied the charges.
Jugnauth was provisionally charged with money laundering, the director of public prosecution told the court in a charge sheet.
In November, Mauritius’ new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam announced an audit of public finances days after questioning the accuracy of some government data compiled by the previous administration.

Title: China’s Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium was attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S.
Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, BYD’s  Wang Chuanfu, Unitree’s Wang Xingxing, and CATL’s Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed.
Meituan’s Wang Xing, China Feihe’s  Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed.
Tencent’s 0700.HK Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country’s business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said.
The symposium also comes as DeepSeek’s AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China’s broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets.
Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development.
But China’s efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities.
“It’s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.”
Tech shares in Hong Kong have roared higher in recent weeks on a combination of optimism about the DeepSeek AI breakthrough and a thawing of authorities’ approach to internet giants.
The Hang Seng technology index. HSTECH hit a three-year high in morning trade on Monday, having rallied on Friday after Reuters reported Xi was to chair Monday’s symposium. It slipped in volatile afternoon trade and was last down 1.3%.
Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
“Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis.
“Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.” (Reuters)

Title: Maddison earns Tottenham 1-0 victory over Man Utd

Content: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison’s early goal proved enough for the hosts to edge a 1-0 victory over fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United on Sunday.
Maddison, back in the starting lineup after injury, tapped home a rebound from close range in the 13th minute to settle a contest in which both sides showed their frailties.
Victory eased the pressure on Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou with his side moving above United into 12th place with 30 points. United dropped to 15th with 29 points.
It was another underwhelming display by Ruben Amorim’s United although they did have their chances with Alejandro Garnacho wasting a golden opportunity in the first half.

Title: Liverpool edge past Wolves to go seven points clear at top
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:52:51 +0000
Content: Premier League leaders Liverpool extended their advantage to seven points with a trickier-than-expected 2-1 win over lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield on Sunday courtesy of goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah.
Arne Slot’s team had looked to be cruising at 2-0 after Diaz bundled in on 15 minutes and won a penalty later in the half for strike partner Salah to convert with ease – a 23rd league goal for the league’s leading marksman.
But Wolves, fighting for their lives near the bottom, gave them a few frights and punished Liverpool for a sloppy second half when Matheus Cunha curled a low shot brilliantly past Alisson in the 67th minute.
In an edgy finale, Liverpool held on for the win, taking them to 60 points and still on track for the title with nearest rivals Arsenal on 53. Both have 13 games left.
“We just managed to dig deep,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said. “The second half was a slog … everyone gets nervous. But it’s a massive win for us and another game down.”
Wolves are 17th on 19 points, two above the drop zone.
Although Liverpool were far from their best, especially in a nervy second half, victory was a huge relief after a week of unusual slip-ups including an FA Cup defeat by second-tier Plymouth and a last-gasp equaliser for Everton against them in the league.
“We’d love to dominate for the full 90 minutes but it is the Premier League and Wolves can punish you and create dangerous moments against you. It says a lot we kept fighting and kept going and got the three points,” said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk.
“At times we were sloppy as well and we couldn’t keep the ball as well as we can.”
ALL-ACTION DIAZ
In the first half, the Reds looked comfortable after Diaz slotted home when Toti Gomes’ attempted clearance dropped kindly for him. The speedy Colombian was then brought down by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa for Salah to do what he always does – score easily from the spot – in the 37th minute.
Cunha was by far Wolves’ best player and had put a free kick just over before his glorious effort from outside the box had the away fans dreaming of a comeback.
Wolves’ recently-signed midfielder Marshall Munetsi, who saw a shot superbly saved by Alisson when one-on-one, said the players were proud of their second-half performance.
“We created a lot of chances and made them uncomfortable … the second half was the identity of the team, this is what the coach wants. This is something we have to keep doing.”
With a colossal fight against relegation to come, Wolves’ coach Vitor Pereira echoed that after so nearly matching the Premier League’s best team.
“We must play the first half as we played the second half, this is what I want to see in my team – the personality, courage and identity,” he said. “Even the best players in the world, if you press them they make mistakes.”

Jaishankar emphasized India’s commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and ensuring a stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
During the visit, Jaishankar held bilateral talks with Oman’s Foreign Minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi. Both leaders reviewed the “full spectrum of India-Oman relations” and discussed ways to enhance collaboration in areas of mutual interest, the MEA said.
As part of their meeting, Jaishankar and Albusaidi launched a logo commemorating 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and Oman. The MEA noted that the logo symbolizes the “long-standing partnership” based on shared history, culture, and strong people-to-people ties.
Additionally, the two leaders unveiled the book Mandvi to Muscat: Indian Community and the Shared History of India and Oman. Brought out by the Indian Embassy in Muscat, the book highlights the deep historical connections between the Indian diaspora and Oman, underscoring centuries-old ties that continue to influence bilateral relations.
On the sidelines of the conference, Jaishankar also met with the foreign ministers of Brunei, Bangladesh, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Nepal to discuss key regional and global issues of mutual interest.

Title: Brazilian youngster Fonseca triumphs at Argentina Open

Content: Joao Fonseca became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP tournament on Sunday after the 18-year-old captured the Argentina Open title with a 6-4 7-6(1) win over home favourite Francisco Cerundolo.
Fonseca has established himself as one of the game’s most exciting young talents with his victory at the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah in December and his win over ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the first round of the Australian Open last month.
He lost to Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego in five sets in the second round at Melbourne Park.
“It is a dream, I work every day for these moments. Playing a final away from home, in Argentina, is difficult,” said Fonseca after denying fifth seed Cerundolo the title in front of a raucous crowd in Buenos Aires.
“It’s very special and I’ve taken another step forward in my career and I’m closer to my dream of becoming world number one,” he told a press conference.
Fonseca also defeated Argentines Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Federico Coria and Mariano Navone in the earlier rounds before beating Serbian Laslo Djere in the last four.
Cerundolo had stunned top seed Alexander Zverev of Germany in the quarter-finals before knocking out Spain’s Pedro Martinez in the semis. (Reuters)

Title: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured

Content: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured
Papal selection thriller “Conclave” and period drama “The Brutalist” were the big winners at the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, winning four prizes each.
“Conclave”, which had led nominations with 12 nods, won the night’s most coveted award, best film, as well as outstanding British film, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
“We live in a time of a crisis of democracy and institutions that are usually used to bring us together are used to pull us apart,” “Conclave” director Edward Berger said in his acceptance speech for the outstanding British film award.
“And sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith in that situation but that’s why we make movies and that’s why we made this movie.”
“The Brutalist”, a three-and-a-half hour tale about a Hungarian immigrant architect trying to rebuild his life in the United States post-World War Two, had also been considered a frontrunner for best film. It won best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for its star, Adrien Brody.
“This film is really about this pursuit of leaving something meaningful and I think that is something we can all relate to,” Brody said in his acceptance speech.
“The Brutalist” also won original score and cinematography.
In one of the big surprises of the night, Mikey Madison won the leading actress category for portraying an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch’s son in “Anora”.
Many had considered the frontrunners to be Demi Moore, who has received multiple honours for her performance in body horror “The Substance”, and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in “Hard Truths”.
“I really wasn’t expecting this,” Madison said.
“I want to take to a moment to recognise the sex worker community … you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be your friend.”
“Anora”, considered a strong awards season contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month’s Academy Awards, was also up for best film, as was Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown”.
SALDANA, CULKIN WIN
Fellow best film nominee “Emilia Perez”, which mixes the diverse genres of musical and crime, triumphed in the film not in the English language category.
“This is too nice, you shouldn’t have done that,” director Jacques Audiard said, accepting his award. “This award is not just for me but everyone who worked tirelessly on this film.”
He thanked the film’s cast members, including an absent Karla Sofia Gascon, who had been nominated for leading actress.
Zoe Saldana won supporting actress for her portrayal of a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman.
“Emilia Perez”, had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.
In the supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin won for dramedy “A Real Pain”. The movie also picked up best original screenplay for writer-director Jesse Eisenberg.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:35:09 +0000
Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty bounce back to end 8-day losing streak
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:55:23 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices rebounded on Monday, snapping an eight-day losing streak and closing the trading session in positive territory.
The Sensex rose by 57.65 points, or 0.08 percent, finishing at 75,996.86, while the Nifty gained 30.25 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 22,959.50.
Of the 50 stocks comprising the Nifty index, 34 ended the day in the green, with Adani Enterprises leading the gains, surging 4 percent.
Among the top gainers were Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Power Grid and IndusInd Bank.
On the other hand, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank were among the major losers, with their shares falling as much as 3.45 percent.
The broader markets also saw a recovery in the second half of the trading day.
The Nifty Midcap100 index closed with a gain of 0.39 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index ended with a marginal increase of 0.04 percent.
Among the sectors on the NSE, Pharma, Banks, Financial Services, Healthcare, OMCs, Consumer Durables, and Metals showed positive movements.
The Nifty Pharma index was the top performer, which rose 1.27 percent during the session, with Glenmark Pharma and Ajanta Pharma leading the gains.
However, the Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Media indices ended lower, with declines of up to 0.71 percent.
According to experts, recent shifts in global policies, especially those emerging from the US, are invoking a sense of uncertainty among foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which in turn is reshaping their investment strategies in dynamic markets like India.
Additionally, the prevailing high valuations in the Indian stock market have added to the caution among investors, said Vipul Bhowar of Waterfield Advisors.
Last week, both indices ended their two-week winning streak with significant losses.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs and expands SWAMIH fund
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:52:41 +0000
Content: The Centre on Monday launched the ‘Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs’, which was announced in the Union Budget 2025-26 to boost the micro, small, and medium enterprises.
The scheme facilitates collateral-free loans to MSMEs by providing loans up to Rs 100 crore for the purchase of plant, machinery, or equipment.
The scheme would provide 60 per cent guarantee coverage by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) to member lending institutions (MLIs) for a credit facility up to Rs 100 crore, sanctioned to eligible MSMEs under MCGS-MSME for the purchase of equipment/machinery.
Launching the scheme here, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also distributed sanction letters to MSMEs eligible under the scheme in Mumbai.
The scheme is expected to facilitate easy availability of credit for MSMEs and give a major boost to the manufacturing sector in India.
Under the scheme, the borrower must be an MSME with a valid Udyam Registration Number. The guaranteed loan amount will not exceed Rs 100 crore, although the total project cost can be higher. Additionally, at least 75% of the project cost must be for purchasing equipment or machinery.
FM Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary also handed over the keys to homebuyers who have benefitted due to the SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing) Fund during the post-Budget interaction programme with stakeholders here.
As of January 24, the SWAMIH Fund has successfully delivered over 50,000 homes, with a commitment to deliver an additional 20,000 homes each year for the next three years.
As announced in Union Budget 2025-26, SWAMIH Fund 2 will be established as a blended finance facility with contributions from the government, banks, and private investors.
This fund of Rs 15,000 crore will aim for expeditious completion of another 1 lakh units.
At a media interaction during the event, the Finance Minister said that the last three Budgets focused on improving MSMEs, including the government-guaranteed loan in the current Budget.
She stressed that the government’s focus has not shifted from capital expenditure to consumption expenditure.
FM Sithraraman further stated that the Centre is working on more reforms in the insurance sector, in which 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) has been allowed.
The current Budget proposes to raise the FDI cap for the insurance sector from 74 per cent to 100 per cent.
Guardrails are being put so that citizens’ money towards premium payment for insurance is kept within the country, she said.

Title: Government actively considering raising deposit insurance limit beyond Rs 5 lakh
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:49:57 +0000
Content: The Union Government is actively considering a proposal to raise the deposit insurance limit beyond ₹5 lakh, confirmed M Nagaraju, Secretary, Department of Financial Services (DFS), during a press conference in Mumbai on Monday.
“As and when the government approves, we will notify it. This is under the consideration of the government,” Nagaraju stated when questioned about the ongoing crisis at New India Cooperative Bank. He emphasized that the increase in deposit insurance coverage remains under active review.
India introduced deposit insurance in 1962, becoming the second country globally after the United States to implement such a scheme. The measure was a response to banking crises worldwide, highlighting the need for robust depositor protection. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) currently insures deposits up to ₹5 lakh, a limit that was last raised from ₹1 lakh on February 4, 2020.
Regarding the troubled Mumbai-based New India Cooperative Bank, Nagaraju declined to comment on its status, stating, “The RBI is seized of the matter… we are not going to comment on that.” He advised depositors to contact the bank or visit the DICGC website for updates on their deposit insurance claims.
The crisis at New India Cooperative Bank escalated on February 14, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the bank’s Board of Directors for 12 months, citing “material concerns due to poor governance standards.” This action followed the central bank’s decision on February 13 to impose severe restrictions on the lender’s operations. The RBI barred the bank from granting loans, accepting new deposits, or making payments without its prior approval. Withdrawals from savings or current accounts were also frozen, with limited exceptions for loan settlements.
The restrictions triggered panic among customers, leading to large crowds outside the bank’s branches in Mumbai, Thane, Surat, and Pune. Depositors voiced fears about their savings and locker access. Bank officials assured customers that access to lockers would be maintained.
New India Cooperative Bank, established with multi-state status in 1999, operates 30 branches across Maharashtra and Gujarat. It achieved scheduled bank status on November 1, 1990. The current crisis marks a significant setback in the bank’s four-decade history.

Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent his foreign minister and a senior Kremlin adviser to meet U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss restoring relations and possible talks to end the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said after a call with Putin on Wednesday that they would begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine immediately, and that they had also discussed the Middle East, energy, the U.S. dollar and Artificial Intelligence.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due in Saudi Arabia to meet Russian officials alongside Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, and Steve Witkoff, White House Middle East envoy.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister since 2004, and Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy advisor, were flying to Riyadh at the request of Putin.
“They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,” Peskov said.
“It will also be devoted to the preparation of possible negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement and the organisation of a meeting between the two presidents.”
Peskov declined to comment on a Reuters report that Kirill Dmitriev, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund chief, would also meet the U.S. delegation.
He also declined to comment when asked if Putin and Trump would meet face-to-face in Saudi Arabia later this month. (Reuters)

Title: Israeli military says it killed Hamas official in southern Lebanon
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 15:34:31 +0000
Content: The Israeli military on Monday killed a Hamas leader in southern Lebanon’s Sidon area, it said in a statement.
The army said Muhammad Shaheen was the head of the operations department of Hamas in Lebanon and that he had recently been involved in promoting “terrorist plots” with Iranian direction and funding from Lebanese territory against Israeli citizens.
An Israeli strike on a car in Lebanon’s southern port city of Sidon targeted an official in the Palestinian militant group, two Lebanese security sources told Reuters earlier.
Lebanon’s state news agency said rescuers had removed one body from the car but did not identify the victim.
The Israeli military has been carrying out strikes against members of Hamas, allied Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and other factions in Lebanon, in parallel with the Gaza war.
Those armed groups have launched rockets, drones and artillery attacks across the border into northern Israel.
Under a truce brokered by Washington in November, Israeli troops were granted 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon where they had waged a ground offensive against fighters from Iran-backed Hezbollah since early October.
That deadline was later extended to February 18, but Israel’s military requested that it keep troops in five posts in southern Lebanon, sources told Reuters last week.

Title: India showcases food industry strength at Gulfood 2025

Content: Gulfood 2025, one of the world’s largest food and beverage trade exhibitions, has commenced at the Dubai World Trade Centre, featuring over 5,500 exhibitors from 129 countries. Spanning 24 halls and 1.3 million square feet, the event highlights more than one million products, reinforcing Dubai’s role as a global food trade hub.
India has a significant presence at the event, with 370 companies participating, including 122 under six key industry associations and 248 independent exhibitors. Leading organizations such as the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India, Assocham, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), and the Indian Oilseeds & Produce Export Promotion Council (IOPEPC) are spearheading India’s representation.
Chirag Paswan, India’s Minister for Food Processing Industries, inaugurated the Indian Pavilion in the presence of Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan and other dignitaries. Speaking at the event, Paswan emphasized India’s commitment to global partnerships in food processing.
“Under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is fostering global collaborations in the food processing sector, encouraging investments, and integrating digital technologies to develop a future-ready food ecosystem,” he stated during his keynote address at the Leadership Summit in Dubai.
He further added, “India’s presence at Gulfood 2025 is a testament to our commitment to becoming a global leader in food processing and agri-exports. This event will showcase India’s strengths in food processing and value addition while fostering new collaborations and innovative food solutions. Our participation will help expand India’s footprint in new markets and establish sustainable supply chains that benefit both producers and consumers worldwide.”
Highlighting India’s growing role in the global food industry, Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan remarked, “India’s strengthened trade ties are reflected in its expanding role in global food supply chains. The country’s leadership in pulses, cereals, and grains is a testament to its ability to meet rising global demand for sustainable and nutritious food.”
This year, India’s participation at Gulfood 2025 emphasizes sustainability, technology-driven supply chains, and product diversification. With the Gulf region being a key market, the Indian Consulate in Dubai has actively supported Indian businesses by facilitating B2B meetings, networking events, and trade delegations.
The Indian Mission, in collaboration with NAFED, APEDA, and FIEO, provides exhibitors with branding support, market insights, regulatory guidance, and access to buyers and distributors. Additionally, interactive knowledge sessions with business delegations, including the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and IGTD Exim Chamber of Commerce, aim to enhance market understanding for Indian producers.
The demand for specific Indian products in the Gulf region continues to grow, driven by the large Indian diaspora and strong bilateral trade relations. Spices, rice, ready-to-eat meals, and Ayurvedic products remain highly sought after, alongside textiles, jewelry, and emerging sectors like electronics and IT.
The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has further boosted trade flows, with e-commerce platforms such as Amazon UAE and Noon expanding market access for Indian brands.
In 2023, India exported $1.61 billion worth of processed food and agricultural products to the UAE, underscoring the strong trade relationship between the two nations. With India’s dynamic presence at Gulfood 2025, the country is poised to further strengthen its footprint in the global food industry.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow

Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.
Under the government’s Deep Ocean Mission initiatives, the Ministry of Earth Sciences has entrusted the National Institute of Ocean Technology with the ambitious task of designing and developing the Matsya-6000, as part of the Samudrayan Project.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”

Title: Elon Musk’s Tesla kicks off hiring in India amid strengthening ties with government
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:32:05 +0000
Content: Elon Musk-owned Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has officially begun its hiring process in India, marking a significant step towards its long-anticipated entry into the domestic market.
On Monday, the electric vehicle (EV) giant posted a job listing on LinkedIn for the position of Consumer Engagement Manager in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The role is a full-time, on-site position, indicating Tesla’s commitment to building a direct presence in the country. https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4155877322/
Tesla’s latest hiring activity aligns with its broader strategy to expand in India. The company has recently posted a total of 13 job openings, covering both customer-facing and operational roles.
This development follows a crucial meeting between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 14 in Washington DC.
The discussions between the two centered on strengthening India-US collaboration in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development. The two also explored emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and governance–areas that align with Tesla’s vision for India.
Tesla, a global leader in electric mobility and renewable energy, has had a limited presence in India but has been considering an expansion for years.
With the latest job postings, the company is taking concrete steps to establish itself in the world’s third-largest automobile market.
Industry experts believe Tesla’s hiring push could be a precursor to the company setting up sales and service operations, and eventually manufacturing in India.
The move aligns with the Indian government’s push for electric vehicle adoption and local manufacturing, supported by incentives under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
While Tesla has not provided an official timeline for its India launch, its active hiring suggests that preparations are in full swing.
In December, Musk revealed that Starlink’s satellite internet services were non-operational in India following the confiscation of two of the company’s devices by authorities–one from an area affected by armed conflict and the other from a region linked to drug smuggling.
Additionally, Musk has been advocating for a reduction in tariffs on Tesla’s electric vehicles. He expressed willingness to export Tesla’s affordable EV models to India, contingent on the country lowering its import duties.

Title: Indian graduates show strong aptitude for AI, ML Roles: Report
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:21:53 +0000
Content: Indian graduates are demonstrating a strong aptitude for roles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), according to a report released on Tuesday.
The report, by talent assessment firm Mercer Mettl, revealed that Indian graduates have a 46.1% employability rate in AI and ML – the highest among all technical roles.
Covering data from more than 2,700 campuses and over 1 million learners, the report presents a complex landscape marked by both promising adaptability and persistent skill gaps.
It also found that 50% of graduates in India possess the soft skills required for AI/GenAI collaboration, though they need to improve in areas like creativity (44.3% employability). Strong areas include communication skills (55.1%), critical thinking (54.6%), and leadership skills (54.2%). With a 46% employability rate, learning agility remains crucial for navigating the evolving tech landscape.
Further, the report showed that graduates from Tier 1 colleges lead in employability (48.4%), followed by those from Tier 2 (46.1%) and Tier 3 (43.4%) institutions. However, the potential exists across all tiers, particularly in specialized tech areas. Tier 2 graduates excel in UI/UX developer roles, with a 58.3% employability rate.
Delhi reported the highest employability rate (53.4%), followed by Himachal Pradesh and Punjab (51.1%). Uttarakhand and Jharkhand also performed well, with rates of 50% and 49.6%, respectively.
Notably, the report found equal employability for male and female graduates in AI, ML, and data science sectors. However, disparities were noted in software testing.
“In 2025, the employability rate for Indian graduates stands at 42.6%, reflecting a slight decline from 44.3% in 2023, primarily due to evolving industry expectations. However, significant progress has been made in employability for technical roles, as colleges and students increasingly focus on developing skills that align with market demands,” said Siddhartha Gupta, President of Mercer India.
“On the other hand, developing certain non-technical and soft skills presents a more complex learning curve, often requiring additional time to cultivate. This data clearly highlights these trends,” he added.

Title: Champions Trophy: NZ pacer Ferguson ruled out with foot injury, Jamieson named replacement
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:15:23 +0000
Content: New Zealand suffered another injury blow ahead of their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign as the fast bowler Lockie Ferguson has been ruled out of the tournament with a foot injury.
Ferguson felt some pain in his right foot after bowling a spell in the informal warm-up match against Afghanistan in Karachi on Sunday and an initial medical assessment indicated he would not be fit enough to take part in the entire tournament.
Given the proximity to the start of the Champions Trophy and the short nature of the tournament, the decision was made to send Ferguson home to begin rehabilitation, the New Zealand Cricket said.
It added that fast bowler Kyle Jamieson will replace Ferguson in the squad and will depart for Pakistan this evening.
The Event Technical Committee of the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 has approved Jamieson as a replacement for Ferguson in the New Zealand squad.
Jamieson returned to domestic cricket for the Canterbury Kings in the Super Smash in December, following a 10-month stint on the sideline rehabilitating a stress fracture in his back.
He played a key role as the Kings reached the Grand Final, finishing as the competition’s joint second-leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets, including figures of 4-12 against the Central Stags at Hagley Oval.
He featured in Canterbury’s Round 8 Ford Trophy match against the Central Stags last week as well as Round 9 win over Northern Districts in Hamilton.
Ferguson became the second Kiwi to be ruled out of the mega event, as New Zealand already lost pacer Ben Sears due to a hamstring injury earlier this week with seamer Jacob Duffy coming in as a replacement.
New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said it was tough news for Ferguson and the team.
“We’re really disappointed for Lockie,” said Stead. “Lockie is a key part of the bowling group and brings a lot of major tournament experience and we know how much he was looking forward to representing New Zealand at another major event. We wish him well for his recovery and hope he is back firing soon.”
Stead said Jamieson’s unique skillset made him an effective replacement for Ferguson.
“Kyle brings plenty of pace and extra bounce which will suit the conditions here in Pakistan. He’s shown since returning in the Dream11 Super Smash how effective he can be in the shorter forms of the game, and he’s bowled with real pace and energy which is what you’re looking for from a pace bowler, especially at a pinnacle event.
“We’ve been pleased with the progress he’s made since returning and we feel his loading over the past few weeks and his successful spells in the recent Ford Trophy match mean he will be good to go if required in the tournament,” Stead added.
New Zealand will begin their against the hosts Pakistan in Karachi in the tournament opener on Wednesday.
New Zealand squad: Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young.

Title: US tariffs on steel sector unlikely to impact India materially: Crisil
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:05:50 +0000
Content: The US tariffs on the steel sector are unlikely to impact India significantly, as only 2 percent of the country’s total finished steel exports in the first nine months of this fiscal year were to the US, according to Crisil Intelligence.
The US has decided to impose a flat 25 percent tariff on steel imports from March 12, replacing the previous system of multiple lesser levies. This change is expected to have a three-fold impact.
“Firstly, it will reduce the exports of its trade partners as local production increases. However, India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only 2 percent of its total finished steel exports in the first nine months of this fiscal year were to the US,” said Sehul Bhatt, Director-Research at Crisil Intelligence.
Secondly, the tariffs may lead to the diversion of exporter inventory to other importing nations at competitive prices, especially in an environment of increasing global competition. This could further lower steel prices in India, which are already trending at four-year lows.
“This means the Indian government may need to intervene with safeguard duties to support domestic capacities. The timing and magnitude of such action will be critical,” Bhatt noted.
Thirdly, the increased production by US mills will likely reduce the availability of steel scrap for exports. This is because about 70 percent of the steel industry in the US uses the electric arc furnace process, which relies on scrap to produce steel. Currently, India sources around 14-15 percent of its scrap requirements from the US.
Key import sources for the US include Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea. In 2024, the US saw a sharp rise in steel exports from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Brazil.
While the US tariffs may open up a portion of the US market for India’s steel exports, the surplus steel produced by Japan and South Korea may be diverted to the Indian market, according to a recent ICRA report.

Title: Russia’s sovereign wealth chief says Trump is a problem solver ahead of high-level talks
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:05:04 +0000
Content: The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund on Tuesday described U.S. President Donald Trump as a problem solver ahead of U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia in what are expected to be the most significant discussions between the two former Cold War foes on ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
The conversation could pave the way for a summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as the two sides discuss restoring Russian-American relations.
“We really see that President Trump and his team is a team of problem solvers, people who have already addressed a number of big challenges very swiftly, very efficiently and very successfully,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Riyadh.
Russia said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on Tuesday that will focus on ending the Ukraine war and restoring “the whole complex” of Russia-U.S. ties.
Ukraine says no peace deal can be made on its behalf in the talks, to which Kyiv was not invited.
Dmitriev, a U.S.-educated former Goldman Sachs banker, played a role in early contacts between Moscow and Washington during Trump’s first term as president from 2016-2020.
Russia hopes that the United States will hear Moscow’s position in the talks on Ukraine, Interfax news agency cited Dmitriev as saying.
Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said on Monday that Dmitriev might join the delegation to discuss any economic questions that might arise.
“It’s very important to understand that U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from you know what’s happening right now, and we believe as a way forward is through solutions,” Dmitriev said.
The talks come after European leaders gathered in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to agree on a unified strategy after they were blindsided by Trump’s push for immediate talks on Ukraine after a phone call with Putin last week.
The European leaders said they would invest more in defence and take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.
“Everyone feels the great sense of urgency,” Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X. “At this crucial time for the security of Europe we must continue to stand behind Ukraine.”
“Europe will have to make a contribution towards safeguarding any agreement, and cooperation with the Americans is essential,” he said.
INITIAL CONTACT
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov on Tuesday, a foreign policy advisor to Putin, in Riyadh, officials from both sides said.
The meeting comes barely a month after Trump took office and reflects a significant departure from Washington’s position under the administration of President Joe Biden, who eschewed public contacts, concluding that Russia was not serious about ending the Ukraine war.
Russia, which has occupied parts of Ukraine since 2014, launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022.
U.S. officials sought to cast Tuesday’s talks as an initial contact to determine whether Moscow is serious about ending the war in Ukraine.
“This is a follow-up on that initial conversation between Putin and President Trump about perhaps if that first step is even possible, what the interests are, if this can be managed,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters in Riyadh.
The Kremlin, however, suggested the discussions would cover “the entire complex of Russian-American relations”, as well as preparing for talks on a possible settlement regarding Ukraine and a meeting between the two presidents.
Russia said Lavrov and Rubio in a call on Saturday discussed removing barriers to trade and investment between the two countries.
Then-President Biden and Kyiv’s allies around the world imposed waves of sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine three years ago, aimed at weakening the Russian economy and limiting the Kremlin’s war efforts.
Riyadh, which is also involved in talks with Washington over the future of the Gaza Strip, has played a role in early contacts between the Trump administration and Moscow, helping to secure a prisoner swap last week.
HOW TO ENGAGE WASHINGTON
It remains unclear how Europe will engage Washington after Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies by calling Putin, long ostracised by the West.
“We agree with President Trump on a “peace through strength” approach,” a European official said after the Paris meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. decision has sparked a realisation among European nations that they will have to do more to ensure Ukraine’s security.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who before the meeting said he was willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, said on Monday there must be a U.S. security commitment for European countries to put boots on the ground.
Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, said he would visit Ukraine from Wednesday and was asked if the U.S. would provide a security guarantee for any European peacekeepers.
“I’ve been with President Trump, and the policy has always been: You take no options off the table,” he said.

Title: India-Qatar partnership to focus on sustainability, technology, and energy, says Piyush Goyal
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 06:10:07 +0000
Content: The future partnership between India and Qatar will be grounded in the areas of sustainability, technology, entrepreneurship, and energy, according to Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal. Speaking at the inaugural session of the India-Qatar Business Forum in New Delhi, Goyal outlined the evolving nature of the bilateral relationship, highlighting how it is expanding beyond traditional trade to embrace new technologies and opportunities.
The Minister emphasized that the India-Qatar partnership is built on a foundation of trust, trade, and tradition. As global trade terms change, the focus is shifting from energy-based exchanges to cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), quantum computing, and semiconductors. Goyal noted that this shift comes at a time when the world is grappling with geopolitical tensions, climate change, cybersecurity challenges, and a growing emphasis on localization.
Goyal said that India and Qatar have complementary strengths and can collaborate to foster prosperity and a shared future. He highlighted the recent signing of two memorandums of understanding (MoUs): one between the Qatari Businessmen Association (QBA) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and another between Invest Qatar and Invest India. He also announced the elevation of the Joint Working Group on trade and commerce to the Ministerial level.
The Minister referenced Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement, “Today, be it major nations or global platforms, the confidence in India is stronger than ever before,” urging business leaders to carry forward this spirit of collaboration and confidence. He added that India offers a dynamic economy, a youthful population, continuous reforms, and a strong focus on ease of doing business and industrial growth.
Goyal extended an invitation to Qatari companies to explore opportunities in India’s expanding sectors such as investments, manufacturing, renewable energy, smart cities, and infrastructure. With both Qatar Vision 2030 and India’s Viksit Bharat 2047, the two nations are poised to build a brighter future for their people, Goyal added.

Title: Indian stocks could see revival soon, global factors are the key: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:56:06 +0000
Content: Global brokerage Morgan Stanley has indicated that Indian stocks could experience a revival soon, though global factors will be crucial to this outcome.
In its latest note, analysts at Morgan Stanley acknowledged that while catching the market bottom is challenging, “buying Indian equities could prove rewarding.”
The brokerage noted that India is emerging from a period of slow growth in recent months, with global conditions improving. Stocks are now priced lower than they have been since the Covid-19 bottom.
The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex have fallen by 13.3% and 11.7%, respectively, from their previous peaks.
Morgan Stanley also highlighted that the Union Budget is supportive of growth, with rising capital expenditure and reduced subsidy expenditure. The Reserve Bank of India’s rate cut and liquidity measures are expected to provide additional support. The note further emphasized that a series of tax reforms in India should encourage foreign direct investment.
Crude oil prices have weakened, and geopolitical conditions are improving with the likely fading of conflicts. “The dollar has corrected, and India’s real effective exchange rate has declined,” the note added.
Morgan Stanley anticipates that India will resume its outperformance relative to emerging markets in the coming months, although this is “subject to global cues not surprising negatively.”
The brokerage pointed to strong macroeconomic stability, improving terms of trade, and projected mid- to high-teen earnings growth annually over the next three to five years as key fundamentals driving potential upside. A reliable source of domestic risk capital is also seen as a positive factor.
In a separate report last week, Morgan Stanley noted that the direct impact of reciprocal tariff hikes by the US will likely be manageable. However, the indirect effect—through uncertainty weighing on business confidence—is seen as more concerning.
Nevertheless, the brokerage maintained that domestic policy will remain supportive of growth, and additional measures will be taken if downside risks emerge.

Title: Djokovic claims the majority of players feel ‘favouritism’ in Sinner’s doping ban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:53:52 +0000
Content: Serbian tennis great Novak Djokovic has claimed that the majority of players are not happy with the way the whole process is handled in the case of world no.1 Jannik Sinner’s three-month doping ban.
Sinner has reached a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which will see the Italian serve a three-month ban.
WADA has accepted that Sinner did not intend to cheat and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of the negligence of members of his entourage.
Djokovic claimed that the majority of players believe Sinner was shown “favouritism” with his three-month doping ban.
“There’s a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled,” Djokovic was quoted by The Guardian.
“A majority of the players don’t feel it’s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player if you have access to the top lawyer,” he said.
The case involving Sinner was the first of two prominent incidents in tennis that occurred in rapid succession. In November, world No. 2 in women’s tennis Iga Swiatek received a one-month suspension following a positive test for trimetazidine, a medication prescribed for angina.
The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) acknowledged that the positive result was due to contamination from a medication Swiatek had been using to alleviate jet lag.
In contrast, former world No. 1 Simona Halep received a four-year ban from the ITIA in 2022 following a positive test, although this penalty was subsequently reduced to nine months.
Djokovic further highlighted the “inconsistencies” in the anti-doping system and called it “unfair”.
“Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have got the ban for years … there is so many inconsistencies between the cases,” said Djokovic.
“Sinner has got a suspension for three months because of mistakes and negligence of his team members, who are working on the tour. This is also something that I personally and many other players find strange.
“Now it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously don’t work for anti-doping, it’s obvious. I hope that shortly the governing bodies are going to come together and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes. It’s inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair,” he added.

Title: PM Fasal Bima Yojana turns nine: Rs 1.75 lakh crore in claims disbursed to 23.22 crore farmers
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:28:46 +0000
Content: The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), a scheme providing comprehensive coverage for farmers against crop losses caused by unpredictable natural disasters, has disbursed Rs 1.75 lakh crore in claims to more than 23.22 crore farmers over the past nine years, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
Launched in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMFBY has played a crucial role in stabilizing farmers’ incomes while promoting the adoption of innovative agricultural practices.
The scheme witnessed a 25% growth in farmer enrolment in 2023-24 compared to the previous year, demonstrating its growing popularity.
The Union Cabinet, recognizing PMFBY’s impact, approved its continuation along with the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) till 2025-26, with a budget of Rs.69,515.71 crore. RWBCIS, introduced alongside PMFBY, is a weather index-based scheme that complements PMFBY’s crop insurance approach.
Technological Advancements in PMFBY
PMFBY integrates advanced technology, including satellite imagery, drones, and remote sensing, to enhance transparency and accuracy in crop area estimation, yield disputes, and loss assessments. The introduction of YES-TECH (Yield Estimation System Based on Technology) from Kharif 2023 allows for more accurate yield loss assessments, blending technology-based and manual estimates to improve claim settlements.
Key Benefits of PMFBY
Farmers pay an affordable premium of 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi crops, and 5% for horticultural or commercial crops, with the remaining premium subsidized by the government. PMFBY covers a wide range of risks, including natural disasters, pests, diseases, and post-harvest losses due to local calamities like hailstorms and landslides. Claims are processed within two months of harvest to provide timely compensation, preventing farmers from falling into debt traps.
Risks Covered by PMFBY
The scheme provides insurance for yield losses due to natural disasters, pests, and diseases. Farmers prevented from sowing due to adverse weather conditions are eligible for indemnity claims of up to 25% of the sum insured. Post-harvest losses are covered for up to 14 days after harvest, and localized hazards like hailstorms or landslides affecting individual farms are also insured.
Strengthening PMFBY
Since its launch, the government has made several interventions to enhance transparency and accountability, resulting in record-high farmer participation in 2023-24. The scheme is now the largest crop insurance program in the world, with some states further reducing farmers’ premium burdens by waiving their share.
Achievements of PMFBY
The scheme has paid out Rs.1.75 lakh crore in claims since its inception and has been implemented across 23 states and Union Territories. In 2023-24, non-loanee farmers’ coverage increased to 55% of the total coverage, highlighting the growing voluntary adoption of the scheme. The total sum insured stands at Rs.17.29 lakh crore.

Title: BJP sweeps Gujarat local body polls
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:14:33 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again asserted its dominance in Gujarat’s local body elections, securing a decisive victory in the Junagadh Municipal Corporation by winning 48 out of 60 seats in the February 16 polls.
According to the State Election Commission (SEC), eight seats were won unopposed by the BJP before polling began, while voting took place for the remaining 52 seats. Out of these, the BJP clinched 40 seats, while the main opposition party secured 11 seats, and one independent candidate emerged victorious from Ward No. 9.
In Sanand Municipality, elections were held for 27 out of 28 seats, with one seat won unopposed by the BJP before polling. Out of the 27 contested seats, the BJP secured 24, while the Congress managed to win only three.
Meanwhile, in Bavla Municipality, the BJP reached the halfway mark of 14 out of 28 seats, while the Congress secured 13 seats, and one seat went to a BSP candidate. This close contest could lead to an interesting political scenario in Bavla, as no party has achieved a clear majority yet.
The third municipality in Ahmedabad district, Dhandhuka, also went to the polls, but its results were still awaited, according to the State Election Commission.
In Dakor Municipality, a political deadlock emerged as the BJP secured 12 seats, while independent candidates won 14 seats, leaving no party with a clear majority. The Congress failed to win a single seat in Dakor, marking a significant setback for the opposition in this region.
Additionally, the BJP swept the district panchayat by-elections, winning all nine seats across Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Panchmahal, Dahod, Bharuch, Dangs, and Botad. Notably, in Panchmahal, the BJP candidate won unopposed.
These local body elections were also significant as they marked the first implementation of newly introduced reservation policies for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in several local bodies.

Title: IPL 2025 full squads and fixtures: how every team lines up
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:19:05 +0000
Content: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket tournament organised by the Indian board (BCCI).
First held in 2008, it quickly became the most lucrative cricket competition in the world, with a brand value of $12 billion, according to a December 2024 report by brand valuation consultancy firm Brand Finance.
Here is what you need to know about the 18th edition of the competition, which kicks off next month:
WHEN IS THE IPL HAPPENING?
* The 18th edition of the IPL runs from March 22 to May 25.
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE IPL?
* The 10 participating teams are split into two groups. Each team play twice, home and away, against other teams in the group and the team in the same row in the other group, along with one match each against the remaining four teams from the opposite group, totalling 14 matches in the group stage.
* The top four teams in a unified points table will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams will play each other in ‘Qualifier 1,’ with the winner reaching the final.
* The teams placed third and fourth will compete in the ‘Eliminator’ match where the winner will progress to ‘Qualifier 2,’ taking on the loser of ‘Qualifier 1’ for a place in the final.
* Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, and Punjab Kings are in Group 1. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Lucknow Super Giants are in Group 2.
WHERE IS THE IPL TAKING PLACE?
* The IPL is held in the home cities of the franchises based across India. However, some teams may choose to split their home games between two or more cities.
* The 2025 edition will be played across 13 venues.
* Eden Gardens, the home ground of defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders, will host the opening game, ‘Qualifier 2’ and the final. Sunrisers Hyderabad, who finished second in the table last season, will host the ‘Qualifier 1’ and ‘Eliminator’ matches.
WHO IS INVOLVED IN IPL 2025?
* Some of the biggest names in cricket from around the world will be in action, with England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler fetching the highest price for an overseas player at 157.5 million Indian rupees ($1.81 million) at the player auction in November, joining Gujarat Titans.
* The teams spent over $72.51 million at the auction, with Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, signed by Lucknow Super Giants for $3.11 million, earning the highest price tag.
* World Cup-winning Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has retired from international cricket, will play for Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who both retired from international T20 cricket after India won the 20-over World Cup last year, will also be in action for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, respectively.
* Some former greats of the sport, who are present in the competition as coaches, are Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, and Stephen Fleming coaching Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chennai, respectively.
* Players from India’s politically estranged rivals Pakistan have not played in the IPL since its opening edition in 2008.
Pakistan’s government barred its players from participating in IPL 2009, citing security concerns amid tense relations after the Mumbai militant attacks in November 2008.
Although Pakistan’s authorities cleared their players to participate in the next edition, Pakistani players were snubbed from IPL 2010 and have not featured in the competition since.

Title: South Korea’s parliament presses for Yoon’s removal as impeachment trial winds down
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:44:33 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol could try to impose martial law again or undermine constitutional institutions should he be reinstated, lawyers for parliament argued on Tuesday as his impeachment trial entered its final phase.
After weeks of testimony by high-ranking current and former officials, including some facing criminal charges for their role in the brief imposition of martial law on December 3, lawyers for both sides summarised their arguments and evidence at the Constitutional Court.
“Declaring martial law in a situation that doesn’t fit a national emergency is a declaration of dictatorship and military rule,” Kim Jin-han, a lawyer for the parliament, told the justices.
He cited pro-Yoon protesters who stormed a different court in January.
“If he returns to work, we don’t know if he will again exercise martial law,” Kim said. “If he returns to work, we can’t rule out the possibility that he will attack other state and constitutional institutions.”
The Constitutional Court is due to hold another hearing to question three more witnesses on Thursday, including the impeached prime minister and the former police chief.
The court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. If he is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon has argued that he had a right as president to issue his martial law decree, which lasted around six hours before he rescinded it in the face of parliamentary opposition. He said the move was also justified by political deadlock and threats from “anti-state forces” sympathetic to North Korea.
His case at the Constitutional Court has also included arguments that he never actually intended to stop parliament from operating, even though the order was publicly declared and troops and police were deployed to the legislature.
Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission and later said the decree was necessary in part because the NEC had been unwilling to address concerns over election hacking, a claim rejected by election officials.
Prosecutors have also indicted Yoon on separate criminal charges of leading an insurrection. He was arrested last month and is being held at a detention centre.
The first preparatory hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday.
Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.

Title: Indian players have potential to play in Europe, says MBSG defender Tom Aldred
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:27:43 +0000
Content: Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) are one step away from a consecutive Indian Super League (ISL) title, thanks largely to a defensive unit that excels at both ends of the pitch.
With 14 of the team’s 42 goals coming from defenders this season, an ISL record, the team has set a new benchmark for contributions from the backline, also bettering the previous best of eight by Chennaiyin FC in 2017-18.
Tom Aldred, a new addition to the team from the A-League, has bagged two goals and his 13 blocks have been the highest by any Mohun Bagan Super Giant player this term.
In discussing his move to the Mariners, Aldred spoke highly about the quality of the ISL and the quality of Indian players.
“There are some very good players here. From what I have seen so far at Mohun Bagan Super Giant, the Indian players are a very good group. I have had conversations with some of the foreign players about how Indian players could play in Europe. I feel their levels are very good,” he said.
Coming on the back of spells in England, Scotland, and Australia, Aldred’s praise shows the potential that has inspired the Mohun Bagan Super Giant backline to flourish.
Subhasish Bose has spearheaded their charge on this front with aplomb, recording six goals this season, which is the highest ever by a defender in a single ISL campaign. His attacking prowess has caught opponents off-guard especially from set pieces, since he has won 52 aerial duels, and accurate positioning has allowed him to deliver rich rewards. Bose has not only made a mark on the scoresheet but also thrived defensively, notching seven interceptions in a game against Hyderabad FC, which is a league-high in a single match by any player in 2024-25. He has won the fourth-most tackles (39) and notched the second-most interceptions (43) in the league too.
Equally impressive has been Alberto Rodriguez, who has chimed in with five goals. Four of those strikes have come from corners, spotlighting the team’s effectiveness from the dead ball. Subhasish and Rodriguez are in fact their top two scorers so far, only behind Jamie Maclaren’s 10 strikes. The Spaniard’s physical prowess and well-timed runs have made him a threatening presence in the opposition’s penalty zone.
Another player who has excelled for the Mariners so far is Dippendu Biswas, who has become a regular in the playing XI in ISL 2024-25. Partnering Bose, Aldred, and Rodriguez in the backline, Biswas has made 11 appearances and averaged 33 passes per game at 81% accuracy. The 21-year-old has also won 13 tackles, 36 duels, 31 recoveries, made 28 clearances; and scored once and assisted twice – blending his youthful exuberance seamlessly with the experience prevalent in the defence.
Beyond these performances, what truly sets Mohun Bagan Super Giant’s defence apart is their collective solidity. Thirteen clean sheets in 21 matches and just 14 goals conceded display how well organised and disciplined the unit is. Whether it is Subhasish, Rodriguez, and Aldred combining centrally at times by taking turns or the wider defenders stepping up to support the attack, the cohesion has been successful throughout the season.

Title: India-Qatar business forum eyes growth in tech, diversification beyond energy
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:21:04 +0000
Content: The India-Qatar Joint Business Forum was held on Tuesday in New Delhi, coinciding with the visit of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Amir of Qatar. Organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in partnership with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the forum focused on expanding economic collaboration between the two nations.
Union Minister Piyush Goyal, in his address at the inaugural session, outlined India’s ambition to become a USD 30-35 trillion economy by 2047. He said that while energy trade remains a critical part of India-Qatar relations, future growth lies in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, the Internet of Things, and semiconductors.
He also invited Qatari businesses to explore investment opportunities in India, particularly in the Gujarat International Finance Tech-City (GIFT City), and proposed the establishment of a Joint Working Group to identify mutual sectors of interest.
Sheikh Faisal bin Thani bin Faisal Al Thani, Minister of Commerce and Industry, State of Qatar, underscored the enduring relationship between India and Qatar, which has seen India emerge as Qatar’s third-largest trading partner. He called for increased investment opportunities between the two countries, particularly in Qatar’s expanding economy and infrastructure.
India’s economic growth was also highlighted by Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada, who pointed to the USD 709 billion in foreign direct investment India has attracted over the last decade. He emphasized India’s leadership in technology, with over 155,000 startups across various industries.
Prasada also mentioned the role of digital initiatives, like India Stack, in advancing financial inclusion and expanding access to digital services. The partnership between Qatar National Bank (QNB) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is one such initiative, aiming to enhance digital payments through QR Code-based UPI transactions.
Dr. Ahmad Al-Sayed, Minister of State for Foreign Trade Affairs, Qatar, stressed the need for further diversification of collaboration beyond the energy sector. He pointed to growing opportunities in electric vehicles, manufacturing, and non-oil industries. Qatar’s efforts, including the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) and Qatar Science & Technology Park, were also highlighted as part of the country’s broader strategy to foster business and innovation.
With bilateral trade exceeding USD 15 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, investment flows between India and Qatar are increasing, with Qatar now ranking among the top three GCC investors in India. To build on this momentum, two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed between CII and the Qatar Business Association, as well as between Invest India and Invest Qatar.
Sanjiv, Joint Secretary of DPIIT, emphasized the importance of the India-Qatar business delegation in fostering stronger ties, and invited Qatari participation in the Startup India Mahakumbh 2025, scheduled for April 3-5.

Title: Delhi LG chairs high level meeting regarding Summer Action Plan
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:17:19 +0000
Content: Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena chaired a high-level meeting on Tuesday with senior officials from various departments of the Delhi government, including the Delhi Jal Board, to review the Summer Action Plan aimed at ensuring uninterrupted water supply for Delhiites amid the approaching summer heat.
The meeting, held at the LG Secretariat, focused on measures to prevent water shortages during peak summer months. A key point of discussion was initiating talks with Haryana to ensure sufficient water supply from May to June, according to a statement from the LG’s office.
The review also covered progress on cleaning the Yamuna River. The LG emphasized the implementation of a ‘four-pronged strategy’ to combat pollution in the river. According to the statement, the action plan begins with removing trash, garbage, and silt from the Yamuna stream. Concurrently, cleaning operations will commence in the Najafgarh Drain, Supplementary Drain, and other major drains contributing to river pollution.
Additionally, the LG’s office outlined steps to address wastewater treatment. A daily watch on the performance of existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) will be maintained, ensuring they operate at full capacity. To bridge the shortfall in treating approximately 400 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage, a time-bound plan for constructing new STPs and decentralized STPs (DSTPs) will be implemented and operationalized.
The LG has set a three-year timeline for cleaning the Yamuna River, underscoring the importance of seamless coordination between various agencies, including the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) Department, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Environment Department, Public Works Department (PWD), and Delhi Development Authority (DDA).
To ensure accountability, the LG has directed weekly progress monitoring. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been instructed to maintain strict vigilance over the cleaning process and submit regular reports.
The renewed focus on Yamuna cleaning follows an earlier meeting between the LG and the Chief Secretary on February 16, during which an immediate directive was issued to deploy trash skimmers, weed harvesters, and dredge utility vehicles for cleaning the river.

Title: Sensex, Nifty end flat amid mixed global cues
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:48:30 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market traded within a narrow range on Tuesday, reflecting mixed signals from global markets. Despite intra-day fluctuations, the benchmark indices closed with marginal losses.
The Sensex touched a low of 75,531 during the session but recovered slightly, ending 29 points lower at 75,967. Similarly, the Nifty 50 moved between 22,801 and 22,992 before settling at 22,945, down 14 points from its previous close.
Among the top gainers in the Sensex 30 pack were power companies NTPC and Power Grid Corporation, which saw gains of up to 3%. Tech Mahindra, Zomato, HCL Technologies, and Kotak Mahindra Bank also performed well.
On the other hand, stocks like IndusInd Bank, Hindustan Unilever, UltraTech Cement, Mahindra & Mahindra, and TCS faced selling pressure, slipping between 1% and 2%.
On the Nifty index, NTPC led the gains with a 3.19% increase, while Tech Mahindra, Wipro, ONGC, and Apollo Hospital were other top gainers.
Meanwhile, Trent and Mahindra & Mahindra were among the top losers, slipping up to 2.5%.
Hrishikesh Yedve from Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd said: “As long as the index holds the recent low of 22,725, a buy-on-dips strategy remains favourable.”
He added that the 21-Day Simple Moving Average (DSMA) at 23,240 acts as an immediate hurdle, and a decisive move above this level could confirm a near-term bottom reversal.
The broader market showed signs of weakness, with the BSE SmallCap index declining nearly 1.5%. The Nifty Bank declined 196.25 points or 0.40% to end the intra-day session at 49,062.65.
Market sentiment remained bearish, as nearly 3,000 stocks on the BSE declined, while only around 1,000 stocks advanced.

Title: India and Qatar elevate bilateral ties to strategic partnership following PM Modi’s talks with Qatari Amir
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:45:16 +0000
Content: India and Qatar upgraded their bilateral relations to a ‘strategic partnership’ on Tuesday, with a focus on strengthening cooperation in trade, energy, investments, innovation, technology, food security, culture, and people-to-people ties.
The Agreement on the Establishment of a Strategic Partnership between the two nations was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of Qatar, at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. The Amir arrived in India on Monday for a two-day state visit.
A revised agreement aimed at avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion concerning income taxes was also signed, further deepening economic cooperation between the two countries.
Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, shared on X: “PM @narendramodi & HH Sheikh @TamimbinHamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, held wide-ranging talks at Hyderabad House today. Both leaders decided to elevate India-Qatar relations to a Strategic Partnership with focus on trade, energy, investments, innovation, technology, food security, culture & people-to-people ties.

Title: ‘Every game in this period is difficult’: Arne Slot ahead of Liverpool’s tricky run of fixtures
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:43:01 +0000
Content: The next nine days will be very vital in Liverpool’s title run, with the league leaders having to play away games against Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle United at Anfield Stadium.
With the point difference between Arne Slot’s side and second-placed Arsenal now at seven, the title is Liverpool’s to lose. In his pre-game conference, the Dutch head coach applauded the work done by Unai Emery at Aston Villa and stated with 13 games to go in the 2024-25 season, every game will be difficult.
“(They have) a very good manager (Unai Emery) who always has a very good game plan. He has brought in quite a lot of good players in the winter break, and they already had a very good team. They qualified for top eight in the Champions League, so it tells you it is a strong team we are going to face. Every game in this period for every team in the league is difficult,” said Slot.
Slot went further in-depth on one of Aston Villa’s winter transfer window signings, Marcus Rashford, who joined the Birmingham side from Liverpool’s biggest rivals Manchester United.
Rashford had fallen down the pecking order since the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim at the Red Devils with the English forward claiming he needed a ‘new challenge’ and the Portuguese head coach stating that he and Rashford had different ideas on how football should be played.
“The first time I faced him in real life was the USA tour and I was impressed. I was really impressed with how fast he is, how he has a nice height and is comfortable with the ball, so I think he is a very good player.
“I hope that he is going to show that at Villa. Of course, I am not hoping that he will do this tomorrow but I would be completely surprised if a player of his quality is not going to show it because he is a very good player in my opinion,” Slot added.

Title: US and Russia meet without Ukraine for first talks on ending war
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 09:47:16 +0000
Content: U.S. and Russian officials met on Tuesday in Riyadh for the highest-level talks to date between the two former Cold War foes on ending the war in Ukraine.
They were expected to discuss ways to end the three-year-old conflict in Ukraine and restore American-Russian relations. Their talks could pave the way for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
Ukraine, which is not attending, says no peace deal can be made on its behalf. “We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week.
European governments, alarmed at the possibility that Russia and the United States could sideline them from negotiations that will determine the future security of the continent, have also demanded a role in peace talks.
Media were allowed to film the two delegations before the start of the talks.
Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sat opposite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at a polished wooden table with three large white floral arrangements.
The officials ignored shouted questions from reporters asking whether the U.S. was sidelining the Ukrainians and what concessions Washington was demanding of Moscow.
Russia said the talks would focus on ending the war and restoring “the whole complex” of Russia-U.S. ties, which the Kremlin described as “below zero” under the previous administration of Joe Biden.
Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, told reporters in Riyadh: “We really see that President Trump and his team is a team of problem solvers, people who have already addressed a number of big challenges very swiftly, very efficiently and very successfully.”
Dmitriev, a U.S.-educated former Goldman Sachs banker, played a role in early contacts with Moscow during Trump’s first term as president from 2016-2020.
Ushakov said on Monday that Dmitriev might join the delegation to discuss economic questions.
“It’s very important to understand that U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from, you know, what’s happening right now,” Dmitriev said.
US TAKES NEW APPROACH TO RUSSIA UNDER TRUMP
European leaders had gathered in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to agree on a unified strategy, after being blindsided by Trump’s push for immediate talks on Ukraine after a phone call with Putin last week.
The European leaders said they would invest more in defence and take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.
“Everyone feels the great sense of urgency,” Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said. “At this crucial time for the security of Europe we must continue to stand behind Ukraine.”
“Europe will have to make a contribution towards safeguarding any agreement, and cooperation with the Americans is essential.”
The meeting in Riyadh reflects a significant departure from Washington’s position under Biden, who eschewed public contacts, concluding that Russia was not serious about ending the war.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, having seized Crimea and fomented an insurgency in the east in 2014, and controls about a fifth of the country.
U.S. officials cast Tuesday’s talks as an initial contact to determine whether Moscow is serious about ending the war, after Putin and Trump spoke last Wednesday.
“This is a follow-up on that initial conversation between Putin and President Trump about perhaps if that first step is even possible, what the interests are, if this can be managed,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters in Riyadh.
The Kremlin, however, suggested the discussions would cover “the entire complex of Russian-American relations”, as well as preparing for talks on a settlement for Ukraine and a meeting between the two presidents.
Russia said Lavrov and Rubio in a call on Saturday discussed removing barriers to trade and investment.
EUROPE SEEKS TO RETAIN INFLUENCE AS US AND RUSSIA TALK
Then-president Biden and Kyiv’s allies around the world have imposed waves of sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, aimed at weakening Russia’s economy and its war effort.
Riyadh, which is also involved in talks with Washington over the future of the Gaza Strip, has played a role in early contacts between the Trump administration and Moscow, helping to secure a prisoner swap last week.
It remains unclear how Europe will engage Washington after Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies by calling Putin, long ostracised by the West.
“We agree with President Trump on a ‘peace through strength’ approach,” a European official said after the Paris meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. decision has sparked a realisation among European nations that they will have to do more to ensure Ukraine’s security.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who before the meeting said he was willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, said on Monday there must be a U.S. security “backstop” for European countries to put boots on the ground.
Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, said he would visit Ukraine from Wednesday and was asked if the U.S. would provide a security guarantee for any European peacekeepers.
“I’ve been with President Trump, and the policy has always been: You take no options off the table,” he said.

Title: Vatican cancels pope’s weekend engagements as he battles ‘complex’ infection
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 18:01:51 +0000
Content: Pope Francis, who is spending his fifth day in hospital for what doctors described as a “complex” respiratory infection, will not take part in this weekend’s Holy Year events, the Vatican said on Tuesday.
The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on February 14.
All public events on the pope’s calendar were cancelled through Sunday, the Vatican said in a brief statement.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Francis had slept peacefully overnight and had eaten breakfast on Tuesday. A further update on the pope’s condition was expected later on Tuesday.
A Vatican official speaking on background to discuss the pope’s condition without authorisation said the pontiff was not on a ventilator and was breathing on his own.
The pope had been due to lead several events over the weekend for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, which runs through to next January.
It is a special time of pardon and forgiveness for Catholics and the Vatican expects 32 million tourists to visit Rome throughout the year, including for a range of special audiences with Francis.
The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the pope’s drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a “complex clinical situation”. They described it as a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract”.
Doctors say a polymicrobial infection occurs when two or more micro-organisms are involved, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
Massimo Andreoni, an infectious disease specialist, said the Vatican’s reports that the pope did not have a fever and was well enough to eat were “very encouraging”.
“It suggests that the general condition is fair and that there is no major respiratory failure that would make this much more complicated,” said Andreoni, a professor at Rome’s Tor Vergata University.
Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times he has been prone to lung infections.
The Vatican has said Francis will stay in hospital for as long as necessary. It has not specified whether the pope is suffering from a bacterial or viral infection.
While a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down a fever or help their body fight the infection.

Title: Congo army retreat from Bukavu leads to clashes with allied militias
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:48:51 +0000
Content: Government forces and local militias have clashed south of the provincial capital of Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as troops fall back in the face of an advance by Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, military sources and townsfolk say.
The troops and their militia allies were meant to pull back from Bukavu – a trading and mining industry hub – to avoid urban battles with the rebels and to dig in elsewhere to stall the rapid offensive.
The militias wanted to stand and fight.
By the time the rebels started moving into Bukavu over the weekend, the plan was unravelling into chaos, a Congolese general, a senior officer, a community leader, and several residents told Reuters.
Having already lost Congo’s main eastern city of Goma, near the Rwandan border, the forces deployed to defend Bukavu and its 1.3 million people hastily packed up and left.
Direct clashes with the M23 were largely avoided, but towns south of Bukavu then found themselves in the middle of firefights as pro-government militia fighters, known as the Wazalendo, tried to disarm or halt retreating or deserting Congolese soldiers.
“Just this morning there was the crackle of gunfire from Kamanyola to Uvira,” a community leader said on Monday, referring to towns on the N5 road south of Bukavu that have become flashpoints far from the front line with the M23.
“All the villages on road N5 are emptying,” he said.
The disorderly retreat and the ease with which the M23 rebels have overrun eastern Congo’s two major cities have stoked fears of a break-up of the country, a regional war that could drag in Uganda, and open talk in Kinshasa of a possible coup against Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi.
“It’s total chaos,” said a civil society source in Kamanyola, one of several towns where residents have reported clashes in recent days between Congolese troops and their one-time allies.
The Congolese army did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
RIGHTS AND RESOURCES
The rebels, backed by Rwanda, are led by ethnic Tutsis and say they are fighting for their rights.
Various militias are also vying for control of the region’s abundant mineral resources such as tantalum and cobalt, key components of electric vehicles, mobile phones and other technological products used across the world.
Congo is also the top supplier of copper to China.
On Sunday, as reports of the messy Bukavu withdrawal emerged, there were signs of growing unease in the capital.
“Tshisekedi was elected by the Congolese people for a five-year term. We will not accept any coup,” Justice Minister Constant Mutamba said on X.
The disarray in South Kivu will also add to criticism of the decision to recruit the Wazalendo, or Patriots, the loose alliance of militias that are often poorly trained and undisciplined.
A video shared with Reuters by one resident appeared to show Wazalendo fighters in the N5 town of Sange handing out rifles to passersby from the back of a truck they had seized, along with its weapons, from the Congolese army.
Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. A security source and two civil society members confirmed such an incident took place.
“The Wazalendo…just keep messing up. The presidency rearmed all the armed groups thinking that these individuals would serve their cause,” a general in the army said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It was not possible to contact a Wazalendo representative for comment.
“WE FLEE AGAIN”
The withdrawal from Bukavu without a fight has angered many Wazalendo in South Kivu, said Congolese researcher Josaphat Musamba, who is from the province.
“They are determined to fight…They don’t understand how the Congolese army can abandon them.”
Three Congolese military sources said the decision to retreat was made to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied the fall of Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city, in late January, during which about 3,000 people were killed, according to the United Nations.
The loss of Kavumu airport north of Bukavu to the M23 and the air support it provided also influenced the decision to pull back, the general said.
Meanwhile repeated battlefield losses had left soldiers demoralised, said a senior officer serving in the conflict zone, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The soldiers didn’t want to fight anymore. They were fleeing and looting,” he said.
Poor morale and indiscipline have repeatedly undermined the Congolese army’s fight against the M23 since the insurgency broke out in 2022 in a renewal of a conflict dating back to the 1990s genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.
“At the Bukavu stage, we flee again,” said one exasperated soldier in a video that showed large numbers of soldiers clambering onto an truck full of supplies.
“This is how we are treated under the regime of Tshisekedi.”
The insurgency has deepened an already dire humanitarian crisis in eastern provinces. Recent fighting has destroyed emergency shelters, leaving around 350,000 displaced people with no roof over their heads, the U.N. refugee agency says.
Rwanda rejects allegations from Congo, the United Nations, and Western powers that it supports M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against the threat from a Hutu militia, which it says is fighting with the Congolese military.
Congo rejects Rwanda’s complaints and says Rwanda has used its proxy militias to loot its minerals.

Title: Israel to begin negotiations on second phase of Gaza ceasefire deal, minister says
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:34:19 +0000
Content: Israel will begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, including an exchange of the remaining Israeli hostages with Palestinian detainees, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Tuesday, adding that Israel demanded a complete demilitarisation of the enclave.
Negotiations for the second phase of the deal were supposed to be under way before the first phase ends on March 2, but Qatar said the talks have not officially started yet.
A “Hezbollah model” in Gaza would not be acceptable to Israel “and therefore we need a total demilitarisation of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority”, Saar said in a press conference.
He added that Israel was aware of an alternative plan by Arab states for Gaza, made to counter U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to redevelop the strip under U.S. control, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said is worthy of exploration.
Israel would not support a plan that would see civilian control of Gaza transferred from Hamas to the Palestinian authority, Saar added.

Title: Former CEC Rajiv Kumar bids farewell, calls Election Commission ‘place of worship of democracy’
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:19:10 +0000
Content: Rajiv Kumar, the 25th Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India, bid farewell to the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday, hailing the institution as a “place of worship of democracy.” Expressing optimism about its future, he said he was confident that under the incoming leadership, the ECI would reach even greater heights.
In his parting remarks, Kumar praised the pivotal role played by voters and political parties in strengthening Indian democracy. “This building is the place of worship of democracy. Through great hard work, it has amassed heritage over the last 75 years. I am hopeful that it will rise even higher in the future. The new team will take it forward with great capability,” he said. He also wished success to all voters, acknowledging their central contribution to the democratic process.
The farewell ceremony marked the conclusion of Kumar’s tenure, during which he served 4.5 years in the Commission. He joined as Election Commissioner on September 1, 2020, and assumed charge as CEC on May 15, 2022. His term was distinguished by silent but impactful reforms spanning structural, technological, and administrative domains.
During his leadership, Kumar oversaw a complete electoral cycle, including the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, elections in 31 states and Union Territories, and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential polls in 2022. The Commission noted that these elections were conducted peacefully, with near-zero repolls and incidents of violence—an achievement Kumar credited to the dedication of 15 million polling officials.
A strong proponent of technology, Kumar championed reforms to strengthen election integrity while addressing challenges such as cyber threats and misinformation on social media. He advocated for biometric authentication at polling booths to prevent impersonation and pushed for mandatory online reporting of political party expenditures to enhance financial transparency.
Kumar’s tenure was marked by several key reforms aimed at modernizing the electoral process. These included:
– Multiple Voter Registration Dates: Operationalizing four qualifying dates for voter registration and introducing early application facilities for 17+ youngsters. 
– Simplified Registration Forms: Making voter registration more accessible and user-friendly. 
– Assam Delimitation: Redefining electoral boundaries in Assam. 
– Voter Facilitation Centres: Allowing polling personnel to vote at facilitation centres, preventing intimidation and malpractices.
Under his leadership, technology-driven reforms, such as ERONET 2.0, were introduced to manage India’s vast electoral database. This system bolstered voter roll management with enhanced security and real-time processing. Additionally, he launched the ‘Myth vs Reality’ register during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to combat misinformation and fake news on social media.
On the global stage, Kumar positioned India as a leader in electoral management, spearheading the ‘Cohort on Election Integrity’ and offering training to officials from multiple countries. He described India’s electoral expertise as a powerful instrument of soft power, enhancing the country’s global democratic influence.
In a gesture of appreciation, Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu lauded Kumar’s inclusive and transformative leadership, crediting him with purpose-driven reforms that modernized India’s electoral machinery while upholding democratic values.
As Rajiv Kumar steps down, Gyanesh Kumar will assume charge as the new Chief Election Commissioner on February 19, 2025.

Title: India, Qatar aim to double annual trade in five years from existing USD 14 billion
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:28:36 +0000
Content: India and Qatar have agreed to double their annual bilateral trade from the current USD 14 billion to USD 28 billion within the next five years. The announcement came following bilateral talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani on Tuesday. The discussions, which took place at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, focused on trade, investment, energy cooperation, and deepening people-to-people ties.
Prime Minister Modi welcomed the Amir and praised him for bringing a large delegation of senior Qatari officials and top business leaders to foster economic collaboration. Both countries also signed an agreement to elevate their bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership.
During a special briefing, Arun Kumar Chatterjee, Secretary (CPV & OIA) in the Ministry of External Affairs, highlighted that the two leaders agreed to set a target of doubling bilateral trade within five years. “Trade, investment, and energy were among the major topics discussed. The current trade volume stands at approximately USD 14 billion annually, and both sides have agreed to aim for USD 28 billion over the next five years,” Chatterjee said.
Qatar emerged as a key partner in India’s investment landscape, with the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) currently holding around USD 1.5 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI) in India. Chatterjee noted that both leaders identified new sectors for QIA to increase its investments in the Indian market.
A Joint Business Forum, co-chaired by the Ministers of Commerce and Industry from both countries, was held earlier in the day. The forum brought together top industrialists and institutions from India and Qatar, facilitating productive discussions on future business collaborations.
The Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, arrived in New Delhi on Monday for a two-day state visit, marking his first trip to India since 2015. In a special gesture, Prime Minister Modi personally received him at Palam Technical Airport.
Earlier in the day, the Amir received a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he was greeted by President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi. President Murmu is scheduled to host a banquet reception in honor of the Amir and his delegation later in the evening.

Title: India negotiating FTA with GCC and Qatar: MEA
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:29:15 +0000
Content: India is actively negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar pact with Qatar, aiming to deepen bilateral ties and boost cooperation in trade, energy, investment, and security.
The development was announced during a special briefing on the state visit of the Amir of Qatar to India. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Secretary (CPV & OIA) Arun Kumar Chatterjee said, “India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are currently negotiating a free trade agreement. As for Qatar, both sides are exploring the possibility of signing a similar agreement in the future, which was part of the discussions during this round of talks.”
India shares deep historical and economic ties with the Gulf region. Qatar, one of India’s closest allies in the Gulf, plays a pivotal role in India’s energy security, accounting for 41% of the country’s total natural gas imports. The Gulf region is also home to millions of Indian expatriates whose remittances significantly contribute to India’s economy. According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, remittances from the UAE alone amounted to USD 15.40 billion in the financial year 2020-21, representing 18% of India’s total inward remittances.
The GCC, comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, is India’s largest trading partner bloc, with bilateral trade reaching over USD 154 billion in FY 2021-22. Negotiations for an India-GCC FTA, which began in 2004 with a Framework Agreement on Economic Cooperation, had stalled but have now resumed with renewed momentum.
During the visit, India and Qatar signed an agreement to elevate their bilateral ties to a strategic partnership and exchanged multiple Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) covering trade, energy, investment, innovation, technology, food security, culture, and people-to-people ties.
The two leaders also reviewed the landmark agreement signed in February 2024 between Qatar Energy and Petronet LNG Limited, under which Qatar will supply 7.5 million metric tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India from 2028 for 20 years. “India and Qatar share a vibrant energy partnership, and both leaders discussed ways to broaden this partnership, including exploring mutual investments,” Chatterjee said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the Amir of Qatar for his support to the large Indian community in Qatar, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. “India and Qatar enjoy deep-rooted, friendly relations anchored in historic trade and people-to-people ties,” he remarked.
The Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, arrived in India on a two-day visit and received a ceremonial welcome with a Guard of Honour at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Title: Recapitalisation, reforms have worked well for public sector banks: SBI Chairman
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:44:13 +0000
Content: Recapitalisation and reforms in recent years have worked well for public sector banks, resulting in cleaner balance sheets, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman C.S. Setty said on Tuesday.
The savings behaviour has also changed, as depositors are practising asset allocation across segments, Setty said during the NDTV Profit Conclave here.
He highlighted the critical role of capital in achieving the vision of a developed India (Viksit Bharat) and stressed the need for diversified sources of debt capital beyond traditional bank loans.
“The trust element was always there, and PSBs have always enjoyed a great amount of trust from depositors. What has changed in recent years is that recognition, recapitalisation, and reforms have truly worked for public sector banks,” he told the gathering.
Setty further stated that the balance sheets are cleaner.
“Most importantly, from the last cycle, we have learned our lesson in terms of using the vast amount of data now available to underwrite loans effectively,” he said.
PSU banks, traditionally wholesale lenders, have now adopted a diversified mix of retail, agriculture, MSME, and corporate loans, resulting in more balanced loan books.
According to Setty, capital is a critical element for the blueprint of Viksit Bharat.
“Currently, much of the debt capital comes from bank loans. The nature of savings is undergoing a change, with a shift in depositors’ behaviour and asset allocation across segments of savers,” he stated.
The SBI Chairman emphasised the need to deepen the bond market and leverage capital from mutual funds, insurance, and pension funds to achieve the goal of a $35 trillion economy by 2047.
The country’s largest public sector lender reported an impressive 84.32 per cent surge in net profit year-on-year, reaching ₹16,891 crore for the October-December quarter (Q3 FY25), compared to ₹9,164 crore in the year-ago period. The profit rise was driven by higher core income during the quarter.
The net interest income (NII), or core income, increased by 4.09 per cent from a year ago, standing at ₹41,445.5 crore compared to ₹39,816 crore, according to the bank’s stock exchange filing.
The gross NPA ratio improved to 2.07 per cent as of December 31, 2024, down from 2.13 per cent in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, the net NPA ratio remained unchanged at 0.53 per cent.

Title: BJP sweeps Gujarat local body polls
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:14:33 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again asserted its dominance in Gujarat’s local body elections, securing a decisive victory in the Junagadh Municipal Corporation by winning 48 out of 60 seats in the February 16 polls.
According to the State Election Commission (SEC), eight seats were won unopposed by the BJP before polling began, while voting took place for the remaining 52 seats. Out of these, the BJP clinched 40 seats, while the main opposition party secured 11 seats, and one independent candidate emerged victorious from Ward No. 9.
In Sanand Municipality, elections were held for 27 out of 28 seats, with one seat won unopposed by the BJP before polling. Out of the 27 contested seats, the BJP secured 24, while the Congress managed to win only three.
Meanwhile, in Bavla Municipality, the BJP reached the halfway mark of 14 out of 28 seats, while the Congress secured 13 seats, and one seat went to a BSP candidate. This close contest could lead to an interesting political scenario in Bavla, as no party has achieved a clear majority yet.
The third municipality in Ahmedabad district, Dhandhuka, also went to the polls, but its results were still awaited, according to the State Election Commission.
In Dakor Municipality, a political deadlock emerged as the BJP secured 12 seats, while independent candidates won 14 seats, leaving no party with a clear majority. The Congress failed to win a single seat in Dakor, marking a significant setback for the opposition in this region.
Additionally, the BJP swept the district panchayat by-elections, winning all nine seats across Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Panchmahal, Dahod, Bharuch, Dangs, and Botad. Notably, in Panchmahal, the BJP candidate won unopposed.
These local body elections were also significant as they marked the first implementation of newly introduced reservation policies for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in several local bodies.

Title: IPL 2025 full squads and fixtures: how every team lines up
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:19:05 +0000
Content: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket tournament organised by the Indian board (BCCI).
First held in 2008, it quickly became the most lucrative cricket competition in the world, with a brand value of $12 billion, according to a December 2024 report by brand valuation consultancy firm Brand Finance.
Here is what you need to know about the 18th edition of the competition, which kicks off next month:
WHEN IS THE IPL HAPPENING?
* The 18th edition of the IPL runs from March 22 to May 25.
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE IPL?
* The 10 participating teams are split into two groups. Each team play twice, home and away, against other teams in the group and the team in the same row in the other group, along with one match each against the remaining four teams from the opposite group, totalling 14 matches in the group stage.
* The top four teams in a unified points table will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams will play each other in ‘Qualifier 1,’ with the winner reaching the final.
* The teams placed third and fourth will compete in the ‘Eliminator’ match where the winner will progress to ‘Qualifier 2,’ taking on the loser of ‘Qualifier 1’ for a place in the final.
* Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, and Punjab Kings are in Group 1. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Lucknow Super Giants are in Group 2.
WHERE IS THE IPL TAKING PLACE?
* The IPL is held in the home cities of the franchises based across India. However, some teams may choose to split their home games between two or more cities.
* The 2025 edition will be played across 13 venues.
* Eden Gardens, the home ground of defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders, will host the opening game, ‘Qualifier 2’ and the final. Sunrisers Hyderabad, who finished second in the table last season, will host the ‘Qualifier 1’ and ‘Eliminator’ matches.
WHO IS INVOLVED IN IPL 2025?
* Some of the biggest names in cricket from around the world will be in action, with England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler fetching the highest price for an overseas player at 157.5 million Indian rupees ($1.81 million) at the player auction in November, joining Gujarat Titans.
* The teams spent over $72.51 million at the auction, with Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, signed by Lucknow Super Giants for $3.11 million, earning the highest price tag.
* World Cup-winning Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has retired from international cricket, will play for Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who both retired from international T20 cricket after India won the 20-over World Cup last year, will also be in action for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, respectively.
* Some former greats of the sport, who are present in the competition as coaches, are Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, and Stephen Fleming coaching Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chennai, respectively.
* Players from India’s politically estranged rivals Pakistan have not played in the IPL since its opening edition in 2008.
Pakistan’s government barred its players from participating in IPL 2009, citing security concerns amid tense relations after the Mumbai militant attacks in November 2008.
Although Pakistan’s authorities cleared their players to participate in the next edition, Pakistani players were snubbed from IPL 2010 and have not featured in the competition since.

Title: South Korea’s parliament presses for Yoon’s removal as impeachment trial winds down
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:44:33 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol could try to impose martial law again or undermine constitutional institutions should he be reinstated, lawyers for parliament argued on Tuesday as his impeachment trial entered its final phase.
After weeks of testimony by high-ranking current and former officials, including some facing criminal charges for their role in the brief imposition of martial law on December 3, lawyers for both sides summarised their arguments and evidence at the Constitutional Court.
“Declaring martial law in a situation that doesn’t fit a national emergency is a declaration of dictatorship and military rule,” Kim Jin-han, a lawyer for the parliament, told the justices.
He cited pro-Yoon protesters who stormed a different court in January.
“If he returns to work, we don’t know if he will again exercise martial law,” Kim said. “If he returns to work, we can’t rule out the possibility that he will attack other state and constitutional institutions.”
The Constitutional Court is due to hold another hearing to question three more witnesses on Thursday, including the impeached prime minister and the former police chief.
The court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. If he is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon has argued that he had a right as president to issue his martial law decree, which lasted around six hours before he rescinded it in the face of parliamentary opposition. He said the move was also justified by political deadlock and threats from “anti-state forces” sympathetic to North Korea.
His case at the Constitutional Court has also included arguments that he never actually intended to stop parliament from operating, even though the order was publicly declared and troops and police were deployed to the legislature.
Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission and later said the decree was necessary in part because the NEC had been unwilling to address concerns over election hacking, a claim rejected by election officials.
Prosecutors have also indicted Yoon on separate criminal charges of leading an insurrection. He was arrested last month and is being held at a detention centre.
The first preparatory hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday.
Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.

Title: Delhi BJP announces ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ at Ramlila Maidan
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:29:52 +0000
Content: Asserting that a new chapter in the national capital’s progress was unfolding, Delhi BJP on Wednesday invited the people to the ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ at Ramlila Maidan, where the Chief Minister and the rest of the cabinet will take their oaths.
In a post on social media platform X in Hindi, the Delhi BJP stated: “A new chapter of Delhi’s progress is about to begin. With the ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’, we all together will move towards new heights of development in Delhi. Come to Ramlila Maidan and witness this historic moment!”
The post mentions that the ceremony will take place on 20 February at 10 a.m.
Interestingly, the BJP has named the oath-taking ceremony ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ following its promise of putting the national capital back on track with development. The party has blamed the previous AAP government for failing to perform its duties. Ahead of the polls, in its manifesto titled ‘Viksit Delhi Sankalp’, the BJP had promised that, when the party forms the government, it would “give Delhi a new direction”.
Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the oath-taking ceremony of the BJP government at the historic Ramlila Ground in Delhi on Thursday. The name of the Chief Minister will be chosen by the BJP Legislature Party at its headquarters on Wednesday evening. After the meeting, a signed letter of support from all the MLAs in favour of the new Chief Minister and Leader of the House will be presented to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) V.K. Saxena.
The BJP won 48 of the 70 seats in the Assembly elections, defeating the Aam Aadmi Party, which secured 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure a single seat for the third consecutive time. Notably, the lotus bloomed in the national capital after 27 years.

Title: Benfica see off Monaco in thriller to reach last 16
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:23:14 +0000
Content: Benfica held determined AS Monaco to a 3-3 draw in a thrilling second leg of their Champions League knockout phase playoff on Tuesday for a 4-3 aggregate win that earned the hosts a place in the competition’s last 16.
Benfica, who had a one-goal advantage from the first leg, opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with winger Kerem Akturkoglu’s close-range strike after a fine pass from Vangelis Pavlidis.
But Monaco had the hosts on the ropes for much of the match and midfielder Takumi Minamino equalised with a simple finish 10 minutes later before Eliesse Ben Seghir put them in front after the break with a stunning first-time shot inside the right post.
Benfica were then awarded a penalty and Pavlidis coolly converted from the spot to make it 2-2 before Monaco substitute George Ilenikhena and Benfica’s Orkun Kokcu added a goal each late on.
“It was a hard game with lots of running, but in the end I am really happy that I could score and help us go through to the next stage,” said player of the match Kokcu.
Benfica will be up against either Liverpool or Barcelona in the last 16, depending on Friday’s draw.
The Portuguese side, who had already beaten Monaco twice this season with a 3-2 away win also in the tournament’s league phase, have never lost at home to a French club.
Monaco gave their travelling fans reasons to believe in a turnaround but an early golden chance by Krepin Diatta to level the tie on aggregate was denied by Benfica keeper Anatoliy Trubin.
The hosts grew into the game and Akturkoglu opened the scoring after Pavlidis recovered the ball just outside the box before squaring it across the face of the goal to the Turkey forward, who scored into an empty net.
BATTLING MONACO
Monaco were rewarded for their strong start and seconds after Breel Embolo hit the post, Minamino equalised in the 32nd minute.
Embolo then misfired an excellent chance in first-half stoppage time as Monaca were on the front foot before and after the restart.
Trubin kept out a powerful attempt by Eliesse Ben Seghir two minutes into the second half. But there was little the Ukrainian goalkeeper could do when the 20-year-old eventually gave Monaco the lead in the 51st minute.
Maghnes Akliouche drove the ball into the box before squaring it to Ben Seghir, who curled it home beautifully.
Benfica were awarded a penalty after Monaco’s Thilo Kehrer brought down Fredrik Aursnes which Pavlidis made no mistake firing home.
Pavlidis, who joined the Portuguese side in July from AZ Alkmaar, has seven goals in the competition this season.
Ilenikhena raised the visitors’ hopes when he restored the lead for Monaco in the 81st minute, aiming low into the middle of the goal in a solo effort seconds after entering the pitch.
But Kokcu levelled for Benfica three minutes later from a perfect cross by Alvaro Carreras.

Title: Musk calls himself ‘tech-support’ for Trump, blasts U.S. bureaucracy for blocking executive orders
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:42:30 +0000
Content: Tesla CEO and DOGE Head Elon Musk has accused the U.S. bureaucracy of obstructing President Donald Trump’s executive orders, claiming that officials are “fighting against the will of the people.”
In a Fox News interview aired Tuesday, Musk criticized the slow implementation of Trump’s directives and asserted that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is working to ensure the orders are enforced. “The president makes these executive orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don’t get implemented,” he said, alleging that bureaucratic resistance undermines democratic governance.
Musk, who openly declared his support for Trump, described himself as the president’s “tech-support.” “I’m here to provide the president with technology support. I’m a technologist, and I try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better,” he said.
Citing an example of bureaucratic obstruction, Musk pointed to the continued funding of luxury hotels for illegal immigrants, despite Trump issuing an executive order to halt taxpayer money for such expenses. “We went in there and said, ‘This is a violation of the presidential executive order. It needs to stop.’ One of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is making sure the president’s orders are actually carried out,” he added.
He further warned that unelected bureaucrats, by resisting Trump’s directives, are undermining democracy. “The president is the elected representative of the people. If the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the president from implementing what the people want, then we live in a bureaucracy, not a democracy,” Musk said.
Reflecting on his shifting political stance, Musk noted that he was once embraced by left-wing circles but now faces hostility for supporting Trump. “I used to be adored by the left. Not anymore… They call it ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome,’ and you don’t realize how real this is,” he said.
Musk also described intense reactions from those opposed to Trump, recalling an incident where merely mentioning the president’s name sparked extreme responses. “It was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular containing methamphetamine and rabies. They become completely irrational,” he said.
Since endorsing Trump, Musk claimed he has faced hostility. “I’m getting dirty looks from everyone—if looks could kill, I’d be dead several times over,” he added.

Title: Djokovic stunned by Berrettini in Qatar Open first round
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:31:28 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic was stunned 7-6(4) 6-2 by Matteo Berrettini in the Qatar Open first round on Tuesday as the Italian enjoyed his first win over the former world number one. 
Berrettini played superbly to knock out the twice champion in one hour 35 minutes and secure his first victory against a top-10 opponent since January 2023. 
“It’s something that I’ve been looking to do,” said former world number six Berrettini, who had lost all four of his previous matches against the Serbian. 
“I played against him in the most important tournaments on tour, had the honour and the pleasure to play against him. I wish I could have won one of those matches as well.” 
World number 35 Berrettini, voted the ATP’s comeback player last year, faces Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor in the next round. 
Djokovic, a 24-times Grand Slam winner who was aiming for a 100th ATP title, was playing his first singles match since retiring from the Australian Open semi-finals due to a hamstring injury. 
The 37-year-old, who last week said he was “almost fully recovered”, had not lost a first-round match since his 2022 Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. 
“I didn’t have any pain or discomfort in that sense. I was outplayed by just a better player today,” said Djokovic. 
“I wasn’t at my desired level, and it could be that I’m still not moving the way I want to move but I played without pain so there is no excuse in that. 
“Things are not the same as 10, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis and it’s more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances.” 
Djokovic will now turn his attention to the doubles event, pairing up with Spaniard Fernando Verdasco against Finn Harri Heliovaara and Britain’s Henry Pattem in the quarter-finals.

Title: Dozens of false killer whales stranded on remote Australian beach
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:23:32 +0000
Content: More than 150 false killer whales have been stranded on an isolated beach in the Australian state of Tasmania, with rescue crews trying to save the majority of the large dolphins that survived the ordeal, authorities said on Wednesday.
Initial checks showed 136 animals were still alive, Tasmania’s environment department said in a statement. Reasons for the beachings are unclear.
The endangered dolphins, which can grow up to 20 feet (6.1 m) long and weigh up to 3,000 lbs (1,361 kg), resemble killer whales. They are found in all tropical and subtropical oceans, generally in deep offshore waters, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“Stranding response in this area is complex due to the inaccessibility of the site, ocean conditions and the challenges of getting specialist equipment to the remote area,” the statement said.
The dolphins were found stranded in the island state’s northwest coast near Arthur River, about 400 km (250 miles) from Tasmania’s state capital, Hobart.

Title: Bayern’s Davies nets late equaliser against Celtic to book last-16 spot
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:02:59 +0000
Content: Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies snatched a last-gasp equaliser against Celtic for a 1-1 draw in their playoff on Tuesday as theyreached the Champions League last-16 by 3-2 on aggregate.
They will next face either fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid depending on Friday’s draw.
Davies scored in stoppage time after former Bayern reserve player Nicolas Kuehn had given the visitors a shock lead in the 63rd minute asthey tried to overturn a first-leg deficit and win a first game in Germany in 16 attempts.
Having lost the first leg 2-1 in Glasgow, Celtic came agonisingly close to forcing extra time with a bold performance that had the hosts on the backfoot for much of the game.
“If you watched the first leg, I don’t think it was surprising,” said Bayern midfielder Leon Goretzka. “Of course we could have made it easier for ourselves by not conceding a goal.”
“We have played three games in six days now and it was all about getting results, which we didand we’re happy about that,” he added after Bayern earned a 0-0 draw at reigning German champions Leverkusen on Saturday.
With the Bavarians made to sweat from the start, Celtic’s Kuehn saw a shot cleared off the line by Raphael Guerreiro in the 16th minute before Daizen Maeda narrowly missed connecting with an Arne Engels cross in front of goal a little later.
Bayern had to wait until the stroke of halftime for their own opportunity, striker Harry Kane hitting the bar with a shot.
The England captain, who had little impact otherwise and was nursing a knock to the head from the Leverkusen game, was taken off at halftime.
KUEHN POUNCES
Bayern came close again seconds after the restart with Goretzka failing to beat goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in a one-on-one.
It was Celtic, however, who broke the deadlock with a deserved goal when Kuehn slotted home following two defensive errors to put Brendan Rodgers’ team in the driving seat.
Bayern upped the tempo and came close with Goretzka and Leroy Sane before Schmeichel pulled off another superb save to deny Joshua Kimmich.
The Danethen did everything right to stop Goretzka’s effort in front of goal in stoppage time but could do nothing when Davies bundled the ball over the line on the rebound.
The equaliser sent the Germans through to the knockout stage and left Celtic’s players and coach bitterly disappointed.
“It was just such a cruel way to not even lose the game but to go out of the competition,” said Rodgers. “A real heroic performance, just unfortunate at the end.
“I think our European credibility has been restored this season, I think we built that up from last year, that’s my takeaway from this season.”

Title: ASI begins underwater exploration to uncover submerged heritage off Dwarka coast
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:59:39 +0000
Content: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has launched a new phase of underwater exploration off the coast of Dwarka, Gujarat, as part of its efforts to uncover and preserve India’s submerged cultural heritage, the Ministry of Culture said on Tuesday.
A team of five archaeologists, led by Prof. Alok Tripathi, Additional Director-General (Archaeology), has begun investigations near the Gomati Creek. The team includes H.K. Nayak, Director (Excavations and Explorations), Dr. Aparajita Sharma, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, Poonam Vind, and Rajkumari Barbina. This marks the first time that an ASI-led underwater exploration team includes a significant number of women archaeologists actively participating in the investigations.
Renewed Focus on Underwater Archaeology
This exploration is part of the revived Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW) of ASI, which has been reactivated to conduct offshore surveys and excavations in Dwarka and Bet Dwarka. Since the 1980s, the UAW has played a key role in underwater archaeological research, with previous explorations at sites including Bangaram Island (Lakshadweep), Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), Loktak Lake (Manipur), and Elephanta Island (Maharashtra).
The ASI has also worked in collaboration with the Indian Navy and other government organizations to study and protect underwater cultural heritage. Between 2005 and 2007, ASI conducted offshore and onshore excavations in Dwarka, leading to the discovery of sculptures and stone anchors during low tide. These findings formed the basis for subsequent underwater excavations.
Preserving India’s Submerged Heritage
The latest underwater investigations mark a crucial step in ASI’s ongoing mission to explore and protect India’s rich underwater heritage. As the UAW continues its research in Dwarka, the findings could offer valuable insights into the historical and cultural significance of submerged structures in the region.

Title: Tiger Woods back in action in TGL loss to New York GC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:33:41 +0000
Content: Tiger Woods on Tuesday made his first start since the death of his mother when he competed in a TGL match at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
It was all over in a proverbial New York Minute for Woods and his Jupiter Links GC teammates Kevin Kisner and Tom Kim as they lost 10-3 in a one-sided shellacking at the hands of the New York Golf Club.
A rampant New York team of Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Cameron Young stormed to an 8-0 lead before coasting to their first victory of the season in the indoor league played on a golf simulator.
Despite the result, Woods seemed to enjoy plenty of laughs, feeding off the humor of his livewire teammate Kisner, and the 15-time major champion appeared more relaxed than in his TGL debut three weeks ago.
His mother Kultida was in the gallery that night, but she died eight days later, on Feb. 4, at the age of 80, which prompted her son to pull out of last week’s PGA Tour Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines, stating that he was still processing the loss.
“She really enjoyed watching me play and it was awesome to have her in the stands,” Woods said of his mother’s presence at his previous TGL match. “It was a great moment and I’m definitely appreciative of her being here. I had a hard time driving down here. I hadn’t hit a golf ball since I played with the president (Trump on Feb. 9).
“It’s been a hard process. I really haven’t thought about golf, and I don’t think I’ll be thinking about it for a bit here.”
Woods, Kisner and Tom Kim did not get on the board until the ninth hole (of 15) on Tuesday. By then the match was all but over as New York improved to 1-2 for the season. Jupiter Links dropped to 1-2.
Woods also admitted that the evening included “one of the most embarrassing moments in my golfing career.”
Due to a misunderstanding with his caddie, Woods hit his second shot on the 13th hole 100 yards when he was actually 199 yards away from the green.
Woods’ teammates laughed heartily at the error.
“I just screwed up,” Woods said. “That was embarrassing.”
Six teams are competing in the inaugural season of the fast-paced league, which is attempting to appeal to a young demographic by encouraging players, among other things, to indulge in what passes in golf for trash-talking.
“We’re here for the entertainment,” Kisner said just before hitting his tee shot into a bunker at the 14th hole.
“That’s a lot more fun than the last two matches,” said Fowler, happy to be on the victorious side.

Title: India emerges as a global leader in science, technology, and innovation: Dr. Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:20:50 +0000
Content: India is no longer just a follower on the global stage; it is now leading in multiple fields, including space exploration, biotechnology, nuclear energy, and scientific research. Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, and Minister of State for PMO, made this bold assertion during a recent address, highlighting India’s remarkable advancements and rising prominence in the world of science and technology.
India’s space sector has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. With ambitious missions and successful international collaborations, India has positioned itself as a key player in space exploration. The Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), part of India’s growing technological capabilities, is paving the way for future missions such as Gaganyaan, Chandrayaan-4, and the Bharatiya Antariksh Station—India’s forthcoming international space station.
India’s rise in the space sector is underscored by its increasing role in satellite launches. Over the past decade, the country has launched 433 foreign satellites, earning substantial revenues—$157 million and €260 million—from 2014 to 2023. The success of Chandrayaan-3, which made India the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole, has propelled India to the forefront of lunar exploration. The global scientific community, including NASA, is now keenly awaiting India’s findings from the Moon’s southern pole.
India’s achievements in biotechnology and bioeconomy are equally impressive. The nation became the first to develop a DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, cementing its leadership in vaccine research. Additionally, India introduced the world’s first herpesvirus vaccine for cervical cancer, further establishing itself as a global leader in preventive healthcare.
The bioeconomy has also flourished, growing from $10 billion in 2014 to nearly $140 billion today. Projections suggest it will reach $250 billion in the coming years, fueled by a surge in biotech startups—almost 9,000 today compared to just 50 in 2014. India is also gaining ground in bio-manufacturing, ranking third in the Asia-Pacific region and 12th globally, with its influence rapidly expanding.
India is also pioneering space biology, with significant investments in research focused on sustaining life beyond Earth. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology have signed an MoU to advance space biotechnology, focusing on growing plants in space to support long-term space missions. Research in space medicine and human physiology in extraterrestrial environments is expected to be crucial as humanity looks to expand its presence beyond Earth.
In nuclear energy, India has set an ambitious goal of generating 100 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2047. This effort will contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions by 50%, positioning India as a leader in sustainable energy development. India’s nuclear policy, originally envisioned by Homi Bhabha for peaceful purposes, is now viewed as a model of responsible energy development worldwide.
India’s standing in scientific research has gained global recognition. The country is now ranked fourth worldwide in scientific publications, and projections suggest it could surpass the United States to become the leading nation in scientific research by 2030. This growing dominance is also reflected in India’s space economy, which is expected to grow five to ten times in the next decade, further solidifying its leadership in science and bio-manufacturing.
Dr. Singh emphasized that India’s rise is no longer about catching up but about setting the global agenda.

Title: After decades in exile, Syria’s Jews visit Damascus
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:06:37 +0000
Content: For the first time in three decades, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll in a synagogue in the heart of Syria’s capital Damascus, carefully passing their thumbs over the handwritten text as if still in awe they were back home.
The father and son fled Syria in the 1990s, after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country’s historic Jewish community, which had faced decades of restrictions including on owning property or holding jobs.
Virtually all of the few thousand Jews in Syria promptly left, leaving less than 10 in the Syrian capital. Joseph and Henry – just a child at the time – settled in New York.
“Weren’t we in a prison? So we wanted to see what was on the outside,” said Joseph, now 77, on his reasons for leaving at the time. “Everyone else who left with us is dead.”
But when Assad’s son and successor as president Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December, the Hamra family began planning a once-unimaginable visit to Damascus with the help of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group.
They met with Syria’s deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now managed by caretaker authorities installed by the Islamist rebels who ousted Assad after more than 50 years of family rule that saw itself as a bastion of secular Arab nationalism.
The new authorities have said all of Syria’s communities will play a role in their country’s future. But incidents of religious intolerance and reports of conservative Islamists proselytizing in public have kept more secular-minded Syrians and members of minority communities on edge.
Henry Hamra, now aged 48, said Syria’s foreign ministry had now pledged to protect Jewish heritage.
“We need the government’s help, we need the government’s security and it’s going to happen,” he said.
Walking through the narrow passages of the Old City, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site, Henry and Joseph ran into their onetime neighbours – Palestinian Syrians – and later marveled at hand-painted Hebrew lettering at several synagogues.
“I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,” said Henry.
But some things were missing, he said, including a golden-lettered Torah from one of the synagogues that was now stored in a library in Israel, to where thousands of Syrian Jews fled throughout the 20th century.
While the synagogues and Jewish school in the Old City remained relatively well-preserved, Syria’s largest synagogue in Jobar, an eastern suburb of Damascus, was reduced to rubble during the nearly 14-year civil war that erupted after Assad’s violent suppression of protests against him.
Jobar was home to a large Jewish community for hundreds of years until the 1800s and the synagogue, built in honour of the biblical prophet Elijah, was looted before it was destroyed.

Title: Always exciting to hear PM Modi’s vision for India, says Rishi Sunak
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:22:34 +0000
Content: Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “friend”, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday said that it is “always exciting” to hear PM Modi’s vision for India.
Sunak and his family met the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday evening, having detailed conversation on many subjects.
PM Modi said that Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.
Taking to X, Prime Minister Modi wrote, “It was a delight to meet former UK PM, Mr. Rishi Sunak and his family! We had a wonderful conversation on many subjects. Mr. Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.”
The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom replied to the PM’s post on Wednesday, highlighting his strong friendship with the Indian leader and PM Modi’s constant support for strengthening India-UK relations.
“Wonderful to catch up with my friend Narendra Modi. Thank you for so warmly welcoming my family, too! Always exciting to hear your vision for India, and so important the UK-India relationship goes from strength to strength,” Sunak posted on X.
Born to Indian parents in Southampton with roots in Punjab, Sunak is the first Indian-origin person to have served as the UK Prime Minister from 2022 to 2024.
Always proud of his Indian roots, Sunak batted for having close ties with India in economic, security and scientific spheres as both nations collaborated in areas like finance, technology, healthcare, and education besides establishing the FinTech Bridge connecting London and Mumbai.
As the Conservative Party leader conceded defeat in the UK general election in July 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Rishi Sunak’s contribution to consolidate ties between the two nations during his tenure as the UK Prime Minister.
“Thank you Rishi Sunak for your admirable leadership of the UK, and your active contribution to deepen the ties between India and the UK during your term in office. Best wishes to you and your family for the future,” PM Modi posted on X on July 5, 2024.
Sunak had also congratulated PM Modi on the BJP-led NDA’s third straight election victory last year, insisting that the UK and India share the closest of friendships which would continue to thrive.
In May 2024, as the UK Prime Minister, he hailed India’s rise as an ‘economic superpower’, asserting that new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

Title: Fat, not muscle: drugmakers in race for next weight-loss breakthrough
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:15:11 +0000
Content: Current weight-loss methods such as lifestyle changes, surgery, and popular therapies like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound result in both fat and muscle loss that can increase the risk of falls and decrease overall strength, which could be especially harmful for older patients.
The following companies are developing weight-loss treatments that help preserve or grow muscles while patients shed pounds:
Eli Lilly
The U.S. drugmaker spent nearly $2 billion in 2023 to acquire Versanis Bio’s bimagrumab, which prevents the activity of a protein called myostatin to help preserve muscle.
Lilly is testing bimagrumab alone and in combination with Novo’s Wegovy — a mid-stage trial begun before the acquisition — with a main goal of change in total body weight. It is also partnering with China-based Laekna to develop a similar drug.
Regeneron
Regeneron is testing its drug, trevogrumab, along with Wegovy and another treatment, garetosmab, in a three-part study with healthy and obese participants. Trevogrumab is an antibody that belongs to the same class of treatments as Lilly’s bimagrumab.
The study, expected to be completed next year, has a main goal of change in body weight, but also will measure change in fat mass, waist circumference, body composition, and thigh muscle volume. It is expected to be completed next year.
Scholar Rock
The drug developer is testing apitegromab, an experimental therapy that targets the myostatin protein, alongside GLP-1 treatments. Its drug helped improve motor function for patients with spinal muscular atrophy in a late-stage study.
The mid-stage study plans to enroll 100 patients and evaluate changes in total lean mass, or fat-free mass. Secondary goals include changes in body weight and various types of fat.
Roche
Swiss drugmaker Roche began a study last year of its experimental drug, RG6237, as a monotherapy in people with high body weight. The drug, known as an anti-latent myostatin, works by eliminating an inactive form of the protein from the blood.
Roche plans to start a mid-stage trial this year combining the drug and its own GLP-1 weight-loss drug candidate CT-388.
Biohaven
Biohaven is evaluating its myostatin targeting drug, taldefgrobep alfa, in an early-stage obesity trial.
The drug recently failed to improve motor function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, but helped cut total body fat mass and showed numerically larger increases in lean mass and bone density compared to placebo.
It said it plans to rapidly advance a mid-stage study of the drug in patients with obesity.
Keros Pharma
Keros’ drug, KER-065, which targets myostatin and activin A proteins, increased lean mass and reduced fat mass in obese mice when given alone and in combination with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic.
Keros said it will assess the drug’s safety in an early-stage study of male patients with obesity. Data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2025.
Elevai Biosciences
Elevai Biosciences, a unit of PMGC Holdings, acquired two myostatin targeting drugs – EL-22 and EL-32 – from South Korean firm MOA Life Plus last year.
The company, previously known as Elevai Labs, plans to seek an FDA green light to begin human studies this year for both experimental drugs in combination with GLP-1 treatments.
Veru
Veru’s oral drug, enobosarm, targets the androgen hormones that play a role in body development and reproductive health. In a mid-stage study, patients who received the drug along with Wegovy lost 71% less lean, or muscle, mass on average than those who received Wegovy and a placebo over 16 weeks.
The company will test whether its drug can improve stair climb power in patients aged 60 and older in a larger, late-stage study.
35 Pharma
Montreal, Canada-based 35Pharma plans to test the safety of its experimental drug, HS235, in an early-stage study. The treatment targets activin and GDF ligands – two proteins that play a key role in regulating skeletal muscle, blood and bone metabolism. Data from this study is expected in the second half of this year.
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals has two RNA-based obesity drugs in its pipeline – ARO-INHBE and ARO-ALK7 – that intervene in a pathway that signals the body to store fat. The company plans to evaluate ARO-INHBE in human studies this year, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Lilly’s tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro.
Six Peaks/AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca in May 2024 agreed to pay up to $80 million to SixPeaks Bio to work with the Swiss biotech start-up on its antibody that targets activin cell receptors to preserve muscle mass in people on weight-loss therapy. Under the deal, Astra also obtained certain exclusive rights to acquire SixPeaks.

Title: Putin-Trump meeting is possible this month but may be later, Kremlin says
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:14:36 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump could meet this month, although the first face-to-face encounter between a Russian and a U.S. leader since 2021 could take longer to prepare, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.
Trump said on Tuesday he would probably meet Putin this month and dismissed Ukraine’s concern about being left out of U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia, while suggesting Kyiv could have reached a deal with Russia earlier.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the meeting in Riyadh was focused mostly on Russian-U.S. bilateral ties but that it was a “very, very important step” towards reaching a settlement on the Ukraine war, nearing the end of its third year.
“But this is the first step… Naturally, it’s impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,” Peskov said.
Asked if a meeting between Putin and Trump could take place this month, Peskov was quoted by Interfax as saying: “Possibly. And possibly not.”
Putin and Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden held a summit in Geneva in June 2021. That was the most recent time a U.S. and Russian leader met face to face, though Biden and Putin had a call in February 2022 and messages were passed via intermediaries.
Trump has upended Western policy on Russia and Ukraine, ordering talks with Russia without Ukraine or European powers, speaking to Putin, and talking about bringing down the price of oil – of which Russia is a major exporter.
Trump says he wants to end the war and that he thinks Putin wants to do a deal. But he has yet to spell out his plan for halting a conflict that has left swathes of Ukraine destroyed, killed or injured hundreds of thousands of people and raised fears of a direct confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world’s two biggest nuclear powers.
The talks in Riyadh were the first that the U.S. and Russia have held to seek an end to the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two.
No Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine’s armed forces.
In 2022, Putin sent his army into Ukraine in what he called a “special military operation”. He said it was needed to protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine and counter what he said was a grave threat to Russia from potential Ukrainian membership of NATO.
Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab that threatens European security, and say that Russia could go further and attack NATO one day. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.

Title: Hong Kong and Uyghur communities in Ireland urge government to confront China on transnational repression during Wang Yi’s visit
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:08:52 +0000
Content: Members of the Hong Kong and Uyghur communities in Ireland have called on the Irish government to address China’s transnational repression and human rights violations during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Dublin.
Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, arrived in Ireland after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he met with top European leaders. He is scheduled to hold discussions with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris, The Irish Times reported.
In a joint statement, organizations representing Uyghurs and Hongkongers in Ireland urged the government to take concrete action against China’s repression, including allegations of genocide, politically motivated imprisonment, and harassment of diaspora communities.
The groups raised concerns over Chinese government surveillance and intimidation of dissidents on Irish soil, warning that these activities pose a direct threat to Ireland’s national security.
“We do not feel we can openly exercise our right to protest for fear of retribution by the regime—whether against our family members back home, within Ireland itself, or by losing our chance to visit our homelands,” the statement read, as quoted by The Irish Times.
They highlighted that the European Union has acknowledged China’s pattern of transnational repression, particularly targeting Tibetan, Taiwanese, Hongkonger, and Uyghur communities.
The statement also referenced a recent case where Hong Kong authorities detained the relatives of an exiled activist to punish her for participating in a legal protest in London. Such incidents, the groups said, have created a climate of fear among diasporic Hongkongers in Ireland and beyond.
The European Hong Kong Diaspora Alliance, the Irish Uyghur Cultural Association, and Stand With Hong Kong urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to raise these concerns with Wang, emphasizing that diplomatic ties and economic relations should not come at the cost of fundamental freedoms.
“People in Ireland have a right to live free from fear,” the statement added.
Wang Yi’s visit marks the second high-profile Chinese delegation to Ireland in just over a year, following Premier Li Qiang’s trip in January 2024.
China’s foreign ministry, announcing the visit last week, described Ireland as a “strategic partner for mutually beneficial cooperation,” saying that bilateral ties have maintained “sound growth momentum.”

Title: SBI pegs India’s GDP growth at 6.3% for Q3 of 2024-25
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:05:05 +0000
Content: SBI economists have pegged India’s GDP growth at 6.2-6.3 per cent for Q3 (October-December) of 2024-25 driven by buoyant demand and Capex trends along with the increase in EBIDTA and corporate GVA recorded by India Inc.
The SBI report released on Wednesday considers the slowdown in the second quarter (Q2) as a “blip” and states that “presuming no major revisions are announced in the erstwhile Q1 and Q2 figures by NSO, we estimate the FY25 full year GDP at 6.3 per cent.”
The official GDP data for the third quarter is expected to be released on February 28.
The report states that the percentage of indicators showing acceleration has increased to 74 per cent in Q3FY25 vs 71 per cent in Q2FY25.
Continuing the momentum, a healthy rural economy is further reinforcing stability and sustains momentum in other sectors even as rural agriculture wage growth is consistent and domestic tractor sales and rabi crop sown have picked up momentum.
The report highlights that Capex is showing improvement in Q3 FY25 with majority of the states’ Capex as a percentage of BE (Budget estimate) being lower in FY25 on date but embracing a momentum in Q3 FY25, which augurs well for future developments.
It also points out that IIP manufacturing growth has improved from 3.3 per cent in Q2 FY25 to 4.3 per cent in Q3 FY25 and the SBI Index is also showing positive momentum in Q3.
India Inc. has reported positive EBIDTA growth/margins (44 bps) after two quarters, while Corporate GVA has improved substantially (QoQ), according to the report.
The report further states that despite the global slowdown, India has continued to remain one of the fastest growing economies.
It highlights that the recent update of the IMF’s global growth forecast estimates India’s growth at 6.5 per cent for both FY25 and FY26 on the back of robust domestic demand, infrastructure support and the Government’s strategic policy interventions
The SBI has built a ‘Nowcasting Model,’ to estimate GDP statistically, with 36 high frequency indicators associated with industry activity, service activity, and global economy.
The model uses the dynamic factor model to estimate the common or representative or latent factor of all the high frequency indicators from Q4 of FY13 to Q1 of FY23.

Title: India’s CNG vehicle count surged 3-fold to 7.5 million units in last 8 years amid green push: Crisil
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:53:57 +0000
Content: Domestic annual sales of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles are forecast to reach 1.1 million units by the end of the current financial year, driven by the government’s ongoing push for cleaner fuels, according to a Crisil report released on Wednesday.
This will take the CNG vehicle count in India to 7.5 million, a 3 times increase from 2.6 million in fiscal 2016, and translate into a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 12 per cent, the report states.
The rapid uptake has been undergirded by the expansion of the CNG infrastructure, with the number of filling stations set to rise to over 7,400 from 1,081 in fiscal 2016, etching a CAGR of 24 per cent.
The report also states that rising sales of CNG passenger vehicles has driven up their penetration in the overall passenger vehicle population to 15-16 per cent this fiscal-end vs 5.6 per cent in fiscal 2016.
The availability of over 30 CNG car variants, compared with single digit not long ago, thus catering to diverse consumer preferences, has accelerated adoption.
The commercial vehicle segment has also been gaining traction amid growing options that offer tangible cost savings, with penetration levels currently at 10-11 per cent.
Penetration in the two-wheeler segment is growing as well, following the introduction of CNG options, the report states.
However, the three-wheeler segment, which currently has a penetration level of 28-29 per cent, will need to navigate competition from Electric Vehicles (EVs), according to the report.
CNG consumption has increased in tandem with the rise in sales of CNG vehicles, at a CAGR of around 13 per cent between fiscal years 2016 and 2025.
The expansion and distribution of CNG infrastructure can be gauged from the fact that the share of the top five states has reduced to 55 per cent in fiscal 2025 from over 90 per cent in fiscal 2016, with newly awarded geographical areas gaining traction, the report points out.
Congestion levels at filling stations are also expected to decrease, with the number of vehicles per station reducing by around half since fiscal 2016, thereby enhancing overall customer experience and operational efficiency of the CNG stations.
Going forward as well, the expansion of CNG infrastructure in cities such as Chennai and in tier-II cities is expected to support sustained sales of CNG and, in turn, CNG vehicles, the report states.
However, on a cautionary note, the report also points out that the development of the CNG market could be impacted by factors such as low availability of cheap domestic natural gas and increasing competitiveness from alternative fuels.
Also, the recent cut in Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM) gas allocation for CNG, including a drop from 68 per cent to 51 per cent in October 2024, and a further reduction to 37 per cent in November 2024 (later revised to 50 per cent in January 2025), have created uncertainty and increased the gas sourcing cost of city gas distributors, the report added.
APM gas allocation is the supply of natural gas to city gas distributors (CGD) at a regulated price.
This gas is used for essential services like piped natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG).

Title: From student leader to chief minister: The political journey of Rekha Gupta
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:07:22 +0000
Content: In a significant development, first-time BJP MLA Rekha Gupta has been appointed as the Chief Minister of Delhi after the party secured victory in the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections.
Gupta was named the BJP legislature party leader after several rounds of meetings, with the last one taking place at the BJP headquarters on Wednesday in Delhi. She will be sworn in as the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi on Thursday at a grand ceremony at Ramlila Maidan.
She was picked for the top post after the key legislative party meeting of BJP leaders on Wednesday evening. Two BJP observers along with 48 MLAs, held deliberation at the BJP office in Delhi, following which Gupta’s name was announced for the Delhi CM post.
Gupta’s appointment marks a historic moment as she becomes the fourth woman to hold the prestigious post in the capital city, following in the footsteps of leaders like former CM Sheila Dikshit. Gupta’s victory in the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections is particularly remarkable as she won the Shalimar Bagh seat by a commanding margin of 29,595 votes, defeating AAP’s Bandana Kumari.
Born on July 19, 1974, in Nandgarh village of Jind district in Haryana, Rakha Gupta’s father served as a bank officer. In 1976, the family moved to Delhi when Gupta was just two years old. She grew up and completed her education in the capital city, where her strong academic background laid the foundation for her future political career.
Gupta’s entry into politics began during her student years. As a student at Delhi University, she joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Her active involvement in student politics led to her election as the President of Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) for the 1996-1997 term. She also served as the Secretary of Dyal Singh College and was deeply engaged in student activism, which propelled her further into public life.
Rekha Gupta’s political career with the BJP began in the early 2000s. She joined the party’s youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), and held the role of secretary in the Delhi unit. Gupta’s leadership skills were quickly recognised, and she was appointed the National Secretary of BJYM from 2004 to 2006. Her strong organisational abilities and dedication to the party’s mission helped her gain prominence within the BJP ranks.
In 2007, Gupta was elected as a councillor in the MCD elections, representing the North Pitampura constituency. She went on to serve as the President of the Women’s Welfare and Child Development Committee in MCD from 2007 to 2009. She also held several other key positions, including General Secretary of the Delhi BJP Women’s Wing, and National Executive Member of the party.
Despite her sound political exposure, Gupta also faced sizeable challenges in her electoral journey. She contested the Shalimar Bagh seat in both the 2015 and 2020 Delhi Assembly elections but was defeated by AAP’s Bandana Kumari in both years. However, Gupta’s persistence and unwavering commitment to her constituents paid off in 2025 when she triumphed in the Shalimar Bagh seat, reclaiming it with a decisive victory.

Title: Rekha Gupta chosen BJP legislature party leader, set to become Delhi’s fourth woman CM
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:23:33 +0000
Content: The long suspense over ‘who will be the next Delhi Chief Minister’ ended on Wednesday evening with first-time MLA Rekha Gupta being chosen as the leader of the BJP legislature party, paving the way for her to take over the post.
Gupta, the MLA from Shalimar Bagh, was chosen at a meeting of the BJP legislature party at the state party office at Pant Marg this evening, under the supervision of two central observers – former Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and BJP national Secretary Om Prakash Dhankhar.
As the meeting began to elect the BJP legislature party leader, there was intense speculation about a woman legislator taking over the mantle. Gupta will be the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi after Sushma Swaraj (BJP), Sheila Dikshit (Congress), and Atishi (AAP).
Even before the announcement of her name, celebrations had broken out at the house of Gupta, a former Delhi University Students Union President and municipal councillor.
After being chosen by the BJP legislators, Gupta is slated to head to the Raj Niwas, where she will meet Lt Governor V.K. Saxena and stake claim to form the next government.
The new Chief Minister will take oath at a grand swearing-in ceremony at the city’s iconic Ramlila Maidan at noon tomorrow. The new CM will be administered the oath of office and secrecy by Lt Governor Saxena, amidst the presence of top BJP brass and leaders of allied parties on the dais. A gathering of car drivers, auto drivers and slum-dwellers will be among the key bunch of people who will garner attention at the oath-taking ceremony.
The oath-taking ceremony will take place from 11 a.m. to 12.34 p.m., with the Chief Minister’s swearing-in set for 12.05 p.m. The event will be attended by several key political figures, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, along with over 200 BJP MPs and MLAs, and invited religious leaders.
The name of the new Chief Minister had remained a closely guarded secret till now, apparently because the process got delayed due to the Prime Minister’s trips to France and the United States.
The BJP, which had been out of power in Delhi since 1998, won a convincing victory in the 2025 Assembly elections, winning 48 seats in the 70-member Assembly, and reducing the AAP to 22.

Title: Trump’s approval rating slips as Americans worry about the economy
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:08:52 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s approval rating has ticked slightly lower in recent days as more Americans worried about the direction of the U.S. economy as the new leader threatens a host of countries with tariffs, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
The six-day poll, which closed on Tuesday, showed 44% of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing as president, down from 45% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 24-26. Trump’s approval rating stood at 47% in a January 20-21 poll conducted in the hours after the Republican’s return to the White House.
The share of Americans who disapprove of his presidency has risen more substantially, to 51% in the latest poll, compared with 41% right after he took office.

Trump enjoys a relatively high rate of approval on his immigration policy, with 47% of respondents backing his approach that has included promises to ramp up deportations of migrants in the country illegally. The share was little changed from January.
But the share of Americans who think the economy is on the wrong track rose to 53% in the latest poll from 43% in the January 24-26 poll. Public approval of Trump’s economic stewardship fell to 39% from 43% in the prior poll.
A pillar of Trump’s political strength has been public belief that his policies will be good for the economy, and his rating on the economy remains significantly higher than the final readings of his predecessor in office, Democrat Joe Biden, who ended his term with a 34% approval rating on the economy. But Trump’s rating for the economy is well below the 53% he had in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted in February 2017, the first full month of his first term as U.S. president.

In the latest poll, only 32% of respondents approved of Trump’s performance on inflation, a potential early sign of disappointment in the Republican’s performance on a core economic issue after several years of rising prices weakened Biden ahead of last year’s presidential election. Trump defeated Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, in the Electoral College and narrowly won the popular vote.
A recent report from the U.S. Labor Department showed consumer prices rose by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January, with Americans facing higher costs for a range of goods and services. Other economic data has shown U.S. households expect inflation to pick up following Trump’s February 1 announcements for steep tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.
While the levies on Mexico and Canada were since delayed until March, Trump has set March 12 as the start date for other tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and he has directed his staff to devise global reciprocal tariffs.
Fifty-four percent of respondents in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said they opposed new tariffs on imported goods from other countries, while 41% were in favor of them. Increasing tariffs on Chinese goods had higher levels of support, with 49% in favor and 47% against.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 4,145 U.S. adults nationwide and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points in either direction.

Title: MeitY launches Digital Brand Identity Manual to strengthen India’s digital governance
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:02:44 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has taken a significant step forward in strengthening India’s digital governance with the launch of the Digital Brand Identity Manual (DBIM) and the commencement of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Conference 2025. The event, held in New Delhi on Wednesday, was led by Jitin Prasada, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, and S. Krishnan, Secretary for MeitY.
The DBIM is part of the “Gov.In: Harmonisation of Government of India’s Digital Footprint” initiative, aimed at streamlining the digital presence of government bodies across the country. This initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Reform, Perform, and Transform,” making digital governance more accessible, inclusive, and citizen-centric.
In his address, Prasada emphasized that the launch of DBIM would support the government’s approach of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” by ensuring uniformity and cohesion in the digital presence of ministries, departments, and other government entities. He stressed that DBIM aims to improve accessibility and transparency, while boosting trust in India’s e-governance ecosystem. The manual is designed to simplify government websites and make them more user-friendly, allowing citizens from diverse backgrounds to easily access government services.
The introduction of the Central Content Publishing System (CCPS) will help improve transparency by making government policies, schemes, and initiatives readily accessible to the public. Additionally, the manual calls for the incorporation of AI-driven tools and enhanced security measures to build a future-ready and trustworthy digital ecosystem.
MeitY’s digital initiative also includes the development of a DBIM Toolkit, aimed at ensuring consistency in digital identity across government platforms. The Gov.In CMS platform will streamline website management for government entities, while CCPS will centralize content governance. Furthermore, social media guidelines have been introduced to standardize digital communication across platforms.
As part of the launch, MeitY unveiled its own DBIM-compliant website, showcasing the streamlined and citizen-friendly digital experience that is set to be adopted across other ministries and departments. Four ministry websites have already migrated to the Gov.In CMS platform, with more expected to follow suit.
The First CIO Conference 2025 brought together experts from MeitY, NIC, MyGov, and various other ministries to discuss the adoption and implementation of DBIM. The conference highlighted key areas such as harmonizing government websites to establish a unified digital brand identity, enhancing website accessibility and performance through the Gov.In platform, and localizing content to ensure inclusivity. Another critical topic of discussion was ensuring compliance with the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites and Apps (GIGW) and STQC Certification for quality assurance.

Title: India emerges as a global leader in science, technology, and innovation: Dr. Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:20:50 +0000
Content: India is no longer just a follower on the global stage; it is now leading in multiple fields, including space exploration, biotechnology, nuclear energy, and scientific research. Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, and Minister of State for PMO, made this bold assertion during a recent address, highlighting India’s remarkable advancements and rising prominence in the world of science and technology.
India’s space sector has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. With ambitious missions and successful international collaborations, India has positioned itself as a key player in space exploration. The Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), part of India’s growing technological capabilities, is paving the way for future missions such as Gaganyaan, Chandrayaan-4, and the Bharatiya Antariksh Station—India’s forthcoming international space station.
India’s rise in the space sector is underscored by its increasing role in satellite launches. Over the past decade, the country has launched 433 foreign satellites, earning substantial revenues—$157 million and €260 million—from 2014 to 2023. The success of Chandrayaan-3, which made India the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole, has propelled India to the forefront of lunar exploration. The global scientific community, including NASA, is now keenly awaiting India’s findings from the Moon’s southern pole.
India’s achievements in biotechnology and bioeconomy are equally impressive. The nation became the first to develop a DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, cementing its leadership in vaccine research. Additionally, India introduced the world’s first herpesvirus vaccine for cervical cancer, further establishing itself as a global leader in preventive healthcare.
The bioeconomy has also flourished, growing from $10 billion in 2014 to nearly $140 billion today. Projections suggest it will reach $250 billion in the coming years, fueled by a surge in biotech startups—almost 9,000 today compared to just 50 in 2014. India is also gaining ground in bio-manufacturing, ranking third in the Asia-Pacific region and 12th globally, with its influence rapidly expanding.
India is also pioneering space biology, with significant investments in research focused on sustaining life beyond Earth. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology have signed an MoU to advance space biotechnology, focusing on growing plants in space to support long-term space missions. Research in space medicine and human physiology in extraterrestrial environments is expected to be crucial as humanity looks to expand its presence beyond Earth.
In nuclear energy, India has set an ambitious goal of generating 100 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2047. This effort will contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions by 50%, positioning India as a leader in sustainable energy development. India’s nuclear policy, originally envisioned by Homi Bhabha for peaceful purposes, is now viewed as a model of responsible energy development worldwide.
India’s standing in scientific research has gained global recognition. The country is now ranked fourth worldwide in scientific publications, and projections suggest it could surpass the United States to become the leading nation in scientific research by 2030. This growing dominance is also reflected in India’s space economy, which is expected to grow five to ten times in the next decade, further solidifying its leadership in science and bio-manufacturing.
Dr. Singh emphasized that India’s rise is no longer about catching up but about setting the global agenda.

Title: Chandrababu Naidu thanks PM Modi, HM Shah for Rs 608 crore flood relief to Andhra
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:13:41 +0000
Content: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for sanctioning Rs 608.08 crore for the state under disaster and flood relief.
Naidu, whose Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is a key partner in BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, took to X to thank the Prime Minister and Home Minister on behalf of the people of Andhra Pradesh.
Out of the Rs 1554.99 crore allocated to all states under disaster and flood relief, Andhra Pradesh has got Rs 608.08 crore.
The High-Level Committee (HLC), under the chairmanship of the Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah, approved Rs 1554.99 crore of additional Central assistance under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to five states, affected by flood, flash flood, landslides, cyclonic storm during last year.
The HLC approved central assistance of Rs 1554.99 crore to five states from NDRF, subject to an adjustment of 50 per cent of the opening balance for the year available in the SDRF. Out of the total amount of Rs 1554.99 crore, Rs 608.08 crore has been approved for Andhra Pradesh, Rs 170.99 crore for Nagaland, Rs 255.24 crore for Odisha, Rs 231.75 crore for Telangana and Rs 288.93 crore for Tripura.
According to an official release, this additional assistance is over and above the funds released by the Centre to the states in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at the disposal of the states.
During the financial year 2024-25, the Central Government released Rs 18,322.80 crore to 27 states from SDRF, Rs 4,808.30 crore from NDRF to 18 states, Rs 2208.55 crore from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) to 14 states and Rs 719.72 crore from National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) to eight states.
The Central Government had deputed Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to these states, immediately after the calamities.

Title: After decades in exile, Syria’s Jews visit Damascus
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:06:37 +0000
Content: For the first time in three decades, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll in a synagogue in the heart of Syria’s capital Damascus, carefully passing their thumbs over the handwritten text as if still in awe they were back home.
The father and son fled Syria in the 1990s, after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country’s historic Jewish community, which had faced decades of restrictions including on owning property or holding jobs.
Virtually all of the few thousand Jews in Syria promptly left, leaving less than 10 in the Syrian capital. Joseph and Henry – just a child at the time – settled in New York.
“Weren’t we in a prison? So we wanted to see what was on the outside,” said Joseph, now 77, on his reasons for leaving at the time. “Everyone else who left with us is dead.”
But when Assad’s son and successor as president Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December, the Hamra family began planning a once-unimaginable visit to Damascus with the help of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group.
They met with Syria’s deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now managed by caretaker authorities installed by the Islamist rebels who ousted Assad after more than 50 years of family rule that saw itself as a bastion of secular Arab nationalism.
The new authorities have said all of Syria’s communities will play a role in their country’s future. But incidents of religious intolerance and reports of conservative Islamists proselytizing in public have kept more secular-minded Syrians and members of minority communities on edge.
Henry Hamra, now aged 48, said Syria’s foreign ministry had now pledged to protect Jewish heritage.
“We need the government’s help, we need the government’s security and it’s going to happen,” he said.
Walking through the narrow passages of the Old City, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site, Henry and Joseph ran into their onetime neighbours – Palestinian Syrians – and later marveled at hand-painted Hebrew lettering at several synagogues.
“I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,” said Henry.
But some things were missing, he said, including a golden-lettered Torah from one of the synagogues that was now stored in a library in Israel, to where thousands of Syrian Jews fled throughout the 20th century.
While the synagogues and Jewish school in the Old City remained relatively well-preserved, Syria’s largest synagogue in Jobar, an eastern suburb of Damascus, was reduced to rubble during the nearly 14-year civil war that erupted after Assad’s violent suppression of protests against him.
Jobar was home to a large Jewish community for hundreds of years until the 1800s and the synagogue, built in honour of the biblical prophet Elijah, was looted before it was destroyed.

Title: Always exciting to hear PM Modi’s vision for India, says Rishi Sunak
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:22:34 +0000
Content: Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “friend”, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday said that it is “always exciting” to hear PM Modi’s vision for India.
Sunak and his family met the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday evening, having detailed conversation on many subjects.
PM Modi said that Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.
Taking to X, Prime Minister Modi wrote, “It was a delight to meet former UK PM, Mr. Rishi Sunak and his family! We had a wonderful conversation on many subjects. Mr. Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.”
The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom replied to the PM’s post on Wednesday, highlighting his strong friendship with the Indian leader and PM Modi’s constant support for strengthening India-UK relations.
“Wonderful to catch up with my friend Narendra Modi. Thank you for so warmly welcoming my family, too! Always exciting to hear your vision for India, and so important the UK-India relationship goes from strength to strength,” Sunak posted on X.
Born to Indian parents in Southampton with roots in Punjab, Sunak is the first Indian-origin person to have served as the UK Prime Minister from 2022 to 2024.
Always proud of his Indian roots, Sunak batted for having close ties with India in economic, security and scientific spheres as both nations collaborated in areas like finance, technology, healthcare, and education besides establishing the FinTech Bridge connecting London and Mumbai.
As the Conservative Party leader conceded defeat in the UK general election in July 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Rishi Sunak’s contribution to consolidate ties between the two nations during his tenure as the UK Prime Minister.
“Thank you Rishi Sunak for your admirable leadership of the UK, and your active contribution to deepen the ties between India and the UK during your term in office. Best wishes to you and your family for the future,” PM Modi posted on X on July 5, 2024.
Sunak had also congratulated PM Modi on the BJP-led NDA’s third straight election victory last year, insisting that the UK and India share the closest of friendships which would continue to thrive.
In May 2024, as the UK Prime Minister, he hailed India’s rise as an ‘economic superpower’, asserting that new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:19:32 +0000
Content: Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL), one of India’s premier defense shipbuilding yards, is showcasing its indigenously designed Fast Patrol Vessels (FPVs) and Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) at NAVDEX 2025 in Abu Dhabi. These vessels highlight India’s growing capabilities in naval innovation and self-reliance under the “Make in India” initiative.
The Fast Patrol Vessel(Model) on display is a 50-meter-long, high-speed craft capable of reaching 35 knots. Designed and built in-house by GSL, it is primarily intended for patrolling, anti-smuggling, and anti-terrorist operations. Additionally, it can serve as a coastal convoy escort and a communication link during wartime. The vessel is powered by three 2,720 kW diesel engines driving independent waterjets, offering high maneuverability and efficiency. With fully air-conditioned accommodations for 35 personnel, it is designed to withstand challenging sea conditions and sustain operations for extended durations without external support.
GSL has successfully delivered seven FPVs to the Indian Coast Guard, which have proven their capabilities in national emergencies, including disaster response during tsunamis. Additionally, two FPVs have been exported to Mauritius, reinforcing GSL’s footprint in the global defense sector.
The Offshore Patrol Vessel, another key exhibit at NAVDEX 2025, is renowned for its high stability, operational versatility, and adaptability to diverse missions, including combat operations, law enforcement, anti-piracy patrols, search-and-rescue missions, and environmental disaster response. Built with a robust steel hull, the OPV is engineered to endure heavy sea conditions while ensuring optimal performance in multi-role operations.

Title: Rekha Gupta sworn in as Delhi Chief Minister; Becomes 4th Woman CM of national capital
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 07:12:30 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rekha Gupta on Thursday was sworn-in as Delhi Chief Minister in a grand ceremony at Ramlila Maidan.
Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena administered the oath of office to Rekha Gupta and her council of ministers in the ceremony.
Six other ministers, including Parvesh Sahib Singh, Ashish Sood, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Ravinder Indraj Singh, Kapil Mishra, and Pankaj Kumar Singh, also took the oath.
Bharatiya Janata Party’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Minister JP Nadda, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, were present on the occasion.

Multiple party leaders, including union ministers and CMs of neighbouring states, were present to attend the ceremony.
Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, Bihar Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha, Rajasthan Deputy CM Prem Chand Bairwa, Goa CM Pramod Sawant, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and other leaders were also present at the spot.
Having risen from the ranks and served Delhi in different organisational capacities and as a councillor, Rekha Gupta is familiar with the issues and problems of the national capital.
With the BJP’s election manifesto containing a slew of promises, she is expected to hit the ground running and adopt a hands-on approach.
She will be the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi. The national capital has had women Chief Ministers from the BJP, Congress, and Aam Aadmi Party.
An elected MLA from Shalimar Bagh seat, Rekha Gupta has served as general secretary of BJP Mahila Morcha in Delhi and as a member of its national executive committee. In these roles, she initiated numerous campaigns for the welfare of marginalized communities and women.
Rekha Gupta started her political journey with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a student body affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Having studied at Delhi University’s Daulat Ram College, she became the President of the Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) in 1996-97 and actively raised student issues. As a councillor from North Pitampura in 2007, she worked on developing basic facilities in the area, such as libraries and parks. She has also pursued an LLB and is the founder of the AAS, a NGO. She lost the mayoral election to AAP’s Shelly Oberoi in 2023.
A first-time MLA, Rekha Gupta, 50, was preferred over more senior leaders in Delhi BJP apparently because the the party wanted a woman leader to assume the post. She is known to keep a low profile compared to some other leaders in Delhi BJP. Her name as next Delhi CM was announced after days of intense speculation about the possible choice. The results of Delhi assembly polls were declared on February 8.
With BJP stressing on women empowerment, Rekha Gupta’s elevation will help the party emphasise its credentials among women. She will be the only woman among the present BJP Chief Ministers.
After her election as leader of BJP legislature party, Rekha Gupta expressed her gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party leadership and people of Delhi for the responsibility bestowed on her and said every moment of her life will spent in fulfilling it.
Rekha Gupta said that it is a “miracle” and a “new chapter” marking the beginning of a transformative chapter for women in politics.
Speaking to the media, Gupta vowed to hold corrupt individuals accountable, asserting that they will have to answer for every rupee misused.
“It is a miracle, it is a new motivation and a new chapter. If I can be the CM, this means ways are open for all the women… Anyone who has been corrupt will have to give an account of each and every rupee,” she said.
Further, she expressed gratitude to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s high command for trusting her to govern the national capital.
“It is a huge responsibility. I thank PM Modi and BJP high command for having faith in me… I will fulfil my responsibility with utmost honesty… My first priority is to complete all the commitments our party has made, and the second priority is that all our 48 MLAs will work as a team Modi. I never thought I would be a CM of Delhi,” Rekha Gupta said.
Rekha Gupta on Wednesday was elected as leader of BJP legislative party in a meeting of newly-elected MLAs.
The BJP won 48 seats in a historic mandate, ousting the Aam Aadmi Party from power.

Title: World Day of Social Justice – Rs. 13,611 crore allocated to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 07:03:43 +0000
Content: The World Day of Social Justice is observed on February 20 by the United Nations to promote efforts in addressing poverty, exclusion, and unemployment while fostering solidarity and equality of opportunity across societies. This year’s theme emphasises the role of governments and global institutions in tackling social injustice and promoting fairness.
India’s role in Social Justice initiatives
Aligned with the global mission of the World Day of Social Justice, India’s Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) has been working on bridging socio-economic disparities through legislative reforms, grassroots initiatives, and international collaborations. Over the years, India has strengthened its commitment to empowering marginalized communities and upholding justice for all citizens.
Since its inception in 2009, the World Day of Social Justice has served as a global reminder of the interconnection between social justice and peace. With rising economic inequalities and challenges in global security, the importance of social justice initiatives becomes ever more critical. This is further supported by the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) efforts, which promote social justice through their Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization.
Key Social Justice Programs in India
India’s journey toward achieving social justice is deeply rooted in its constitutional mandates, which lay a strong foundation for ensuring equality, dignity, and justice, particularly for disadvantaged communities. The MoSJE’s recent initiatives, such as PM-AJAY, NAMASTE, SMILE, PM-DAKSH Yojana, and the Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan, highlight India’s focus on creating opportunities for marginalized groups through education, skills development, and economic empowerment.
The MoSJE has also prioritized the empowerment of vulnerable groups, including Scheduled Castes (SCs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Transgender Persons, and individuals engaged in begging, through a series of social protection measures and welfare programs. Additionally, the government has expanded its budget allocation, reflecting its continued focus on fostering justice and inclusion.
Initiatives for the Marginalised
Through programs such as SRESHTA (Scheme for Residential Education for Students in High Schools in Targeted Areas) and Purple Fests, the MoSJE has ensured that marginalized communities gain access to quality education and platforms for social inclusion. The NAMASTE scheme has also been crucial in providing sustainable livelihoods to sanitation workers, while SMILE continues to work towards rehabilitating transgender individuals and persons engaged in begging.
As the country observes the World Day of Social Justice, these efforts reaffirm India’s dedication to addressing socio-economic gaps and ensuring dignity, justice, and equal opportunity for all its citizens.

Title: Egypt announces first discovery of pharaoh’s tomb in more than 100 years
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 07:01:05 +0000
Content: A joint Egyptian-British mission has identified an ancient tomb near Luxor as that of King Thutmose II, marking the first discovery of a pharaonic royal tomb in more than 100 years, Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said on Tuesday.
Located west of the Valley of the Kings, Thutmose II’s tomb was the last lost tomb of the kings of Egypt’s 18th dynasty, and the first royal tomb discovered since King Tutankhamun’s in 1922, the ministry said.
Archaeologists were able to identify the tomb due to alabaster vessels found on site and inscribed with the name of King Thutmose II and his wife Queen Hatshepsut, one of a small handful of women to have ruled Egypt.
They also found pieces of his funerary furniture, as well as pieces of mortar with blue inscriptions, yellow stars and religious writing, the statement said.
However, due to flooding soon after the king’s death, the tomb was generally not well preserved, the ministry statement added. There were indications that most of its contents had been moved, and work to recover them was under way, it said.

Title: Israel prepares to receive bodies of youngest Gaza hostages
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:58:51 +0000
Content: Israel braced on Thursday for the return of the bodies of infant Kfir Bibas and his four-year-old brother Ariel, the two youngest captives taken by Hamas in their October 7, 2023 attack and among the most potent symbols of the trauma inflicted that day.
Palestinian militant groups said the bodies of the two boys and their mother Shiri Bibas, along with that of a fourth hostage, Oded Lifschitz, would be handed over on Thursday under the Gaza ceasefire agreement reached last month with the backing of the United States and the mediation of Qatar and Egypt.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a brief video statement that Thursday would be “a very difficult day for the state of Israel. An upsetting day, a day of grief.”
Hundreds of people gathered in the winter cold ahead of the handover. Armed Hamas militants in black and camouflage uniforms toured the area.
Kfir Bibas was nine months old when the Bibas family, including their father Yarden, was abducted at Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of a string of communities near Gaza that was overrun by Hamas-led attackers from Gaza on October 7.
Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother had been killed in an Israeli airstrike but their deaths were never confirmed by Israeli authorities and even at the last minute, some refused to accept they were dead.
“Shiri and the kids became a symbol,” said Yiftach Cohen, a resident of Nir Oz, which lost around a quarter of its inhabitants, either killed or kidnapped, during the Oct. 7 assault. “I still hope that they will be alive.”
Yarden Bibas was returned in an earlier exchange of hostages for prisoners this month. But the family said this week their “journey is not over” until they received final confirmation of what happened to the boys and their mother.
The handover will be the first return of dead bodies during the current agreement and Israel is not expected to confirm their identities until full DNA checks have been completed.
Despite accusations on both sides of ceasefire breaches, the fragile agreement that took effect on January 19 has held up since the first in a series of exchanges of hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.
Netanyahu has faced criticism from his far-right coalition allies for agreeing to the deal, which some in Israel feel rewards Hamas and leaves the militant group in place in Gaza.
But successive surveys have shown broad support among the public for the ceasefire, and thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to demand the government stick to the deal until all the remaining hostages are returned.
Israel launched its war in the Gaza Strip after the Hamas-led attack that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, with 251 kidnapped. The Israeli military campaign has killed some 48,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, and left densely populated Gaza largely in ruins.
LIVING HOSTAGES
Thursday’s handover of bodies will be followed by the return of six living hostages on Saturday, in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians, expected to be women and minors detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war.
Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in the first phase of an agreement intended to open the way towards ending the war in Gaza.
So far 19 Israeli hostages have been released, as well as five Thais who were returned in an unscheduled handover.
Negotiations for a second phase, expected to cover the return of around 60 remaining hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive, and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip to allow an end to the war, are expected to begin in the coming days.
Prospects for an agreement remain uncertain, however, with both sides far apart on issues including the future governance of Gaza, which Israel has said cannot be run by either Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.
The issue has also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza, a move critics say would amount to a war crime and ethnic cleansing, and for the enclave to be developed as a waterfront property under U.S. control.

Title: IN-SPACe unveils Rs 500 crore technology adoption fund to boost India’s space startups and innovation
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:48:29 +0000
Content: The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe), an arm of the Department of Space (DoS), has launched a new fund with a corpus of Rs 500 crore to support the growth of India’s space startups.
The Technology Adoption Fund (TAF) aims to accelerate the development of indigenous space technology, reducing reliance on imported solutions. It will invest in domestic research and development and strengthen collaboration between government agencies and the private sector, positioning India as a key global player in the space industry.
“The fund will offer financial support of up to 60 per cent of the project cost for startups and MSMEs, and 40 per cent for larger industries, with a maximum funding cap of Rs 25 Crores per project,” said Dr Pawan Goenka, Chairman, IN-SPACe.
Goenka said the fund is designed to enable “innovators to bridge the gap between early-stage development and commercialisation”.
“This support will enable companies to refine their technologies, enhance production processes, and meet market demands both within India and abroad. Our focus is on enabling practical solutions that can be quickly integrated into the space ecosystem,” he added.
The fund will also support the transition of early-stage space technologies developed by Indian companies into commercially viable products. With TAF, IN-SPACe aims to support a wide range of outcomes — from the development of new space products to the creation of intellectual property that can drive future research and development.
The fund will help promote advanced space technologies and contribute to job creation along with economic growth.
By funding projects that have the potential to become commercial successes, IN-SPACe is taking concrete steps toward strengthening India’s position in the global space sector. The TAF is also open to all eligible Non-Government Entities (NGEs)/companies that are ready to demonstrate the commercial potential of their innovations.
The fund will also provide partial funding to NGEs. In addition to financial support, the initiative will provide technical guidance and mentoring opportunities, which will help companies navigate challenges during the product development phase.
This comprehensive support framework is intended to ensure that innovative ideas are not only protected and refined but also brought to market efficiently.
“The launch of this forward-looking fund by IN-SPACe is a major step toward enabling start-ups to accelerate their journey from concept to commercialisation,” said Lt. Gen. AK Bhatt (retd.), Director General, Indian Space Association (ISpA), while welcoming the initiative.
He said that India is “witnessing a surge of pioneering startups developing groundbreaking solutions for the space industry”.

Title: South Korea’s Yoon attends his first criminal trial hearing
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:36:03 +0000
Content: South Korea’s impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared at a Seoul court on Thursday for the first hearing of his criminal trial over insurrection charges, during which his lawyers demanded his release from jail.
TV footage aired by local broadcasters showed justice ministry vehicles leaving the Seoul Detention Centre where Yoon is being held before arriving at the court where lines of police buses were parked outside to ensure security.
The court heard a bid by Yoon’s lawyers to cancel his detention as they argued that the insurrection probe had been conducted in an illegal manner, and that there was no risk of Yoon trying to destroy evidence.
Prosecutors last month indicted Yoon after accusing him of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3.
The charges are unprecedented for a sitting South Korean president, and if convicted, Yoon could face years in prison for his martial law decree, which shocked the country and sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media.
His move set off a wave of political upheaval in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a top U.S. ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection.
Prosecutors on Thursday called for quick proceedings considering the case’s “gravity”, but Yoon’s lawyers said they needed more time to review records.
Yoon had “no intention to paralyse the country,” one of his lawyers told the court, adding that his martial law declaration was to inform the public of the “legislative dictatorship of the huge opposition party”.
A judge said the court would hold the next hearing on the criminal case on March 24.
Yoon is also facing a parallel impeachment trial conducted by the Constitutional Court which has entered its final phase.
The top court will hear witnesses testify, including Prime Minister Han Duck-soo later on Thursday. Yoon will also attend the impeachment trial hearing, according to media reports.
The Constitutional Court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him.
Yoon and his lawyers have argued that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.

Title: Rohit seeks big scores from top order, has high expectations of Gill
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:30:06 +0000
Content: India’s top order batters must kick on and get big scores if the team are to post competitive totals in the Champions Trophy, captain Rohit Sharma said on Wednesday ahead of their tournament opener against Bangladesh.
Having failed to win the one-day international World Cup on home soil in 2023, India are aiming to win a 50-over title for the first time since their last Champions Trophy triumph in 2013. They finished runners-up in the last edition in 2017.
India are coming off a resounding 3-0 ODI series sweep of England, where they scored 356 in the only game they batted first and Rohit said they would need more of the same to succeed in the longer version of the limited overs format.
Apart from Rohit and his opening partner Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer had decent starts against England but could not convert them into big scores.
“Your top three, four or five batsmen need to get that big score for you to post a big score eventually. I think our top four batters are quite experienced,” Rohit told reporters ahead of Thursday’s match in Dubai.
“We know that once they are set, once they are in, they like to get those big runs. They do understand that and everyone understands that between your top four, one has to get that big score.”
Rohit also hoped his opening partner and vice-captain Gill has a “great tournament” after being awarded the player of the series against England for his tally of 259 runs, which included a century and two fifties.
Gill had come in for criticism after he managed to score only 93 runs in five innings in the test series loss in Australia but Rohit said the 25-year-old must not be judged by his batting performances against the red ball.
“Gill is a very, very classy player. There was never a doubt about his ability in this squad. I think we tend to mix formats and I don’t think that’s the right way to judge any player,” Rohit said.
“Certain players have their strength in certain formats and if one format doesn’t go well, it doesn’t mean that (their performances in) the other format will be the same. It’s there for all of us to see what happened in Australia.
“Things have changed, certainly in a different format. So, with Gill, we know the numbers are crazy. He’s been superb for us in the last three, four years and there is a reason he’s been elevated to vice-captain of the team as well.”
The tournament is being hosted by Pakistan but India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
India will also play Pakistan (Sunday) and New Zealand (March 2) in their group, with the top two sides moving to the semi-finals.

Title: President Murmu extends greetings on statehood day of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:13:01 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday extended greetings on the occasion of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram’s statehood day.
In a post on X, she praised both states for their “extraordinary natural heritage and cultural traditions.”
“Blessed by Mother Nature and having rich cultural heritage, both states represent India at its best. I am sure that the people of both the States will preserve their extraordinary natural heritage and cultural traditions. I wish the wonderful people of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram script new chapters of progress and excellence,” President Murmu said.
Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu echoed similar sentiments, celebrating the state as the “land of the rising sun” and an emblem of pride and progress. Reflecting on Arunachal Pradesh’s journey since its statehood in 1987, he honored the resilience and unity of its people.
“From the snow-capped peaks of Tawang to the lush valleys of Ziro, our state is not just a place on the map but a home to resilient hearts, rich cultural heritage, traditions and boundless dreams,” Khandu said.
“Today, as we celebrate Statehood Day, let us celebrate our past, cherish our present & march forward into a brighter future where our youth shine, our heritage thrives, and our state flourishes,” he added.
Union Ministers JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju also marked the occasion, lauding the states’ development and cultural vibrancy.
“With its mesmerizing natural beauty, Arunachal Pradesh, the land of the rising sun, exemplifies a perfect fusion of modernity and ancient tribal traditions. Under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi Ji and the leadership of CM Pema Khandu Ji, the state is witnessing continuous development,” Nadda said on X.
Rijiju reflected on its evolution from the North Eastern Frontier Agency to a full-fledged state.
“Warmest greetings to all my beloved sisters & brothers of Arunachal Pradesh on Statehood Day! A proud occasion to commemorate the historic journey from NEFA to becoming a Union Territory on 20 January 1972 & achieving full statehood on 20 February 1987. A momentous chapter in our history that continues to inspire progress & unity. Wishing Arunachal Pradesh continued growth, prosperity & success,” Rijiju said.
Mizoram, which became the 23rd state of India on February 20, 1987, was also celebrated for its rich traditions and growth since gaining statehood.

Title: FIH Men’s Hockey Pro League: Gurjant Singh’s lone goal helps India beat Germany in tightly-contested affair
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:42:54 +0000
Content: India won their second match in the FIH Hockey Pro League 2024-25 (Men) season on Wednesday after beating World Champions Germany 1-0 at the Kalinga Hockey Stadium in Bhubaneswar.
Gurjant Singh scored the only goal of the match as India climbed to seventh in the standings.
It was a good response from India after they had succumbed to a 4-1 loss to Germany on Tuesday. The Indian defence, marshalled by Captain Harmanpreet Singh, put in a solid display to secure an important win.
After a bright start, India took the lead four minutes into the match as Gurjant Singh scored in back-to-back matches.
Rajinder Singh sent the ball into the circle hoping for Mandeep Singh to put it into goal. Mandeep’s effort was saved by Alexander Stadler but the German goalkeeper did not clear the loose ball away. An unmarked Gurjant dove in to sweep the ball into the empty goal.
India deployed a half-court press as they looked to protect their lead and pounce on any German mistakes. Germany nearly got the equaliser as Thies Prinz showcased his incredible 3D skills to beat his markers. Krishan Bahadur Pathak stood tall and swatted away Prinz’s attempt before Florian Sperling scooped the loose ball over the goal.
Germany won the first penalty corner of the match with 46 seconds left in the quarter but Gonzalo Peillat’s drag-flick flew wide of the goal as the first quarter ended 1-0 in India’s favour.
India resorted to sitting deeper in their half and forcing the Germans to try and find ways to penetrate the circle. Suraj Karkera, who replaced Pathak in the Indian goal in the second quarter, was rarely called into action.
It was India who had the better chances from counter attacks as Shilanand Lakra, Nilam Sanjeep Xess and Raj Kumar Pal tested Stadler. India won three penalty corners in the final minute but the German defence made sure they went into the break trailing only by the solitary goal.
Germany began the third quarter with more urgency and it needed an instinctive save from Pathak to deny Prinz a goal in the 32nd minute. Pathak was called into action a couple of minutes later as he denied Peillat a penalty corner with a superb save with his foot.
India had a big chance to double their advantage towards the end of a cagey third quarter. However, Stadler pulled off an incredible double save to deny Sukhjeet Singh and Vivek Sagar Prasad.
The Indian defence was tested early in the fourth quarter as Germany won a penalty corner in the 46th minute. Karkera did well to save Peillat’s drag-flick. India won a penalty corner two minutes later but Amit Rohidas sent his drag-flick wide.
With time against them, Germany upped the ante in the final five minutes. The World Champions won a penalty corner with four minutes to go but captain Harmanpreet successfully used India’s review to reverse the decision.
Germany took off Stadler soon after for an additional outfield player as they hunted for a late equaliser. The Germans won four penalty corners in a row only to be thwarted by a resolute Indian defence led by Karkera.
India held their nerves to keep Germany at bay and win their second match of the season.

Title: Trump says he will announce a range of tariffs over ‘next month or sooner’
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:41:13 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he will announce tariffs related to lumber, cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals “over the next month or sooner.”
“I’m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber, probably and some other things over the next month or sooner,” Trump said at a conference in Miami.
He did not provide further details.
Since returning to office on January 20, Trump has initiated numerous tariffs and made even more frequent threats to impose levies on imported goods.
They range from broad ones – a universal tariff on foreign-imported goods – to ones aimed at specific sectors, regions, or countries in an effort to get others to meet his policy demands.
Trump’s threats have changed over time, leaving other nations and businesses unclear of what is to come next. Some economists and experts have warned Trump’s sweeping tariffs will stoke inflation.

Title: Questioning the Election Matrix of the CEC and Election Commissioners
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:18:11 +0000
Content: “It is no use blaming the looking glass if your face is awry.” – Nikolai Gogol
The Election Commission of India is the apex constitutional body for conducting elections for the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, President, Vice President, and state legislature. Its head, the Election Commissioner, is appointed through a select committee, including the PM, the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha, and a Union Minister nominated by the PM. The role of the committee is to ensure transparency in the appointment process, but when the office of the Election Commission is under question, it raises serious concerns. The opposition has every right to interfere in the political arena, as the guardian of a healthy democratic process. In fact, Ivor Jennings has said, “The Leader of the Opposition is the alternate PM.”
But the consistent accusation of INC over the bureaucratic selection of the Election Commissioner has proved to be vanum opus, as Congress was in the same shoes in which today it is trying to point out nails.
Congress, from time to time, has tried to control the apex functionary of elections in India and has been seen giving them political favors in order to reward loyalists for toeing the line and using former Election Commissioners for its political gain.
Former CEC | Tenure | Post-Retirement Favors

KVK Sundaram (1958-67) – Chairman of the Law Commission and Padma Vibhushan
Nagendra Singh (1972-73) – Padma Vibhushan
RK Trivedi (1982-85) – Governor, Padma Vibhushan
VS Ramadevi (1990) – Governor
TN Seshan (1990-96) – Contested election from Congress in 1996
MS Gill (1996-2001) – Rajya Sabha member (2004-2016), Minister of Youth Affairs (2009-11), Minister of SPI (2011)
MS Lyngdoh (2001-2004) – Joined Congress
N Gopalaswami (2006-2009) – Padma Vibhushan

Congress is hypocritical on the appointment of the CEC, as Gyanesh Kumar officially assumed charge as India’s new CEC, but Congress raises concerns over his appointment, alleging why the CJI was not included in the appointment panel of the CEC, even though the ruling of the SC in 2023 said that “the selection panel would jointly appoint EC until Parliament formulates a law on the same.”
After passing the bill, it is clear that the SC never said the CJI should be part of the select committee, so why is the opposition crying? Now, the question is, how was the CEC appointed during the Congress regime? Were appointments done by neutral bodies? Rahul Gandhi chooses drama over integrity, ignoring his own party’s past of creating loyalists out of Election Commissioners.
They thought that the BJP would adopt a similar political tactic. As Edward Howe said, “A thief believes everyone steals.” But Congress forgets that for greater and more popular success, such a short-sighted tactic will not be helpful and is just another way to ignore its own accountability and question institutional transparency.
We should not throw stones at others’ houses if ours is made of glass. Historically, Congress has paid favors to most of the Election Commissioners in its tenure, undermining the transparent democratic process. The position of the Election Commissioner should not be politicized by any political party, as politicization can hinder institutional legitimacy.
The questioning of the CEC is one side of the coin, but on the other side, there can be a negative ripple effect of this baseless accusation turned political stunt, showing the acute dissatisfaction of the opposition and causing ire for the election machinery.
Now, why can questioning the recruitment process turn dangerous for the opposition?

Declining credibility – The opposition itself does not have a credible political performance but questions the institution and the process.
Consistent incompetency – The opposition adapting the new tactics of defaming electoral institutions shows how weak it has become, resorting to blame games and double standards to prove its point.
Trust deficit – The INC represents a wide section of the Indian population, but it feeds distrust in them by questioning the recruitment process. This affects voter turnout and decreases the will to vote. In a country where political literacy is still largely absent in Tier 2 and 3 cities, Congress can fall prey to its own political tactic.
Political inaccuracy – The whole recruitment issue highlights the political inaccuracy of Congress itself because, in the appointment of any Election Commissioner, the select committee is considered for an opinion, which itself includes the Leader of the Opposition. Then how could Congress not point out the discrepancies in the appointment pre-elections but blame the whole process after, claiming the recruitment is faulty?

In contrast, the Modi government has included the LOP in the selection as per convention and has not created loyalists out of Election Commissioners, as Congress did during its political regime. The BJP has not made any retired CEC a governor or given them accolades like the Padma Bhushan.
Congress has reentered a time where it highly needs to assess its stance on Indian institutions, their legitimacy, and accept its shortcomings rather than going berserk about the ruling party, accusing it of full-fledged electoral discrepancy. As a Chinese proverb says: “The man who blames others has a long way in his journey to go. The man who blames himself is halfway there. And the man who blames no one has halfway arrived.”
Although not blaming at all is counterproductive to the existence of the opposition, Congress definitely needs to be the man who blames himself for his failures. Every time someone says that they failed because of someone else, there is a very high chance that they are avoiding some truth about themselves.
The politics of the blame game done by Congress is an escape from constant complexity to the world of entertainment because running a nation and making better lives for people often requires constant effort. Things only get better when you solve hard problems, and avoiding them will only take you down the path of obstinacy.
The only time a politician will try to avoid the blame game is when they are the target. Hence, no such questions on the selection process were entertained during Congress rule at the center. The same Congress that disregarded norms is now blaming the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance for the selection of the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners. The people are not amused, and they know the truth.

Title: India becomes second country to introduce digital pilot licenses
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:21:06 +0000
Content: India has taken a significant leap in modernizing its civil aviation sector with the launch of the Electronic Personnel License (EPL) for pilots. Union Minister for Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu introduced the initiative, making India the second country in the world to implement digital pilot licenses, following approval from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
Replacing traditional physical licenses, the EPL will now be available in a digital format, accessible through the eGCA Mobile Application. This transition is expected to streamline the licensing process while enhancing security and transparency. The initiative aligns with the Government of India’s vision for “Ease of Doing Business” and “Digital India”, ensuring a seamless experience for aviation professionals.
The adoption of EPL follows ICAO’s Amendment 178 to Annex 1 – Personnel Licensing, which encourages electronic licensing for improved efficiency and security. While leading aviation nations are still in the process of implementing similar systems, India has swiftly taken the lead in this transformation, setting a global benchmark.
For years, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued pilot licenses in smart card format, with over 62,000 such licenses already distributed. In 2024 alone, nearly 20,000 pilots required printed card licenses, averaging 1,667 cards per month. With the introduction of EPL, the reliance on physical licenses will be gradually phased out, reducing delays and cutting down on plastic and paper usage, contributing to environmental sustainability.
Emphasizing the growing demand for aviation professionals, Minister Ram Mohan Naidu highlighted that India’s rapidly expanding civil aviation sector would require approximately 20,000 new pilots in the near future. He said that pilots are the backbone of the industry, and digital initiatives such as eGCA and EPL will enhance their global employability while ensuring real-time access to their credentials for security operations.
The launch of EPL is part of a broader push towards digital transformation in Indian aviation. The government has already introduced several groundbreaking initiatives, including the eGCA platform for licensing, the Digital Sky Platform for drones, and the Electronic Flight Folder (EFF) for airline operations. These efforts collectively aim to modernize the aviation sector and position India as a leader in digital aviation solutions.

Title: Trump FBI pick Patel faces Senate vote amid Justice Department tumult
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:47:52 +0000
Content: The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate is set to confirm Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, on Thursday, which would put a Trump loyalist atop the nation’s most prominent law enforcement agency at a time of growing upheaval.
Patel would take charge as Trump-backed officials seek to put their stamp on the FBI and its parent agency, the Justice Department, challenging decades-old traditions of independence and reorienting its mission toward Trump’s core priorities.
At least 75 career Justice Department lawyers and FBI officials, who normally keep their roles from administration to administration, have either resigned, been fired or stripped of their posts in the first month of the Trump administration.
Justice Department leadership has ordered broad policy changes, demanded loyalty to Trump’s agenda and sought to drop a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who courted Trump, citing his cooperation on immigration enforcement.
“Donald Trump himself and those around him have been very clear that they do believe that the president should affect prosecutorial decisions and prosecutorial outcomes,” said Noah Bookbinder, a former federal prosecutor and head of the ethics group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “They were offended by the efforts to prosecute Donald Trump and those close to him, and they see it as part of their mission to exact vengeance.”
Trump-appointed officials have said many early moves are aimed at pursuing the administration’s policy goals and ending what they have described as abuses against Trump and his supporters.
Trump and his allies planned during his campaign to install loyalists in the department and weaken the autonomy of a career workforce that they have long viewed with suspicion. Trump has been ensnared in Justice Department investigations dating back to his first campaign in 2016 and faced two federal criminal cases during his years out of power which were dropped after he won the election before reaching trials.
“This DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts,” a senior official, Chad Mizelle, said in a statement last week. Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Prosecutors working on Trump cases repeatedly denied any political influence over those prosecutions.
TRADITION OF INDEPENDENCE
The Trump administration’s efforts have collided with a deeply ingrained tradition of independence in federal criminal investigations, dating back to reforms that followed the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974.
The move by the acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, to drop the Adams case caused particular tumult. The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where the case was brought, and at least seven other prosecutors in New York and Washington resigned in protest, with some accusing the Trump administration of improper motives.
A top Justice Department official accused the prosecutors of having disordered priorities.
Trump-appointed officials also fired more than a dozen lawyers who were involved in the two criminal cases against Trump and about 18 prosecutors who handled cases arising from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.
The FBI faced internal strife even before Patel’s arrival. Bove demanded a list from the bureau of all employees who worked on the sprawling investigation into the attack on the Capitol for an internal review.
Its acting director, Brian Driscoll, a career FBI agent, initially resisted and law enforcement groups condemned what they viewed as an unfair attack on career agents who worked on investigations assigned to them. Two groups of FBI agents sued over fears agent names would be publicly released.
The Trump administration has said agents who only followed orders would not be disciplined and has committed, for now, not to identify FBI agents who worked on the January 6 probe.
PATEL’S AGENDA
Patel has vowed that politics will play no role in his leadership of the FBI, but his closeness to Trump has prompted concerns from Democrats and many legal experts.
The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, last week accused Patel of orchestrating the removal of FBI officials from the outside, citing information from whistleblowers.
Patel has said he will increase the FBI’s role in countering illegal immigration and violent crime, top Trump priorities, by “letting good cops be cops.” He has said he will scale back investigative work at the FBI’s Washington headquarters where many counterintelligence, national security and public corruption probes are housed.
Patel has been among the biggest boosters of claims that a “deep state” within the government has pursued Trump in an attempt to sink his political prospects.
“The erosion of trust is evident,” Patel wrote in a Wall Street Journal essay last month, referring to the FBI.
Patel’s nomination is itself evidence of Trump’s attempts to exert greater control over federal law enforcement. The FBI director, who serves a 10-year term, is not typically a role that turns over with the change to a new presidential administration.
Trump nominated Patel after winning the November election, effectively forcing former Director Christopher Wray, who Trump had appointed to the role in 2017, to resign. Trump fired Wray’s predecessor, James Comey.
Patel has drawn strong condemnation from Democrats who accused him during his confirmation hearing of embracing conspiracy theories and fixating on political grievances.
Republicans broadly supported Patel, calling him a reformer who has challenged institutions that have misused their authority.

Title: Kremlin, after Trump-Zelenskiy spat, says Ukraine leader says ‘inadmissible’ things
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:10:48 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made “inadmissible” remarks about other world leaders after Zelenskiy accused U.S President Donald Trump of living in a “disinformation bubble.”
Zelenskiy on Wednesday also dismissed as false a claim by the U.S. president about his popularity rating being at just 4%.
Asked about Zelenskiy’s remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday told reporters:
“The rhetoric of Zelenskiy and many representatives of the Kyiv regime leaves much to be desired. The fact that Zelenskiy’s rating is falling is an absolutely obvious trend.”
Peskov said he didn’t want to get into details on numbers though when it came to discussing Zelenskiy’s popularity which opinion polls in Ukraine show is above 50%.
“Often representatives of the Ukrainian regime, especially in recent months, allow themselves to say absolutely unacceptable things about heads of other states. Of course, for many heads of state about whom such statements are made, this is absolutely unacceptable,” said Peskov.
“We see that there are certain differences between Washington and Kyiv,” he added, accusing Ukraine of spending foreign taxpayers’ money in an uncontrolled way and balking at attempts to hold it to account for funds spent in the past.

Title: FIH Pro League: India women hope to change fortune against Germany
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:59:08 +0000
Content: The Indian women’s hockey team will be looking to turn their campaign around as they prepare to take on Germany in the FIH Pro League 2024-25. After a challenging start, India are determined to bounce back and collect crucial points to improve their position in the standings.
India began their campaign with a thrilling 3-2 win over England but fell short in the second match against the same opponents, losing 2-1 in a shootout after a 2-2 draw in regular time. In their third game, India fought hard against Spain in an entertaining contest but narrowly lost 3-4. The story repeated itself in their next match, where they were edged out 1-0 by Spain in a closely contested encounter.
Currently, Salima Tete-led India are placed eighth in the points table, with four points from as many matches. The team has shown moments of brilliance, but they will be hoping to capitalise on their opportunities and find consistency as they gear up for the German challenge.
On the other hand, Germany will also be searching for their first regular win of the tournament. Having played six matches, the Germans have lost four in regulation time and one in a shootout, while managing to secure a bonus point in a shootout victory. They are currently placed at the bottom of the standings with three points, making this a crucial matchup for both teams.
Speaking ahead of the games against Germany, India captain Salima Tete said, “We know these upcoming games are very important for us, especially after the close matches we’ve had. The team has shown a lot of heart and effort, but we need to be more clinical in key moments, especially in converting our chances. Germany are a tough team, and we expect a challenging battle, but we are determined to turn things around.”
“We have worked hard in training, focusing on our defense and penalty corner execution. Everyone is motivated and ready to give their best in these crucial games. We know what’s at stake, and as a team, we are confident that we can rise to the challenge and deliver a strong performance,” she added.
India will take on Germany on February 21 and 22.

Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar engaged in key diplomatic discussions with his counterparts from Singapore and Brazil on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (FMM) in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Thursday.
In a meeting with Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, the two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation and global geopolitical developments. Jaishankar later described their exchange as insightful, reaffirming India’s strong ties with Singapore.
“Always a good conversation with FM @VivianBala of Singapore, this time in Johannesburg on the sidelines of G20 FMM. Discussed the state of the world and our work in furthering bilateral ties,” Jaishankar posted on X.
He also held talks with Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, focusing on bilateral relations, global issues, and Brazil’s BRICS Presidency. The discussions underscored India’s commitment to multilateral cooperation, particularly within the G20 framework.
“Delighted to meet FM Mauro Vieira of Brazil today in Johannesburg. Discussed bilateral ties, global developments, our work in the G20 and Brazil’s BRICS Presidency,” Jaishankar wrote on X.
Jaishankar is currently on a two-day visit to South Africa at the invitation of South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ronald Lamola, to participate in the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), his presence is aimed at strengthening India’s engagement with the G20 and amplifying the voice of the Global South within the forum.
South Africa assumed the G20 Presidency on December 1, 2024, and will hold it until November 2025 under the theme “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability.” The G20, comprising 19 major economies along with the European Union and African Union, plays a pivotal role in shaping global economic and financial policies.

Content: Foreign ministers from the G20 top economies were to meet in South Africa on Thursday and Friday, amid tensions between members over the Ukraine war, trade disputes and with the top U.S. diplomat staying away owing to a feud with the hosts.
The G20 countries, which represent some 85% of global GDP and three quarters of trade, often struggle to see eye to eye, but geopolitical rifts since Russia’s 2022 Ukraine invasion have rendered it more fractious than ever.
The discord has increased since President Donald Trump took office a month ago and implemented rapid changes in Washington’s trade and foreign policies.
South Africa holds the rotating presidency of the group and for President Cyril Ramaphosa the first G20 meeting in Africa was an opportunity to get rich nations to heed poorer countries’ concerns – worsening inequality, inadequate action on climate change, and a financial system that favours investment banks over poor sovereign debtors.
But the United States won’t be attending: Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this month rejected as “very bad” the previously agreed agenda of “diversity, equity and inclusion”.
Then Trump cut U.S. aid to South Africa in an ideological dispute with the latter’s efforts to redress historic racial injustices in land ownership – and over its genocide case against U.S. ally Israel at the International Court of Justice.
The gathering takes place as Trump has upended the U.S. policy of solidarity with Ukraine as he seeks to broker peace in its war with Russia. He has blamed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the conflict, and sidelined NATO allies in ending a campaign to isolate Russia.
The U.S. absence is an opportunity for China, which has the world’s second biggest economy, to expand its influence. Such efforts by Beijing are normally focused on the Global South but China has quickly sought to capitalise on the cracks in the transatlantic alliance.
Its foreign ministry said on Monday that “healthy and stable” China-EU relations are needed now more than ever.

Title: US State Department revises China webpage to focus on trade, business curbs
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:43:46 +0000
Content: The U.S. State Department has changed references to China on its website, emphasising the trade deficit in an expanded section on economic ties, while dropping talk of working with allies and assistance to China on cultural and environmental issues.
The February 13 changes underscore the new administration’s focus on trade and other priorities after removing a phrase last week from the department’s Taiwan fact sheet about not supporting the island’s independence, which angered Beijing.
China’s economy is “one of the most restrictive investment climates in the world”, read the expanded section on economic ties that highlighted the U.S-China trade deficit and U.S. businesses’ concerns on the challenges of operating in China.
“China also engages in unfair trade practices, including using forced labor and massive state subsidies, putting American businesses at a disadvantage, and making them complicit in China’s human rights abuses,” the webpage read.
The U.S. embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Responding to a query on the changes, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry described them as “distorting facts and slandering China’s foreign policy, and hyping up so-called China-U.S. strategic competition”.
Guo Jiakun, the spokesperson, added, “China is strongly dissatisfied with this.”
The changes come after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional tariff of 10% on all imports from China, saying it failed to halt fentanyl trafficking. He plans further reciprocal tariffs on all nations that limit U.S. access to their markets.
The State Department also dropped the phrase “People’s Republic of China (PRC)” from its country fact sheet on China, opting instead for “China”.
The site also features new language on countering Chinese cyber activity against U.S. government bodies and critical infrastructure networks as well as efforts to obtain U.S. cutting-edge technology for military purposes.
It emphasises the need to rebuild the U.S. industrial base and shore up its lead in artificial intelligence.
An expanded section on China’s role in international bodies accuses the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of attempting to “manipulate and subvert” such bodies as the United Nations.
It seeks to “groom and install CCP members in leadership and other positions,” the section adds.
The site skips previous mention of “(working) closely with our allies and partners to defend our interests and values”, saying instead that Washington will “follow the principles of reciprocity and fairness” in ties with China.
It also drops a section on U.S. assistance to China that listed programmes for preserving Tibetan culture, environmental protection, human rights and combating drug trafficking.
The omissions come as Trump embarks on a massive programme to reshape the U.S. government, by attempting to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and suspending foreign assistance.
‘PRC’ AND ‘CHINA’
The Biden administration routinely referred to the country by the abbreviation “PRC” for its official name, the People’s Republic of China.
Wen-Ti Sung, fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, believes that the revised language seems to “drive a hard bargain by raising complaints on economic policy issues” but also represents U.S. softening on fundamental matters core to the Chinese ruling party’s interests, namely regime security.
China has thousands of years of history. But the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949 after Mao Zedong’s Communist forces won a bloody civil war against the Republic of China, whose government fled to the island of Taiwan.
“This shift in wording may entail that China’s current political system ought to be considered the default setting for China, rather than just a temporary phenomenon for a particular moment in time,” said Sung.
“This shift may be Washington’s signal to reassure Beijing that the U.S. does not intend to challenge the Chinese Communist Party’s rule.”
The three U.S.-China joint communiques issued between 1972 and 1982 that form the basis of diplomatic relations use both terms, “PRC” and “China”, to refer to Beijing.
The United States has acknowledged the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China, but officially takes no position on Taiwan’s sovereignty under Washington’s “One China” policy.

Title: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta chairs first Cabinet meeting, implements Ayushman Bharat scheme, moves to table 14 pending CAG reports
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:31:16 +0000
Content: Hours after taking the oath as Delhi’s Chief Minister, Rekha Gupta chaired her first cabinet meeting, announcing key decisions that set the tone for her government. Among the first orders of business was the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, with a ₹5 lakh top-up provided by the state government. Additionally, she confirmed that her government would table the 14 pending Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports in the Assembly’s first sitting, a move that the previous AAP-led government had failed to execute.
Addressing a press conference following the meeting, Gupta emphasized that these steps reflected the BJP’s commitment to fulfilling its election promises. She reiterated that her government would sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Centre to execute the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, ensuring that the state government would cover the additional financial burden. 
Alongside these major policy announcements, Gupta also allocated portfolios to her council of ministers. As Chief Minister, she has retained key departments, including General Administration, Services, Finance, Revenue, Women and Child Development, Land and Building, Information and Public Relations, Vigilance, Administrative Reforms, Planning, and all other departments not assigned to specific ministers.
BJP MLA Pravesh Verma has been entrusted with the Public Works Department (PWD), Legislative Affairs, Irrigation and Flood Control, Water, and Gurdwara Elections, while Ashish Sood will handle Home, Power, Urban Development, Education, Higher Education, and Technical Training. Manjinder Singh Sirsa has been given charge of Food and Supplies, Forest and Environment, and Industries, while Ravinder Singh (Indraj) will oversee Social Welfare, SC and ST Welfare, Cooperative, and Elections.
Kapil Mishra, a prominent BJP leader, will be responsible for Law and Justice, Labour, Employment, Art and Culture, Language, and Tourism, while Pankaj Kumar Singh will lead the Health and Family Welfare, Transport, and Information Technology departments.
In a symbolic first public appearance after the cabinet meeting, Rekha Gupta and her ministers attended the evening Aarti on the banks of the Yamuna. Addressing the gathering, she reaffirmed her government’s commitment to cleaning the river, describing it as a top priority for her administration.

Title: IRS fires 6,000 employees as Trump slashes government
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:51:58 +0000
Content: A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6% of the agency’s workforce in the midst of the critical tax-filing season.
The cuts are part of President Donald Trump’s radical downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s biggest campaign donor.
Christy Armstrong, the IRS’ director of talent acquisition, teared up as she announced the layoffs on a phone call and told workers to support each other during a difficult time, said an employee on the call.
“She was pretty emotional,” the source said.
The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. The agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, up from 80,000 when he took office.
Independent budget analysts estimate the expansion could boost government revenue and help narrow trillion-dollar budget deficits. Trump’s Republicans say the expansion would lead to more harassment of ordinary American taxpayers.
The workers being cut are in their probationary period and have fewer protections than career employees.
The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies given that it is in the middle of its busiest period, with the April 15 tax filing deadline just two months away.
The IRS expects over 140 million individual returns by that deadline.
ALL 50 STATES
The dismissals target workers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., including hundreds at large offices in Pennsylvania, New York, Utah, California and Kentucky, according to people familiar with the matter.
Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers, independent specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, the sources said.
The IRS will retain several thousand employees deemed critical for processing tax returns, including those involved in supporting and advocating for taxpayers, one source said.
The White House has not said how many of the nation’s 2.3 million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week.
The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big business and collect taxes — including those that oversee Musk’s companies SpaceX, Tesla TSLA.O and Neuralink.
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump.
Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefit programs that make up roughly one-third of that total.
Democratic critics say Trump is exceeding his constitutional authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families.
Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers that oversee the nation’s nuclear weapons have been fired and then recalled, while medicines and food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump’s freeze on foreign aid.
Contractors that do business with the government have furloughed workers as their contracts have been canceled.
Some workers were told they were fired for poor performance, despite receiving glowing reviews.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration told scientists to stop using the words “woman,” “disabled” and “elderly” in external communications, sources said. The White House said this was an error based on a misinterpretation of an order by the president.

Title: Kremlin offers Trump support in Zelenskiy spat as Putin ally says US leader is ‘200% right’
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:30:55 +0000
Content: The Kremlin offered Donald Trump support in his standoff with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accusing the Ukrainian president of making “inadmissible” remarks about world leaders as a Russian official said he was stunned by how fast the U.S stance had shifted.
Trump’s return to the presidency has begun to warm moribund U.S.-Russia ties, which fell to their lowest point since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis under Joe Biden, Trump’s predecessor, due to Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
By contrast, Kyiv’s ties with Washington, crucial to its battlefield defence against Russia, have begun to fracture under Trump with tensions around a potential U.S. deal to exploit Ukraine’s natural resources and over a U.S. decision to hold two-way talks with Russia about Ukraine without Kyiv.
Zelenskiy on Wednesday accused Trump of living in a “disinformation bubble” after Trump called him “a dictator” and dismissed as false a claim by Trump that his popularity rating was just 4%.
The Kremlin weighed in on Trump’s side on Thursday.
“The rhetoric of Zelenskiy and many representatives of the Kyiv regime leaves much to be desired. The fact that Zelenskiy’s rating is falling is an absolutely obvious trend,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Peskov said he didn’t want to get into details on numbers though when it came to discussing Zelenskiy’s popularity, which opinion polls in Ukraine show is above 50%.
‘UNACCEPTABLE’ CRITICISM
“Often representatives of the Ukrainian regime, especially in recent months, allow themselves to say absolutely unacceptable things about heads of other states,” said Peskov, without providing examples.
“We see that there are certain differences between Washington and Kyiv,” he added, accusing Ukraine of spending foreign taxpayers’ money in an uncontrolled way and balking at attempts to hold it to account for funds spent in the past.
That criticism, which Ukraine has repeatedly denied when it has come from U.S. politicians, is part of a pattern which has seen Russian politicians from President Vladimir Putin on down sometimes offering support for Trump administration talking points.
Trump’s swift move to repair ties with Moscow, his equally fast falling out with Kyiv and Vice President JD Vance’s sharp criticism of Europe at the Munich Security Conference have left traditional U.S. allies stunned and scrambling to forge a common response. Britain has said it would be willing to send troops to support Ukraine, while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez plans to visit Kyiv on Monday to show his country’s support for Zelenskiy and Ukrainian democracy.
Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said he was stunned at how quickly Trump’s stance on Ukraine had evolved.
“‘A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.’ If you’d told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud,” Medvedev wrote on X in English.
“Trump is 200 percent right,” said Medvedev.
With a possible Putin-Trump meeting on the agenda, U.S.-Russia talks on Ukraine in the pipeline, and a souring of ties between Kyiv and Washington, there are cautious hopes in Moscow that it may be possible to end the war on many of its own terms.
Zelenskiy has long been seen by the Russian leadership as a potential obstacle to getting an agreement on ending the war because he has been so vociferous in his opposition to Moscow and is seen as unbending when it comes to his terms for a potential settlement.
Putin, and now Trump, have suggested Zelenskiy must hold an election to renew his mandate given that an election due last year was not held because of martial law. Zelenskiy has said that it’s not the right moment to hold an election.
Some hardliners in Russia, like Konstantin Malofeyev, a wealthy nationalist businessman, said Zelenskiy needs to hold and lose an election before a peace deal can be struck.
“Yes, the duped voters (of Ukraine) will still elect an anti-Russian president. But it won’t be Zelenskiy,” Malofeyev said on Telegram.
“The new Ukrainian authorities will be able to do a deal.”

Title: Indonesia’s Mount Dukono erupts, triggers aviation warning and safety advisory
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:08:01 +0000
Content: Mount Dukono, located in Indonesia’s North Maluku province, erupted on Thursday, prompting the country’s Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre to issue an aviation warning.
The volcano, situated on Halmahera Island, spewed a column of ash up to 2,000 metres into the sky, with thick white-to-grey clouds drifting south of the crater.
To mitigate risks to aviation, a Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation (VONA) has been issued at the orange level, the second-highest warning, prohibiting planes from flying below 5 km around the volcano.
Aircraft should also exercise caution due to ash clouds, which can disrupt flights, Xinhua News Agency reported.
Residents, visitors, and tourists in the vicinity of Mount Dukono are advised to avoid any activities near the Malupang Warirang crater, an active crater on the volcano, within a 4 km radius.
People living around the volcano are encouraged to keep face masks readily available to protect against respiratory hazards from volcanic ash.
Mount Dukono, standing 1,087 metres above sea level, is one of Indonesia’s 127 active volcanoes.
Last month, Mount Merapi, located near the densely populated city of Yogyakarta, the capital of the Special Region of Yogyakarta Province, emitted hot lava.
The volcano erupted five times, with lava flows reaching up to 1,900 metres, prompting the country’s Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre to issue a safety warning for nearby residents.
Standing at 2,968 metres, Mount Merapi is one of Indonesia’s 127 active volcanoes.
Earlier, on October 3, 2024, Indonesia’s most active volcano, Mount Merapi, emitted 21 lava flows towards the southwest, according to the Geological Disaster Technology Research and Development Centre.

Title: India and Saudi Arabia forge New Media Partnership as Waves 2025 Summit approaches
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:59:00 +0000
Content: A high-level Indian delegation has concluded a landmark series of strategic meetings in Saudi Arabia, strengthening bilateral media partnerships and generating momentum for India’s upcoming World Audio-Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES 2025).
Led by Information and Broadcasting Secretary Sanjay Jaju and Prasar Bharati CEO Gaurav Dwivedi, the delegation met with key Saudi media leaders during the “Future of Media” Exhibition (FOMEX) in Riyadh. During their visit, the team toured exhibition booths of global media organizations including MBC Group, Ekagami, Sony, and AIBD at FOMEX, exploring potential international partnerships.
Other engagements included discussions with Jomana R. Alrashid, CEO of Saudi Research and Media Group (SRMG), and Assistant Minister of Media Abdullah bin Ahmed Al-Maghlouth, focusing on expanding bilateral media cooperation.
The delegation’s agenda featured a meeting with Mohammed bin Fahd Al-Harthi, CEO of Saudi Broadcasting Authority, exploring synergies in broadcasting technology and content exchange. Secretary Jaju also participated in a panel discussion on “Modern Digital Marketing Tools: Innovations & Growth Opportunities” at the Saudi Media Forum, highlighting India’s digital media advancements and the upcoming WAVES 2025 summit.
Productive sessions were held with Hassan Al Asmari, Vice President of the Saudi Press Agency, and Fahad Suwayan, Manager of the Saudi Film Commission, establishing frameworks for cross-border content creation and distribution.
The delegation, accompanied by Indian Ambassador Dr. Suhel Khan, engaged in substantive talks with the Saudi Ministry of Investment about media infrastructure development and technological collaboration.
The delegation included key Ministry officials, including Raman Kumar, Director of Global Outreach at PBS, and Kshitij Aggarwal, Deputy Director of Digital Media, who explored opportunities for educational content creation and professional training programs.
WAVES 2025, scheduled for May 1-4 at Mumbai’s Jio World Convention Centre, is positioned as a transformative event in India’s digital entertainment landscape.

Title: Rekha Gupta begins tenure as Delhi CM with Yamuna Aarti, Cabinet members join ceremony
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:31:02 +0000
Content: On her first day as Delhi Chief Minister, Rekha Gupta, along with her newly inducted cabinet members and Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva, attended the evening aarti at Vasudev Ghat on the banks of the Yamuna.
Gupta, a first-time MLA from Shalimar Bagh, took oath as the ninth Chief Minister of Delhi earlier in the day at a grand swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan. The event was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, top BJP leaders, and chief ministers from NDA-ruled states.
The 50-year-old leader was chosen as Delhi’s new Chief Minister during the BJP Legislature Party meeting at the party’s national headquarters on Wednesday. Alongside her, Parvesh Verma, Ashish Sood, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Kapil Mishra, Ravinder Indraj Singh, and Pankaj Singh were also sworn in as ministers by Lt. Governor VK Saxena.
Earlier in the day, visuals showed an ongoing cleaning process in the Yamuna River. The BJP, which secured a historic mandate by winning 48 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections, has prioritized the river’s cleanup. On February 16, trash skimmers, weed harvesters, and dredge utility vehicles were deployed as part of the initiative, while the evening aarti was also introduced at Vasudev Ghat.
Pollution in the Yamuna was a key electoral issue, with political parties blaming each other over encroachments, flood management, and the deteriorating water quality. The BJP has accused the AAP government of failing to fulfill its promises on cleaning the river and has pledged to make it a top priority.
Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal urged the newly elected Delhi government to table the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report and expedite the Yamuna cleanup. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured on February 8 that the report would be presented in the first session of the new assembly.

Title: Zelenskiy calls for US pragmatism after Trump calls him a ‘dictator’
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:56:21 +0000
Content: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was counting on Ukrainian and European unity and U.S. pragmatism as Kyiv faces a mounting crisis in relations with its hitherto key U.S. ally under the leadership of President Donald Trump.
In an extraordinary rift, Trump said on Wednesday that Zelenskiy was a “dictator without elections” who should act quickly or lose his country, unthinkable rhetoric from a U.S. leader for most of Russia’s three-year-old all-out war.
Trump is pushing for a quick deal to end the war in Ukraine and has alarmed Washington’s European allies by leaving them and Ukraine out of initial talks with Russia and blaming Ukraine for Russia’s 2022 invasion.
European leaders have responded by pledging to step up spending on defence and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for Ukraine, a plan the Kremlin says is a major cause for concern but which Zelenskiy has welcomed.
“We are standing strong on our own two feet. I am counting on Ukrainian unity, our courage … on the unity of Europe and the pragmatism of America,” Zelenskiy told Ukrainians in his video address late on Wednesday.
“Because America needs success just as much as we do,” he added.
The row with the U.S. coincides with a visit to Ukraine by Keith Kellogg, the U.S. envoy for Russia and Ukraine.
Zelenskiy told Ukrainians that he would be meeting Kellogg on Thursday. He said it was crucial that the meeting as well as cooperation with Washington in general was “constructive”.
Trump is seeking to reestablish ties with Russia and also invest in Ukraine’s resources of minerals critical to the energy transition, although Ukraine rejected an initial U.S. plan as it did not entail security guarantees.
The Trump administration may seek to strike a simplified minerals deal and later negotiate detailed terms, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Kellogg said as he arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday that he was there to listen. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that Trump was repeating Russian disinformation but later struck a conciliatory tone.
“Together with America and Europe, peace can be more secure and this is our goal. Success brings us together. Our unity is the strongest safeguard of our future. A future without (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, but with peace.”
European leaders have been struggling to respond to the sudden apparent about-turn in U.S. policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was among European leaders who held talks with Canada on Wednesday.
“Recent developments and this different view of things from the United States now oblige us not only to face the truth, but to move at a very high speed and implement decisions that we have been discussing for long,” he said late on Wednesday.
Russian forces have laid Ukrainian cities, towns and villages to waste and are edging forward along parts of the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line across eastern and southern Ukraine. Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and claims ownership of more.
Ukrainian officials say a ceasefire would just give Russia time to prepare for further aggression, but the head of Ukrainian military intelligence agency said on Thursday there could be a ceasefire this year, while casting doubt on its durability.
‘IMPOSSIBLE AND IMMORAL’
At the centre of Trump’s charge that Zelenskiy is a “dictator” is that Ukraine has not held elections because of martial law, which it declared when Russia unleashed its invasion on February 24, 2022.
Martial law, which provides authorities with emergency powers for the war effort, specifically prohibits holding ruary elections. Zelenskiy’s mandate would normally have ended last May, but he remains in power as no election has been held.
Trump’s comments have spurred some, though not all Ukraine’s opposition figures to speak out and rally around Zelenskiy despite seeing him as a political opponent.
Ex-prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko said Zelenskiy was Ukraine’s legitimate leader until someone else was elected, and that it was “impossible and immoral” to hold elections during the war, as the military would not be able to take part.
“Only Ukrainians have the right to decide when and under what conditions they should change their government. Today, there are no such conditions!” she wrote on Facebook.
Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the ex-army chief who is Ukraine’s ambassador to London and whose popularity make him look like a one-day presidential candidate, said ending the war with Russia, not elections, were the priority.
At an event hosted by Ukrainian media outlet NV, he said: “for now, we have one task: to stand up and preserve our state.”
“Only after that we will think about something else.”
The most prominent opposition figure who is yet to robustly push back on Trump’s latest election call is Petro Poroshenko, the former president who sees Zelenskiy as a political rival and with whom he has acrimonious relations.
Poroshenko has in the past staunchly opposed calls for wartime elections in the name of national unity, but he has remained silent this time after the government imposed sanctions on him last week, something he said was a blow to unity.
Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker for Poroshenko’s party, has been calling for a government of national unity.
She said: “the biggest responsibility today lies with the Ukrainian authorities. Zelenskiy must immediately stop putting pressure on the opposition and political repression against those he does not like.”
Serhii Prytula, who runs a major charity supporting the Ukrainian army and is seen as a possible presidential hopeful one day, advised Ukrainians on X not to read Trump’s comments before bed.
“Remember that here in Ukraine, only we – the people of Ukraine – determine who is a dictator and who is not.”

Title: Questioning the Election Matrix of the CEC and Election Commissioners
Publication Date: Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:18:11 +0000
Content: “It is no use blaming the looking glass if your face is awry.” – Nikolai Gogol
The Election Commission of India is the apex constitutional body for conducting elections for the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, President, Vice President, and state legislature. Its head, the Election Commissioner, is appointed through a select committee, including the PM, the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha, and a Union Minister nominated by the PM. The role of the committee is to ensure transparency in the appointment process, but when the office of the Election Commission is under question, it raises serious concerns. The opposition has every right to interfere in the political arena, as the guardian of a healthy democratic process. In fact, Ivor Jennings has said, “The Leader of the Opposition is the alternate PM.”
But the consistent accusation of INC over the bureaucratic selection of the Election Commissioner has proved to be vanum opus, as Congress was in the same shoes in which today it is trying to point out nails.
Congress, from time to time, has tried to control the apex functionary of elections in India and has been seen giving them political favors in order to reward loyalists for toeing the line and using former Election Commissioners for its political gain.
Former CEC | Tenure | Post-Retirement Favors

KVK Sundaram (1958-67) – Chairman of the Law Commission and Padma Vibhushan
Nagendra Singh (1972-73) – Padma Vibhushan
RK Trivedi (1982-85) – Governor, Padma Vibhushan
VS Ramadevi (1990) – Governor
TN Seshan (1990-96) – Contested election from Congress in 1996
MS Gill (1996-2001) – Rajya Sabha member (2004-2016), Minister of Youth Affairs (2009-11), Minister of SPI (2011)
MS Lyngdoh (2001-2004) – Joined Congress
N Gopalaswami (2006-2009) – Padma Vibhushan

Congress is hypocritical on the appointment of the CEC, as Gyanesh Kumar officially assumed charge as India’s new CEC, but Congress raises concerns over his appointment, alleging why the CJI was not included in the appointment panel of the CEC, even though the ruling of the SC in 2023 said that “the selection panel would jointly appoint EC until Parliament formulates a law on the same.”
After passing the bill, it is clear that the SC never said the CJI should be part of the select committee, so why is the opposition crying? Now, the question is, how was the CEC appointed during the Congress regime? Were appointments done by neutral bodies? Rahul Gandhi chooses drama over integrity, ignoring his own party’s past of creating loyalists out of Election Commissioners.
They thought that the BJP would adopt a similar political tactic. As Edward Howe said, “A thief believes everyone steals.” But Congress forgets that for greater and more popular success, such a short-sighted tactic will not be helpful and is just another way to ignore its own accountability and question institutional transparency.
We should not throw stones at others’ houses if ours is made of glass. Historically, Congress has paid favors to most of the Election Commissioners in its tenure, undermining the transparent democratic process. The position of the Election Commissioner should not be politicized by any political party, as politicization can hinder institutional legitimacy.
The questioning of the CEC is one side of the coin, but on the other side, there can be a negative ripple effect of this baseless accusation turned political stunt, showing the acute dissatisfaction of the opposition and causing ire for the election machinery.
Now, why can questioning the recruitment process turn dangerous for the opposition?

Declining credibility – The opposition itself does not have a credible political performance but questions the institution and the process.
Consistent incompetency – The opposition adapting the new tactics of defaming electoral institutions shows how weak it has become, resorting to blame games and double standards to prove its point.
Trust deficit – The INC represents a wide section of the Indian population, but it feeds distrust in them by questioning the recruitment process. This affects voter turnout and decreases the will to vote. In a country where political literacy is still largely absent in Tier 2 and 3 cities, Congress can fall prey to its own political tactic.
Political inaccuracy – The whole recruitment issue highlights the political inaccuracy of Congress itself because, in the appointment of any Election Commissioner, the select committee is considered for an opinion, which itself includes the Leader of the Opposition. Then how could Congress not point out the discrepancies in the appointment pre-elections but blame the whole process after, claiming the recruitment is faulty?

In contrast, the Modi government has included the LOP in the selection as per convention and has not created loyalists out of Election Commissioners, as Congress did during its political regime. The BJP has not made any retired CEC a governor or given them accolades like the Padma Bhushan.
Congress has reentered a time where it highly needs to assess its stance on Indian institutions, their legitimacy, and accept its shortcomings rather than going berserk about the ruling party, accusing it of full-fledged electoral discrepancy. As a Chinese proverb says: “The man who blames others has a long way in his journey to go. The man who blames himself is halfway there. And the man who blames no one has halfway arrived.”
Although not blaming at all is counterproductive to the existence of the opposition, Congress definitely needs to be the man who blames himself for his failures. Every time someone says that they failed because of someone else, there is a very high chance that they are avoiding some truth about themselves.
The politics of the blame game done by Congress is an escape from constant complexity to the world of entertainment because running a nation and making better lives for people often requires constant effort. Things only get better when you solve hard problems, and avoiding them will only take you down the path of obstinacy.
The only time a politician will try to avoid the blame game is when they are the target. Hence, no such questions on the selection process were entertained during Congress rule at the center. The same Congress that disregarded norms is now blaming the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance for the selection of the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners. The people are not amused, and they know the truth.

Title: Israeli military says body released by Hamas is not of a hostage
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:21:55 +0000
Content: The Israeli military said on Friday that one of the bodies released by Hamas did not belong to any of the hostages held in Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating an already shaking ceasefire.
Two of the bodies were identified as infant Kfir Bibas and his four-year-old brother Ariel, while a third body that was supposed to be their mother, Shiri, was found not to match with any hostage and remained unidentified, the military said.
“This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,” the military said, in a statement, demanding the return of Shiri and all hostages.
The family of hostage Oded Lifshitz, said in a statement that his body had been formally identified.
There was no immediate reaction from Hamas.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier vowed revenge on Hamas after the group released the remains of what it said were four hostages, including that of Kfir and Ariel, the youngest of those abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack.
Palestinian militants handed over four black coffins in a carefully orchestrated public display as a crowd of Palestinians and dozens of armed Hamas militants watched, creating a spectacle which was condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
The purported remains of the boys, their mother and Lifshitz, were handed over under the Gaza ceasefire agreement reached last month with the backing of the United States and the mediation of Qatar and Egypt.
Israelis lined the road in the rain near the Gaza border to pay their respects as the convoy carrying the coffins drove by.
“We stand here together, with a broken heart. The sky is also crying with us and we pray to see better days,” said one woman, who gave her name only as Efrat.
In Tel Aviv, people gathered, some weeping, in a public square opposite Israel’s defence headquarters that has come to be known as Hostages Square.
“Agony. Pain. There are no words. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,” said President Isaac Herzog.
In a recorded address released after the remains of the hostages were handed over, Netanyahu vowed to eliminate Hamas, saying “the four coffins” obliged Israel to ensure “more than ever” that there was no repeat of the October 7 attack.
“Our loved ones’ blood is shouting at us from the soil and is obliging us to settle the score with the despicable murderers, and we will,” he said.
Over the course of the 16-month-old conflict, Israeli officials have repeatedly asserted that Hamas would be destroyed and the roughly 250 hostages abducted during the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel would be returned home.
During Thursday’s handover, one militant stood beside a poster showing coffins wrapped in Israeli flags. It read “The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins”.
U.N. chief Guterres condemned “the parading of bodies and displaying of the coffins of the deceased hostages in the manner seen this morning, which is abhorrent and appalling,” his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said.
He said international law required remains to be handed over in a way that ensures “respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families.”
‘SYMBOL’
Kfir Bibas was nine months old when the Bibas family, including their father Yarden, was abducted at Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of a string of communities near Gaza that were overrun by Hamas-led attackers from Gaza.
Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, but their deaths were not confirmed by Israeli authorities.
“Shiri and the kids became a symbol,” said Yiftach Cohen, of the Nir Oz kibbutz, which lost around a quarter of its residents, either killed or kidnapped, during the assault.
Yarden Bibas was returned alive in an exchange for prisoners this month.
Lifshitz was 83 when he was abducted from Nir Oz, the kibbutz he helped found. His wife, Yocheved, 85 at the time, was seized with him and released two weeks later, along with another woman.
He was a former journalist and in an op-ed in left-leaning Haaretz in January 2019, he listed what he said were Netanyahu’s policy failures.
LIVING HOSTAGES
The handover marked the first return of dead bodies during the current agreement.
The military said that the Bibas children had been murdered in captivity in November 2023 by “terrorists”. The prime minister’s office earlier said that Lifshitz was murdered in captivity by Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza.
Chen Kugel, the head of the Israel National Center of Forensic Medicine, later said in a televised statement that Lifshitz had been murdered more than a year ago.
The Hamas-led attack into Israel killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, with 251 kidnapped. Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed some 48,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, and left densely populated Gaza in ruins.
Thursday’s handover of bodies will be followed by the return of six living hostages on Saturday, in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians, expected to be women and minors detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war.
Negotiations for a second phase, expected to cover the return of around 60 remaining hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive, and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip to allow an end to the war, are expected to begin in the coming days.

Title: India’s private sector growth hits six-month high in February: HSBC flash PMI data
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:58:19 +0000
Content: India’s private sector output reached a six-month high in February, driven by a sharp expansion in services activity, according to the latest HSBC Flash PMI data.
The seasonally adjusted HSBC Flash India Composite Output Index rose to 60.6 from 57.7 in January, marking its strongest growth since August 2024 and remaining above its long-term average.
The services sector was the key contributor to this growth, with the HSBC Flash India Services PMI Business Activity Index climbing to 61.1 from 56.5 in January, its highest level in nearly a year. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector’s growth slowed slightly, with the HSBC Flash India Manufacturing PMI easing to 57.1 from 57.7 in January, though it still indicated robust expansion.
A rise in new orders and output boosted business confidence, leading to an increase in hiring activity. The report noted that job creation reached a record high, with firms hiring both permanent and temporary workers. The services sector, in particular, experienced the sharpest rise in new business since August 2024.
Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said, “Rapid restocking around the world continues to lift new export orders. A healthy acceleration in orders and output is keeping firms optimistic about the future. Input prices eased while output prices rose at a faster pace, leading to improved margins, especially for goods producers.”
Export demand also strengthened, with new international orders rising at the fastest pace in seven months. Goods producers led this growth, although their momentum slowed compared to January.
The HSBC Flash PMI data showed contrasting price trends. Input cost inflation eased to a four-month low, while selling prices increased at a faster rate, particularly in the services sector. The rate of charge inflation in February was the highest in three months, as businesses were able to pass on costs to consumers.
Rising labor and transportation costs continued to put pressure on input prices, though inflationary pressures remained moderate compared to historical levels. Services firms reported higher expenses on food and wages, adding to their cost burdens.
Private sector firms remained optimistic about future output, with business sentiment reaching its highest level since November 2024. This confidence was especially strong in the manufacturing sector, where companies continued to stockpile raw materials to support production growth.

Title: India’s fruit exports expand into western markets with GI tags driving growth
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:36:24 +0000
Content: India’s agricultural exports have reached new markets under the Modi government, with shipments of fruits entering Western countries for the first time and rice exports recording substantial growth, boosting farmers’ incomes.
A senior agriculture ministry official stated that these exports, ranging from exotic fruits to traditional staples, align with the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which aims to create new opportunities for Indian farmers.
In a recent milestone, India shipped its first consignments of premium Sangola and Bhagwa pomegranates to Australia via sea. This development is expected to enable bulk exports at lower transport costs, expanding India’s fresh fruit market in Australia and strengthening its presence in global supply chains.
Indian pomegranates have already gained popularity in Western markets following the trial shipment of Bhagwa pomegranates to the United States in 2023. Maharashtra’s Solapur district accounts for nearly 50% of the country’s pomegranate exports.
The official noted that the government’s Geographical Indication (GI) tagging has played a key role in promoting India’s distinctive fruits. For instance, Purandar figs, known for their unique taste and texture, are gaining traction in Europe. In 2024, India exported its first ready-to-drink fig juice made from Purandar figs to Poland, following an earlier shipment to Germany in 2022.
In 2022, India also exported the first consignment of GI-tagged “Vazhakulam Pineapple” from Kerala’s Ernakulam district to Dubai and Sharjah, opening up new opportunities for pineapple farmers.
As part of efforts to diversify fruit exports, India shipped its fibre- and mineral-rich dragon fruit, locally known as ‘Kamalam,’ to London and Bahrain in 2021. The consignment to London was sourced from Gujarat’s Kutch region, while the shipment to Bahrain came from West Midnapore, West Bengal.
The northeastern region has also gained from this export drive. In 2021, India exported its first shipment of Burmese grapes, known as ‘leteku’ in Assamese, from Guwahati to Dubai. The same year, fresh jackfruit from Tripura was shipped to Germany, marking the first export of its kind. Additionally, a consignment of ‘Raja Mircha,’ also known as king chilli, from Nagaland was exported to London via Guwahati despite the challenges posed by its perishable nature.
India’s rice exports have also seen robust growth. In 2021, the first consignment of iron-rich ‘red rice,’ grown without chemical fertilizers in Assam’s Brahmaputra Valley, was exported to the United States. Known locally as ‘Bao-dhaan,’ red rice is a staple in Assamese cuisine.
The latest data shows that India’s total rice exports rose by 44.61% to $1.37 billion in January 2025, compared to $0.95 billion in January 2024. This growth has made rice one of the leading contributors to India’s merchandise exports, reflecting the strength of the country’s agricultural sector.

Title: Dalai Lama returns to Dharamsala after winter sojourn in south India
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:31:01 +0000
Content: Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, returned to his home in Dharamsala on Friday after a month-and-a-half winter sojourn in southern India, his aides confirmed. During his visit, he led prayer services, performed ordinations for 303 monks, and met with over 8,000 people across Bylakuppe and Hunsur in Karnataka.
Upon his arrival at Gaggal airport, the Dalai Lama was warmly received by Gyari Dolma, Central Tibetan Administration’s Department of Security Minister, alongside members of the Tibetan Parliament and representatives from various faiths including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.
Local Tibetans, many dressed in traditional attire, joyfully lined the streets with white silk scarves and incense as the Dalai Lama made his way to the hilltop Tsuglagkhang temple near his official residence in McLeodganj.
McLeodganj, often referred to as “Little Lhasa,” has been home to the Dalai Lama since 1960 when he fled Tibet amid Chinese persecution. The town is also the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile and houses around 16,000 Tibetans. His teachings on non-violence, peace, and religious harmony have made him a revered figure globally, and he remains a symbol of Buddhism and a respected guest in India.
As the Dalai Lama approaches his 90th birthday in July, he continues his mission of promoting peace and religious tolerance. A Nobel laureate, he will release a new book in March titled Voice for the Voiceless: Over Seven Decades of Struggle with China for My Land and My People. The book offers personal insights into his lifelong struggle with China and his efforts to protect Tibet’s distinct culture, religion, and history.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 following China’s occupation and has since been an advocate for Tibet’s freedom, negotiating with successive Chinese leaders. His new book will provide the first detailed account of these negotiations and reflect on Tibet’s ongoing fight for autonomy, nearly 75 years after China’s invasion.

Title: US says it will drop immigration case against SpaceX
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:16:29 +0000
Content: The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said it would drop a case accusing Elon Musk’s space technology company SpaceX of refusing to hire certain immigrants.
The Justice Department last month signaled it could back away from the case, brought during Democratic President Joe Biden’s term.
Musk, a top adviser to Republican President Donald Trump, is leading a commission tasked with identifying waste in the federal government.
In a Thursday court filing in Brownsville, Texas, government lawyers asked a judge to end a pause in proceedings so they could file a notice of dismissal of the case. The Justice Department said it would dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning it could not be brought again.
Texas-based SpaceX and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Justice Department in August 2023 filed an administrative complaint alleging SpaceX from 2018 to 2022 routinely discouraged asylum recipients and refugees from applying for jobs and refused to consider them.
At the time, the department said SpaceX wrote in job postings and public statements that it could only hire U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents because of U.S. export control laws. The department said export control laws did not impose such restrictions.
SpaceX has denied wrongdoing. The company said in a November 16, 2023, court filing that export laws impose “strict limitations on who it can employ.”
“SpaceX follows strict policies and procedures to both ensure compliance with all export control laws and regulations and also prevent any unlawful discrimination,” the company said.
SpaceX sued to block the administrative complaint, which would be heard in-house by an administrative judge.
The company said DOJ administrative judges are improperly appointed by the U.S. attorney general because they are granted powers that should be reserved only for officials appointed by the president.
A judge had temporarily blocked DOJ from pursuing the case while it weighed arguments from both sides.
Trump and Musk have both been critical of the powers of federal agencies, including those like DOJ with in-house enforcement proceedings.
On his first day in office, Trump declared illegal immigration a national emergency. He has stepped up deportations and issued a broad ban on asylum claims.

Title: Centre likely to modify new EV policy as Tesla gears up to enter India
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:10:20 +0000
Content: As Tesla prepares to enter India this year, the government is likely working on to modify the terms of a new policy that promotes manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) in the country.
In a bid to attract the likes of Tesla, the tweaked EV policy may mandate carmakers to show a turnover of Rs 2,500 crore in the second year itself, as per sources. Centre may also offer further import duty relief.
The government is likely to start accepting applications after the updated EV policy is notified in mid-March. The approvals are likely to be given by August and imports to start soon after, reliable sources added.
Elon Musk-run Tesla will not immediately start manufacturing in the country but rely on imports from its Berlin Gigafactory in Europe, and gradually increase local procurement.
While all eyes are on Elon Musk-run Tesla to make its entry into India, the government is expecting a good response from several automobile majors on the EV policy.
The new EV policy was announced in March last year, where the government reduced the customs duty to 15 per cent with certain conditions.
It entailed a minimum investment of Rs 4,150 crore to set up EV manufacturing facilities, production to start within three years and reach 25 per cent DVA (domestic value addition) by three years and 50 per cent DVA within five years at the maximum.
The new EV policy paved the way for Musk and other automakers to enter the Indian EV market.
According to experts, the EV market in the country can achieve over 40 per cent penetration with $100 billion revenue by 2030.
Meanwhile, Musk-run EV major is set to take a “top-down approach” – launch expensive models in India first and then follow it up with the cheaper vehicles.
The electric car maker is reportedly set to import its fully-built Model Y from its Berlin Gigafactory, as the electric SUV is manufactured in right-hand drive configuration in the European facility.
Tesla, which has an office in Pune, is reportedly searching for locations in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai and Aerocity in Delhi to set up their first showrooms in the country.
The company has advertised for at least 13 new roles, mostly for the Mumbai and Delhi markets. The jobs include business operation analyst, service technician and various advisory roles, including customer engagement manager and order operations specialist, as per its LinkedIn advertisements.

Title: Tennis: Alcaraz rues error that turned the match in shock loss to Lehecka
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:57:46 +0000
Content: World number three Carlos Alcaraz was left ruing a mistake that let Jiri Lehecka off the hook in the third set and allowed the Czech to fight back and claim a 6-3 3-6 6-4 victory in the Qatar Open quarter-finals on Thursday.
Four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz led 4-2 in the deciding set and was 40-30 up on Lehecka’s serve when the top seed hit the net on a return to give his unseeded opponent the chance to hold.
Lehecka went on to win every remaining game and clinch his first victory over a top-three player.
“It was about one point. I think that’s what makes tennis really difficult. One point makes a difference,” Spaniard Alcaraz told reporters after his second loss of the year.
“At 4-2 break point, it was just a few centimetres down in the net, so it could turn the match completely. But then 4-3, he started playing great tennis.
“Probably I could have done a bit better from 4-3, but his game was incredible. He was returning pretty well, really aggressively, no mistakes, or almost no mistakes, so that’s what I have to learn.”
Alcaraz, who won Wimbledon and the French Open last year, said there was little he could have done differently to win the match.
“Next time, I just have to keep going when I am up in the match, with serves. But in my mind, I don’t know what I could have done better, and I give credit to him,” Alcaraz added.
Former Australian Open quarter-finalist Lehecka was elated after the win.
“For me to win a match like that against a player like this is a super big achievement. I believed in myself and knew I had the level to produce this kind of tennis,” he said.
Lehecka faces Briton Jack Draper in the semi-finals on Friday.

Title: Israeli prime minister tells military to carry out West Bank operation after bus explosions
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:44:24 +0000
Content: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the military to carry out an “intensive” operation in the West Bank after explosions on buses close to Tel Aviv on Thursday, in what Netanyahu’s office described as an attempted mass attack.
No casualties were reported.
The Israeli police earlier said there had been explosions on three buses in two Israeli suburbs outside Tel Aviv and that four explosive devices had been found. Local media reported the explosions had occurred on buses in depots and were empty.
The explosions were a stark reminder of the devastating bus bombings in Israel that were a hallmark of the Palestinian uprising of the 2000s, although such attacks are now rare.
The military said in a statement that it was assisting the police and Shin Bet intelligence agency in the investigation. The police said it was searching for suspects, advising the public to remain vigilant.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosions. Netanyahu met with the defense minister, head of the military and Shin Bet and the police commissioner following the explosions, his office said. A police spokesperson said that improvised explosive devices with timers had been identified and public transportation had been searched for any further devices.
A video published by local media showed what appeared to be a bus on fire at a depot and a photo of a burned out bus.
The military said it would intensify counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank and that it had blocked entry points in certain areas, without specifying where. The military has been conducting a large scale military operation in the West Bank over the past month that it says is targeting militants.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to leave their homes in West Bank refugee camps, while homes and infrastructure have been demolished.
The bus blasts come amid a fragile ceasefire in Gaza between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel after 16 months of war. Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four hostages.
The ceasefire has held since it was implemented on January 19 despite accusations traded by Israel and Hamas of violations.

Content: U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for the Ukraine conflict met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Thursday but there was no immediate word on whether their talks had helped smooth over an unprecedented wartime rift between the once firm allies, and key U.S. officials indicated that major frustrations remain.
Zelenskiy had earlier struck a conciliatory tone after accusing Trump of repeating Russian disinformation in response to the U.S. president’s accusation that Ukraine had started the three-year-old war with Russia. Trump went on to refer to Zelenskiy as a “dictator” who should act fast or lose his country.
Trump, in office for just a month, is pushing for a quick deal to end the war and has alarmed Washington’s European allies by leaving them and Ukraine out of initial talks with Russia.
His vice president, JD Vance, said on Thursday he believed an end to the conflict was near and there was no stopping the war without speaking to Russia.
U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, meanwhile, told a White House press briefing that Zelenskiy’s insults were unacceptable and that the Ukrainian president needed to come back to the table and discuss a previously floated deal to give the United States access to Ukraine’s minerals resources.
Trump’s Ukraine and Russia envoy, Keith Kellogg, had arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday, saying he was there to listen.
Following the meeting, Zelenskiy wrote on X that he had a detailed and productive conversation with Kellogg about prisoners of war, effective security guarantees that would be part of any peace agreement, and the battlefield situation.
But there were few additional details available, and a planned joint press conference was cancelled at the U.S.’s request, Zelenskiy’s office said.
Trump is seeking to reestablish ties with Russia and also invest in Ukraine’s mineral resources critical to the energy transition. Ukraine rejected an initial U.S. plan as it did not include security guarantees.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Trump administration was considering presenting a simplified minerals deal to Zelinskiy, though the Ukrainian president made no mention of the revised agreement in his social media remarks.
A possible meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin “will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday.
“You don’t generally have these meetings until you know some outcome or some progress has been made,” Rubio told journalist Catherine Herridge in an interview broadcast on X.
SECURITY GUARANTEES
European leaders have responded to Trump’s stance on Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defence and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who is due to meet with Trump in Washington on Monday, said on Thursday he would tell Trump not to be “weak” on Putin.
“How can you be credible with China if you’re weak with Putin?” Macron said, during a question-and-answer session on social media.
Waltz, for his part, said the U.S. would welcome European-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, and he pushed for all NATO members to be spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense by the alliance’s next summit, set for June.
The Kremlin says the European plan is a major cause for concern but Zelenskiy and NATO have welcomed it.
“It is vital that … Russia will never again try to take one more square kilometre of Ukrainian land,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said.
Russian forces have laid Ukrainian cities, towns and villages to waste and are edging forward along parts of the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line across eastern and southern Ukraine. Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and claims ownership of more.
Ukrainian officials say a ceasefire would just give Russia time to prepare for further aggression. However, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence agency said on Thursday there could be a ceasefire this year, while casting doubt on its durability.
UKRAINIANS RALLY ROUND
At the center of Trump’s charge that Zelenskiy is a dictator is that Ukraine has not held elections because of martial law, which it declared when Russia unleashed its invasion on February 24, 2022.
Martial law, which provides authorities with emergency powers for the war effort, prohibits holding elections. Zelenskiy won office in 2019 and his mandate would normally have ended last May.
Trump’s comments spurred some, though not all, of Ukraine’s opposition figures to rally around Zelenskiy.
Ex-prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko said Zelenskiy was Ukraine’s legitimate leader until someone else was elected, and that it was “impossible and immoral” to hold elections during the war, as the military would not be able to take part.
Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the ex-army chief who is Ukraine’s ambassador to London and whose popularity makes him a possible presidential candidate, said winning the war with Russia to preserve Ukraine, not elections, was the priority.
The most prominent opposition figure who has not pushed back on Trump’s latest election call is Petro Poroshenko, the former president whose relations with Zelenskiy are acrimonious.
Poroshenko previously opposed calls for wartime elections in the name of national unity but remained silent this time after the government imposed sanctions on him last week, something he said was a blow to unity.
Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker for Poroshenko’s party, has been calling for a government of national unity and urged Zelenskiy to stop what she called “political repression against those he does not like”.
Serhii Prytula, who runs a major charity supporting the Ukrainian army and is another possible presidential hopeful, advised Ukrainians on X not to read Trump’s comments before bed.
“Remember that here in Ukraine, only we – the people of Ukraine – determine who is a dictator and who is not.”

Title: Bangladesh should not normalize terrorism, says MEA
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:41:41 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar, during his meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Advisor Touhid Hossain in Muscat earlier this week, conveyed that it is important for Bangladesh to not normalize terrorism, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) revealed on Friday.
Jaishankar held a series of meetings with his counterparts from neighboring countries, including Bangladesh, on the sidelines of the Indian Ocean Conference in Muscat on February 16.
While Jaishankar stated that his discussion with Hossain, the Foreign Affairs Advisor of the interim government in Dhaka, focused on bilateral relations and BIMSTEC, the Bangladeshi side raised the issue of holding a SAARC Standing Committee meeting and urged India to consider the matter.
“Regarding whether SAARC came up for discussion or not… Yes, the matter was brought up by the Bangladesh side when the EAM met with Bangladesh’s Foreign Advisor in Muscat. It was acknowledged that everyone in South Asia is aware of which country and what activities are responsible for obstructing SAARC. The EAM conveyed that it is important for Bangladesh to not normalize terrorism,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi during a media briefing.
EAM Jaishankar and Hossain had last met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September. This marked the first high-level engagement between India and Bangladesh’s interim government after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024.
Bangladeshi media also reported that during their brief meeting, Jaishankar and Hossain emphasized the importance of overcoming challenges in bilateral relations. They also discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting between Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok later this year.
The 6th Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit is scheduled to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, from April 2-4, where Bangladesh will assume the BIMSTEC chairmanship.
While India continues to advocate for the normalization of bilateral ties, the interim regime in Dhaka has faced massive criticism for political crackdowns, human rights abuses, and targeting minorities, particularly the Hindu community. Since the dramatic ouster of Hasina’s Awami League government, Bangladesh has witnessed escalating political instability and accusations against the interim administration.
In December, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Dhaka and conveyed New Delhi’s concerns, particularly regarding the safety and welfare of minorities in Bangladesh, to the top leadership of the interim government.

Title: Kremlin says there’s still no concrete detail on possible Trump-Putin meeting
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:03:35 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Friday that there was a mutual understanding about the need for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that the details of such an encounter had yet to be worked out.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two sides agreed at talks in Riyadh this week – their first on how to end the Ukraine war before more formal negotiations – that the two leaders should meet, but “there are no specifics yet.” He noted that both men had said they were keen to talk in person.
“There is a desire of the two presidents, which they expressed, and there is also an instruction to prepare this meeting well so that it will be as productive as possible. It is during the preparation that all the nuances will be discussed,” Peskov said.
Trump said after the Saudi meeting on Tuesday that he would probably meet Putin before the end of the month.
Putin said on Wednesday that the meeting needed to be carefully prepared in order to achieve results.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a Putin-Trump meeting would largely depend on whether progress could be made on ending the war, and Trump wanted to know if Putin was serious about that.
Peskov restated that Putin was open to negotiating a settlement to the conflict.
“We have our goals, connected with our national security, with our national interests, and we are ready to achieve this goals by means of peace talks,” he said.
He denied a Financial Times report that Russia, at the talks in Saudi Arabia, had demanded the withdrawal of NATO forces from eastern Europe – something it sought in negotiations with the United States in the months before the start of the war, whose third anniversary falls on Monday.
Asked about that milestone, Peskov said it was too early to sum up the results of what Moscow calls its special military operation.
“The special military operation continues. All the goals set by the head of state and the supreme commander-in-chief must be achieved,” he said.

Title: India no longer dependent on foreign aid for tackling AIDS: NACO
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:49:42 +0000
Content: India is no longer dependent on foreign aid or funding to tackle the burden of AIDS, said Dr Uday Bhanu Das, Deputy Director General of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, on Friday.
Speaking at the 16th National Conference of the AIDS Society of India, being held in Gujarat’s Ahmedabad, Das noted that a major chunk of funding for various AIDS programmes in the country comes from the government.
“Currently, 94 per cent of the funding for the National AIDS and STIs Control Programme comes from the Government of India, with just 6 per cent from the Global Fund. However, it is important to recognise that the Government of India also financially contributes to the Global Fund as well as the WHO. India has achieved financial self-sufficiency in its AIDS response,” Das said.
The Phase-V of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) aims to reduce annual new HIV infections and AIDS-related mortalities by 80 per cent by 2025-26 from the baseline value of 2010 in the country.
Another key objective is achieving the 95-95-95 targets by 2025, which aim for 95 per cent of people living with HIV to know their status, 95 per cent of those diagnosed to receive lifesaving antiretroviral therapy, and 95 per cent of those on treatment to be virally suppressed.
“As of 2024, 84 per cent of people living with HIV in India were aware of their status, 86 per cent were receiving lifesaving antiretroviral therapy, and 94 per cent were virally suppressed,” Das said.
Globally, 86 per cent of people living with HIV knew their status, 89 per cent were on antiretroviral therapy, and 93 per cent of those on treatment were virally suppressed.
“If we are to end AIDS, we must ensure that all people with HIV know their status, 100 per cent of them receive lifesaving antiretroviral therapy, and 100 per cent achieve viral suppression. This will not only keep those with HIV healthy but also prevent further transmission,” said Dr Ishwar Gilada, President Emeritus of the AIDS Society of India (ASI).
According to NACO, India’s HIV rates have nearly halved since 2010, with a 44.23 per cent decline by 2023—surpassing the global decline of 39 per cent. AIDS-related deaths in India have also dropped by 79.26 per cent in the same period, compared to the global reduction of 51 per cent.

Title: DRI busts seven fake currency modules across four states; nine arrested
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:45:24 +0000
Content: In a major crackdown on Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) operations, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) dismantled seven modules across Maharashtra, Haryana, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh, resulting in the arrest of nine individuals. The operation, conducted on Thursday, involved simultaneous searches at 11 locations, targeting facilities engaged in printing FICN using imported security paper, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The raids in Maharashtra uncovered sophisticated setups in Vikhroli West, Sangamner, and Kolhapur districts, leading to the seizure of fake currency, machinery, and tools, including laptops, printers, and security paper with watermarks. Three arrests were made in the state. Further investigations in Kolhapur helped track another module in Belgaum, Karnataka, leading to three more arrests.
Additional raids in Rohtak (Haryana), Khagaria (Bihar), and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh) revealed more security paper importers, with laptops, printers, and restricted paper seized. The accused were handed over to the police, with further investigations underway under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).
This follows DRI’s earlier operations on February 8-9, where two people were arrested for importing high-quality security paper, and two facilities in Thane and Bhiwani were busted, leading to further arrests. The DRI continues its efforts to combat FICN operations across the country.

Title: Airlines warned as Chinese navy holds live-fire exercises off Australia
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:57:55 +0000
Content: Australia expressed concern to China on Friday over the short notice given by the Chinese navy that it would hold a live-fire exercise in international waters between Australia and New Zealand, forcing airlines to divert flights, Defence Minister Richard Marles said.
Airlines including Qantas and Air New Zealand modified flight paths between Australia and New Zealand on Friday after China broadcast a message that its People’s Liberation Army Navy would hold live-fire exercises off the New South Wales coast in international waters, a rare event.
A People’s Liberation Army Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel last week entered Australia’s maritime approaches, and travelled down Australia’s east coast this week, monitored by the navies and air forces of Australia and New Zealand.
Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday afternoon it was unclear if live fire had been used by the Chinese navy, and the Australian defence force had advised there was no imminent risk of danger to Australian or New Zealand assets.
“China issued, in accordance with practice, an alert that it would be conducting these activities, including the potential use of live fire. It’s outside of Australia’s exclusive economic zone,” he said, indicating it was at least 200 nautical miles (370 km) offshore.
The Chinese ships put out “a broadcast that was picked up by airlines or literally planes that were commercial planes that were flying across the Tasman”, Marles said in an ABC radio interview on Friday.
“They complied with international law in terms of providing notice, but it was very short notice and it did put commercial planes in a disconcerting circumstance where, you know, they were needing to divert pretty quickly,” he said.
Australia has asked China why it wanted to hold a live fire exercise between Australia and New Zealand, and why more notice wasn’t given to avoid disruptions to commercial aircraft, he said.
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong will also raise the matter with her Chinese counterpart in South Africa, where they are attending the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting.
China’s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a press briefing in Beijing on Friday the Southern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army “organised a fleet of ships to conduct exercises and training in distant waters”.
“The exercises and training activities upheld safety standards and professional operations throughout in accordance with relevant international laws and international practices,” he said.
The New Zealand frigate Te Kaha was in the vicinity of the Chinese exercise, and New Zealand said it was gathering information about the Chinese navy activity.
“Like Australia, our primary concern is the safety of our people, vessels and aircraft. There is no ongoing danger to New Zealand,” New Zealand’s minister for defence Judith Collins said in a statement.
AIRLINES DIVERT ACROSS TASMAN SEA
Airlines were contacted by Australia’s air traffic control agency on Friday warning them of reports of live fire where the Chinese navy task group was operating, the agency and Australian officials said.
“The Civil Aviation Authority and Airservices Australia are aware of reports of live firing in international waters,” air traffic control agency Airservices Australia said in a statement.
“As a precaution, we have advised airlines with flights planned in the area,” it added.
Qantas QAN.AX and its low-cost arm Jetstar were monitoring the airspace and temporarily adjusted some flights across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.
Air New Zealand AIR.NZ said it had modified flight paths as needed to avoid the area, with no impact to its operations, while Virgin Australia IPO-VIR.AX was following instructions from Airservices Australia.
Albanese said he had contacted New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon about the matter.
“The chief of the defence force has advised that it’s not clear whether there was any actual live fire used in this area, but it is consistent with international law,” Albanese said.

Title: Jaishankar calls for plurilateralism and common ground at G20
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:50:43 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, addressing the G20 session in South Africa, underscored the strain on the global order due to ongoing conflicts and called for greater plurilateralism to address global deficits. He emphasized that the international agenda should not be dictated by the interests of a few and urged for collective efforts to uphold international law and multilateral cooperation.
Speaking at the G20 session titled “Discussion on the Global Geopolitical Situation,” Jaishankar welcomed the ongoing ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, reaffirming India’s strong condemnation of terrorism and its advocacy for a two-state solution.
“On the Middle East, we welcome the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, support humanitarian assistance, condemn terrorism, and advocate a two-state solution. Maintaining the ceasefire in Lebanon and ensuring an inclusive Syrian-led, Syrian-owned solution are important. Peace and stability in the region is vital for the entire world,” he said.
Highlighting India’s contributions to maritime security, Jaishankar stressed the importance of ensuring stability in critical regions. “Ensuring maritime security in and around this region is essential. Indian naval forces have contributed to that in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden. Restoring normal maritime commerce remains a priority,” he said.
On the Russia-Ukraine war, he reiterated India’s long-standing position favoring resolution through dialogue and diplomacy. “Regarding the Ukraine conflict, we have long advocated dialogue and diplomacy. Today, the world expects that parties concerned deal with each other to end the war,” he said.
Jaishankar also criticized the lack of global attention to other conflicts, such as those in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and the Sahel, stating that these crises deserve as much focus as other geopolitical flashpoints.
Turning to the Indo-Pacific, he reaffirmed the necessity of respecting international law, particularly UNCLOS 1982. “In the Indo-Pacific, it is important that international law—especially UNCLOS 1982—is respected. Agreements entered into must be observed, and there must be no room for coercion,” he added.
Jaishankar further criticized the dysfunctionality of multilateral institutions, stating, “As G20 members, we must recognize that multilateralism itself lies deeply damaged. The UN and its Security Council are often gridlocked. Just getting it back to work is not enough; its working methods and representation must change. More plurilateralism is required to plug global deficits. International cooperation itself must be less opaque or unilateral, and the global agenda cannot be narrowed down to the interests of a few.”
G20’s role in a multipolar world
Jaishankar also stressed the importance of the G20 in a multipolar world, warning that rising geopolitical polarization has placed significant strain on the institution. He thanked South African Minister Ronald Lamola and President Cyril Ramaphosa for hosting the session and emphasized the G20’s role in shaping global consensus.
“The G20 is an important expression of the world’s growing multi-polarity. It captures the diversity of our interests, cultures, and outlook. For this very reason, its ability to harmonize viewpoints is key to advancing the global agenda,” he said.
However, he acknowledged the increasing divisions within the global order. “The polarization of recent years has created visible stress and distorted priorities. What we could do was, somehow, find enough common ground to safeguard this institution. Today, the imperative is to go beyond that,” he said.
Jaishankar listed multiple challenges facing the global system, including the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial pressures, food security issues, climate change, concentrated supply chains, and the weaponization of trade and finance. He also pointed to the geopolitical implications of technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, space exploration, drones, and green hydrogen.
Jaishankar reiterated the need for diplomacy, international law, and respect for institutions like the UN Charter to navigate global challenges. “Geo-politics is a reality, as is national interest. But the very purpose of diplomacy—and a group like the G20—is to find common ground and create the basis for collaboration. We can do so best by observing international law, respecting the UN Charter, and preserving institutions.”
He further warned against escalating conflicts, adding, “Differences must not become disputes, disputes should not become conflicts, and conflicts should not lead to a bigger breakdown. There are lessons from the last few years for all of us to reflect on. But equally, an experience to draw upon as we seek to lead the world to a better place.”

Title: Deeply troubling, agencies probing foreign interference in India’s internal affairs: MEA on USAID funding
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:47:25 +0000
Content: India on Friday said that relevant departments and agencies are looking into the information put out by the US administration about the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) meddling in Indian elections and spending millions to influence voter turnout in the country.
“We have seen information that has been put out by the US administration regarding certain USAID activities and funding. These are obviously very deeply troubling. This has led to concerns about foreign interference in India’s internal affairs,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi during a media briefing.
“Relevant departments and agencies are looking into this matter. It would be premature to make a public comment at this stage. Relevant authorities are looking into this and hopefully we can come up with an update on that subsequently,” he added.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the Biden administration’s motive behind spending $21 million through the USAID to influence electoral outcome in India.
“Why do we need to spend $21 million on voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian Government… This is a total breakthrough,” Trump said while speaking at the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Thursday, India time.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump had backed the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) decision to cancel the $21 million funding for “voter turnout in India”.
“Why are we giving $21 million to India? They got a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high. I have a lot of respect for India and their Prime Minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout? In India? What about voter turnout here?” Trump remarked while speaking at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
The Elon Musk-led DOGE had on February 16 announced the cancellation of the $21 million grant, outlining several foreign assistance programmes – the India voter turnout project topping the list – that had been deemed unnecessary or excessive.
The department had also listed several other countries where the US taxpayer dollars were going to be spent, all of which have now been cancelled.
It included $29M to “strengthening political landscape in Bangladesh” and $20M for “fiscal federalism” in Nepal.
Questions are also being raised about the role of USAID and other organisations in Bangladesh during the Biden period and its role in ousting the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina, last August. All USAID aid programmes in Bangladesh have now been suspended.

Title: Sensex, Nifty end lower amid global weakness and broad-based sell-off
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:44:03 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Friday, extending its weekly losses due to weak global cues and broad-based weakness across sectors.
The Sensex declined by 424.90 points, or 0.56%, to close at 75,311.06, while the Nifty fell by 117.25 points, or 0.51%, ending the session at 22,795.90. The Nifty Bank index also dropped by 353.35 points, or 0.72%, closing at 48,981.20.
The Nifty has closed lower in 12 of the last 13 trading sessions, reflecting the market’s continued downward trend. Among sectoral indices, 12 out of 13 major indices ended in the red. The Nifty Auto index emerged as the worst performer, falling by 2.5% after reports suggested that the government may reduce import duties on electric vehicles. In contrast, the Nifty Metal index posted gains, making it the top-performing sector.
Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, and Eicher Motors were among the top gainers, while Mahindra & Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and Bharat Petroleum were the leading laggards.
Vikram Kasat of PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher attributed the market’s weak performance to concerns over US retaliatory tariffs and persistent foreign selling. He added that overnight losses on Wall Street, driven by a rise in US jobless claims and weak corporate outlooks, further weighed on investor sentiment.
Market experts noted that the hawkish tone of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, signaling prolonged higher interest rates, has raised concerns about liquidity in emerging markets, including India.
In the currency market, the rupee weakened by 0.05, closing at 86.70 despite a decline in the dollar index to 106.60. Foreign institutional investor (FII) selling continued to pressure the rupee, which is expected to trade between 86.45 and 87.10 in the coming days, influenced by global sentiment and capital flows.
Meanwhile, gold prices remained volatile. On the Comex, gold fluctuated between $2,920 and $2,935, while on the MCX, it traded within a range of ₹85,900 to ₹85,400.
The market is expected to remain cautious in the near term, with global developments and monetary policy decisions playing a key role in influencing investor sentiment.

Title: Experts stress mental health and stigma reduction for adolescents
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:34:39 +0000
Content: Addressing mental health needs and breaking the stigma surrounding psychological issues is essential for the well-being and development of adolescents, according to psychology experts.
Adolescence is marked by rapid physical, psychological, and social changes that can often lead to stress. Studies indicate a rise in stress levels among adolescents, posing a challenge to their mental well-being. Factors such as brain development, hormonal changes, bullying, coping skills, and resilience play a key role in influencing their mental health.
“The effects of bullying leave scars that extend beyond the visible, leading to long-lasting impacts such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and even thoughts of self-harm,” said Prof. Rajesh Sagar, Professor of Psychiatry at AIIMS New Delhi. He emphasized the need for collective efforts from researchers, educators, and health professionals to build resilience and create safer environments for adolescents.
Prof. Sagar was speaking at an event in the national capital aimed at shaping policy recommendations and intervention strategies to support adolescent mental health in India. The discussions focused on equipping young individuals with essential life skills to help them cope with stress and improve their mental resilience.
Prof. Pallab Maulik, Director of Research at The George Institute for Global Health India, stressed the importance of reducing mental health stigma. “India is home to more than 250 million adolescents. For the nation’s future, it is essential to take all necessary steps to improve the psychological well-being of these young individuals, who will lead the country in the coming decades,” he said.
The event also discussed the role of technology and social media, highlighting their potential to provide mental health support while minimizing associated risks.
At a separate event in New Delhi, Dr. Pratima Murthy, Director of NIMHANS, underscored the need for greater awareness and early diagnosis of mental health disorders.
“One in ten people suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder,” said Dr. Murthy, emphasizing that mental health conditions should be recognized as any other health issue. She also noted that advancements in genetics and brain imaging are paving the way for more effective treatments.

Title: Arab leaders in Riyadh discuss ‘Palestinian cause’ and Gaza developments
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:36:11 +0000
Content: Arab leaders discussed on Friday the joint efforts supporting “the Palestinian cause” and Gaza developments, during an informal meeting in Riyadh attended by Gulf states, Egypt and Jordan, the Saudi state news agency SPA said.
Arab countries are rushing to formulate an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to redevelop war-torn Gaza into an international beach resort and his call on Egypt and Jordan to take in resettled Gaza Palestinians.
Both countries reject the proposal, citing national security concerns, but there are no signs Arab states are making serious progress on a counter-plan.
SPA did not mention that the leaders discussed Trump’s proposal.
The meeting, called by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was attended by Jordan’s King Abdullah and Crown Prince Hussein, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and his national security adviser, Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah and Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, a photo published with the statement showed.
Sources familiar with the discussions told Reporters they tackled a mainly Egyptian proposal that could include up to $20 billion in funding over three years from wealthy Gulf and Arab states, but there was no official confirmation.
The leaders welcomed Egypt hosting an emergency meeting of the Arab League on March 4, SPA added.
Major U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which is one of few Arab states to have normalised ties with Israel, have ruled out any displacement of Gaza Palestinians and said peacemaking should envisage a Palestinian state co-existing with Israel.
Palestinians and others in the region are concerned Trump’s plan would destabilise the region, repeating the “Nakba”, or catastrophe in the 1948 war at the birth of the state of Israel.
In a defining moment of pain for the Palestinians, almost 800,000 of them fled or were forced away from their homes and villages. Many were driven into refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where many of their descendants languish more than 75 years later.

Title: J&K: fresh snowfall transforms Bhalessa, tourist influx surges in Dal Lake
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:05:19 +0000
Content: The Gandoh Bhalesa Mountain in Doda has transformed into a winter wonderland after fresh snowfall blanketed the lush green terrain, offering a mesmerizing white landscape. The snow-clad Himalayan peaks and serene surroundings continue to attract tourists seeking a magical winter experience.
 
Meanwhile, Srinagar’s iconic Dal Lake is witnessing a surge in tourist footfall, with travelers from across the country and beyond flocking to experience its enchanting beauty. Shikara rides remain a favorite, allowing visitors to explore the lake’s inner parts while taking in the breathtaking scenery.
 
The rise in tourism has provided a boost to local businesses, benefiting houseboat owners, shikara operators, and handicraft sellers. The cozy houseboats, renowned for their intricate woodwork and charming interiors, offer visitors a unique and memorable stay. Shikara operators guide tourists through the picturesque waters, while local artisans showcase traditional Kashmiri handicrafts, with beautifully crafted souvenirs becoming popular among visitors.
 
However, the increase in tourism also brings challenges, emphasizing the need for sustainable tourism practices to preserve Dal Lake’s delicate ecosystem. Initiatives to reduce plastic waste and promote eco-friendly shikara rides are essential to maintaining the lake’s pristine beauty for future generations.
 
Sharing his experience, Rahul Gupta, a tourist from Lucknow, said, “This is a beautiful place, truly the paradise of Kashmir. Everyone should visit. The people are helpful, the environment is pollution-free, and the facilities are excellent. My houseboat experience was great. It’s a must-visit, especially in winter.”
 
Another tourist, Urvashi, said, “We arrived yesterday and explored the market, taking a shikara ride to Zero Point and Lal Chowk. The market is wonderful, people are friendly, and it’s peaceful and pollution-free. It’s enjoyable even in the cold winter.”
 
Local resident Ghulam Rasool added, “It’s winter season now, and the cold weather is attracting tourists. The climate is perfect, and Kashmir’s beauty is at its peak.”
 
In the Jammu region, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is conducting snow clearance operations on the Budhal-Mahore-Gool Road, ensuring connectivity between the districts of Rajouri, Mahore, and Ramban despite the harsh weather conditions.
 
As tourism flourishes, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi noted the region’s improved security situation. “In the hinterland, the Counter Terrorism grid has been reinvigorated, and all government agencies have taken steps in a synergized manner for the upliftment of the local populace, which has resulted in the region shifting from ‘Terrorism to Tourism,’” he said.
 
With enhanced security and infrastructural development, Jammu and Kashmir is experiencing a resurgence in economic activity, driven by the thriving tourism sector.

Title: Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:32:19 +0000
Content: President Donald Trump on Friday fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership.
Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he would nominate former Lieutenant General Dan “Razin” Caine to succeed Brown, breaking with tradition by pulling someone out of retirement for the first time to become the top military officer.
The president will also replace the head of the U.S. Navy, a position held by Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead a military service, as well as the air force vice chief of staff, the Pentagon said. He is also removing the judge advocates general for the Army, Navy and Air Force, critical positions that ensure enforcement of military justice.
Trump’s decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which was already bracing for mass firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in military deployments under Trump’s new America First foreign policy.
While the Pentagon’s civilian leadership changes from one administration to the next, the uniformed members of the U.S. armed forces are meant to be apolitical, carrying out the policies of Democratic and Republican administrations.
Brown, the second Black officer to become the president’s top uniformed military adviser, had been expected to complete his four-year term in September 2027.
A U.S. official said Brown was relieved with immediate effect, before the Senate confirms his successor.
Reuters in November was first to report that the incoming Trump administration planned a sweeping shakeup of the top brass, with firings including Brown.
Democratic lawmakers condemned the decision by Trump, a Republican.
“Firing uniformed leaders as a type of political loyalty test, or for reasons relating to diversity and gender that have nothing to do with performance, erodes the trust and professionalism that our servicemembers require to achieve their missions,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the firings were “un-American, unpatriotic, and dangerous for our troops and our national security.”
“This is the definition of politicizing our military,” he said.
‘WOKE’ GENERALS
During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump spoke of firing “woke” generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pullout from Afghanistan. On Friday, the president did not explain his decision to replace Brown.
“I want to thank General Charles ‘CQ’ Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,” Trump wrote.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had been skeptical of Brown before taking the helm of the Pentagon with a broad agenda that includes eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military.
In his most recent book, Hegseth asked whether Brown would have gotten the job if he were not Black.
“Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt – which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” he wrote in his 2024 book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.”
Brown, a former fighter pilot who has held commands in the Middle East and Asia, recounted experiencing discrimination in the military in an emotional video posted online after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which sparked nationwide protests for racial justice.
Brown was on official travel when Trump made the announcement. Hours before Trump’s post, Brown’s official X account had posted images of him meeting troops on the U.S. border with Mexico, deployed in support of Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
“Border Security has always been critical to the defense of our homeland. As we navigate unprecedented security challenges… we will ensure our troops at the border have everything they need,” Brown posted.

Title: North Korea seen using ChatGPT in AI education
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:14:22 +0000
Content: North Korea is apparently using ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) service developed by OpenAI of the United States, in its higher education AI studies, according to a media report on Saturday.
According to the report from Voice of Korea, a Pyongyang external propaganda outlet, members of an AI research institute at Kim Il Sung University were seen learning ChatGPT and its functionalities, reports Yonhap news agency.
Learning material used by the institute explained how ChatGPT generates text based on user input. Given North Korea’s heavily restricted internet access, it is unclear whether researchers have direct access to the service.
Han Chol-jin, a researcher at Kim Il Sung University, said the institute is focused on teaching ways to understand and acquire advanced technology and adapt it for domestic use.
Earlier this month, Choson Sinbo, a pro-Pyongyang newspaper based in Japan, reported on global AI developments and the growing concerns and restrictions surrounding China’s DeepSeek.
The outlet criticized Western restrictions on Chinese AI technologies, claiming they are part of an effort to limit China’s technological growth. It also stated that China has developed a low-cost AI model comparable to ChatGPT without advanced semiconductors.
Meanwhile, OpenAI said it has banned user accounts that were potentially used to facilitate a deceptive employment scheme possibly connected to North Korea, as it seeks to ensure its AI models are not utilised for malicious purposes.
In an updated report, the ChatGPT maker revealed that actors in question generated content consisting of personal documentation for fictitious “job applicants,” such as resumes, online job profiles and cover letters as it pointed to the North’s scheme to deploy IT workers overseas to create hard currency to support the Pyongyang regime.
“The activity we observed is consistent with the tactics, techniques and procedures Microsoft and Google attributed to an IT worker scheme potentially connected to North Korea,” the company said in the report, titled “Disrupting malicious uses of our models.”
“While we cannot determine the locations or nationalities of the actors, the activity we disrupted shared characteristics publicly reported in relation to North Korean state efforts to funnel income through deceptive hiring schemes, where individuals fraudulently obtain positions at Western companies to support the regime’s financial network,” it added.

Title: Kash Patel sworn in as FBI Director, takes oath on Bhagavad Gita
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:08:02 +0000
Content: Indian-American Kash Patel was officially sworn in as the ninth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday, taking the oath on the Bhagavad Gita.
Patel’s girlfriend and family stood beside him during the ceremony, while other family members were seated in the front row. The oath was administered at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Patel succeeds Christopher Wray, following his confirmation by the U.S. Senate, as reported by Fox News.
After taking the oath, Patel described the moment as a realization of the American dream. “I am living the American dream, and anyone who thinks the American dream is dead, look right here. You’re talking to a first-generation Indian who is about to lead the law enforcement agency of the greatest nation on earth. That can’t happen anywhere else,” Patel stated.
He also pledged to ensure accountability within the FBI. “I promise that there will be accountability within the FBI and outside of it,” he affirmed.
U.S. President Donald Trump expressed strong support for Patel, describing him as “tough” and “strong.” Trump said, “One of the reasons I love Kash and wanted to put him in is because of the respect the agents have for him. He will go down as the best ever at that position. Turned out he was very easy to get approved. He is a tough and strong guy. He has his opinions. Trey Gowdy came out with an incredible statement, saying that Kash is an incredible person, and people don’t realize it. When he said that, there was no doubt left. It was a big statement from someone who is respected and on the moderate side.”
The White House also welcomed Patel’s confirmation, calling it a vital step in advancing President Trump’s agenda to restore integrity and uphold the rule of law. In a post on X, the White House stated, “@FBIDirectorKash Patel’s confirmation as FBI Director is a crucial step in executing President Trump’s agenda to restore integrity and uphold the rule of law. The FBI will serve the American people and refocus on its core mission: enforcing justice fairly and without bias.”
Following his confirmation, Patel expressed his gratitude to President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi for their support. He reiterated his commitment to rebuilding the FBI as a transparent, accountable, and justice-driven agency.
Patel’s nomination faced opposition from Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. However, he secured support from the rest of the Republican Party, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had previously opposed other Trump nominees. According to NBC News, the confirmation passed with a narrow 51-49 vote, with all Senate Democrats voting against Patel.

Title: Germany set for tricky coalition building, poll shows ahead of election
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:27:07 +0000
Content: Germany’s mainstream political parties lost support while the far-right AfD gained ground in one of the last polls published before the election on Sunday, pointing to likely tricky coalition building that could drag on for months.
The vote comes at an awkward moment, leaving a leadership vacuum at the heart of Europe just as it seeks to tackle a confrontational U.S. Donald Trump whose apparent desire to disengage from the region and mend ties with Russia raises questions about the solidity of the western alliance.
Election frontrunner Friedrich Merz, the head of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, warned on Friday that while Germany’s future lay in the West, it was not clear that the West would include the United States anymore.
“But even without Americans, our place remains in the centre of Europe, not alongside Putin and not isolated on the way to the right-wing populist sidelines,” he wrote in a letter to supporters on Friday.
“For Europe to continue to succeed in the future, Germany must be prepared to take on leadership responsibility.”
The CDU/CSU which has consistently led polls for months dropped one percentage point to 29% in the survey by Forsa, while the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained one point to 21%.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats dropped one point to 15% while the Greens and the pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) were steady on 13% and 5% respectively. The far-left Left party inched up one point to 8%.
With all parties refusing to work with the AfD in a country scarred by its Nazi past, the latest poll suggests it will be near impossible for any two of the other parties to form a majority.
Instead, frontrunner Merz will likely have to form a three-way coalition with either the SPD and Greens or SPD and FDP, according to the poll, making negotiations all the trickier.
Coalition talks could therefore take longer, leaving Scholz in a caretaker role but unable to take major decisions on the future of Europe’s largest economy.
It also suggests the next coalition might be as incohesive and difficult to govern as the three-way alliance led by Scholz that collapsed last November after just three years in power.
Scholz’s was the first such three-way coalition in decades at a national level – but such coalitions are set to become more frequent given the rise of the AfD and the decline of the erstwhile big-tent parties.
Still, the tone of the campaign has softened in the past week in a sign parties are preparing the path for talks.
Asked in a television debate if he would get into the boat of keen oarsman Scholz, Merz replied “Ja” (yes). Likewise, Scholz affirmed he would take a plane with hobby pilot Merz. “I assume he was given his pilot permit for a reason.”
The moment of camaraderie belied the tensions that had erupted between the leaders in recent weeks over migration policy, however, and in particular Merz’s decision to attempt to push through a crackdown on migration with support from the AfD.
Merz had previously vowed not to rely on AfD lawmakers to get measures through parliament. Scholz and others said they could no longer trust him after his turnaround.

Title: EAM Jaishankar backs South Africa’s G20 priorities, calls for global collaboration
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:03:58 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday expressed India’s strong support for the priorities set by the South African Presidency, emphasizing their alignment with India’s own advocacy during its G20 leadership. Speaking at the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Johannesburg, Jaishankar underscored the need for the G20 to prioritize cooperation over competition in addressing global challenges.
“We are supportive of the priorities of the South African Presidency. They align with what India has advocated both nationally and during its own G20 Presidency,” Jaishankar said. He stressed that as the G20 enters its second cycle, it must accurately reflect pressing global challenges, including food, energy, and health security, as well as promoting women-led development.
Reaffirming India’s commitment to disaster response, Jaishankar highlighted the success of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which India initiated in 2019 and now has 42 nations and seven organizations as members. “We support strong frameworks for preparedness, emergency response, recovery, and reconstruction. During our G20 Presidency, we established a Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group focused on financing. Our commitment in this domain remains strong,” he added.
On debt sustainability, he emphasized the need for comprehensive frameworks that balance development needs with fiscal responsibility, noting that the MDB reform roadmap initiated during India’s G20 Presidency remains relevant. He also advocated for affordable and equitable financing for energy transitions, pointing to India’s initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and the Global Biofuels Alliance as key examples of global cooperation on climate action.
Jaishankar further called for resilient and transparent supply chains, enhanced cooperation in geological exploration, and sustainable mining practices, particularly for critical minerals. “We recognize that this has special potential for growth in Africa,” he said.
Praising South Africa’s efforts in tackling inclusive economic growth, food security, and AI for sustainable development, he remarked that these areas are integral to India’s human-centric policies. “South Africa’s endeavor to address these challenges through task forces is commendable. In India, these domains remain central to our development approach,” he said.
Jaishankar concluded by affirming confidence in South Africa’s ability to lead the G20 effectively and uphold the focus on developmental issues. “It has been fortuitous that four developing countries have held back-to-back G20 Presidencies, ensuring that development remains at the forefront of the global agenda. As South Africa’s Presidency advances, I am confident we will collectively work towards providing leadership and solutions to the key issues of our times,” he added.

Title: “Never been any animosity between Indian languages”: PM Modi
Publication Date: Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:13:11 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday emphasized that India’s languages have always influenced and enriched each other, asserting that there has never been any animosity among them. Addressing the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan at Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi, he urged people to reject misconceptions that seek to create linguistic divisions, reaffirming the government’s commitment to treating all languages as mainstream.
“There has never been any animosity among Indian languages. They have always influenced and enriched each other. When attempts are made to divide people based on language, our shared linguistic heritage stands as a counterargument. It is our responsibility to distance ourselves from such misconceptions and embrace all languages,” PM Modi said.
Highlighting the government’s push for multilingual education, PM Modi asserted that the initiative enables students to pursue higher studies in their native tongues, including Marathi, without English proficiency becoming a barrier.
“We are promoting education in all major languages, including Marathi. The youth of Maharashtra can now study engineering and medicine in their mother tongue. We have changed the mindset that previously overlooked talent due to a lack of English proficiency,” he added.
Speaking on Marathi’s literary and cultural contributions, the Prime Minister hailed its role in shaping Dalit literature and pioneering science fiction. He also acknowledged Maharashtra’s historical contributions to Ayurveda, science, and logical reasoning.
“Marathi has given the country a rich Dalit literary tradition and has been at the forefront of modern thought, including science fiction. Maharashtra’s scholars have significantly contributed to Ayurveda, science, and rational discourse,” he said.
Recalling the Bhakti movement and the role of Marathi saints in driving social change, PM Modi highlighted how the language became a symbol of resistance during foreign invasions.
“Saints from Maharashtra used Marathi to guide society during the Bhakti movement. Throughout centuries of foreign rule, Marathi remained a symbol of freedom. Warriors like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Maharaj, and Baji Rao Peshwa defeated their enemies and upheld the spirit of resistance,” he added.
The three-day Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, being held in Delhi after 71 years, aims to celebrate the literary and cultural significance of the Marathi language.

A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) highlighted that the gathering aims to underscore the “timeless relevance of Marathi literature” while addressing modern literary challenges such as language preservation, translation, and the impact of digitalization. The event follows the government’s recent decision to grant Marathi classical language status.
The Sammelan features a diverse lineup of panel discussions, book exhibitions, cultural performances, and interactive sessions with eminent literary figures. Notably, a symbolic literary train journey from Pune to Delhi, carrying 1,200 participants, has been organized to showcase the unifying spirit of literature.

Your Excellency, Prime Minister, my mentor, every time I meet you, I am inspired to work even harder as a public servant,” Tobgay said.

I am delighted to celebrate this auspicious occasion in India among friends led by the Honourable Prime Minister and all the distinguished guests here.”

Title: How do Germany’s federal elections work?
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:25:10 +0000
Content: Germans go to the polls on Sunday in a snap election called after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-way coalition. This is how Germany’s election system works:
 
WHAT IS GERMANY’S HYBRID VOTING SYSTEM?
 
Germany’s reformed voting system aims to blend British- or American-style single-member constituencies with the proportionality characteristic of most continental European countries.
 
Under the old system, proportionality was ensured by topping up parliament with extra seats after winners were found in each of 299 constituencies. This ensured parties held seats in line with their share of the vote, regardless of the distribution of constituency seats.
 
In 2021, that led to a parliament of 735 seats, one of the largest legislatures in the world.
 
A new law, introduced in 2023, fixes parliament at 630 seats – between Britain’s lower House of Commons and Turkey’s National Assembly in world rankings – and prioritises proportionality over individual member seats.
 
Now, if a party wins a share of seats that is greater in proportion to their share of the national vote, some constituencies will be left vacant, starting with those where the winning candidates have the narrowest margin of victory.
 
The change may hurt parties that are traditionally strong in single-member constituencies – in particular the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats (CDU) whose leader Friedrich Merz is tipped to become the next chancellor after the election.
 
HOW DOES THE 5% THRESHOLD WORK?
 
Under rules designed to prevent the kind of chaotic and fragmented parliaments that in the 1930s helped fuel the disastrous rise to power of Adolf Hitler’s Nazis, parties must in general get 5% of the national vote to enter parliament.
 
But under a rule that had been scrapped in the new law before being restored by a court ruling, parties that win three constituency seats are entitled to seats corresponding to their vote share even if it is below 5%.
 
In 2021, that saved the Left party, which, thanks to three members with strong regional bases in eastern Germany, got 39 seats.
 
The combination of the 5% threshold, the three-seat exception, and an unusually competitive party landscape with many smaller parties jostling for position makes for a particularly unpredictable result this time.
 
Polls put the neo-liberal Free Democrats, whose departure from Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-way coalition precipitated the snap election, on about 4-5%, while the Left is seen on 6-7% and its splinter party, the upstart Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance(BSW), on 4-5%.
 
The Free Voters, strong rivals to the CSU in Bavaria, are far short of the 5% threshold nationally but have a chance of winning three member constituencies, which would put them in the Bundestag for the first time.
 
HOW COULD PARLIAMENT LOOK?
 
With a highly competitive party landscape and a complex electoral system, the parliament could comprise anywhere from four to eight parties. The first scenario would yield the most consolidated Bundestag since 2017, while the latter would mark the most diverse in modern German history.
 
That means the distribution of power in the new parliament is extremely hard to predict and that Merz will most likely need a coalition partner – either Scholz’s Social Democrats or the Greens or maybe both – to build a majority government.
 
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), currently in second place in most polls on around 20%, is unlikely to be part of any coalition government as all other parties have ruled out working with a party they regard as undemocratic.

Title: Govt secures ₹1.56 crore  relief for students from coaching centres through NCH
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:15:58 +0000
Content: The government announced on Saturday that it has successfully secured refunds totaling ₹1.56 crore for over 600 students and aspirants who had been denied refunds by coaching centres. The relief was achieved through grievances filed via the National Consumer Helpline (NCH), the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) stated.
The affected students were enrolled in coaching programs for civil services, engineering courses, and other competitive examinations. Despite adhering to the terms and conditions of their respective coaching institutes, they were denied refunds for unfulfilled services, delayed classes, or canceled courses.
Taking swift action, the DoCA directed coaching centres to adopt a student-centric approach and cease the unfair practice of withholding refunds. The Department emphasized that denying legitimate refund claims would no longer be tolerated, urging educational institutions to respect consumer rights.
“The swift action by the Department has helped students receive compensation for unfulfilled services, late classes, or canceled courses, ensuring they do not bear the financial burden of unfair business practices,” the Ministry of Consumer Affairs said in a statement.
The Department further highlighted its commitment to strengthening the complaint redressal mechanism and educating students about their consumer rights. “Through proactive efforts, the Department aims to empower students to take action against any form of unfair treatment,” the ministry added.
The NCH, which played a key role in resolving these grievances, has become a vital platform for addressing consumer complaints across the country. It operates in 17 languages, including Hindi, English, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Maithili, Santhali, Bengali, Odia, Assamese, and Manipuri. Consumers can register complaints via the toll-free number 1915, ensuring accessibility across all regions.
The helpline has seen a remarkable increase in engagement over the years. The number of calls received grew from 12,553 in December 2015 to 1,55,138 in December 2024. Similarly, the average number of monthly complaints registered surged from 37,062 in 2017 to 1,12,468 in 2024, as informed to Parliament earlier this month.

Title: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta meets PM Modi; Ministers inspect road repairs and infrastructure projects
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 09:33:37 +0000
Content: Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence on Saturday, while her Cabinet ministers conducted field inspections to assess the condition of city roads and review pending infrastructure projects.
Earlier in the day, Gupta addressed well-wishers from the balcony of her Shalimar Bagh residence. Using a public address system, she shared her plans for the meeting with PM Modi, stating that she would convey the gratitude of women and daughters of Delhi for the opportunity to lead the city.
“On my first day in office, we approved Prime Minister Modi’s Ayushman Bharat scheme during the first Cabinet meeting,” Gupta announced, promising to use every day in office to serve the people. “Our mission is to achieve Viksit Delhi, as envisioned by PM Modi. This journey requires the collective effort of every citizen,” she added.
Following her visit to the Prime Minister’s residence, CM Gupta chaired a meeting with officials from the Public Works Department (PWD) to discuss solutions for dug-up and damaged roads, as well as traffic congestion in the city. She directed the department to expedite improvements and ensure better road conditions.
Meanwhile, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma inspected the Barapullah Phase-3 project, where he assured that delayed payments and pending environmental clearances would be resolved swiftly to accelerate the project’s progress. Speaking to reporters near Sarai Kale Khan in South East Delhi, Verma stressed the need for long-lasting road infrastructure.
“We have instructed road contractors to guarantee a lifespan of at least 10 years for newly constructed roads to eliminate the need for frequent recarpeting,” Verma said, adding that measures are being taken to remove encroachments from city roads.
During another field visit at the Khajuri Khas crossing in North East Delhi, Law and Labour Minister Kapil Mishra criticized the previous government, blaming it for the poor condition of the city’s roads.
“Under Arvind Kejriwal’s government, Delhi’s roads became a network of potholes, dust, and waterlogging. Now, with the new work culture in place, all Cabinet ministers and officials will work round-the-clock to repair and restore the roads immediately,” Mishra said.

Title: Champions Trophy: Pakistan unlikely to beat India, says Danish Kaneria
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 07:58:21 +0000
Content: Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria believes that Mohammad Rizwan’s Pakistan side stands little chance of defeating India in their highly anticipated Champions Trophy clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.
Kaneria pointed to Pakistan’s recent struggles, including a disappointing performance in the Tri-Nation Series and a 1-1 draw against the West Indies in a home Test series. In contrast, he praised India’s strong comeback after their Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat in Australia, where they convincingly defeated England in the white-ball series.
“After the debacle in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, India defeated England in the white-ball series at home. They got their confidence back as Rohit and Virat scored runs, while Shami silenced critics with his bowling and bagged a fifer against Bangladesh,” Kaneria told IANS.
Kaneria also highlighted the challenge posed by India’s spin attack, particularly for Pakistan’s skipper Babar Azam, who has historically struggled against left-arm spinners.
“India have better spinners, and Babar Azam struggles against left-arm spinners. How will he tackle Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel? On the other hand, Pakistan lacks a quality spinner. We’ve seen Virat and other Indian batters struggle against leg-spinners, but Pakistan doesn’t have one to exploit that weakness. This match is huge, but I don’t see Pakistan having any chance of winning on February 23,” Kaneria remarked.
Reflecting on Pakistan’s recent match against New Zealand, Kaneria criticized Babar’s approach during the chase of a 321-run target, where he scored 64 off 90 balls. He praised Khushdil Shah for showing greater intent with his 69-run knock off 49 balls, which included 10 fours and a six.
“When Babar thinks the match is out of reach, he seems to focus on scoring runs for himself rather than for the team. He didn’t show the required intent, whereas Khushdil Shah did and played a good knock. Although we lost the game, his innings helped reduce the margin of defeat. Babar can’t justify that knock,” Kaneria said.
He also praised Shubman Gill for his classical century, adding that without the right intent, it would be difficult for Pakistan to secure a win against India, especially on Dubai’s dry and slow pitches.
“Shubman Gill scored a classical century. If you don’t have the intent, winning against India will be very difficult. Dubai pitches are dry and slow, making it tough to play against India’s quality bowling attack, even in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah,” he added.
When asked to name his trump cards for the clash, Kaneria picked Khushdil Shah, Saud Shakeel, and Shaheen Afridi for Pakistan, while naming Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Harshit Rana as key players for India.
“In Fakhar’s absence, Khushdil Shah and Salman Agha have the ability to step up. Saud Shakeel is technically sound and can make a big difference. In the bowling department, Shaheen is the most experienced bowler. For India, Shubman Gill will be the X-factor, while Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are also crucial. Harshit Rana will play a key role in the bowling attack,” Kaneria said.
India, led by Rohit Sharma, started their Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket win against Bangladesh on Wednesday. They will aim to continue their winning streak against Pakistan on Sunday, which would secure their spot in the semifinals.

Title: World Anti-Doping Agency drops lawsuit against US counterpart
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 07:54:44 +0000
Content: The World Anti-Doping Agency said on Friday it has dropped its lawsuit against the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in a dispute involving 23 Chinese swimmers who failed drug tests in the lead-up to the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.
News of the positive tests led to a war of words between the two agencies and an investigation by Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier, who determined that WADA had not shown “favoritism or complacency” toward China.
The swimmers were not punished after WADA accepted Chinese authorities’ explanation that they were exposed to the banned substance trimetazidine through contamination from spice containers in the kitchen of a hotel where they were staying.
USADA argued that the swimmers should have been provisionally suspended and blasted WADA for what it said was a lack of transparency around the situation.
WADA said it had filed the lawsuit against USADA and its CEO Travis Tygart to protect its reputation, but now feels vindicated by Cottier’s findings.
“In the interest of moving on and focusing our efforts on strengthening the global anti-doping system that the community has worked hard to build together over 25 years, WADA has made the decision to withdraw the lawsuit against Tygart and USADA,” WADA said in a statement.
Tygart has said in the past he was not satisfied with Cottier’s conclusions.
In a USADA statement, he described WADA’s lawsuit as “unauthorized and baseless” and claimed “complete vindication” after its withdrawal.
“It’s time for those who value clean sport to step up and get WADA right, as athletes deserve a fair, robust global watchdog to protect their rights to fair competition,” he said.

The campaign further established two records in digital participation. It created the largest online photo album of people displaying a digital certificate, with 62,525 photos—more than double the previous record of 29,068 photos held by Accenture Solutions. Additionally, it set the record for the largest online video album of people reciting the same sentence, collecting 12,798 videos and surpassing the previous record of 8,992 videos held by Ghe Bharari, Rahul Kulkarni, and Neelam Edlabadkar.
Guinness World Records adjudicator Richard Williams Stenning officially announced the achievements and presented certificates to Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ayush, Prataprao Jadhav, during an event in Mumbai.
Jadhav praised the Ministry’s dedication to advancing Ayush healthcare systems, while Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary of the Ministry of Ayush, noted that the Ministry has set six world records within two months.
The Desh Ka Prakriti Parikshan Abhiyaan was launched on October 29, marking the 9th Ayurveda Day. The campaign’s first phase received an overwhelming response, conducting prakriti parikshan (nature assessments) for over 1.29 crore individuals—exceeding the initial target of 1 crore. This phase involved 1,81,667 volunteers, including 1,33,758 Ayurveda students, 16,155 teachers, and 31,754 physicians, setting a world record for participation.

Title: Arab leaders in Riyadh discuss ‘Palestinian cause’ and Gaza developments
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:36:11 +0000
Content: Arab leaders discussed on Friday the joint efforts supporting “the Palestinian cause” and Gaza developments, during an informal meeting in Riyadh attended by Gulf states, Egypt and Jordan, the Saudi state news agency SPA said.
Arab countries are rushing to formulate an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to redevelop war-torn Gaza into an international beach resort and his call on Egypt and Jordan to take in resettled Gaza Palestinians.
Both countries reject the proposal, citing national security concerns, but there are no signs Arab states are making serious progress on a counter-plan.
SPA did not mention that the leaders discussed Trump’s proposal.
The meeting, called by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was attended by Jordan’s King Abdullah and Crown Prince Hussein, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and his national security adviser, Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah and Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, a photo published with the statement showed.
Sources familiar with the discussions told Reporters they tackled a mainly Egyptian proposal that could include up to $20 billion in funding over three years from wealthy Gulf and Arab states, but there was no official confirmation.
The leaders welcomed Egypt hosting an emergency meeting of the Arab League on March 4, SPA added.
Major U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which is one of few Arab states to have normalised ties with Israel, have ruled out any displacement of Gaza Palestinians and said peacemaking should envisage a Palestinian state co-existing with Israel.
Palestinians and others in the region are concerned Trump’s plan would destabilise the region, repeating the “Nakba”, or catastrophe in the 1948 war at the birth of the state of Israel.
In a defining moment of pain for the Palestinians, almost 800,000 of them fled or were forced away from their homes and villages. Many were driven into refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where many of their descendants languish more than 75 years later.

Title: J&K: fresh snowfall transforms Bhalessa, tourist influx surges in Dal Lake
Publication Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:05:19 +0000
Content: The Gandoh Bhalesa Mountain in Doda has transformed into a winter wonderland after fresh snowfall blanketed the lush green terrain, offering a mesmerizing white landscape. The snow-clad Himalayan peaks and serene surroundings continue to attract tourists seeking a magical winter experience.
 
Meanwhile, Srinagar’s iconic Dal Lake is witnessing a surge in tourist footfall, with travelers from across the country and beyond flocking to experience its enchanting beauty. Shikara rides remain a favorite, allowing visitors to explore the lake’s inner parts while taking in the breathtaking scenery.
 
The rise in tourism has provided a boost to local businesses, benefiting houseboat owners, shikara operators, and handicraft sellers. The cozy houseboats, renowned for their intricate woodwork and charming interiors, offer visitors a unique and memorable stay. Shikara operators guide tourists through the picturesque waters, while local artisans showcase traditional Kashmiri handicrafts, with beautifully crafted souvenirs becoming popular among visitors.
 
However, the increase in tourism also brings challenges, emphasizing the need for sustainable tourism practices to preserve Dal Lake’s delicate ecosystem. Initiatives to reduce plastic waste and promote eco-friendly shikara rides are essential to maintaining the lake’s pristine beauty for future generations.
 
Sharing his experience, Rahul Gupta, a tourist from Lucknow, said, “This is a beautiful place, truly the paradise of Kashmir. Everyone should visit. The people are helpful, the environment is pollution-free, and the facilities are excellent. My houseboat experience was great. It’s a must-visit, especially in winter.”
 
Another tourist, Urvashi, said, “We arrived yesterday and explored the market, taking a shikara ride to Zero Point and Lal Chowk. The market is wonderful, people are friendly, and it’s peaceful and pollution-free. It’s enjoyable even in the cold winter.”
 
Local resident Ghulam Rasool added, “It’s winter season now, and the cold weather is attracting tourists. The climate is perfect, and Kashmir’s beauty is at its peak.”
 
In the Jammu region, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is conducting snow clearance operations on the Budhal-Mahore-Gool Road, ensuring connectivity between the districts of Rajouri, Mahore, and Ramban despite the harsh weather conditions.
 
As tourism flourishes, Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi noted the region’s improved security situation. “In the hinterland, the Counter Terrorism grid has been reinvigorated, and all government agencies have taken steps in a synergized manner for the upliftment of the local populace, which has resulted in the region shifting from ‘Terrorism to Tourism,’” he said.
 
With enhanced security and infrastructural development, Jammu and Kashmir is experiencing a resurgence in economic activity, driven by the thriving tourism sector.
