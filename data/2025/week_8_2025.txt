Title: River systems similar to blood vessels of our body, says UP CM at ‘Faith of Kumbh’ conclave
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:20:06 +0000
Content: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that more than 52 crore devotees have taken a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam during the ongoing Mahakumbh Mela.
This has been the largest congregation in human history for a religious event.
Speaking at the inauguration of a climate conclave that saw the role of religious leaders in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, CM Yogi Adityanath “emphasised saving nature as it faces dire challenges like pollution, over-extraction, and climate change”.
He expressed concern over the drying of rivers and called for urgent collective action to rejuvenate the rivers and their ecosystem.
“River systems are similar to the blood vessels of our body. If the vessels get choked, or toxic, the body will die. And if the tributaries and the rivers get toxic or choked, they will die,” he said and asked the faith leaders, scientists, and researchers how can we control the siltation and pollution of the rivers.
The Chief Minister said the government has channelised and dredged the Sangam bank by adopting mechanical methods.
“The flow of the river at Triveni Sangam has multiplied.”
Triveni Sangam is a sacred confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the ‘mystical’ Saraswati.
Triveni Sangam is located in Prayagraj.
Officials told IANS that ahead of the Mahakumbh 2025 the three streams of the Ganga were unified into a single flow which made Sangam more than just a river, a lifeline for millions of people, a symbol of cultural and spiritual heritage, besides a crucial ecological system that sustains life.
CM Yogi Adityanath said the government has carried out several sapling plantation drives to increase the forest cover.
“A total of 210 crore saplings were planted across the state in eight years with the survival rate of 70-80 per cent,” the Chief Minister added.
He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ban on single-use plastics.
Advocating for the need to save nature as its deterioration leads to the abnormal rise in natural calamities, CM Yogi Adityanath said two years ago 90 people died owing to lightning in just a few hours from Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) to Bihar.
“We have installed weather early warning systems, but more need to be installed.”
The Mahakumbh 2025, the world’s largest spiritual gathering, hosted the first-ever conclave.
Organised by the state Directorate of Environment and supported by the environment research organisation, iFOREST, the event titled ‘Faith of Kumbh and Climate Change’ saw more than 1,000 participants and 30 speakers representing religious institutions, government bodies, civil society, and academia.
The climate conclave comes at a time when climate change and environmental degradation are intensifying globally.
With its deep connection to sacred rivers and spiritual traditions, the Kumbh Mela offers an extraordinary platform to influence societal consciousness.
Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to galvanise climate action, the Uttar Pradesh government organised the event.
“Our Upanishads teach us that the entire world is a creation of the Almighty. We should use it, not exploit it. “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” sees the world as one. Our rivers, animals, forests, every life form in this entire ecosystem not only take but give back to the environment. Even the small creatures like bees give back,” said Swami Mukundananda, Founder, Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust.
“At a time like this, when climate crisis is impacting every part of the world, religious and spiritual leaders must play a pivotal role in inspiring sustainable practices and climate action,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, Chief Secretary, while releasing the ‘Mahakumbh Declaration on Climate Change’.
The conclave seeks to bridge the sacred and the sustainable, recognising that faith communities, with their moral authority and grassroots reach, are indispensable allies in the fight against the climate crisis.
“We have worshipped the creator for so long, let us not forget the creation. We must preserve and protect it. If we go on like this, we will neither have the Ganga nor the Yamuna. These will be mere stories. Our nation can only progress if our environment progresses,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, President of Paramarth Niketan.
“Religion and faith hold immense power to influence society. Climate action cannot succeed unless it resonates culturally and emotionally with the masses. Unlike scientists or policymakers, faith leaders know how to take a message to the people,” said Chandra Bhushan, President and CEO of iFOREST.
A cornerstone of the conclave is the Uttar Pradesh government’s pledge to “green” religious institutions.
The state envisions religious centres and shrines becoming models of sustainability. This includes installing solar panels, implementing rainwater harvesting systems, recycling waste, banning single-use plastics, and creating green zones around sacred spaces.
The state’s pledge also includes funding faith-based organisations to promote environmental and climate education, campaigns, and actionable practices.
Initiatives like eco-friendly pilgrimages, green festivals, and sustainable temple management can reduce the carbon footprint of religious practices.

Title: India, Japan joint military exercise to begin at Mount Fuji from Feb 25
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:05:27 +0000
Content: The sixth edition of Joint Military Exercise Dharma Guardian, between India and Japan, is scheduled at Mount Fuji, Japan from February 25 to March 9, the Indian Army said on Sunday.
The exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the two forces while undertaking joint urban warfare and counter-terrorism operations under UN mandate, said the Additional Directorate General of Public Information, IHQ of MoD (Army) in a social media post.
“Building on the momentum of the Chief of the Army Staff’s (COAS) successful visit to Japan from October 14 to 17, 2024, Exercise Dharma Guardian 2025 will further strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation between India and Japan,” it said.
Earlier on February 11, special forces of India and Egypt commenced the ‘Cyclone III’ exercise at Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in Rajasthan. An official said that the exercise would conclude on February 23.

Title: Champions Trophy: Batting-sorted India look favourites for title despite no Bumrah (SWOT Analysis)
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:44:34 +0000
Content: India, the reigning ICC Men’s T20 World Cup winners, enter the Champions Trophy with a 3-0 series sweep over England. The batters impressed with their scintillating knocks, while the bowlers were at their proficient best to bamboozle the England batters.
With all their matches in Dubai, India will be keen to continue the good momentum they have right now into going all the way towards the Champions Trophy. Here’s a SWOT analysis from IANS on the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team taking part in the Champions Trophy happening for the first time after 2017.
Strength: Undoubtedly, India’s main strength lies in their top four powerful batters. Captain Rohit Sharma showed parks of his ultra-attacking way of playing in the first ten overs while hitting 119 in Cuttack, while Shubman Gill stepped up to hit a fine century in Ahmedabad. The Rohit-Gill opening combination has been the most productive pairing for India.
Since joining forces in 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus stands, making for a highly useful opening combination for the Indian team in 50-over cricket.
Virat Kohli also got a fifty in Ahmedabad to add more confidence in India’s ability to control middle overs with the bat, while Shreyas Iyer has stepped up as a very solid number four batter. With Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja batting deep and in good current all-round form, it augurs well for the Indian team in their quest to register competitive scores in Dubai.
Weakness: With no Jasprit Bumrah, it means India are without a game-changing fast-bowling force who could turn around the game in a jiffy in any phase of the game. His absence is a body blow for India, as they would look up to Pandya, Mohammed Shami, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh to step up.
Another pocket of weakness India have is diluting the powers of KL Rahul. It’s no secret that Rahul has been a handy run-scorer at number five. But with head coach Gautam Gambhir’s liking for left-right combination taking precedence, it has meant Axar has batted at that slot.
Rahul, meanwhile, has been pushed to number six, a place where his recent returns have gone down. A decision like this might backfire if India collapses like a pack of cards in the quest of getting fast runs in their batting innings.
Opportunity: India last won the Champions Trophy in 2013, when MS Dhoni was at the helm. Since then, they have reached two semi-finals and as many finals in 50-over ICC events. While they missed a home ODI World Cup win in 2023 and another Champions Trophy triumph in 2017, they now have a golden chance to make up for it in Dubai.
A Champions Trophy triumph will give Rohit another ICC trophy after winning T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies last year, while the win will also ensure a big result is in Gambhir’s kitty after having a tumultuous time in his coaching stint so far.
Threat: By picking five spinners in Axar, Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, India have decided to keep all options open in terms of bowling composition. It’s clear that they are going in with an intention to play three spinners in their playing eleven, especially with Dubai coming off hosting ILT20 matches earlier this month.
But what if they are asked to defend totals, and dew sets in the evening in Dubai, it would mean that their spin-pronged strategy would backfire, which then poses a big threat to their chances of winning the tournament.
India squad: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakravarthy.

Title: Nerveless Niemann overhauls Ancer to win LIV Golf Adelaide title
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:33:54 +0000
Content: Joaquin Niemann hit a stunning seven-under par final round of 65 to claim the LIV Golf Adelaide title on Sunday, finishing on 13-under par to win by three shots as Sergio Garcia’s Fireballs quartet claimed victory in the team event.
The Chilean trailed a trio of players that included Abraham Ancer by three shots at the start of the day’s play at the Grange Golf Club, prevailing in a battle with the 33-year-old down the back nine to win his third LIV Golf event.
“I’m starting to feel the chills now because I didn’t want to get out of the game rhythm because you never know what could happen, but now I feel that relief and it feels awesome,” Niemann said.
Niemann started the day on six-under par but had pulled himself into contention by the time he reached the turn, picking up four shots to put pressure on Ancer, who had been flawless after birdying the first two holes to take a clear lead.
Another birdie at the 12th by Niemann, his fifth of the round, saw him draw level with Ancer, and he responded with a birdie of his own to go back in front.
But the pressure on Ancer started to tell on the par-three 14th when the Mexican-American put his tee shot into a greenside bunker before dropping his first shot of the day.
And while Ancer reclaimed that shot on the 16th, he missed his first fairway of the day on the 17th, going on to drop out of the lead with another bogey.
Niemann held his nerve to birdie the last, prompting Ancer to bogey the 18th and slip into a share for second with Carlos Ortiz.
Ancer at least had the consolation of securing victory with Garcia, Luis Masaveu and David Puig as the Fireballs finished six shots ahead of Legion XIII to claim the team title.
“It’s bittersweet with Abe (Ancer), the way he played, he was there the whole day and it would’ve been nice to get the double,” Garcia said. “Super proud of the way they all fought in tricky conditions.”

Title: WPL: DC’s victory was largely driven by Shafali and Niki’s crucial innings, opines Mithali Raj
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:45:32 +0000
Content: Former India captain Mithali Raj opined that Delhi Capitals nerve-wracking last-ball victory in the WPL match was largely driven by Shafali Verma and Niki Parsad’s crucial innings.
Delhi Capitals registered a two-wicket win over Mumbai Indians at the BCA Stadium. Mumbai posted total of 164 on the back of Nat Sciver-Brunt’s efforts (80 not out off 59) and a fiery cameo from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (42 off 22).
Shafali was in her element from the get-go in the run-chase, hitting a six and four boundaries off the innings’ second over from Saika Ishaque. It was the Shafali show as DC scored 60 in the powerplay.
Speaking about the high-intensity match on Jio Hotstar, Mithali said, “What can I say? The kind of match we witnessed today was remarkable. Last evening’s game was high-scoring, with a chase of 201 and big hits. But today, it was all about intensity. The momentum kept shifting between the teams so frequently that until the last ball, no one could predict the winner.”
Commenting on Niki’s performance, Mithali said the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain stepped into a high-pressure match and and managed it with impressive composure.
“Delhi Capitals’ victory was largely driven by Shafali Verma’s strong start, but Niki Prasad’s crucial 35-run innings was equally significant. When wickets were falling around her, she remained at the crease, providing stability. It was her first game, and coming fresh from the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain, she stepped into a high-pressure match and handled it with remarkable poise. There must have been nerves, but she fought through them brilliantly.
“Though we didn’t see much of it, her innings today was mature beyond her years. She had solid support from Alice Capsey and Sarah Bryce. In the end, as the game came down to two runs off two balls, she went for a big shot, which will come with experience. But what she has done today for Delhi Capitals is massive,” she said.
Reflecting on Shafali’s show, the former skipper added, “I think anyone stepping into Shafali Verma’s shoes would acknowledge how she has never shown a defensive approach. Right from the second ball, she started scoring runs, playing her shots with her usual flair. That’s just her style. The only way to dismiss her today was to outthink her, and I understand that feeling because I’ve been in that situation myself.
“At one point, she had too much time and wasn’t sure where to place the ball. Just before her dismissal, the fielding side adjusted their setup, bringing mid-on up and pushing deep square leg back because she had found boundaries there. She instinctively aimed to clear mid-on but ended up playing into the fielder’s hands, resulting in a crucial wicket.”
Former West Indian cricketer Stacy-Ann King commented on Niki Prasad’s brilliant innings, saying, “We saw what she could do in terms of India Under-19 team. But she didn’t have much chance to bat because of G Trisha and of course Kamalini, who were exceptional. After she started off a little shaky, she eventually just played her shots, and it was amazing.”
Stacy-Ann also shared her insights on the Mumbai Indians’ performance and said, The Harmanpreet-led side made a critical mistake during those five balls when MI didn’t complete their full 20 overs.
“When Harmanpreet spoke, she mentioned that those five balls where MI didn’t bat the full 20 overs were a critical mistake. Even scoring a single run in that phase could have made a difference. This is an opportunity for them to reassess their approach, particularly in handling their spinners,” she said.
“Hayley Matthews picked up key wickets, including Shafali and Sarah, but conceded 15 runs before that. Both teams can take valuable lessons from each other on how they approach their innings and how their bowlers strategise moving forward,” the West Indian added.

Title: Heart has ‘sweet taste’ receptors, can sense artificial sweeteners: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:11:20 +0000
Content: Researchers have found that the heart possesses “sweet taste” receptors, similar to those on our tongues, and stimulating these receptors with sweet substances can modulate the heartbeat.
The discovery opens new avenues for understanding heart function and potentially for developing novel treatments for heart failure.
The new research found that these receptors are not just present on heart muscle but also functional.
When the researchers stimulated these receptors in both human and mouse heart cells using aspartame, a common artificial sweetener, they observed a significant increase in the force of heart muscle contraction and accelerated calcium handling – key processes for a healthy heartbeat.
While taste receptors are traditionally associated with the tongue and our ability to perceive flavours, recent studies have shown that these receptors exist in other parts of the body, where they likely play different roles.
This new study is the first to identify specific “sweet taste” receptors, known as TAS1R2 and TAS1R3, on the surface of heart muscle cells.
“After you eat a meal, it’s been shown that your heart rate and blood pressure actually are increasing,” said Micah Yoder, a graduate student in the lab of Jonathan Kirk at Loyola University Chicago.
Previously, this was thought to be a neural axis that’s being signaled.
“But we’re proposing a more direct consequence, where we have a spike in our blood sugar after eating a meal, and that’s binding to these sweet taste receptors on the heart muscle cells, causing a difference in the heartbeat,” he added.
Intriguingly, the researchers also found that these receptors are more abundant in the hearts of patients with heart failure, suggesting a possible link to disease.
Further investigation revealed that stimulating the receptors triggers a cascade of molecular events within the heart cells, involving key proteins that control calcium flow and muscle contraction.
Additionally, their research may explain why high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is linked to arrhythmogenesis, or an irregular heartbeat.
Not only are these sweet taste receptors particularly stimulated by artificial sweeteners like aspartame, overstimulation of these sweet taste receptors lead to a an increase in arrhythmic like behaviour in the heart cells, researchers found.
However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of stimulating these receptors in the heart as well as how these receptors might be targeted to strengthen the heart in the case of heart failure.
The work was set to be presented at the 69th Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Los Angeles. The Biophysical Society has been established to lead development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics.

Title: US says website update routine, after removal of reference to Taiwan independence
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:28:34 +0000
Content: The U.S. State Department said it has made a routine update to the Taiwan section of its website, after the removal of previous wording saying it did not support Taiwan’s formal independence, among other changes that cheered the government in Taipei.
The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.
But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence”, the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organisations “where applicable”.
The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, was sworn in to his second term in the White House.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time.
“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the spokesperson said, referring to Washington’s officially taking no position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the subject.
“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.
“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”
China’s foreign ministry has yet to respond to requests for comment on the changes in the website’s wording.
On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations”.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island’s people can decide their future.
Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up the People’s Republic of China.

Boxing legend Mary Kom reflected on overcoming societal expectations. “In the beginning, it was very difficult because boxing is not considered a women’s sport. I just wanted to prove myself in front of all the girls and women in the country. In doing so, I have brought glory to the nation by becoming a World Champion multiple times,” she said
Two-time Paralympic champion shooter Avani Lekhara shared how knowledge helped her conquer fear: “We fear things that we don’t have knowledge about. I started gaining knowledge and improving myself, and in this way, my fear gradually decreased.”

Title: Mauritius’ former Prime Minister gets bail on money laundering charges
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:56:43 +0000
Content: A court in Mauritius has released former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on bail following his arrest on charges of money laundering, a magistrate at the court said.
Last month, the country’s former central bank governor was detained and released on bail after being charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.
An Indian Ocean archipelago, Mauritius is an offshore financial centre that markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia.
“He (Jugnauth) shall not interfere directly or indirectly with any witness or potential witness,” Rishan Chineah, the magistrate at the bail and remand court in the capital, Port Louis, said on Sunday.
The magistrate also barred Jugnauth from communicating about the case with anyone, except for investigation authorities or the court itself, and ordered him to appear on Monday to complete the bail process.
Jugnauth’s lawyer, Raouf Gulbul, told reporters his client denied the charges.
Jugnauth was provisionally charged with money laundering, the director of public prosecution told the court in a charge sheet.
In November, Mauritius’ new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam announced an audit of public finances days after questioning the accuracy of some government data compiled by the previous administration.

Title: China’s Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium was attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S.
Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, BYD’s  Wang Chuanfu, Unitree’s Wang Xingxing, and CATL’s Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed.
Meituan’s Wang Xing, China Feihe’s  Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed.
Tencent’s 0700.HK Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country’s business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said.
The symposium also comes as DeepSeek’s AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China’s broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets.
Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development.
But China’s efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities.
“It’s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.”
Tech shares in Hong Kong have roared higher in recent weeks on a combination of optimism about the DeepSeek AI breakthrough and a thawing of authorities’ approach to internet giants.
The Hang Seng technology index. HSTECH hit a three-year high in morning trade on Monday, having rallied on Friday after Reuters reported Xi was to chair Monday’s symposium. It slipped in volatile afternoon trade and was last down 1.3%.
Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
“Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis.
“Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.” (Reuters)

Title: Maddison earns Tottenham 1-0 victory over Man Utd

Content: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison’s early goal proved enough for the hosts to edge a 1-0 victory over fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United on Sunday.
Maddison, back in the starting lineup after injury, tapped home a rebound from close range in the 13th minute to settle a contest in which both sides showed their frailties.
Victory eased the pressure on Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou with his side moving above United into 12th place with 30 points. United dropped to 15th with 29 points.
It was another underwhelming display by Ruben Amorim’s United although they did have their chances with Alejandro Garnacho wasting a golden opportunity in the first half.

Title: Liverpool edge past Wolves to go seven points clear at top
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:52:51 +0000
Content: Premier League leaders Liverpool extended their advantage to seven points with a trickier-than-expected 2-1 win over lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield on Sunday courtesy of goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah.
Arne Slot’s team had looked to be cruising at 2-0 after Diaz bundled in on 15 minutes and won a penalty later in the half for strike partner Salah to convert with ease – a 23rd league goal for the league’s leading marksman.
But Wolves, fighting for their lives near the bottom, gave them a few frights and punished Liverpool for a sloppy second half when Matheus Cunha curled a low shot brilliantly past Alisson in the 67th minute.
In an edgy finale, Liverpool held on for the win, taking them to 60 points and still on track for the title with nearest rivals Arsenal on 53. Both have 13 games left.
“We just managed to dig deep,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said. “The second half was a slog … everyone gets nervous. But it’s a massive win for us and another game down.”
Wolves are 17th on 19 points, two above the drop zone.
Although Liverpool were far from their best, especially in a nervy second half, victory was a huge relief after a week of unusual slip-ups including an FA Cup defeat by second-tier Plymouth and a last-gasp equaliser for Everton against them in the league.
“We’d love to dominate for the full 90 minutes but it is the Premier League and Wolves can punish you and create dangerous moments against you. It says a lot we kept fighting and kept going and got the three points,” said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk.
“At times we were sloppy as well and we couldn’t keep the ball as well as we can.”
ALL-ACTION DIAZ
In the first half, the Reds looked comfortable after Diaz slotted home when Toti Gomes’ attempted clearance dropped kindly for him. The speedy Colombian was then brought down by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa for Salah to do what he always does – score easily from the spot – in the 37th minute.
Cunha was by far Wolves’ best player and had put a free kick just over before his glorious effort from outside the box had the away fans dreaming of a comeback.
Wolves’ recently-signed midfielder Marshall Munetsi, who saw a shot superbly saved by Alisson when one-on-one, said the players were proud of their second-half performance.
“We created a lot of chances and made them uncomfortable … the second half was the identity of the team, this is what the coach wants. This is something we have to keep doing.”
With a colossal fight against relegation to come, Wolves’ coach Vitor Pereira echoed that after so nearly matching the Premier League’s best team.
“We must play the first half as we played the second half, this is what I want to see in my team – the personality, courage and identity,” he said. “Even the best players in the world, if you press them they make mistakes.”

Jaishankar emphasized India’s commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and ensuring a stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
During the visit, Jaishankar held bilateral talks with Oman’s Foreign Minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi. Both leaders reviewed the “full spectrum of India-Oman relations” and discussed ways to enhance collaboration in areas of mutual interest, the MEA said.
As part of their meeting, Jaishankar and Albusaidi launched a logo commemorating 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and Oman. The MEA noted that the logo symbolizes the “long-standing partnership” based on shared history, culture, and strong people-to-people ties.
Additionally, the two leaders unveiled the book Mandvi to Muscat: Indian Community and the Shared History of India and Oman. Brought out by the Indian Embassy in Muscat, the book highlights the deep historical connections between the Indian diaspora and Oman, underscoring centuries-old ties that continue to influence bilateral relations.
On the sidelines of the conference, Jaishankar also met with the foreign ministers of Brunei, Bangladesh, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Nepal to discuss key regional and global issues of mutual interest.

Title: Brazilian youngster Fonseca triumphs at Argentina Open

Content: Joao Fonseca became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP tournament on Sunday after the 18-year-old captured the Argentina Open title with a 6-4 7-6(1) win over home favourite Francisco Cerundolo.
Fonseca has established himself as one of the game’s most exciting young talents with his victory at the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah in December and his win over ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the first round of the Australian Open last month.
He lost to Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego in five sets in the second round at Melbourne Park.
“It is a dream, I work every day for these moments. Playing a final away from home, in Argentina, is difficult,” said Fonseca after denying fifth seed Cerundolo the title in front of a raucous crowd in Buenos Aires.
“It’s very special and I’ve taken another step forward in my career and I’m closer to my dream of becoming world number one,” he told a press conference.
Fonseca also defeated Argentines Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Federico Coria and Mariano Navone in the earlier rounds before beating Serbian Laslo Djere in the last four.
Cerundolo had stunned top seed Alexander Zverev of Germany in the quarter-finals before knocking out Spain’s Pedro Martinez in the semis. (Reuters)

Title: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured

Content: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured
Papal selection thriller “Conclave” and period drama “The Brutalist” were the big winners at the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, winning four prizes each.
“Conclave”, which had led nominations with 12 nods, won the night’s most coveted award, best film, as well as outstanding British film, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
“We live in a time of a crisis of democracy and institutions that are usually used to bring us together are used to pull us apart,” “Conclave” director Edward Berger said in his acceptance speech for the outstanding British film award.
“And sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith in that situation but that’s why we make movies and that’s why we made this movie.”
“The Brutalist”, a three-and-a-half hour tale about a Hungarian immigrant architect trying to rebuild his life in the United States post-World War Two, had also been considered a frontrunner for best film. It won best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for its star, Adrien Brody.
“This film is really about this pursuit of leaving something meaningful and I think that is something we can all relate to,” Brody said in his acceptance speech.
“The Brutalist” also won original score and cinematography.
In one of the big surprises of the night, Mikey Madison won the leading actress category for portraying an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch’s son in “Anora”.
Many had considered the frontrunners to be Demi Moore, who has received multiple honours for her performance in body horror “The Substance”, and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in “Hard Truths”.
“I really wasn’t expecting this,” Madison said.
“I want to take to a moment to recognise the sex worker community … you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be your friend.”
“Anora”, considered a strong awards season contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month’s Academy Awards, was also up for best film, as was Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown”.
SALDANA, CULKIN WIN
Fellow best film nominee “Emilia Perez”, which mixes the diverse genres of musical and crime, triumphed in the film not in the English language category.
“This is too nice, you shouldn’t have done that,” director Jacques Audiard said, accepting his award. “This award is not just for me but everyone who worked tirelessly on this film.”
He thanked the film’s cast members, including an absent Karla Sofia Gascon, who had been nominated for leading actress.
Zoe Saldana won supporting actress for her portrayal of a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman.
“Emilia Perez”, had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.
In the supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin won for dramedy “A Real Pain”. The movie also picked up best original screenplay for writer-director Jesse Eisenberg.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:35:09 +0000
Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty bounce back to end 8-day losing streak
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:55:23 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices rebounded on Monday, snapping an eight-day losing streak and closing the trading session in positive territory.
The Sensex rose by 57.65 points, or 0.08 percent, finishing at 75,996.86, while the Nifty gained 30.25 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 22,959.50.
Of the 50 stocks comprising the Nifty index, 34 ended the day in the green, with Adani Enterprises leading the gains, surging 4 percent.
Among the top gainers were Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Power Grid and IndusInd Bank.
On the other hand, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank were among the major losers, with their shares falling as much as 3.45 percent.
The broader markets also saw a recovery in the second half of the trading day.
The Nifty Midcap100 index closed with a gain of 0.39 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index ended with a marginal increase of 0.04 percent.
Among the sectors on the NSE, Pharma, Banks, Financial Services, Healthcare, OMCs, Consumer Durables, and Metals showed positive movements.
The Nifty Pharma index was the top performer, which rose 1.27 percent during the session, with Glenmark Pharma and Ajanta Pharma leading the gains.
However, the Nifty Auto, FMCG, IT, and Media indices ended lower, with declines of up to 0.71 percent.
According to experts, recent shifts in global policies, especially those emerging from the US, are invoking a sense of uncertainty among foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which in turn is reshaping their investment strategies in dynamic markets like India.
Additionally, the prevailing high valuations in the Indian stock market have added to the caution among investors, said Vipul Bhowar of Waterfield Advisors.
Last week, both indices ended their two-week winning streak with significant losses.

Title: FM Sitharaman launches Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs and expands SWAMIH fund
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:52:41 +0000
Content: The Centre on Monday launched the ‘Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs’, which was announced in the Union Budget 2025-26 to boost the micro, small, and medium enterprises.
The scheme facilitates collateral-free loans to MSMEs by providing loans up to Rs 100 crore for the purchase of plant, machinery, or equipment.
The scheme would provide 60 per cent guarantee coverage by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) to member lending institutions (MLIs) for a credit facility up to Rs 100 crore, sanctioned to eligible MSMEs under MCGS-MSME for the purchase of equipment/machinery.
Launching the scheme here, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also distributed sanction letters to MSMEs eligible under the scheme in Mumbai.
The scheme is expected to facilitate easy availability of credit for MSMEs and give a major boost to the manufacturing sector in India.
Under the scheme, the borrower must be an MSME with a valid Udyam Registration Number. The guaranteed loan amount will not exceed Rs 100 crore, although the total project cost can be higher. Additionally, at least 75% of the project cost must be for purchasing equipment or machinery.
FM Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary also handed over the keys to homebuyers who have benefitted due to the SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing) Fund during the post-Budget interaction programme with stakeholders here.
As of January 24, the SWAMIH Fund has successfully delivered over 50,000 homes, with a commitment to deliver an additional 20,000 homes each year for the next three years.
As announced in Union Budget 2025-26, SWAMIH Fund 2 will be established as a blended finance facility with contributions from the government, banks, and private investors.
This fund of Rs 15,000 crore will aim for expeditious completion of another 1 lakh units.
At a media interaction during the event, the Finance Minister said that the last three Budgets focused on improving MSMEs, including the government-guaranteed loan in the current Budget.
She stressed that the government’s focus has not shifted from capital expenditure to consumption expenditure.
FM Sithraraman further stated that the Centre is working on more reforms in the insurance sector, in which 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) has been allowed.
The current Budget proposes to raise the FDI cap for the insurance sector from 74 per cent to 100 per cent.
Guardrails are being put so that citizens’ money towards premium payment for insurance is kept within the country, she said.

Title: Government actively considering raising deposit insurance limit beyond Rs 5 lakh
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:49:57 +0000
Content: The Union Government is actively considering a proposal to raise the deposit insurance limit beyond ₹5 lakh, confirmed M Nagaraju, Secretary, Department of Financial Services (DFS), during a press conference in Mumbai on Monday.
“As and when the government approves, we will notify it. This is under the consideration of the government,” Nagaraju stated when questioned about the ongoing crisis at New India Cooperative Bank. He emphasized that the increase in deposit insurance coverage remains under active review.
India introduced deposit insurance in 1962, becoming the second country globally after the United States to implement such a scheme. The measure was a response to banking crises worldwide, highlighting the need for robust depositor protection. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) currently insures deposits up to ₹5 lakh, a limit that was last raised from ₹1 lakh on February 4, 2020.
Regarding the troubled Mumbai-based New India Cooperative Bank, Nagaraju declined to comment on its status, stating, “The RBI is seized of the matter… we are not going to comment on that.” He advised depositors to contact the bank or visit the DICGC website for updates on their deposit insurance claims.
The crisis at New India Cooperative Bank escalated on February 14, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the bank’s Board of Directors for 12 months, citing “material concerns due to poor governance standards.” This action followed the central bank’s decision on February 13 to impose severe restrictions on the lender’s operations. The RBI barred the bank from granting loans, accepting new deposits, or making payments without its prior approval. Withdrawals from savings or current accounts were also frozen, with limited exceptions for loan settlements.
The restrictions triggered panic among customers, leading to large crowds outside the bank’s branches in Mumbai, Thane, Surat, and Pune. Depositors voiced fears about their savings and locker access. Bank officials assured customers that access to lockers would be maintained.
New India Cooperative Bank, established with multi-state status in 1999, operates 30 branches across Maharashtra and Gujarat. It achieved scheduled bank status on November 1, 1990. The current crisis marks a significant setback in the bank’s four-decade history.

Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent his foreign minister and a senior Kremlin adviser to meet U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss restoring relations and possible talks to end the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said after a call with Putin on Wednesday that they would begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine immediately, and that they had also discussed the Middle East, energy, the U.S. dollar and Artificial Intelligence.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due in Saudi Arabia to meet Russian officials alongside Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, and Steve Witkoff, White House Middle East envoy.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister since 2004, and Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy advisor, were flying to Riyadh at the request of Putin.
“They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,” Peskov said.
“It will also be devoted to the preparation of possible negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement and the organisation of a meeting between the two presidents.”
Peskov declined to comment on a Reuters report that Kirill Dmitriev, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund chief, would also meet the U.S. delegation.
He also declined to comment when asked if Putin and Trump would meet face-to-face in Saudi Arabia later this month. (Reuters)

Title: Israeli military says it killed Hamas official in southern Lebanon
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 15:34:31 +0000
Content: The Israeli military on Monday killed a Hamas leader in southern Lebanon’s Sidon area, it said in a statement.
The army said Muhammad Shaheen was the head of the operations department of Hamas in Lebanon and that he had recently been involved in promoting “terrorist plots” with Iranian direction and funding from Lebanese territory against Israeli citizens.
An Israeli strike on a car in Lebanon’s southern port city of Sidon targeted an official in the Palestinian militant group, two Lebanese security sources told Reuters earlier.
Lebanon’s state news agency said rescuers had removed one body from the car but did not identify the victim.
The Israeli military has been carrying out strikes against members of Hamas, allied Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and other factions in Lebanon, in parallel with the Gaza war.
Those armed groups have launched rockets, drones and artillery attacks across the border into northern Israel.
Under a truce brokered by Washington in November, Israeli troops were granted 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon where they had waged a ground offensive against fighters from Iran-backed Hezbollah since early October.
That deadline was later extended to February 18, but Israel’s military requested that it keep troops in five posts in southern Lebanon, sources told Reuters last week.

Title: India showcases food industry strength at Gulfood 2025

Content: Gulfood 2025, one of the world’s largest food and beverage trade exhibitions, has commenced at the Dubai World Trade Centre, featuring over 5,500 exhibitors from 129 countries. Spanning 24 halls and 1.3 million square feet, the event highlights more than one million products, reinforcing Dubai’s role as a global food trade hub.
India has a significant presence at the event, with 370 companies participating, including 122 under six key industry associations and 248 independent exhibitors. Leading organizations such as the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India, Assocham, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), and the Indian Oilseeds & Produce Export Promotion Council (IOPEPC) are spearheading India’s representation.
Chirag Paswan, India’s Minister for Food Processing Industries, inaugurated the Indian Pavilion in the presence of Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan and other dignitaries. Speaking at the event, Paswan emphasized India’s commitment to global partnerships in food processing.
“Under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is fostering global collaborations in the food processing sector, encouraging investments, and integrating digital technologies to develop a future-ready food ecosystem,” he stated during his keynote address at the Leadership Summit in Dubai.
He further added, “India’s presence at Gulfood 2025 is a testament to our commitment to becoming a global leader in food processing and agri-exports. This event will showcase India’s strengths in food processing and value addition while fostering new collaborations and innovative food solutions. Our participation will help expand India’s footprint in new markets and establish sustainable supply chains that benefit both producers and consumers worldwide.”
Highlighting India’s growing role in the global food industry, Consul General Satish Kumar Sivan remarked, “India’s strengthened trade ties are reflected in its expanding role in global food supply chains. The country’s leadership in pulses, cereals, and grains is a testament to its ability to meet rising global demand for sustainable and nutritious food.”
This year, India’s participation at Gulfood 2025 emphasizes sustainability, technology-driven supply chains, and product diversification. With the Gulf region being a key market, the Indian Consulate in Dubai has actively supported Indian businesses by facilitating B2B meetings, networking events, and trade delegations.
The Indian Mission, in collaboration with NAFED, APEDA, and FIEO, provides exhibitors with branding support, market insights, regulatory guidance, and access to buyers and distributors. Additionally, interactive knowledge sessions with business delegations, including the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and IGTD Exim Chamber of Commerce, aim to enhance market understanding for Indian producers.
The demand for specific Indian products in the Gulf region continues to grow, driven by the large Indian diaspora and strong bilateral trade relations. Spices, rice, ready-to-eat meals, and Ayurvedic products remain highly sought after, alongside textiles, jewelry, and emerging sectors like electronics and IT.
The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has further boosted trade flows, with e-commerce platforms such as Amazon UAE and Noon expanding market access for Indian brands.
In 2023, India exported $1.61 billion worth of processed food and agricultural products to the UAE, underscoring the strong trade relationship between the two nations. With India’s dynamic presence at Gulfood 2025, the country is poised to further strengthen its footprint in the global food industry.

Title: Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg postponed due to insufficient snow

Content: The second leg of the 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, scheduled to be held in Gulmarg from February 22, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall.
The J&K Sports Council shared the update on social media on Monday. “The 5th edition of the Khelo India Winter Games, initially set for February 22-25, 2024, has been postponed due to insufficient snowfall. A new assessment will be conducted once snow conditions improve, and the revised update will be announced accordingly,” the council wrote on X.
This marks the second consecutive year that the event has faced rescheduling due to inadequate snowfall. Last year, the games had to be pushed to February after a dry January.
The first leg of the Khelo India Winter Games (KIWG) 2024 was held in Leh from January 23 to 27, featuring ice sports such as ice hockey and ice skating.
In the first leg, Ladakh bagged seven medals, including four gold, followed by Tamil Nadu with five medals, including three gold. Maharashtra finished with the highest number of medals (10), but with only two gold medals, they finished third. Maharashtra finished on top in KIWG 2023, winning 20 skating medals, including six gold. Telangana (2 gold) finished fourth, and Karnataka (1 gold) finished fifth in KIWG 2024.
The Khelo India Winter Games started in 2020. Almost 1,000 athletes, including 306 women, participated in the inaugural edition. Participation has increased over the years, with more than 1,350 athletes in 2021 and over 1,500 in 2022, highlighting the growing attraction of the Games in J&K.
The 2023 iteration of KIWG saw the participation of over 1,200 participants, including more than 700 athletes, 141 support staff, 113 technical officials, 250-plus volunteers, and sports-specific volunteers, with a total of 136 medals at stake.
This was also the first time that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, along with the Sports Authority of India, managed the technical conduct of the Games in association with the National Sports Federations and Indian Olympic Association.

Title: Govt received over 60,000 inputs from citizens on new Income Tax Bill: FM
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 13:08:39 +0000
Content: The government received more than 60,000 inputs from citizens regarding the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.
Addressing a post-Budget event here, the Finance Minister said the review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has a significant component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘Jan Bhagidari.’
“The government’s emphasis post-Covid-19 pandemic has been to allocate funds for public expenditure in capital building. The perception that the focus has shifted from expenditure to consumption is not correct. Capital expenditure (Capex) has been enhanced, and simultaneously, we’ve provided relief in Personal Income Tax,” she said.
She introduced the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha last week, as part of the tax reforms to streamline and simplify provisions so that they are easier to understand and reduce the scope for legal disputes.
The Finance Minister also thanked PM Modi for being considerate in providing relief to taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum.
“We are committed to the fiscal deficit path set in the July Budget, aiming for below 4.5 percent,” she said.
Reforms aimed at boosting manufacturing, improving the Ease of Doing Business, and enhancing social infrastructure are all being maintained.
“We won’t stop with that. The momentum of reforms shall continue. Newer areas are also being opened up, and that’s why, in the last two years, we have seen investment in the space sector, nuclear sector, etc.,” the Finance Minister emphasized.
“I expect that even state governments will come forward to promote the Ease of Doing Business,” she added.
The Budget has not reduced sectoral allocations, and the effective capital expenditure for the next fiscal year is estimated at Rs 19.08 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.
The Finance Minister said that the effective capital expenditure works out to 4.3 percent of GDP in the Budget for 2025-26, while the fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent.

Title: UK offers peacekeeping troops to Ukraine ahead of Paris talks
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:49:26 +0000
Content: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the first European leader to say he is ready to put peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, making the commitment ahead of an emergency leaders’ meeting in Paris to discuss Europe’s role in a ceasefire.
Starmer’s comments underlined a growing realization among European nations that they will likely have to play a larger role in ensuring Ukraine’s security as Washington works alone with Russia on a potential end to the three-year conflict.
Sweden would consider contributing to post-war peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Monday, adding that negotiations would need to progress before any such decision was taken.
U.S. President Donald Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies last week when he announced he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, without consulting them, to discuss bringing an end to war.
That effort was due to advance with talks this week in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Saturday Europe would not have a seat at the table for any peace talks. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
At Monday’s summit in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was to host leaders from Germany, Italy, Britain, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, which will represent Baltic and Scandinavian countries, along with the European Union leadership and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
A French presidency official said the discussion would look at “the security guarantees that can be given by the Europeans and the Americans, together or separately,” with peacekeepers being just one element of the security guarantees.
Starmer, who is expected to travel to Washington to meet Trump next week, said on Sunday that Europe was facing a “once in a generation moment” for the collective security of the continent, and it must work closely with the United States.
He said Britain was ready to play a leading role in delivering security guarantees for Ukraine, including being ready to put “our own troops on the ground if necessary”.
“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
The European meeting in Paris is taking place after dozens of similar summits have shown the 27-nation EU to be unable to come up with a cohesive plan to end the Ukraine war. Britain is not an EU member but has been a leading supporter of Ukraine.
EUROPE NEEDS ‘TO DO MORE, BETTER’
A Ukrainian official told Reuters last week that only Britain and France had so far signalled any willingness to send troops at some point. However, that could be changing.
Sweden’s Kristersson said on Monday there was “absolutely a possibility” of sending peacekeeping forces.
“There needs to be a very clear mandate for those forces and I don’t think we can see that until we have come further in those negotiations,” he said on the sidelines of a military exercise in Stockholm.
A peacekeeping force would raise the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia and would stretch European militaries, whose arms stocks have been depleted supplying Ukraine, and who are used to relying heavily on U.S. support for major missions.
The French presidency official said Europe needs “to do more, better and in a coherent manner for our collective security.” However, some countries were unhappy that the Paris meeting was not a full EU summit, EU officials said.
The French presidency official said the meeting would facilitate future discussions in Brussels and at NATO.

Title: Champions Trophy will rekindle Pakistan’s love of cricket, say former captains
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Cricket fans in Pakistan are buzzing ahead of the Champions Trophy and hosting the elite one-day international tournament will rekindle the country’s love affair with the sport, three former captains said.
The event, which features the sport’s top eight sides in the ODI format, begins on Wednesday with the hosts up against New Zealand in Karachi.
It will be the first major global tournament hosted by Pakistan in nearly 30 years and former batting great Inzamam Ul Haq told Reuters there was no escaping the excitement in the lead-up to the event.
“Right now everyone is talking about the Champions Trophy, in schools, houses, markets, offices, everywhere,” he added.
Pakistan spent nearly a decade in the wilderness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team’s bus in Lahore in 2009, wounding six players.
Top teams shunned Pakistan after the 2009 attack and it took the Pakistan Cricket Board years to convince foreign counterparts that it was safe to visit.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” Inzamam said. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The national team, captained for the bulk of those years by Misbah Ul Haq, hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates and remained relatively successful until fixtures trickled back onto Pakistani soil in 2018.
“For fans and young cricketers to see the stars playing live is a big deal,” said Misbah, Pakistan’s most successful test captain. “Not having that meant the whole cricket machinery was jammed.”
Former captain Aamer Sohail said the connection between fans and players was evident at Wednesday’s warm-up game against South Africa where Pakistan reeled in the visitors’ 352 to complete their highest successful ODI run chase.
“What was heartening in yesterday’s game is that people turned up and then the players turned up. It was kind of reciprocating, wasn’t it?” added Sohail.
The Champions Trophy was discontinued by the International Cricket Council after the eighth edition in 2017, when Sarfaraz Ahmed’s Pakistan beat India in the final.
Should both teams reach the title decider when it returns to the calendar, Pakistan will not have the advantage of playing at home as India are playing all their matches in Dubai due to political tensions.
“A Pakistan-India match is not just a game of cricket, it’s a game of expectations, of emotions,” said Misbah.
Inzamam recalled a 2004 ODI against India in Karachi where he scored a thrilling hundred in a losing chase.
“I got a standing ovation but so did the Indian team for their performance,” he said. “Supporters from both sides would have wanted to see this match.”
Sohail will forever be remembered for one of the most famous on-field spats with Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad in the 1996 World Cup quarter-finals, the last major event played in Pakistan.
“It’s not just important for both the countries, I think this rivalry is important for international cricket,” he said. (Reuters)

Title: India’s Matsya-6000 Deep-Ocean Submersible clears wet tests
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:08:49 +0000
Content: India’s fourth-generation deep-ocean submersible, Matsya-6000, has successfully completed its wet testing at the harbor, marking a significant step towards conducting shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025, as per an official statement released on Monday.
Matsya-6000 is equipped with several innovative subsystems that ensure its functionality in the deep ocean environment. Key features include a main ballast system for diving, thrusters for movement in all directions, a battery bank for power supply, and syntactic foam for buoyancy. It also boasts advanced control hardware, software, and sophisticated underwater navigation devices. Communication is facilitated through an acoustic modem, underwater telephone, VHF for surface communication, and GPS for precise location tracking.
The submersible’s interior is designed with human life-support systems, along with displays for critical environmental parameters, navigation joysticks for maneuvering, and various oceanographic sensors. Underwater lighting and cameras are integrated into the exterior, all subsystems being indigenously designed and undergoing rigorous testing.
Following the completion of its design phase, Matsya underwent comprehensive dry tests at a 500-meter operational range. These tests, which were conducted to assess the submersible’s integration and performance, proved successful, allowing the submersible to be transported to the L&T Shipbuilding facility at Kattupalli Port near Chennai for wet tests between January 27 and February 12.
Although the restricted water depth in the harbor hindered underwater voice communication, the tests confirmed that Matsya-6000 is on track for future demonstrations in deeper waters. The successful completion of the tests at Kattupalli Port has raised confidence that the submersible will be ready for shallow-water demonstrations at depths of up to 500 meters by the end of 2025.
Under the government’s Deep Ocean Mission initiatives, the Ministry of Earth Sciences has entrusted the National Institute of Ocean Technology with the ambitious task of designing and developing the Matsya-6000, as part of the Samudrayan Project.

Title: Blow for Singapore opposition as court finds leader guilty of lying to parliament
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:07:30 +0000
Content: A Singapore court on Monday found opposition party leader Pritam Singh guilty on two counts of lying to parliament, handing down fines that spared him a loss of his seat and a ban from this year’s general election.
Singh, leader of the Workers’ Party, received two fines of S$7,000 ($5,231), which were below the threshold of S$10,000 per offence outlined in the constitution for a lawmaker to lose their seat and be barred from public office for five years.
Singh, 48, said the verdict was disappointing and he would appeal the decision.
The ruling could dent the image of the Workers’ Party as it gears up for a general election due by November this year, having made inroads against the ruling People’s Action Party in the last contest in 2020, when it expanded its parliamentary seats to 10 from six.
The Workers’ Party has since suffered blows from the resignations of two lawmakers, one over a false statement to parliament and another stepping down over an extramarital affair.
‘NUMEROUS OBSTACLES’
The charges against Singh stemmed from allegations he gave false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, lying to parliament.
Singh had maintained he had urged Khan to own up to parliament about her lie, but Judge Luke Tan on Monday said there was ample evidence and witness testimony to prove otherwise.
“Ms Khan admitted to other WP leaders she had lied, there was absolutely no follow-up from the accused,” Tan told the court. “This could only be because the accused had mentioned that this, and quote, was ‘probably something we would have to take to the grave’.”
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s People’s Action Party is almost certain to dominate and win most seats in the upcoming election, as it has in every vote since independence in 1965, although its share of the popular vote will be closely watched after one of its worst electoral performances in 2020.
Wong is set to deliver his budget speech on Tuesday, expected to focus on cost of living issues, employment and housing, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected growth last year and lower inflation.
Opposition leader Singh said Monday’s verdict would not dent his party’s morale ahead of the election.
“I leave it to the public again to determine how they want to exercise their vote in what we in the Workers’ Party believe is the need of the hour in Singapore, which is the evolution towards a more balanced political system,” he told reporters.
“We have met with numerous obstacles in the course of our political lives. We have shown resilience and in that regard, this case won’t be any different.”

Title: Elon Musk’s Tesla kicks off hiring in India amid strengthening ties with government
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:32:05 +0000
Content: Elon Musk-owned Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has officially begun its hiring process in India, marking a significant step towards its long-anticipated entry into the domestic market.
On Monday, the electric vehicle (EV) giant posted a job listing on LinkedIn for the position of Consumer Engagement Manager in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The role is a full-time, on-site position, indicating Tesla’s commitment to building a direct presence in the country. https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4155877322/
Tesla’s latest hiring activity aligns with its broader strategy to expand in India. The company has recently posted a total of 13 job openings, covering both customer-facing and operational roles.
This development follows a crucial meeting between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 14 in Washington DC.
The discussions between the two centered on strengthening India-US collaboration in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and sustainable development. The two also explored emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and governance–areas that align with Tesla’s vision for India.
Tesla, a global leader in electric mobility and renewable energy, has had a limited presence in India but has been considering an expansion for years.
With the latest job postings, the company is taking concrete steps to establish itself in the world’s third-largest automobile market.
Industry experts believe Tesla’s hiring push could be a precursor to the company setting up sales and service operations, and eventually manufacturing in India.
The move aligns with the Indian government’s push for electric vehicle adoption and local manufacturing, supported by incentives under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
While Tesla has not provided an official timeline for its India launch, its active hiring suggests that preparations are in full swing.
In December, Musk revealed that Starlink’s satellite internet services were non-operational in India following the confiscation of two of the company’s devices by authorities–one from an area affected by armed conflict and the other from a region linked to drug smuggling.
Additionally, Musk has been advocating for a reduction in tariffs on Tesla’s electric vehicles. He expressed willingness to export Tesla’s affordable EV models to India, contingent on the country lowering its import duties.

Title: Indian graduates show strong aptitude for AI, ML Roles: Report
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:21:53 +0000
Content: Indian graduates are demonstrating a strong aptitude for roles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), according to a report released on Tuesday.
The report, by talent assessment firm Mercer Mettl, revealed that Indian graduates have a 46.1% employability rate in AI and ML – the highest among all technical roles.
Covering data from more than 2,700 campuses and over 1 million learners, the report presents a complex landscape marked by both promising adaptability and persistent skill gaps.
It also found that 50% of graduates in India possess the soft skills required for AI/GenAI collaboration, though they need to improve in areas like creativity (44.3% employability). Strong areas include communication skills (55.1%), critical thinking (54.6%), and leadership skills (54.2%). With a 46% employability rate, learning agility remains crucial for navigating the evolving tech landscape.
Further, the report showed that graduates from Tier 1 colleges lead in employability (48.4%), followed by those from Tier 2 (46.1%) and Tier 3 (43.4%) institutions. However, the potential exists across all tiers, particularly in specialized tech areas. Tier 2 graduates excel in UI/UX developer roles, with a 58.3% employability rate.
Delhi reported the highest employability rate (53.4%), followed by Himachal Pradesh and Punjab (51.1%). Uttarakhand and Jharkhand also performed well, with rates of 50% and 49.6%, respectively.
Notably, the report found equal employability for male and female graduates in AI, ML, and data science sectors. However, disparities were noted in software testing.
“In 2025, the employability rate for Indian graduates stands at 42.6%, reflecting a slight decline from 44.3% in 2023, primarily due to evolving industry expectations. However, significant progress has been made in employability for technical roles, as colleges and students increasingly focus on developing skills that align with market demands,” said Siddhartha Gupta, President of Mercer India.
“On the other hand, developing certain non-technical and soft skills presents a more complex learning curve, often requiring additional time to cultivate. This data clearly highlights these trends,” he added.

Title: Champions Trophy: NZ pacer Ferguson ruled out with foot injury, Jamieson named replacement
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:15:23 +0000
Content: New Zealand suffered another injury blow ahead of their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign as the fast bowler Lockie Ferguson has been ruled out of the tournament with a foot injury.
Ferguson felt some pain in his right foot after bowling a spell in the informal warm-up match against Afghanistan in Karachi on Sunday and an initial medical assessment indicated he would not be fit enough to take part in the entire tournament.
Given the proximity to the start of the Champions Trophy and the short nature of the tournament, the decision was made to send Ferguson home to begin rehabilitation, the New Zealand Cricket said.
It added that fast bowler Kyle Jamieson will replace Ferguson in the squad and will depart for Pakistan this evening.
The Event Technical Committee of the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 has approved Jamieson as a replacement for Ferguson in the New Zealand squad.
Jamieson returned to domestic cricket for the Canterbury Kings in the Super Smash in December, following a 10-month stint on the sideline rehabilitating a stress fracture in his back.
He played a key role as the Kings reached the Grand Final, finishing as the competition’s joint second-leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets, including figures of 4-12 against the Central Stags at Hagley Oval.
He featured in Canterbury’s Round 8 Ford Trophy match against the Central Stags last week as well as Round 9 win over Northern Districts in Hamilton.
Ferguson became the second Kiwi to be ruled out of the mega event, as New Zealand already lost pacer Ben Sears due to a hamstring injury earlier this week with seamer Jacob Duffy coming in as a replacement.
New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said it was tough news for Ferguson and the team.
“We’re really disappointed for Lockie,” said Stead. “Lockie is a key part of the bowling group and brings a lot of major tournament experience and we know how much he was looking forward to representing New Zealand at another major event. We wish him well for his recovery and hope he is back firing soon.”
Stead said Jamieson’s unique skillset made him an effective replacement for Ferguson.
“Kyle brings plenty of pace and extra bounce which will suit the conditions here in Pakistan. He’s shown since returning in the Dream11 Super Smash how effective he can be in the shorter forms of the game, and he’s bowled with real pace and energy which is what you’re looking for from a pace bowler, especially at a pinnacle event.
“We’ve been pleased with the progress he’s made since returning and we feel his loading over the past few weeks and his successful spells in the recent Ford Trophy match mean he will be good to go if required in the tournament,” Stead added.
New Zealand will begin their against the hosts Pakistan in Karachi in the tournament opener on Wednesday.
New Zealand squad: Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young.

Title: US tariffs on steel sector unlikely to impact India materially: Crisil
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:05:50 +0000
Content: The US tariffs on the steel sector are unlikely to impact India significantly, as only 2 percent of the country’s total finished steel exports in the first nine months of this fiscal year were to the US, according to Crisil Intelligence.
The US has decided to impose a flat 25 percent tariff on steel imports from March 12, replacing the previous system of multiple lesser levies. This change is expected to have a three-fold impact.
“Firstly, it will reduce the exports of its trade partners as local production increases. However, India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only 2 percent of its total finished steel exports in the first nine months of this fiscal year were to the US,” said Sehul Bhatt, Director-Research at Crisil Intelligence.
Secondly, the tariffs may lead to the diversion of exporter inventory to other importing nations at competitive prices, especially in an environment of increasing global competition. This could further lower steel prices in India, which are already trending at four-year lows.
“This means the Indian government may need to intervene with safeguard duties to support domestic capacities. The timing and magnitude of such action will be critical,” Bhatt noted.
Thirdly, the increased production by US mills will likely reduce the availability of steel scrap for exports. This is because about 70 percent of the steel industry in the US uses the electric arc furnace process, which relies on scrap to produce steel. Currently, India sources around 14-15 percent of its scrap requirements from the US.
Key import sources for the US include Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea. In 2024, the US saw a sharp rise in steel exports from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Brazil.
While the US tariffs may open up a portion of the US market for India’s steel exports, the surplus steel produced by Japan and South Korea may be diverted to the Indian market, according to a recent ICRA report.

Title: Russia’s sovereign wealth chief says Trump is a problem solver ahead of high-level talks
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 07:05:04 +0000
Content: The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund on Tuesday described U.S. President Donald Trump as a problem solver ahead of U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia in what are expected to be the most significant discussions between the two former Cold War foes on ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
The conversation could pave the way for a summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as the two sides discuss restoring Russian-American relations.
“We really see that President Trump and his team is a team of problem solvers, people who have already addressed a number of big challenges very swiftly, very efficiently and very successfully,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Riyadh.
Russia said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on Tuesday that will focus on ending the Ukraine war and restoring “the whole complex” of Russia-U.S. ties.
Ukraine says no peace deal can be made on its behalf in the talks, to which Kyiv was not invited.
Dmitriev, a U.S.-educated former Goldman Sachs banker, played a role in early contacts between Moscow and Washington during Trump’s first term as president from 2016-2020.
Russia hopes that the United States will hear Moscow’s position in the talks on Ukraine, Interfax news agency cited Dmitriev as saying.
Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said on Monday that Dmitriev might join the delegation to discuss any economic questions that might arise.
“It’s very important to understand that U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from you know what’s happening right now, and we believe as a way forward is through solutions,” Dmitriev said.
The talks come after European leaders gathered in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to agree on a unified strategy after they were blindsided by Trump’s push for immediate talks on Ukraine after a phone call with Putin last week.
The European leaders said they would invest more in defence and take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.
“Everyone feels the great sense of urgency,” Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X. “At this crucial time for the security of Europe we must continue to stand behind Ukraine.”
“Europe will have to make a contribution towards safeguarding any agreement, and cooperation with the Americans is essential,” he said.
INITIAL CONTACT
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov on Tuesday, a foreign policy advisor to Putin, in Riyadh, officials from both sides said.
The meeting comes barely a month after Trump took office and reflects a significant departure from Washington’s position under the administration of President Joe Biden, who eschewed public contacts, concluding that Russia was not serious about ending the Ukraine war.
Russia, which has occupied parts of Ukraine since 2014, launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022.
U.S. officials sought to cast Tuesday’s talks as an initial contact to determine whether Moscow is serious about ending the war in Ukraine.
“This is a follow-up on that initial conversation between Putin and President Trump about perhaps if that first step is even possible, what the interests are, if this can be managed,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters in Riyadh.
The Kremlin, however, suggested the discussions would cover “the entire complex of Russian-American relations”, as well as preparing for talks on a possible settlement regarding Ukraine and a meeting between the two presidents.
Russia said Lavrov and Rubio in a call on Saturday discussed removing barriers to trade and investment between the two countries.
Then-President Biden and Kyiv’s allies around the world imposed waves of sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine three years ago, aimed at weakening the Russian economy and limiting the Kremlin’s war efforts.
Riyadh, which is also involved in talks with Washington over the future of the Gaza Strip, has played a role in early contacts between the Trump administration and Moscow, helping to secure a prisoner swap last week.
HOW TO ENGAGE WASHINGTON
It remains unclear how Europe will engage Washington after Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies by calling Putin, long ostracised by the West.
“We agree with President Trump on a “peace through strength” approach,” a European official said after the Paris meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. decision has sparked a realisation among European nations that they will have to do more to ensure Ukraine’s security.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who before the meeting said he was willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, said on Monday there must be a U.S. security commitment for European countries to put boots on the ground.
Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, said he would visit Ukraine from Wednesday and was asked if the U.S. would provide a security guarantee for any European peacekeepers.
“I’ve been with President Trump, and the policy has always been: You take no options off the table,” he said.

Title: India-Qatar partnership to focus on sustainability, technology, and energy, says Piyush Goyal
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 06:10:07 +0000
Content: The future partnership between India and Qatar will be grounded in the areas of sustainability, technology, entrepreneurship, and energy, according to Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal. Speaking at the inaugural session of the India-Qatar Business Forum in New Delhi, Goyal outlined the evolving nature of the bilateral relationship, highlighting how it is expanding beyond traditional trade to embrace new technologies and opportunities.
The Minister emphasized that the India-Qatar partnership is built on a foundation of trust, trade, and tradition. As global trade terms change, the focus is shifting from energy-based exchanges to cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), quantum computing, and semiconductors. Goyal noted that this shift comes at a time when the world is grappling with geopolitical tensions, climate change, cybersecurity challenges, and a growing emphasis on localization.
Goyal said that India and Qatar have complementary strengths and can collaborate to foster prosperity and a shared future. He highlighted the recent signing of two memorandums of understanding (MoUs): one between the Qatari Businessmen Association (QBA) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and another between Invest Qatar and Invest India. He also announced the elevation of the Joint Working Group on trade and commerce to the Ministerial level.
The Minister referenced Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement, “Today, be it major nations or global platforms, the confidence in India is stronger than ever before,” urging business leaders to carry forward this spirit of collaboration and confidence. He added that India offers a dynamic economy, a youthful population, continuous reforms, and a strong focus on ease of doing business and industrial growth.
Goyal extended an invitation to Qatari companies to explore opportunities in India’s expanding sectors such as investments, manufacturing, renewable energy, smart cities, and infrastructure. With both Qatar Vision 2030 and India’s Viksit Bharat 2047, the two nations are poised to build a brighter future for their people, Goyal added.

Title: Indian stocks could see revival soon, global factors are the key: Morgan Stanley
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:56:06 +0000
Content: Global brokerage Morgan Stanley has indicated that Indian stocks could experience a revival soon, though global factors will be crucial to this outcome.
In its latest note, analysts at Morgan Stanley acknowledged that while catching the market bottom is challenging, “buying Indian equities could prove rewarding.”
The brokerage noted that India is emerging from a period of slow growth in recent months, with global conditions improving. Stocks are now priced lower than they have been since the Covid-19 bottom.
The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex have fallen by 13.3% and 11.7%, respectively, from their previous peaks.
Morgan Stanley also highlighted that the Union Budget is supportive of growth, with rising capital expenditure and reduced subsidy expenditure. The Reserve Bank of India’s rate cut and liquidity measures are expected to provide additional support. The note further emphasized that a series of tax reforms in India should encourage foreign direct investment.
Crude oil prices have weakened, and geopolitical conditions are improving with the likely fading of conflicts. “The dollar has corrected, and India’s real effective exchange rate has declined,” the note added.
Morgan Stanley anticipates that India will resume its outperformance relative to emerging markets in the coming months, although this is “subject to global cues not surprising negatively.”
The brokerage pointed to strong macroeconomic stability, improving terms of trade, and projected mid- to high-teen earnings growth annually over the next three to five years as key fundamentals driving potential upside. A reliable source of domestic risk capital is also seen as a positive factor.
In a separate report last week, Morgan Stanley noted that the direct impact of reciprocal tariff hikes by the US will likely be manageable. However, the indirect effect—through uncertainty weighing on business confidence—is seen as more concerning.
Nevertheless, the brokerage maintained that domestic policy will remain supportive of growth, and additional measures will be taken if downside risks emerge.

Title: Djokovic claims the majority of players feel ‘favouritism’ in Sinner’s doping ban
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:53:52 +0000
Content: Serbian tennis great Novak Djokovic has claimed that the majority of players are not happy with the way the whole process is handled in the case of world no.1 Jannik Sinner’s three-month doping ban.
Sinner has reached a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which will see the Italian serve a three-month ban.
WADA has accepted that Sinner did not intend to cheat and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of the negligence of members of his entourage.
Djokovic claimed that the majority of players believe Sinner was shown “favouritism” with his three-month doping ban.
“There’s a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled,” Djokovic was quoted by The Guardian.
“A majority of the players don’t feel it’s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player if you have access to the top lawyer,” he said.
The case involving Sinner was the first of two prominent incidents in tennis that occurred in rapid succession. In November, world No. 2 in women’s tennis Iga Swiatek received a one-month suspension following a positive test for trimetazidine, a medication prescribed for angina.
The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) acknowledged that the positive result was due to contamination from a medication Swiatek had been using to alleviate jet lag.
In contrast, former world No. 1 Simona Halep received a four-year ban from the ITIA in 2022 following a positive test, although this penalty was subsequently reduced to nine months.
Djokovic further highlighted the “inconsistencies” in the anti-doping system and called it “unfair”.
“Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have got the ban for years … there is so many inconsistencies between the cases,” said Djokovic.
“Sinner has got a suspension for three months because of mistakes and negligence of his team members, who are working on the tour. This is also something that I personally and many other players find strange.
“Now it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously don’t work for anti-doping, it’s obvious. I hope that shortly the governing bodies are going to come together and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes. It’s inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair,” he added.

Title: PM Fasal Bima Yojana turns nine: Rs 1.75 lakh crore in claims disbursed to 23.22 crore farmers
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 05:28:46 +0000
Content: The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), a scheme providing comprehensive coverage for farmers against crop losses caused by unpredictable natural disasters, has disbursed Rs 1.75 lakh crore in claims to more than 23.22 crore farmers over the past nine years, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
Launched in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMFBY has played a crucial role in stabilizing farmers’ incomes while promoting the adoption of innovative agricultural practices.
The scheme witnessed a 25% growth in farmer enrolment in 2023-24 compared to the previous year, demonstrating its growing popularity.
The Union Cabinet, recognizing PMFBY’s impact, approved its continuation along with the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) till 2025-26, with a budget of Rs.69,515.71 crore. RWBCIS, introduced alongside PMFBY, is a weather index-based scheme that complements PMFBY’s crop insurance approach.
Technological Advancements in PMFBY
PMFBY integrates advanced technology, including satellite imagery, drones, and remote sensing, to enhance transparency and accuracy in crop area estimation, yield disputes, and loss assessments. The introduction of YES-TECH (Yield Estimation System Based on Technology) from Kharif 2023 allows for more accurate yield loss assessments, blending technology-based and manual estimates to improve claim settlements.
Key Benefits of PMFBY
Farmers pay an affordable premium of 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi crops, and 5% for horticultural or commercial crops, with the remaining premium subsidized by the government. PMFBY covers a wide range of risks, including natural disasters, pests, diseases, and post-harvest losses due to local calamities like hailstorms and landslides. Claims are processed within two months of harvest to provide timely compensation, preventing farmers from falling into debt traps.
Risks Covered by PMFBY
The scheme provides insurance for yield losses due to natural disasters, pests, and diseases. Farmers prevented from sowing due to adverse weather conditions are eligible for indemnity claims of up to 25% of the sum insured. Post-harvest losses are covered for up to 14 days after harvest, and localized hazards like hailstorms or landslides affecting individual farms are also insured.
Strengthening PMFBY
Since its launch, the government has made several interventions to enhance transparency and accountability, resulting in record-high farmer participation in 2023-24. The scheme is now the largest crop insurance program in the world, with some states further reducing farmers’ premium burdens by waiving their share.
Achievements of PMFBY
The scheme has paid out Rs.1.75 lakh crore in claims since its inception and has been implemented across 23 states and Union Territories. In 2023-24, non-loanee farmers’ coverage increased to 55% of the total coverage, highlighting the growing voluntary adoption of the scheme. The total sum insured stands at Rs.17.29 lakh crore.

Title: BJP sweeps Gujarat local body polls
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:14:33 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again asserted its dominance in Gujarat’s local body elections, securing a decisive victory in the Junagadh Municipal Corporation by winning 48 out of 60 seats in the February 16 polls.
According to the State Election Commission (SEC), eight seats were won unopposed by the BJP before polling began, while voting took place for the remaining 52 seats. Out of these, the BJP clinched 40 seats, while the main opposition party secured 11 seats, and one independent candidate emerged victorious from Ward No. 9.
In Sanand Municipality, elections were held for 27 out of 28 seats, with one seat won unopposed by the BJP before polling. Out of the 27 contested seats, the BJP secured 24, while the Congress managed to win only three.
Meanwhile, in Bavla Municipality, the BJP reached the halfway mark of 14 out of 28 seats, while the Congress secured 13 seats, and one seat went to a BSP candidate. This close contest could lead to an interesting political scenario in Bavla, as no party has achieved a clear majority yet.
The third municipality in Ahmedabad district, Dhandhuka, also went to the polls, but its results were still awaited, according to the State Election Commission.
In Dakor Municipality, a political deadlock emerged as the BJP secured 12 seats, while independent candidates won 14 seats, leaving no party with a clear majority. The Congress failed to win a single seat in Dakor, marking a significant setback for the opposition in this region.
Additionally, the BJP swept the district panchayat by-elections, winning all nine seats across Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Panchmahal, Dahod, Bharuch, Dangs, and Botad. Notably, in Panchmahal, the BJP candidate won unopposed.
These local body elections were also significant as they marked the first implementation of newly introduced reservation policies for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in several local bodies.

Title: IPL 2025 full squads and fixtures: how every team lines up
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:19:05 +0000
Content: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket tournament organised by the Indian board (BCCI).
First held in 2008, it quickly became the most lucrative cricket competition in the world, with a brand value of $12 billion, according to a December 2024 report by brand valuation consultancy firm Brand Finance.
Here is what you need to know about the 18th edition of the competition, which kicks off next month:
WHEN IS THE IPL HAPPENING?
* The 18th edition of the IPL runs from March 22 to May 25.
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE IPL?
* The 10 participating teams are split into two groups. Each team play twice, home and away, against other teams in the group and the team in the same row in the other group, along with one match each against the remaining four teams from the opposite group, totalling 14 matches in the group stage.
* The top four teams in a unified points table will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams will play each other in ‘Qualifier 1,’ with the winner reaching the final.
* The teams placed third and fourth will compete in the ‘Eliminator’ match where the winner will progress to ‘Qualifier 2,’ taking on the loser of ‘Qualifier 1’ for a place in the final.
* Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, and Punjab Kings are in Group 1. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Lucknow Super Giants are in Group 2.
WHERE IS THE IPL TAKING PLACE?
* The IPL is held in the home cities of the franchises based across India. However, some teams may choose to split their home games between two or more cities.
* The 2025 edition will be played across 13 venues.
* Eden Gardens, the home ground of defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders, will host the opening game, ‘Qualifier 2’ and the final. Sunrisers Hyderabad, who finished second in the table last season, will host the ‘Qualifier 1’ and ‘Eliminator’ matches.
WHO IS INVOLVED IN IPL 2025?
* Some of the biggest names in cricket from around the world will be in action, with England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler fetching the highest price for an overseas player at 157.5 million Indian rupees ($1.81 million) at the player auction in November, joining Gujarat Titans.
* The teams spent over $72.51 million at the auction, with Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, signed by Lucknow Super Giants for $3.11 million, earning the highest price tag.
* World Cup-winning Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has retired from international cricket, will play for Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who both retired from international T20 cricket after India won the 20-over World Cup last year, will also be in action for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, respectively.
* Some former greats of the sport, who are present in the competition as coaches, are Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, and Stephen Fleming coaching Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chennai, respectively.
* Players from India’s politically estranged rivals Pakistan have not played in the IPL since its opening edition in 2008.
Pakistan’s government barred its players from participating in IPL 2009, citing security concerns amid tense relations after the Mumbai militant attacks in November 2008.
Although Pakistan’s authorities cleared their players to participate in the next edition, Pakistani players were snubbed from IPL 2010 and have not featured in the competition since.

Title: South Korea’s parliament presses for Yoon’s removal as impeachment trial winds down
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:44:33 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol could try to impose martial law again or undermine constitutional institutions should he be reinstated, lawyers for parliament argued on Tuesday as his impeachment trial entered its final phase.
After weeks of testimony by high-ranking current and former officials, including some facing criminal charges for their role in the brief imposition of martial law on December 3, lawyers for both sides summarised their arguments and evidence at the Constitutional Court.
“Declaring martial law in a situation that doesn’t fit a national emergency is a declaration of dictatorship and military rule,” Kim Jin-han, a lawyer for the parliament, told the justices.
He cited pro-Yoon protesters who stormed a different court in January.
“If he returns to work, we don’t know if he will again exercise martial law,” Kim said. “If he returns to work, we can’t rule out the possibility that he will attack other state and constitutional institutions.”
The Constitutional Court is due to hold another hearing to question three more witnesses on Thursday, including the impeached prime minister and the former police chief.
The court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. If he is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon has argued that he had a right as president to issue his martial law decree, which lasted around six hours before he rescinded it in the face of parliamentary opposition. He said the move was also justified by political deadlock and threats from “anti-state forces” sympathetic to North Korea.
His case at the Constitutional Court has also included arguments that he never actually intended to stop parliament from operating, even though the order was publicly declared and troops and police were deployed to the legislature.
Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission and later said the decree was necessary in part because the NEC had been unwilling to address concerns over election hacking, a claim rejected by election officials.
Prosecutors have also indicted Yoon on separate criminal charges of leading an insurrection. He was arrested last month and is being held at a detention centre.
The first preparatory hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday.
Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.

Title: Indian players have potential to play in Europe, says MBSG defender Tom Aldred
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:27:43 +0000
Content: Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) are one step away from a consecutive Indian Super League (ISL) title, thanks largely to a defensive unit that excels at both ends of the pitch.
With 14 of the team’s 42 goals coming from defenders this season, an ISL record, the team has set a new benchmark for contributions from the backline, also bettering the previous best of eight by Chennaiyin FC in 2017-18.
Tom Aldred, a new addition to the team from the A-League, has bagged two goals and his 13 blocks have been the highest by any Mohun Bagan Super Giant player this term.
In discussing his move to the Mariners, Aldred spoke highly about the quality of the ISL and the quality of Indian players.
“There are some very good players here. From what I have seen so far at Mohun Bagan Super Giant, the Indian players are a very good group. I have had conversations with some of the foreign players about how Indian players could play in Europe. I feel their levels are very good,” he said.
Coming on the back of spells in England, Scotland, and Australia, Aldred’s praise shows the potential that has inspired the Mohun Bagan Super Giant backline to flourish.
Subhasish Bose has spearheaded their charge on this front with aplomb, recording six goals this season, which is the highest ever by a defender in a single ISL campaign. His attacking prowess has caught opponents off-guard especially from set pieces, since he has won 52 aerial duels, and accurate positioning has allowed him to deliver rich rewards. Bose has not only made a mark on the scoresheet but also thrived defensively, notching seven interceptions in a game against Hyderabad FC, which is a league-high in a single match by any player in 2024-25. He has won the fourth-most tackles (39) and notched the second-most interceptions (43) in the league too.
Equally impressive has been Alberto Rodriguez, who has chimed in with five goals. Four of those strikes have come from corners, spotlighting the team’s effectiveness from the dead ball. Subhasish and Rodriguez are in fact their top two scorers so far, only behind Jamie Maclaren’s 10 strikes. The Spaniard’s physical prowess and well-timed runs have made him a threatening presence in the opposition’s penalty zone.
Another player who has excelled for the Mariners so far is Dippendu Biswas, who has become a regular in the playing XI in ISL 2024-25. Partnering Bose, Aldred, and Rodriguez in the backline, Biswas has made 11 appearances and averaged 33 passes per game at 81% accuracy. The 21-year-old has also won 13 tackles, 36 duels, 31 recoveries, made 28 clearances; and scored once and assisted twice – blending his youthful exuberance seamlessly with the experience prevalent in the defence.
Beyond these performances, what truly sets Mohun Bagan Super Giant’s defence apart is their collective solidity. Thirteen clean sheets in 21 matches and just 14 goals conceded display how well organised and disciplined the unit is. Whether it is Subhasish, Rodriguez, and Aldred combining centrally at times by taking turns or the wider defenders stepping up to support the attack, the cohesion has been successful throughout the season.

Title: India-Qatar business forum eyes growth in tech, diversification beyond energy
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:21:04 +0000
Content: The India-Qatar Joint Business Forum was held on Tuesday in New Delhi, coinciding with the visit of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Amir of Qatar. Organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in partnership with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the forum focused on expanding economic collaboration between the two nations.
Union Minister Piyush Goyal, in his address at the inaugural session, outlined India’s ambition to become a USD 30-35 trillion economy by 2047. He said that while energy trade remains a critical part of India-Qatar relations, future growth lies in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, the Internet of Things, and semiconductors.
He also invited Qatari businesses to explore investment opportunities in India, particularly in the Gujarat International Finance Tech-City (GIFT City), and proposed the establishment of a Joint Working Group to identify mutual sectors of interest.
Sheikh Faisal bin Thani bin Faisal Al Thani, Minister of Commerce and Industry, State of Qatar, underscored the enduring relationship between India and Qatar, which has seen India emerge as Qatar’s third-largest trading partner. He called for increased investment opportunities between the two countries, particularly in Qatar’s expanding economy and infrastructure.
India’s economic growth was also highlighted by Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada, who pointed to the USD 709 billion in foreign direct investment India has attracted over the last decade. He emphasized India’s leadership in technology, with over 155,000 startups across various industries.
Prasada also mentioned the role of digital initiatives, like India Stack, in advancing financial inclusion and expanding access to digital services. The partnership between Qatar National Bank (QNB) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is one such initiative, aiming to enhance digital payments through QR Code-based UPI transactions.
Dr. Ahmad Al-Sayed, Minister of State for Foreign Trade Affairs, Qatar, stressed the need for further diversification of collaboration beyond the energy sector. He pointed to growing opportunities in electric vehicles, manufacturing, and non-oil industries. Qatar’s efforts, including the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) and Qatar Science & Technology Park, were also highlighted as part of the country’s broader strategy to foster business and innovation.
With bilateral trade exceeding USD 15 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, investment flows between India and Qatar are increasing, with Qatar now ranking among the top three GCC investors in India. To build on this momentum, two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed between CII and the Qatar Business Association, as well as between Invest India and Invest Qatar.
Sanjiv, Joint Secretary of DPIIT, emphasized the importance of the India-Qatar business delegation in fostering stronger ties, and invited Qatari participation in the Startup India Mahakumbh 2025, scheduled for April 3-5.

Title: Delhi LG chairs high level meeting regarding Summer Action Plan
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:17:19 +0000
Content: Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena chaired a high-level meeting on Tuesday with senior officials from various departments of the Delhi government, including the Delhi Jal Board, to review the Summer Action Plan aimed at ensuring uninterrupted water supply for Delhiites amid the approaching summer heat.
The meeting, held at the LG Secretariat, focused on measures to prevent water shortages during peak summer months. A key point of discussion was initiating talks with Haryana to ensure sufficient water supply from May to June, according to a statement from the LG’s office.
The review also covered progress on cleaning the Yamuna River. The LG emphasized the implementation of a ‘four-pronged strategy’ to combat pollution in the river. According to the statement, the action plan begins with removing trash, garbage, and silt from the Yamuna stream. Concurrently, cleaning operations will commence in the Najafgarh Drain, Supplementary Drain, and other major drains contributing to river pollution.
Additionally, the LG’s office outlined steps to address wastewater treatment. A daily watch on the performance of existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) will be maintained, ensuring they operate at full capacity. To bridge the shortfall in treating approximately 400 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage, a time-bound plan for constructing new STPs and decentralized STPs (DSTPs) will be implemented and operationalized.
The LG has set a three-year timeline for cleaning the Yamuna River, underscoring the importance of seamless coordination between various agencies, including the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) Department, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Environment Department, Public Works Department (PWD), and Delhi Development Authority (DDA).
To ensure accountability, the LG has directed weekly progress monitoring. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been instructed to maintain strict vigilance over the cleaning process and submit regular reports.
The renewed focus on Yamuna cleaning follows an earlier meeting between the LG and the Chief Secretary on February 16, during which an immediate directive was issued to deploy trash skimmers, weed harvesters, and dredge utility vehicles for cleaning the river.

Title: Sensex, Nifty end flat amid mixed global cues
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:48:30 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market traded within a narrow range on Tuesday, reflecting mixed signals from global markets. Despite intra-day fluctuations, the benchmark indices closed with marginal losses.
The Sensex touched a low of 75,531 during the session but recovered slightly, ending 29 points lower at 75,967. Similarly, the Nifty 50 moved between 22,801 and 22,992 before settling at 22,945, down 14 points from its previous close.
Among the top gainers in the Sensex 30 pack were power companies NTPC and Power Grid Corporation, which saw gains of up to 3%. Tech Mahindra, Zomato, HCL Technologies, and Kotak Mahindra Bank also performed well.
On the other hand, stocks like IndusInd Bank, Hindustan Unilever, UltraTech Cement, Mahindra & Mahindra, and TCS faced selling pressure, slipping between 1% and 2%.
On the Nifty index, NTPC led the gains with a 3.19% increase, while Tech Mahindra, Wipro, ONGC, and Apollo Hospital were other top gainers.
Meanwhile, Trent and Mahindra & Mahindra were among the top losers, slipping up to 2.5%.
Hrishikesh Yedve from Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd said: “As long as the index holds the recent low of 22,725, a buy-on-dips strategy remains favourable.”
He added that the 21-Day Simple Moving Average (DSMA) at 23,240 acts as an immediate hurdle, and a decisive move above this level could confirm a near-term bottom reversal.
The broader market showed signs of weakness, with the BSE SmallCap index declining nearly 1.5%. The Nifty Bank declined 196.25 points or 0.40% to end the intra-day session at 49,062.65.
Market sentiment remained bearish, as nearly 3,000 stocks on the BSE declined, while only around 1,000 stocks advanced.

Title: India and Qatar elevate bilateral ties to strategic partnership following PM Modi’s talks with Qatari Amir
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:45:16 +0000
Content: India and Qatar upgraded their bilateral relations to a ‘strategic partnership’ on Tuesday, with a focus on strengthening cooperation in trade, energy, investments, innovation, technology, food security, culture, and people-to-people ties.
The Agreement on the Establishment of a Strategic Partnership between the two nations was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of Qatar, at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. The Amir arrived in India on Monday for a two-day state visit.
A revised agreement aimed at avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion concerning income taxes was also signed, further deepening economic cooperation between the two countries.
Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, shared on X: “PM @narendramodi & HH Sheikh @TamimbinHamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, held wide-ranging talks at Hyderabad House today. Both leaders decided to elevate India-Qatar relations to a Strategic Partnership with focus on trade, energy, investments, innovation, technology, food security, culture & people-to-people ties.

Title: ‘Every game in this period is difficult’: Arne Slot ahead of Liverpool’s tricky run of fixtures
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:43:01 +0000
Content: The next nine days will be very vital in Liverpool’s title run, with the league leaders having to play away games against Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle United at Anfield Stadium.
With the point difference between Arne Slot’s side and second-placed Arsenal now at seven, the title is Liverpool’s to lose. In his pre-game conference, the Dutch head coach applauded the work done by Unai Emery at Aston Villa and stated with 13 games to go in the 2024-25 season, every game will be difficult.
“(They have) a very good manager (Unai Emery) who always has a very good game plan. He has brought in quite a lot of good players in the winter break, and they already had a very good team. They qualified for top eight in the Champions League, so it tells you it is a strong team we are going to face. Every game in this period for every team in the league is difficult,” said Slot.
Slot went further in-depth on one of Aston Villa’s winter transfer window signings, Marcus Rashford, who joined the Birmingham side from Liverpool’s biggest rivals Manchester United.
Rashford had fallen down the pecking order since the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim at the Red Devils with the English forward claiming he needed a ‘new challenge’ and the Portuguese head coach stating that he and Rashford had different ideas on how football should be played.
“The first time I faced him in real life was the USA tour and I was impressed. I was really impressed with how fast he is, how he has a nice height and is comfortable with the ball, so I think he is a very good player.
“I hope that he is going to show that at Villa. Of course, I am not hoping that he will do this tomorrow but I would be completely surprised if a player of his quality is not going to show it because he is a very good player in my opinion,” Slot added.

Title: US and Russia meet without Ukraine for first talks on ending war
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 09:47:16 +0000
Content: U.S. and Russian officials met on Tuesday in Riyadh for the highest-level talks to date between the two former Cold War foes on ending the war in Ukraine.
They were expected to discuss ways to end the three-year-old conflict in Ukraine and restore American-Russian relations. Their talks could pave the way for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
Ukraine, which is not attending, says no peace deal can be made on its behalf. “We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week.
European governments, alarmed at the possibility that Russia and the United States could sideline them from negotiations that will determine the future security of the continent, have also demanded a role in peace talks.
Media were allowed to film the two delegations before the start of the talks.
Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sat opposite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at a polished wooden table with three large white floral arrangements.
The officials ignored shouted questions from reporters asking whether the U.S. was sidelining the Ukrainians and what concessions Washington was demanding of Moscow.
Russia said the talks would focus on ending the war and restoring “the whole complex” of Russia-U.S. ties, which the Kremlin described as “below zero” under the previous administration of Joe Biden.
Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, told reporters in Riyadh: “We really see that President Trump and his team is a team of problem solvers, people who have already addressed a number of big challenges very swiftly, very efficiently and very successfully.”
Dmitriev, a U.S.-educated former Goldman Sachs banker, played a role in early contacts with Moscow during Trump’s first term as president from 2016-2020.
Ushakov said on Monday that Dmitriev might join the delegation to discuss economic questions.
“It’s very important to understand that U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from, you know, what’s happening right now,” Dmitriev said.
US TAKES NEW APPROACH TO RUSSIA UNDER TRUMP
European leaders had gathered in Paris on Monday for an emergency summit to agree on a unified strategy, after being blindsided by Trump’s push for immediate talks on Ukraine after a phone call with Putin last week.
The European leaders said they would invest more in defence and take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.
“Everyone feels the great sense of urgency,” Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said. “At this crucial time for the security of Europe we must continue to stand behind Ukraine.”
“Europe will have to make a contribution towards safeguarding any agreement, and cooperation with the Americans is essential.”
The meeting in Riyadh reflects a significant departure from Washington’s position under Biden, who eschewed public contacts, concluding that Russia was not serious about ending the war.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, having seized Crimea and fomented an insurgency in the east in 2014, and controls about a fifth of the country.
U.S. officials cast Tuesday’s talks as an initial contact to determine whether Moscow is serious about ending the war, after Putin and Trump spoke last Wednesday.
“This is a follow-up on that initial conversation between Putin and President Trump about perhaps if that first step is even possible, what the interests are, if this can be managed,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters in Riyadh.
The Kremlin, however, suggested the discussions would cover “the entire complex of Russian-American relations”, as well as preparing for talks on a settlement for Ukraine and a meeting between the two presidents.
Russia said Lavrov and Rubio in a call on Saturday discussed removing barriers to trade and investment.
EUROPE SEEKS TO RETAIN INFLUENCE AS US AND RUSSIA TALK
Then-president Biden and Kyiv’s allies around the world have imposed waves of sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, aimed at weakening Russia’s economy and its war effort.
Riyadh, which is also involved in talks with Washington over the future of the Gaza Strip, has played a role in early contacts between the Trump administration and Moscow, helping to secure a prisoner swap last week.
It remains unclear how Europe will engage Washington after Trump stunned Ukraine and European allies by calling Putin, long ostracised by the West.
“We agree with President Trump on a ‘peace through strength’ approach,” a European official said after the Paris meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. decision has sparked a realisation among European nations that they will have to do more to ensure Ukraine’s security.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who before the meeting said he was willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, said on Monday there must be a U.S. security “backstop” for European countries to put boots on the ground.
Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, said he would visit Ukraine from Wednesday and was asked if the U.S. would provide a security guarantee for any European peacekeepers.
“I’ve been with President Trump, and the policy has always been: You take no options off the table,” he said.

Title: Vatican cancels pope’s weekend engagements as he battles ‘complex’ infection
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 18:01:51 +0000
Content: Pope Francis, who is spending his fifth day in hospital for what doctors described as a “complex” respiratory infection, will not take part in this weekend’s Holy Year events, the Vatican said on Tuesday.
The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on February 14.
All public events on the pope’s calendar were cancelled through Sunday, the Vatican said in a brief statement.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Francis had slept peacefully overnight and had eaten breakfast on Tuesday. A further update on the pope’s condition was expected later on Tuesday.
A Vatican official speaking on background to discuss the pope’s condition without authorisation said the pontiff was not on a ventilator and was breathing on his own.
The pope had been due to lead several events over the weekend for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, which runs through to next January.
It is a special time of pardon and forgiveness for Catholics and the Vatican expects 32 million tourists to visit Rome throughout the year, including for a range of special audiences with Francis.
The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the pope’s drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a “complex clinical situation”. They described it as a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract”.
Doctors say a polymicrobial infection occurs when two or more micro-organisms are involved, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
Massimo Andreoni, an infectious disease specialist, said the Vatican’s reports that the pope did not have a fever and was well enough to eat were “very encouraging”.
“It suggests that the general condition is fair and that there is no major respiratory failure that would make this much more complicated,” said Andreoni, a professor at Rome’s Tor Vergata University.
Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times he has been prone to lung infections.
The Vatican has said Francis will stay in hospital for as long as necessary. It has not specified whether the pope is suffering from a bacterial or viral infection.
While a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down a fever or help their body fight the infection.

Title: Congo army retreat from Bukavu leads to clashes with allied militias
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:48:51 +0000
Content: Government forces and local militias have clashed south of the provincial capital of Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as troops fall back in the face of an advance by Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, military sources and townsfolk say.
The troops and their militia allies were meant to pull back from Bukavu – a trading and mining industry hub – to avoid urban battles with the rebels and to dig in elsewhere to stall the rapid offensive.
The militias wanted to stand and fight.
By the time the rebels started moving into Bukavu over the weekend, the plan was unravelling into chaos, a Congolese general, a senior officer, a community leader, and several residents told Reuters.
Having already lost Congo’s main eastern city of Goma, near the Rwandan border, the forces deployed to defend Bukavu and its 1.3 million people hastily packed up and left.
Direct clashes with the M23 were largely avoided, but towns south of Bukavu then found themselves in the middle of firefights as pro-government militia fighters, known as the Wazalendo, tried to disarm or halt retreating or deserting Congolese soldiers.
“Just this morning there was the crackle of gunfire from Kamanyola to Uvira,” a community leader said on Monday, referring to towns on the N5 road south of Bukavu that have become flashpoints far from the front line with the M23.
“All the villages on road N5 are emptying,” he said.
The disorderly retreat and the ease with which the M23 rebels have overrun eastern Congo’s two major cities have stoked fears of a break-up of the country, a regional war that could drag in Uganda, and open talk in Kinshasa of a possible coup against Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi.
“It’s total chaos,” said a civil society source in Kamanyola, one of several towns where residents have reported clashes in recent days between Congolese troops and their one-time allies.
The Congolese army did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
RIGHTS AND RESOURCES
The rebels, backed by Rwanda, are led by ethnic Tutsis and say they are fighting for their rights.
Various militias are also vying for control of the region’s abundant mineral resources such as tantalum and cobalt, key components of electric vehicles, mobile phones and other technological products used across the world.
Congo is also the top supplier of copper to China.
On Sunday, as reports of the messy Bukavu withdrawal emerged, there were signs of growing unease in the capital.
“Tshisekedi was elected by the Congolese people for a five-year term. We will not accept any coup,” Justice Minister Constant Mutamba said on X.
The disarray in South Kivu will also add to criticism of the decision to recruit the Wazalendo, or Patriots, the loose alliance of militias that are often poorly trained and undisciplined.
A video shared with Reuters by one resident appeared to show Wazalendo fighters in the N5 town of Sange handing out rifles to passersby from the back of a truck they had seized, along with its weapons, from the Congolese army.
Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. A security source and two civil society members confirmed such an incident took place.
“The Wazalendo…just keep messing up. The presidency rearmed all the armed groups thinking that these individuals would serve their cause,” a general in the army said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It was not possible to contact a Wazalendo representative for comment.
“WE FLEE AGAIN”
The withdrawal from Bukavu without a fight has angered many Wazalendo in South Kivu, said Congolese researcher Josaphat Musamba, who is from the province.
“They are determined to fight…They don’t understand how the Congolese army can abandon them.”
Three Congolese military sources said the decision to retreat was made to avoid the bloodshed that accompanied the fall of Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city, in late January, during which about 3,000 people were killed, according to the United Nations.
The loss of Kavumu airport north of Bukavu to the M23 and the air support it provided also influenced the decision to pull back, the general said.
Meanwhile repeated battlefield losses had left soldiers demoralised, said a senior officer serving in the conflict zone, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The soldiers didn’t want to fight anymore. They were fleeing and looting,” he said.
Poor morale and indiscipline have repeatedly undermined the Congolese army’s fight against the M23 since the insurgency broke out in 2022 in a renewal of a conflict dating back to the 1990s genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.
“At the Bukavu stage, we flee again,” said one exasperated soldier in a video that showed large numbers of soldiers clambering onto an truck full of supplies.
“This is how we are treated under the regime of Tshisekedi.”
The insurgency has deepened an already dire humanitarian crisis in eastern provinces. Recent fighting has destroyed emergency shelters, leaving around 350,000 displaced people with no roof over their heads, the U.N. refugee agency says.
Rwanda rejects allegations from Congo, the United Nations, and Western powers that it supports M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against the threat from a Hutu militia, which it says is fighting with the Congolese military.
Congo rejects Rwanda’s complaints and says Rwanda has used its proxy militias to loot its minerals.

Title: Israel to begin negotiations on second phase of Gaza ceasefire deal, minister says
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:34:19 +0000
Content: Israel will begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, including an exchange of the remaining Israeli hostages with Palestinian detainees, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Tuesday, adding that Israel demanded a complete demilitarisation of the enclave.
Negotiations for the second phase of the deal were supposed to be under way before the first phase ends on March 2, but Qatar said the talks have not officially started yet.
A “Hezbollah model” in Gaza would not be acceptable to Israel “and therefore we need a total demilitarisation of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority”, Saar said in a press conference.
He added that Israel was aware of an alternative plan by Arab states for Gaza, made to counter U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to redevelop the strip under U.S. control, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said is worthy of exploration.
Israel would not support a plan that would see civilian control of Gaza transferred from Hamas to the Palestinian authority, Saar added.

Title: Former CEC Rajiv Kumar bids farewell, calls Election Commission ‘place of worship of democracy’
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 17:19:10 +0000
Content: Rajiv Kumar, the 25th Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India, bid farewell to the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday, hailing the institution as a “place of worship of democracy.” Expressing optimism about its future, he said he was confident that under the incoming leadership, the ECI would reach even greater heights.
In his parting remarks, Kumar praised the pivotal role played by voters and political parties in strengthening Indian democracy. “This building is the place of worship of democracy. Through great hard work, it has amassed heritage over the last 75 years. I am hopeful that it will rise even higher in the future. The new team will take it forward with great capability,” he said. He also wished success to all voters, acknowledging their central contribution to the democratic process.
The farewell ceremony marked the conclusion of Kumar’s tenure, during which he served 4.5 years in the Commission. He joined as Election Commissioner on September 1, 2020, and assumed charge as CEC on May 15, 2022. His term was distinguished by silent but impactful reforms spanning structural, technological, and administrative domains.
During his leadership, Kumar oversaw a complete electoral cycle, including the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, elections in 31 states and Union Territories, and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential polls in 2022. The Commission noted that these elections were conducted peacefully, with near-zero repolls and incidents of violence—an achievement Kumar credited to the dedication of 15 million polling officials.
A strong proponent of technology, Kumar championed reforms to strengthen election integrity while addressing challenges such as cyber threats and misinformation on social media. He advocated for biometric authentication at polling booths to prevent impersonation and pushed for mandatory online reporting of political party expenditures to enhance financial transparency.
Kumar’s tenure was marked by several key reforms aimed at modernizing the electoral process. These included:
– Multiple Voter Registration Dates: Operationalizing four qualifying dates for voter registration and introducing early application facilities for 17+ youngsters. 
– Simplified Registration Forms: Making voter registration more accessible and user-friendly. 
– Assam Delimitation: Redefining electoral boundaries in Assam. 
– Voter Facilitation Centres: Allowing polling personnel to vote at facilitation centres, preventing intimidation and malpractices.
Under his leadership, technology-driven reforms, such as ERONET 2.0, were introduced to manage India’s vast electoral database. This system bolstered voter roll management with enhanced security and real-time processing. Additionally, he launched the ‘Myth vs Reality’ register during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to combat misinformation and fake news on social media.
On the global stage, Kumar positioned India as a leader in electoral management, spearheading the ‘Cohort on Election Integrity’ and offering training to officials from multiple countries. He described India’s electoral expertise as a powerful instrument of soft power, enhancing the country’s global democratic influence.
In a gesture of appreciation, Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu lauded Kumar’s inclusive and transformative leadership, crediting him with purpose-driven reforms that modernized India’s electoral machinery while upholding democratic values.
As Rajiv Kumar steps down, Gyanesh Kumar will assume charge as the new Chief Election Commissioner on February 19, 2025.

Title: India, Qatar aim to double annual trade in five years from existing USD 14 billion
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:28:36 +0000
Content: India and Qatar have agreed to double their annual bilateral trade from the current USD 14 billion to USD 28 billion within the next five years. The announcement came following bilateral talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani on Tuesday. The discussions, which took place at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, focused on trade, investment, energy cooperation, and deepening people-to-people ties.
Prime Minister Modi welcomed the Amir and praised him for bringing a large delegation of senior Qatari officials and top business leaders to foster economic collaboration. Both countries also signed an agreement to elevate their bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership.
During a special briefing, Arun Kumar Chatterjee, Secretary (CPV & OIA) in the Ministry of External Affairs, highlighted that the two leaders agreed to set a target of doubling bilateral trade within five years. “Trade, investment, and energy were among the major topics discussed. The current trade volume stands at approximately USD 14 billion annually, and both sides have agreed to aim for USD 28 billion over the next five years,” Chatterjee said.
Qatar emerged as a key partner in India’s investment landscape, with the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) currently holding around USD 1.5 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI) in India. Chatterjee noted that both leaders identified new sectors for QIA to increase its investments in the Indian market.
A Joint Business Forum, co-chaired by the Ministers of Commerce and Industry from both countries, was held earlier in the day. The forum brought together top industrialists and institutions from India and Qatar, facilitating productive discussions on future business collaborations.
The Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, arrived in New Delhi on Monday for a two-day state visit, marking his first trip to India since 2015. In a special gesture, Prime Minister Modi personally received him at Palam Technical Airport.
Earlier in the day, the Amir received a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he was greeted by President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi. President Murmu is scheduled to host a banquet reception in honor of the Amir and his delegation later in the evening.

Title: India negotiating FTA with GCC and Qatar: MEA
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 14:29:15 +0000
Content: India is actively negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar pact with Qatar, aiming to deepen bilateral ties and boost cooperation in trade, energy, investment, and security.
The development was announced during a special briefing on the state visit of the Amir of Qatar to India. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Secretary (CPV & OIA) Arun Kumar Chatterjee said, “India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are currently negotiating a free trade agreement. As for Qatar, both sides are exploring the possibility of signing a similar agreement in the future, which was part of the discussions during this round of talks.”
India shares deep historical and economic ties with the Gulf region. Qatar, one of India’s closest allies in the Gulf, plays a pivotal role in India’s energy security, accounting for 41% of the country’s total natural gas imports. The Gulf region is also home to millions of Indian expatriates whose remittances significantly contribute to India’s economy. According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, remittances from the UAE alone amounted to USD 15.40 billion in the financial year 2020-21, representing 18% of India’s total inward remittances.
The GCC, comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, is India’s largest trading partner bloc, with bilateral trade reaching over USD 154 billion in FY 2021-22. Negotiations for an India-GCC FTA, which began in 2004 with a Framework Agreement on Economic Cooperation, had stalled but have now resumed with renewed momentum.
During the visit, India and Qatar signed an agreement to elevate their bilateral ties to a strategic partnership and exchanged multiple Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) covering trade, energy, investment, innovation, technology, food security, culture, and people-to-people ties.
The two leaders also reviewed the landmark agreement signed in February 2024 between Qatar Energy and Petronet LNG Limited, under which Qatar will supply 7.5 million metric tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India from 2028 for 20 years. “India and Qatar share a vibrant energy partnership, and both leaders discussed ways to broaden this partnership, including exploring mutual investments,” Chatterjee said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the Amir of Qatar for his support to the large Indian community in Qatar, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. “India and Qatar enjoy deep-rooted, friendly relations anchored in historic trade and people-to-people ties,” he remarked.
The Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, arrived in India on a two-day visit and received a ceremonial welcome with a Guard of Honour at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Title: Recapitalisation, reforms have worked well for public sector banks: SBI Chairman
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:44:13 +0000
Content: Recapitalisation and reforms in recent years have worked well for public sector banks, resulting in cleaner balance sheets, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman C.S. Setty said on Tuesday.
The savings behaviour has also changed, as depositors are practising asset allocation across segments, Setty said during the NDTV Profit Conclave here.
He highlighted the critical role of capital in achieving the vision of a developed India (Viksit Bharat) and stressed the need for diversified sources of debt capital beyond traditional bank loans.
“The trust element was always there, and PSBs have always enjoyed a great amount of trust from depositors. What has changed in recent years is that recognition, recapitalisation, and reforms have truly worked for public sector banks,” he told the gathering.
Setty further stated that the balance sheets are cleaner.
“Most importantly, from the last cycle, we have learned our lesson in terms of using the vast amount of data now available to underwrite loans effectively,” he said.
PSU banks, traditionally wholesale lenders, have now adopted a diversified mix of retail, agriculture, MSME, and corporate loans, resulting in more balanced loan books.
According to Setty, capital is a critical element for the blueprint of Viksit Bharat.
“Currently, much of the debt capital comes from bank loans. The nature of savings is undergoing a change, with a shift in depositors’ behaviour and asset allocation across segments of savers,” he stated.
The SBI Chairman emphasised the need to deepen the bond market and leverage capital from mutual funds, insurance, and pension funds to achieve the goal of a $35 trillion economy by 2047.
The country’s largest public sector lender reported an impressive 84.32 per cent surge in net profit year-on-year, reaching ₹16,891 crore for the October-December quarter (Q3 FY25), compared to ₹9,164 crore in the year-ago period. The profit rise was driven by higher core income during the quarter.
The net interest income (NII), or core income, increased by 4.09 per cent from a year ago, standing at ₹41,445.5 crore compared to ₹39,816 crore, according to the bank’s stock exchange filing.
The gross NPA ratio improved to 2.07 per cent as of December 31, 2024, down from 2.13 per cent in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, the net NPA ratio remained unchanged at 0.53 per cent.

Title: BJP sweeps Gujarat local body polls
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 13:14:33 +0000
Content: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has once again asserted its dominance in Gujarat’s local body elections, securing a decisive victory in the Junagadh Municipal Corporation by winning 48 out of 60 seats in the February 16 polls.
According to the State Election Commission (SEC), eight seats were won unopposed by the BJP before polling began, while voting took place for the remaining 52 seats. Out of these, the BJP clinched 40 seats, while the main opposition party secured 11 seats, and one independent candidate emerged victorious from Ward No. 9.
In Sanand Municipality, elections were held for 27 out of 28 seats, with one seat won unopposed by the BJP before polling. Out of the 27 contested seats, the BJP secured 24, while the Congress managed to win only three.
Meanwhile, in Bavla Municipality, the BJP reached the halfway mark of 14 out of 28 seats, while the Congress secured 13 seats, and one seat went to a BSP candidate. This close contest could lead to an interesting political scenario in Bavla, as no party has achieved a clear majority yet.
The third municipality in Ahmedabad district, Dhandhuka, also went to the polls, but its results were still awaited, according to the State Election Commission.
In Dakor Municipality, a political deadlock emerged as the BJP secured 12 seats, while independent candidates won 14 seats, leaving no party with a clear majority. The Congress failed to win a single seat in Dakor, marking a significant setback for the opposition in this region.
Additionally, the BJP swept the district panchayat by-elections, winning all nine seats across Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Panchmahal, Dahod, Bharuch, Dangs, and Botad. Notably, in Panchmahal, the BJP candidate won unopposed.
These local body elections were also significant as they marked the first implementation of newly introduced reservation policies for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in several local bodies.

Title: IPL 2025 full squads and fixtures: how every team lines up
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:19:05 +0000
Content: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket tournament organised by the Indian board (BCCI).
First held in 2008, it quickly became the most lucrative cricket competition in the world, with a brand value of $12 billion, according to a December 2024 report by brand valuation consultancy firm Brand Finance.
Here is what you need to know about the 18th edition of the competition, which kicks off next month:
WHEN IS THE IPL HAPPENING?
* The 18th edition of the IPL runs from March 22 to May 25.
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE IPL?
* The 10 participating teams are split into two groups. Each team play twice, home and away, against other teams in the group and the team in the same row in the other group, along with one match each against the remaining four teams from the opposite group, totalling 14 matches in the group stage.
* The top four teams in a unified points table will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams will play each other in ‘Qualifier 1,’ with the winner reaching the final.
* The teams placed third and fourth will compete in the ‘Eliminator’ match where the winner will progress to ‘Qualifier 2,’ taking on the loser of ‘Qualifier 1’ for a place in the final.
* Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, and Punjab Kings are in Group 1. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Lucknow Super Giants are in Group 2.
WHERE IS THE IPL TAKING PLACE?
* The IPL is held in the home cities of the franchises based across India. However, some teams may choose to split their home games between two or more cities.
* The 2025 edition will be played across 13 venues.
* Eden Gardens, the home ground of defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders, will host the opening game, ‘Qualifier 2’ and the final. Sunrisers Hyderabad, who finished second in the table last season, will host the ‘Qualifier 1’ and ‘Eliminator’ matches.
WHO IS INVOLVED IN IPL 2025?
* Some of the biggest names in cricket from around the world will be in action, with England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler fetching the highest price for an overseas player at 157.5 million Indian rupees ($1.81 million) at the player auction in November, joining Gujarat Titans.
* The teams spent over $72.51 million at the auction, with Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, signed by Lucknow Super Giants for $3.11 million, earning the highest price tag.
* World Cup-winning Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has retired from international cricket, will play for Chennai Super Kings. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who both retired from international T20 cricket after India won the 20-over World Cup last year, will also be in action for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, respectively.
* Some former greats of the sport, who are present in the competition as coaches, are Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, and Stephen Fleming coaching Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chennai, respectively.
* Players from India’s politically estranged rivals Pakistan have not played in the IPL since its opening edition in 2008.
Pakistan’s government barred its players from participating in IPL 2009, citing security concerns amid tense relations after the Mumbai militant attacks in November 2008.
Although Pakistan’s authorities cleared their players to participate in the next edition, Pakistani players were snubbed from IPL 2010 and have not featured in the competition since.

Title: South Korea’s parliament presses for Yoon’s removal as impeachment trial winds down
Publication Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 11:44:33 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol could try to impose martial law again or undermine constitutional institutions should he be reinstated, lawyers for parliament argued on Tuesday as his impeachment trial entered its final phase.
After weeks of testimony by high-ranking current and former officials, including some facing criminal charges for their role in the brief imposition of martial law on December 3, lawyers for both sides summarised their arguments and evidence at the Constitutional Court.
“Declaring martial law in a situation that doesn’t fit a national emergency is a declaration of dictatorship and military rule,” Kim Jin-han, a lawyer for the parliament, told the justices.
He cited pro-Yoon protesters who stormed a different court in January.
“If he returns to work, we don’t know if he will again exercise martial law,” Kim said. “If he returns to work, we can’t rule out the possibility that he will attack other state and constitutional institutions.”
The Constitutional Court is due to hold another hearing to question three more witnesses on Thursday, including the impeached prime minister and the former police chief.
The court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. If he is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.
Yoon has argued that he had a right as president to issue his martial law decree, which lasted around six hours before he rescinded it in the face of parliamentary opposition. He said the move was also justified by political deadlock and threats from “anti-state forces” sympathetic to North Korea.
His case at the Constitutional Court has also included arguments that he never actually intended to stop parliament from operating, even though the order was publicly declared and troops and police were deployed to the legislature.
Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission and later said the decree was necessary in part because the NEC had been unwilling to address concerns over election hacking, a claim rejected by election officials.
Prosecutors have also indicted Yoon on separate criminal charges of leading an insurrection. He was arrested last month and is being held at a detention centre.
The first preparatory hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday.
Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.

Title: Delhi BJP announces ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ at Ramlila Maidan
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:29:52 +0000
Content: Asserting that a new chapter in the national capital’s progress was unfolding, Delhi BJP on Wednesday invited the people to the ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ at Ramlila Maidan, where the Chief Minister and the rest of the cabinet will take their oaths.
In a post on social media platform X in Hindi, the Delhi BJP stated: “A new chapter of Delhi’s progress is about to begin. With the ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’, we all together will move towards new heights of development in Delhi. Come to Ramlila Maidan and witness this historic moment!”
The post mentions that the ceremony will take place on 20 February at 10 a.m.
Interestingly, the BJP has named the oath-taking ceremony ‘Viksit Delhi Pledge Ceremony’ following its promise of putting the national capital back on track with development. The party has blamed the previous AAP government for failing to perform its duties. Ahead of the polls, in its manifesto titled ‘Viksit Delhi Sankalp’, the BJP had promised that, when the party forms the government, it would “give Delhi a new direction”.
Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the oath-taking ceremony of the BJP government at the historic Ramlila Ground in Delhi on Thursday. The name of the Chief Minister will be chosen by the BJP Legislature Party at its headquarters on Wednesday evening. After the meeting, a signed letter of support from all the MLAs in favour of the new Chief Minister and Leader of the House will be presented to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) V.K. Saxena.
The BJP won 48 of the 70 seats in the Assembly elections, defeating the Aam Aadmi Party, which secured 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure a single seat for the third consecutive time. Notably, the lotus bloomed in the national capital after 27 years.

Title: Benfica see off Monaco in thriller to reach last 16
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:23:14 +0000
Content: Benfica held determined AS Monaco to a 3-3 draw in a thrilling second leg of their Champions League knockout phase playoff on Tuesday for a 4-3 aggregate win that earned the hosts a place in the competition’s last 16.
Benfica, who had a one-goal advantage from the first leg, opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with winger Kerem Akturkoglu’s close-range strike after a fine pass from Vangelis Pavlidis.
But Monaco had the hosts on the ropes for much of the match and midfielder Takumi Minamino equalised with a simple finish 10 minutes later before Eliesse Ben Seghir put them in front after the break with a stunning first-time shot inside the right post.
Benfica were then awarded a penalty and Pavlidis coolly converted from the spot to make it 2-2 before Monaco substitute George Ilenikhena and Benfica’s Orkun Kokcu added a goal each late on.
“It was a hard game with lots of running, but in the end I am really happy that I could score and help us go through to the next stage,” said player of the match Kokcu.
Benfica will be up against either Liverpool or Barcelona in the last 16, depending on Friday’s draw.
The Portuguese side, who had already beaten Monaco twice this season with a 3-2 away win also in the tournament’s league phase, have never lost at home to a French club.
Monaco gave their travelling fans reasons to believe in a turnaround but an early golden chance by Krepin Diatta to level the tie on aggregate was denied by Benfica keeper Anatoliy Trubin.
The hosts grew into the game and Akturkoglu opened the scoring after Pavlidis recovered the ball just outside the box before squaring it across the face of the goal to the Turkey forward, who scored into an empty net.
BATTLING MONACO
Monaco were rewarded for their strong start and seconds after Breel Embolo hit the post, Minamino equalised in the 32nd minute.
Embolo then misfired an excellent chance in first-half stoppage time as Monaca were on the front foot before and after the restart.
Trubin kept out a powerful attempt by Eliesse Ben Seghir two minutes into the second half. But there was little the Ukrainian goalkeeper could do when the 20-year-old eventually gave Monaco the lead in the 51st minute.
Maghnes Akliouche drove the ball into the box before squaring it to Ben Seghir, who curled it home beautifully.
Benfica were awarded a penalty after Monaco’s Thilo Kehrer brought down Fredrik Aursnes which Pavlidis made no mistake firing home.
Pavlidis, who joined the Portuguese side in July from AZ Alkmaar, has seven goals in the competition this season.
Ilenikhena raised the visitors’ hopes when he restored the lead for Monaco in the 81st minute, aiming low into the middle of the goal in a solo effort seconds after entering the pitch.
But Kokcu levelled for Benfica three minutes later from a perfect cross by Alvaro Carreras.

Title: Musk calls himself ‘tech-support’ for Trump, blasts U.S. bureaucracy for blocking executive orders
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:42:30 +0000
Content: Tesla CEO and DOGE Head Elon Musk has accused the U.S. bureaucracy of obstructing President Donald Trump’s executive orders, claiming that officials are “fighting against the will of the people.”
In a Fox News interview aired Tuesday, Musk criticized the slow implementation of Trump’s directives and asserted that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is working to ensure the orders are enforced. “The president makes these executive orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don’t get implemented,” he said, alleging that bureaucratic resistance undermines democratic governance.
Musk, who openly declared his support for Trump, described himself as the president’s “tech-support.” “I’m here to provide the president with technology support. I’m a technologist, and I try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better,” he said.
Citing an example of bureaucratic obstruction, Musk pointed to the continued funding of luxury hotels for illegal immigrants, despite Trump issuing an executive order to halt taxpayer money for such expenses. “We went in there and said, ‘This is a violation of the presidential executive order. It needs to stop.’ One of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is making sure the president’s orders are actually carried out,” he added.
He further warned that unelected bureaucrats, by resisting Trump’s directives, are undermining democracy. “The president is the elected representative of the people. If the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the president from implementing what the people want, then we live in a bureaucracy, not a democracy,” Musk said.
Reflecting on his shifting political stance, Musk noted that he was once embraced by left-wing circles but now faces hostility for supporting Trump. “I used to be adored by the left. Not anymore… They call it ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome,’ and you don’t realize how real this is,” he said.
Musk also described intense reactions from those opposed to Trump, recalling an incident where merely mentioning the president’s name sparked extreme responses. “It was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular containing methamphetamine and rabies. They become completely irrational,” he said.
Since endorsing Trump, Musk claimed he has faced hostility. “I’m getting dirty looks from everyone—if looks could kill, I’d be dead several times over,” he added.

Title: Djokovic stunned by Berrettini in Qatar Open first round
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:31:28 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic was stunned 7-6(4) 6-2 by Matteo Berrettini in the Qatar Open first round on Tuesday as the Italian enjoyed his first win over the former world number one. 
Berrettini played superbly to knock out the twice champion in one hour 35 minutes and secure his first victory against a top-10 opponent since January 2023. 
“It’s something that I’ve been looking to do,” said former world number six Berrettini, who had lost all four of his previous matches against the Serbian. 
“I played against him in the most important tournaments on tour, had the honour and the pleasure to play against him. I wish I could have won one of those matches as well.” 
World number 35 Berrettini, voted the ATP’s comeback player last year, faces Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor in the next round. 
Djokovic, a 24-times Grand Slam winner who was aiming for a 100th ATP title, was playing his first singles match since retiring from the Australian Open semi-finals due to a hamstring injury. 
The 37-year-old, who last week said he was “almost fully recovered”, had not lost a first-round match since his 2022 Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. 
“I didn’t have any pain or discomfort in that sense. I was outplayed by just a better player today,” said Djokovic. 
“I wasn’t at my desired level, and it could be that I’m still not moving the way I want to move but I played without pain so there is no excuse in that. 
“Things are not the same as 10, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis and it’s more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances.” 
Djokovic will now turn his attention to the doubles event, pairing up with Spaniard Fernando Verdasco against Finn Harri Heliovaara and Britain’s Henry Pattem in the quarter-finals.

Title: Dozens of false killer whales stranded on remote Australian beach
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:23:32 +0000
Content: More than 150 false killer whales have been stranded on an isolated beach in the Australian state of Tasmania, with rescue crews trying to save the majority of the large dolphins that survived the ordeal, authorities said on Wednesday.
Initial checks showed 136 animals were still alive, Tasmania’s environment department said in a statement. Reasons for the beachings are unclear.
The endangered dolphins, which can grow up to 20 feet (6.1 m) long and weigh up to 3,000 lbs (1,361 kg), resemble killer whales. They are found in all tropical and subtropical oceans, generally in deep offshore waters, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“Stranding response in this area is complex due to the inaccessibility of the site, ocean conditions and the challenges of getting specialist equipment to the remote area,” the statement said.
The dolphins were found stranded in the island state’s northwest coast near Arthur River, about 400 km (250 miles) from Tasmania’s state capital, Hobart.

Title: Bayern’s Davies nets late equaliser against Celtic to book last-16 spot
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:02:59 +0000
Content: Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies snatched a last-gasp equaliser against Celtic for a 1-1 draw in their playoff on Tuesday as theyreached the Champions League last-16 by 3-2 on aggregate.
They will next face either fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid depending on Friday’s draw.
Davies scored in stoppage time after former Bayern reserve player Nicolas Kuehn had given the visitors a shock lead in the 63rd minute asthey tried to overturn a first-leg deficit and win a first game in Germany in 16 attempts.
Having lost the first leg 2-1 in Glasgow, Celtic came agonisingly close to forcing extra time with a bold performance that had the hosts on the backfoot for much of the game.
“If you watched the first leg, I don’t think it was surprising,” said Bayern midfielder Leon Goretzka. “Of course we could have made it easier for ourselves by not conceding a goal.”
“We have played three games in six days now and it was all about getting results, which we didand we’re happy about that,” he added after Bayern earned a 0-0 draw at reigning German champions Leverkusen on Saturday.
With the Bavarians made to sweat from the start, Celtic’s Kuehn saw a shot cleared off the line by Raphael Guerreiro in the 16th minute before Daizen Maeda narrowly missed connecting with an Arne Engels cross in front of goal a little later.
Bayern had to wait until the stroke of halftime for their own opportunity, striker Harry Kane hitting the bar with a shot.
The England captain, who had little impact otherwise and was nursing a knock to the head from the Leverkusen game, was taken off at halftime.
KUEHN POUNCES
Bayern came close again seconds after the restart with Goretzka failing to beat goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in a one-on-one.
It was Celtic, however, who broke the deadlock with a deserved goal when Kuehn slotted home following two defensive errors to put Brendan Rodgers’ team in the driving seat.
Bayern upped the tempo and came close with Goretzka and Leroy Sane before Schmeichel pulled off another superb save to deny Joshua Kimmich.
The Danethen did everything right to stop Goretzka’s effort in front of goal in stoppage time but could do nothing when Davies bundled the ball over the line on the rebound.
The equaliser sent the Germans through to the knockout stage and left Celtic’s players and coach bitterly disappointed.
“It was just such a cruel way to not even lose the game but to go out of the competition,” said Rodgers. “A real heroic performance, just unfortunate at the end.
“I think our European credibility has been restored this season, I think we built that up from last year, that’s my takeaway from this season.”

Title: ASI begins underwater exploration to uncover submerged heritage off Dwarka coast
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:59:39 +0000
Content: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has launched a new phase of underwater exploration off the coast of Dwarka, Gujarat, as part of its efforts to uncover and preserve India’s submerged cultural heritage, the Ministry of Culture said on Tuesday.
A team of five archaeologists, led by Prof. Alok Tripathi, Additional Director-General (Archaeology), has begun investigations near the Gomati Creek. The team includes H.K. Nayak, Director (Excavations and Explorations), Dr. Aparajita Sharma, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, Poonam Vind, and Rajkumari Barbina. This marks the first time that an ASI-led underwater exploration team includes a significant number of women archaeologists actively participating in the investigations.
Renewed Focus on Underwater Archaeology
This exploration is part of the revived Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW) of ASI, which has been reactivated to conduct offshore surveys and excavations in Dwarka and Bet Dwarka. Since the 1980s, the UAW has played a key role in underwater archaeological research, with previous explorations at sites including Bangaram Island (Lakshadweep), Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), Loktak Lake (Manipur), and Elephanta Island (Maharashtra).
The ASI has also worked in collaboration with the Indian Navy and other government organizations to study and protect underwater cultural heritage. Between 2005 and 2007, ASI conducted offshore and onshore excavations in Dwarka, leading to the discovery of sculptures and stone anchors during low tide. These findings formed the basis for subsequent underwater excavations.
Preserving India’s Submerged Heritage
The latest underwater investigations mark a crucial step in ASI’s ongoing mission to explore and protect India’s rich underwater heritage. As the UAW continues its research in Dwarka, the findings could offer valuable insights into the historical and cultural significance of submerged structures in the region.

Title: Tiger Woods back in action in TGL loss to New York GC
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:33:41 +0000
Content: Tiger Woods on Tuesday made his first start since the death of his mother when he competed in a TGL match at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
It was all over in a proverbial New York Minute for Woods and his Jupiter Links GC teammates Kevin Kisner and Tom Kim as they lost 10-3 in a one-sided shellacking at the hands of the New York Golf Club.
A rampant New York team of Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Cameron Young stormed to an 8-0 lead before coasting to their first victory of the season in the indoor league played on a golf simulator.
Despite the result, Woods seemed to enjoy plenty of laughs, feeding off the humor of his livewire teammate Kisner, and the 15-time major champion appeared more relaxed than in his TGL debut three weeks ago.
His mother Kultida was in the gallery that night, but she died eight days later, on Feb. 4, at the age of 80, which prompted her son to pull out of last week’s PGA Tour Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines, stating that he was still processing the loss.
“She really enjoyed watching me play and it was awesome to have her in the stands,” Woods said of his mother’s presence at his previous TGL match. “It was a great moment and I’m definitely appreciative of her being here. I had a hard time driving down here. I hadn’t hit a golf ball since I played with the president (Trump on Feb. 9).
“It’s been a hard process. I really haven’t thought about golf, and I don’t think I’ll be thinking about it for a bit here.”
Woods, Kisner and Tom Kim did not get on the board until the ninth hole (of 15) on Tuesday. By then the match was all but over as New York improved to 1-2 for the season. Jupiter Links dropped to 1-2.
Woods also admitted that the evening included “one of the most embarrassing moments in my golfing career.”
Due to a misunderstanding with his caddie, Woods hit his second shot on the 13th hole 100 yards when he was actually 199 yards away from the green.
Woods’ teammates laughed heartily at the error.
“I just screwed up,” Woods said. “That was embarrassing.”
Six teams are competing in the inaugural season of the fast-paced league, which is attempting to appeal to a young demographic by encouraging players, among other things, to indulge in what passes in golf for trash-talking.
“We’re here for the entertainment,” Kisner said just before hitting his tee shot into a bunker at the 14th hole.
“That’s a lot more fun than the last two matches,” said Fowler, happy to be on the victorious side.

Title: India emerges as a global leader in science, technology, and innovation: Dr. Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:20:50 +0000
Content: India is no longer just a follower on the global stage; it is now leading in multiple fields, including space exploration, biotechnology, nuclear energy, and scientific research. Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, and Minister of State for PMO, made this bold assertion during a recent address, highlighting India’s remarkable advancements and rising prominence in the world of science and technology.
India’s space sector has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. With ambitious missions and successful international collaborations, India has positioned itself as a key player in space exploration. The Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), part of India’s growing technological capabilities, is paving the way for future missions such as Gaganyaan, Chandrayaan-4, and the Bharatiya Antariksh Station—India’s forthcoming international space station.
India’s rise in the space sector is underscored by its increasing role in satellite launches. Over the past decade, the country has launched 433 foreign satellites, earning substantial revenues—$157 million and €260 million—from 2014 to 2023. The success of Chandrayaan-3, which made India the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole, has propelled India to the forefront of lunar exploration. The global scientific community, including NASA, is now keenly awaiting India’s findings from the Moon’s southern pole.
India’s achievements in biotechnology and bioeconomy are equally impressive. The nation became the first to develop a DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, cementing its leadership in vaccine research. Additionally, India introduced the world’s first herpesvirus vaccine for cervical cancer, further establishing itself as a global leader in preventive healthcare.
The bioeconomy has also flourished, growing from $10 billion in 2014 to nearly $140 billion today. Projections suggest it will reach $250 billion in the coming years, fueled by a surge in biotech startups—almost 9,000 today compared to just 50 in 2014. India is also gaining ground in bio-manufacturing, ranking third in the Asia-Pacific region and 12th globally, with its influence rapidly expanding.
India is also pioneering space biology, with significant investments in research focused on sustaining life beyond Earth. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology have signed an MoU to advance space biotechnology, focusing on growing plants in space to support long-term space missions. Research in space medicine and human physiology in extraterrestrial environments is expected to be crucial as humanity looks to expand its presence beyond Earth.
In nuclear energy, India has set an ambitious goal of generating 100 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2047. This effort will contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions by 50%, positioning India as a leader in sustainable energy development. India’s nuclear policy, originally envisioned by Homi Bhabha for peaceful purposes, is now viewed as a model of responsible energy development worldwide.
India’s standing in scientific research has gained global recognition. The country is now ranked fourth worldwide in scientific publications, and projections suggest it could surpass the United States to become the leading nation in scientific research by 2030. This growing dominance is also reflected in India’s space economy, which is expected to grow five to ten times in the next decade, further solidifying its leadership in science and bio-manufacturing.
Dr. Singh emphasized that India’s rise is no longer about catching up but about setting the global agenda.

Title: After decades in exile, Syria’s Jews visit Damascus
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:06:37 +0000
Content: For the first time in three decades, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll in a synagogue in the heart of Syria’s capital Damascus, carefully passing their thumbs over the handwritten text as if still in awe they were back home.
The father and son fled Syria in the 1990s, after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country’s historic Jewish community, which had faced decades of restrictions including on owning property or holding jobs.
Virtually all of the few thousand Jews in Syria promptly left, leaving less than 10 in the Syrian capital. Joseph and Henry – just a child at the time – settled in New York.
“Weren’t we in a prison? So we wanted to see what was on the outside,” said Joseph, now 77, on his reasons for leaving at the time. “Everyone else who left with us is dead.”
But when Assad’s son and successor as president Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December, the Hamra family began planning a once-unimaginable visit to Damascus with the help of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group.
They met with Syria’s deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now managed by caretaker authorities installed by the Islamist rebels who ousted Assad after more than 50 years of family rule that saw itself as a bastion of secular Arab nationalism.
The new authorities have said all of Syria’s communities will play a role in their country’s future. But incidents of religious intolerance and reports of conservative Islamists proselytizing in public have kept more secular-minded Syrians and members of minority communities on edge.
Henry Hamra, now aged 48, said Syria’s foreign ministry had now pledged to protect Jewish heritage.
“We need the government’s help, we need the government’s security and it’s going to happen,” he said.
Walking through the narrow passages of the Old City, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site, Henry and Joseph ran into their onetime neighbours – Palestinian Syrians – and later marveled at hand-painted Hebrew lettering at several synagogues.
“I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,” said Henry.
But some things were missing, he said, including a golden-lettered Torah from one of the synagogues that was now stored in a library in Israel, to where thousands of Syrian Jews fled throughout the 20th century.
While the synagogues and Jewish school in the Old City remained relatively well-preserved, Syria’s largest synagogue in Jobar, an eastern suburb of Damascus, was reduced to rubble during the nearly 14-year civil war that erupted after Assad’s violent suppression of protests against him.
Jobar was home to a large Jewish community for hundreds of years until the 1800s and the synagogue, built in honour of the biblical prophet Elijah, was looted before it was destroyed.

Title: Always exciting to hear PM Modi’s vision for India, says Rishi Sunak
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:22:34 +0000
Content: Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “friend”, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday said that it is “always exciting” to hear PM Modi’s vision for India.
Sunak and his family met the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday evening, having detailed conversation on many subjects.
PM Modi said that Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.
Taking to X, Prime Minister Modi wrote, “It was a delight to meet former UK PM, Mr. Rishi Sunak and his family! We had a wonderful conversation on many subjects. Mr. Sunak is a great friend of India and is passionate about even stronger India-UK ties.”
The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom replied to the PM’s post on Wednesday, highlighting his strong friendship with the Indian leader and PM Modi’s constant support for strengthening India-UK relations.
“Wonderful to catch up with my friend Narendra Modi. Thank you for so warmly welcoming my family, too! Always exciting to hear your vision for India, and so important the UK-India relationship goes from strength to strength,” Sunak posted on X.
Born to Indian parents in Southampton with roots in Punjab, Sunak is the first Indian-origin person to have served as the UK Prime Minister from 2022 to 2024.
Always proud of his Indian roots, Sunak batted for having close ties with India in economic, security and scientific spheres as both nations collaborated in areas like finance, technology, healthcare, and education besides establishing the FinTech Bridge connecting London and Mumbai.
As the Conservative Party leader conceded defeat in the UK general election in July 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Rishi Sunak’s contribution to consolidate ties between the two nations during his tenure as the UK Prime Minister.
“Thank you Rishi Sunak for your admirable leadership of the UK, and your active contribution to deepen the ties between India and the UK during your term in office. Best wishes to you and your family for the future,” PM Modi posted on X on July 5, 2024.
Sunak had also congratulated PM Modi on the BJP-led NDA’s third straight election victory last year, insisting that the UK and India share the closest of friendships which would continue to thrive.
In May 2024, as the UK Prime Minister, he hailed India’s rise as an ‘economic superpower’, asserting that new and fast-growing economic superpowers like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria are significantly reshaping the global economy.

Title: Fat, not muscle: drugmakers in race for next weight-loss breakthrough
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:15:11 +0000
Content: Current weight-loss methods such as lifestyle changes, surgery, and popular therapies like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound result in both fat and muscle loss that can increase the risk of falls and decrease overall strength, which could be especially harmful for older patients.
The following companies are developing weight-loss treatments that help preserve or grow muscles while patients shed pounds:
Eli Lilly
The U.S. drugmaker spent nearly $2 billion in 2023 to acquire Versanis Bio’s bimagrumab, which prevents the activity of a protein called myostatin to help preserve muscle.
Lilly is testing bimagrumab alone and in combination with Novo’s Wegovy — a mid-stage trial begun before the acquisition — with a main goal of change in total body weight. It is also partnering with China-based Laekna to develop a similar drug.
Regeneron
Regeneron is testing its drug, trevogrumab, along with Wegovy and another treatment, garetosmab, in a three-part study with healthy and obese participants. Trevogrumab is an antibody that belongs to the same class of treatments as Lilly’s bimagrumab.
The study, expected to be completed next year, has a main goal of change in body weight, but also will measure change in fat mass, waist circumference, body composition, and thigh muscle volume. It is expected to be completed next year.
Scholar Rock
The drug developer is testing apitegromab, an experimental therapy that targets the myostatin protein, alongside GLP-1 treatments. Its drug helped improve motor function for patients with spinal muscular atrophy in a late-stage study.
The mid-stage study plans to enroll 100 patients and evaluate changes in total lean mass, or fat-free mass. Secondary goals include changes in body weight and various types of fat.
Roche
Swiss drugmaker Roche began a study last year of its experimental drug, RG6237, as a monotherapy in people with high body weight. The drug, known as an anti-latent myostatin, works by eliminating an inactive form of the protein from the blood.
Roche plans to start a mid-stage trial this year combining the drug and its own GLP-1 weight-loss drug candidate CT-388.
Biohaven
Biohaven is evaluating its myostatin targeting drug, taldefgrobep alfa, in an early-stage obesity trial.
The drug recently failed to improve motor function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, but helped cut total body fat mass and showed numerically larger increases in lean mass and bone density compared to placebo.
It said it plans to rapidly advance a mid-stage study of the drug in patients with obesity.
Keros Pharma
Keros’ drug, KER-065, which targets myostatin and activin A proteins, increased lean mass and reduced fat mass in obese mice when given alone and in combination with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic.
Keros said it will assess the drug’s safety in an early-stage study of male patients with obesity. Data from this study is expected in the first quarter of 2025.
Elevai Biosciences
Elevai Biosciences, a unit of PMGC Holdings, acquired two myostatin targeting drugs – EL-22 and EL-32 – from South Korean firm MOA Life Plus last year.
The company, previously known as Elevai Labs, plans to seek an FDA green light to begin human studies this year for both experimental drugs in combination with GLP-1 treatments.
Veru
Veru’s oral drug, enobosarm, targets the androgen hormones that play a role in body development and reproductive health. In a mid-stage study, patients who received the drug along with Wegovy lost 71% less lean, or muscle, mass on average than those who received Wegovy and a placebo over 16 weeks.
The company will test whether its drug can improve stair climb power in patients aged 60 and older in a larger, late-stage study.
35 Pharma
Montreal, Canada-based 35Pharma plans to test the safety of its experimental drug, HS235, in an early-stage study. The treatment targets activin and GDF ligands – two proteins that play a key role in regulating skeletal muscle, blood and bone metabolism. Data from this study is expected in the second half of this year.
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals has two RNA-based obesity drugs in its pipeline – ARO-INHBE and ARO-ALK7 – that intervene in a pathway that signals the body to store fat. The company plans to evaluate ARO-INHBE in human studies this year, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Lilly’s tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro.
Six Peaks/AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca in May 2024 agreed to pay up to $80 million to SixPeaks Bio to work with the Swiss biotech start-up on its antibody that targets activin cell receptors to preserve muscle mass in people on weight-loss therapy. Under the deal, Astra also obtained certain exclusive rights to acquire SixPeaks.

Title: Putin-Trump meeting is possible this month but may be later, Kremlin says
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:14:36 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump could meet this month, although the first face-to-face encounter between a Russian and a U.S. leader since 2021 could take longer to prepare, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.
Trump said on Tuesday he would probably meet Putin this month and dismissed Ukraine’s concern about being left out of U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia, while suggesting Kyiv could have reached a deal with Russia earlier.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the meeting in Riyadh was focused mostly on Russian-U.S. bilateral ties but that it was a “very, very important step” towards reaching a settlement on the Ukraine war, nearing the end of its third year.
“But this is the first step… Naturally, it’s impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,” Peskov said.
Asked if a meeting between Putin and Trump could take place this month, Peskov was quoted by Interfax as saying: “Possibly. And possibly not.”
Putin and Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden held a summit in Geneva in June 2021. That was the most recent time a U.S. and Russian leader met face to face, though Biden and Putin had a call in February 2022 and messages were passed via intermediaries.
Trump has upended Western policy on Russia and Ukraine, ordering talks with Russia without Ukraine or European powers, speaking to Putin, and talking about bringing down the price of oil – of which Russia is a major exporter.
Trump says he wants to end the war and that he thinks Putin wants to do a deal. But he has yet to spell out his plan for halting a conflict that has left swathes of Ukraine destroyed, killed or injured hundreds of thousands of people and raised fears of a direct confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world’s two biggest nuclear powers.
The talks in Riyadh were the first that the U.S. and Russia have held to seek an end to the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two.
No Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine’s armed forces.
In 2022, Putin sent his army into Ukraine in what he called a “special military operation”. He said it was needed to protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine and counter what he said was a grave threat to Russia from potential Ukrainian membership of NATO.
Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab that threatens European security, and say that Russia could go further and attack NATO one day. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.

Title: Hong Kong and Uyghur communities in Ireland urge government to confront China on transnational repression during Wang Yi’s visit
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:08:52 +0000
Content: Members of the Hong Kong and Uyghur communities in Ireland have called on the Irish government to address China’s transnational repression and human rights violations during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Dublin.
Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, arrived in Ireland after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he met with top European leaders. He is scheduled to hold discussions with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris, The Irish Times reported.
In a joint statement, organizations representing Uyghurs and Hongkongers in Ireland urged the government to take concrete action against China’s repression, including allegations of genocide, politically motivated imprisonment, and harassment of diaspora communities.
The groups raised concerns over Chinese government surveillance and intimidation of dissidents on Irish soil, warning that these activities pose a direct threat to Ireland’s national security.
“We do not feel we can openly exercise our right to protest for fear of retribution by the regime—whether against our family members back home, within Ireland itself, or by losing our chance to visit our homelands,” the statement read, as quoted by The Irish Times.
They highlighted that the European Union has acknowledged China’s pattern of transnational repression, particularly targeting Tibetan, Taiwanese, Hongkonger, and Uyghur communities.
The statement also referenced a recent case where Hong Kong authorities detained the relatives of an exiled activist to punish her for participating in a legal protest in London. Such incidents, the groups said, have created a climate of fear among diasporic Hongkongers in Ireland and beyond.
The European Hong Kong Diaspora Alliance, the Irish Uyghur Cultural Association, and Stand With Hong Kong urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to raise these concerns with Wang, emphasizing that diplomatic ties and economic relations should not come at the cost of fundamental freedoms.
“People in Ireland have a right to live free from fear,” the statement added.
Wang Yi’s visit marks the second high-profile Chinese delegation to Ireland in just over a year, following Premier Li Qiang’s trip in January 2024.
China’s foreign ministry, announcing the visit last week, described Ireland as a “strategic partner for mutually beneficial cooperation,” saying that bilateral ties have maintained “sound growth momentum.”

Title: SBI pegs India’s GDP growth at 6.3% for Q3 of 2024-25
Publication Date: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:05:05 +0000
Content: SBI economists have pegged India’s GDP growth at 6.2-6.3 per cent for Q3 (October-December) of 2024-25 driven by buoyant demand and Capex trends along with the increase in EBIDTA and corporate GVA recorded by India Inc.
The SBI report released on Wednesday considers the slowdown in the second quarter (Q2) as a “blip” and states that “presuming no major revisions are announced in the erstwhile Q1 and Q2 figures by NSO, we estimate the FY25 full year GDP at 6.3 per cent.”
The official GDP data for the third quarter is expected to be released on February 28.
The report states that the percentage of indicators showing acceleration has increased to 74 per cent in Q3FY25 vs 71 per cent in Q2FY25.
Continuing the momentum, a healthy rural economy is further reinforcing stability and sustains momentum in other sectors even as rural agriculture wage growth is consistent and domestic tractor sales and rabi crop sown have picked up momentum.
The report highlights that Capex is showing improvement in Q3 FY25 with majority of the states’ Capex as a percentage of BE (Budget estimate) being lower in FY25 on date but embracing a momentum in Q3 FY25, which augurs well for future developments.
It also points out that IIP manufacturing growth has improved from 3.3 per cent in Q2 FY25 to 4.3 per cent in Q3 FY25 and the SBI Index is also showing positive momentum in Q3.
India Inc. has reported positive EBIDTA growth/margins (44 bps) after two quarters, while Corporate GVA has improved substantially (QoQ), according to the report.
The report further states that despite the global slowdown, India has continued to remain one of the fastest growing economies.
It highlights that the recent update of the IMF’s global growth forecast estimates India’s growth at 6.5 per cent for both FY25 and FY26 on the back of robust domestic demand, infrastructure support and the Government’s strategic policy interventions
The SBI has built a ‘Nowcasting Model,’ to estimate GDP statistically, with 36 high frequency indicators associated with industry activity, service activity, and global economy.
The model uses the dynamic factor model to estimate the common or representative or latent factor of all the high frequency indicators from Q4 of FY13 to Q1 of FY23.
