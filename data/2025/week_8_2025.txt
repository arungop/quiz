Title: River systems similar to blood vessels of our body, says UP CM at ‘Faith of Kumbh’ conclave
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 13:20:06 +0000
Content: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that more than 52 crore devotees have taken a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam during the ongoing Mahakumbh Mela.
This has been the largest congregation in human history for a religious event.
Speaking at the inauguration of a climate conclave that saw the role of religious leaders in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, CM Yogi Adityanath “emphasised saving nature as it faces dire challenges like pollution, over-extraction, and climate change”.
He expressed concern over the drying of rivers and called for urgent collective action to rejuvenate the rivers and their ecosystem.
“River systems are similar to the blood vessels of our body. If the vessels get choked, or toxic, the body will die. And if the tributaries and the rivers get toxic or choked, they will die,” he said and asked the faith leaders, scientists, and researchers how can we control the siltation and pollution of the rivers.
The Chief Minister said the government has channelised and dredged the Sangam bank by adopting mechanical methods.
“The flow of the river at Triveni Sangam has multiplied.”
Triveni Sangam is a sacred confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the ‘mystical’ Saraswati.
Triveni Sangam is located in Prayagraj.
Officials told IANS that ahead of the Mahakumbh 2025 the three streams of the Ganga were unified into a single flow which made Sangam more than just a river, a lifeline for millions of people, a symbol of cultural and spiritual heritage, besides a crucial ecological system that sustains life.
CM Yogi Adityanath said the government has carried out several sapling plantation drives to increase the forest cover.
“A total of 210 crore saplings were planted across the state in eight years with the survival rate of 70-80 per cent,” the Chief Minister added.
He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ban on single-use plastics.
Advocating for the need to save nature as its deterioration leads to the abnormal rise in natural calamities, CM Yogi Adityanath said two years ago 90 people died owing to lightning in just a few hours from Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) to Bihar.
“We have installed weather early warning systems, but more need to be installed.”
The Mahakumbh 2025, the world’s largest spiritual gathering, hosted the first-ever conclave.
Organised by the state Directorate of Environment and supported by the environment research organisation, iFOREST, the event titled ‘Faith of Kumbh and Climate Change’ saw more than 1,000 participants and 30 speakers representing religious institutions, government bodies, civil society, and academia.
The climate conclave comes at a time when climate change and environmental degradation are intensifying globally.
With its deep connection to sacred rivers and spiritual traditions, the Kumbh Mela offers an extraordinary platform to influence societal consciousness.
Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to galvanise climate action, the Uttar Pradesh government organised the event.
“Our Upanishads teach us that the entire world is a creation of the Almighty. We should use it, not exploit it. “Vasudaiva Kutumbakam” sees the world as one. Our rivers, animals, forests, every life form in this entire ecosystem not only take but give back to the environment. Even the small creatures like bees give back,” said Swami Mukundananda, Founder, Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust.
“At a time like this, when climate crisis is impacting every part of the world, religious and spiritual leaders must play a pivotal role in inspiring sustainable practices and climate action,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, Chief Secretary, while releasing the ‘Mahakumbh Declaration on Climate Change’.
The conclave seeks to bridge the sacred and the sustainable, recognising that faith communities, with their moral authority and grassroots reach, are indispensable allies in the fight against the climate crisis.
“We have worshipped the creator for so long, let us not forget the creation. We must preserve and protect it. If we go on like this, we will neither have the Ganga nor the Yamuna. These will be mere stories. Our nation can only progress if our environment progresses,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, President of Paramarth Niketan.
“Religion and faith hold immense power to influence society. Climate action cannot succeed unless it resonates culturally and emotionally with the masses. Unlike scientists or policymakers, faith leaders know how to take a message to the people,” said Chandra Bhushan, President and CEO of iFOREST.
A cornerstone of the conclave is the Uttar Pradesh government’s pledge to “green” religious institutions.
The state envisions religious centres and shrines becoming models of sustainability. This includes installing solar panels, implementing rainwater harvesting systems, recycling waste, banning single-use plastics, and creating green zones around sacred spaces.
The state’s pledge also includes funding faith-based organisations to promote environmental and climate education, campaigns, and actionable practices.
Initiatives like eco-friendly pilgrimages, green festivals, and sustainable temple management can reduce the carbon footprint of religious practices.

Title: India, Japan joint military exercise to begin at Mount Fuji from Feb 25
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:05:27 +0000
Content: The sixth edition of Joint Military Exercise Dharma Guardian, between India and Japan, is scheduled at Mount Fuji, Japan from February 25 to March 9, the Indian Army said on Sunday.
The exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the two forces while undertaking joint urban warfare and counter-terrorism operations under UN mandate, said the Additional Directorate General of Public Information, IHQ of MoD (Army) in a social media post.
“Building on the momentum of the Chief of the Army Staff’s (COAS) successful visit to Japan from October 14 to 17, 2024, Exercise Dharma Guardian 2025 will further strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation between India and Japan,” it said.
Earlier on February 11, special forces of India and Egypt commenced the ‘Cyclone III’ exercise at Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in Rajasthan. An official said that the exercise would conclude on February 23.

Title: Champions Trophy: Batting-sorted India look favourites for title despite no Bumrah (SWOT Analysis)
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:44:34 +0000
Content: India, the reigning ICC Men’s T20 World Cup winners, enter the Champions Trophy with a 3-0 series sweep over England. The batters impressed with their scintillating knocks, while the bowlers were at their proficient best to bamboozle the England batters.
With all their matches in Dubai, India will be keen to continue the good momentum they have right now into going all the way towards the Champions Trophy. Here’s a SWOT analysis from IANS on the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team taking part in the Champions Trophy happening for the first time after 2017.
Strength: Undoubtedly, India’s main strength lies in their top four powerful batters. Captain Rohit Sharma showed parks of his ultra-attacking way of playing in the first ten overs while hitting 119 in Cuttack, while Shubman Gill stepped up to hit a fine century in Ahmedabad. The Rohit-Gill opening combination has been the most productive pairing for India.
Since joining forces in 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus stands, making for a highly useful opening combination for the Indian team in 50-over cricket.
Virat Kohli also got a fifty in Ahmedabad to add more confidence in India’s ability to control middle overs with the bat, while Shreyas Iyer has stepped up as a very solid number four batter. With Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja batting deep and in good current all-round form, it augurs well for the Indian team in their quest to register competitive scores in Dubai.
Weakness: With no Jasprit Bumrah, it means India are without a game-changing fast-bowling force who could turn around the game in a jiffy in any phase of the game. His absence is a body blow for India, as they would look up to Pandya, Mohammed Shami, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh to step up.
Another pocket of weakness India have is diluting the powers of KL Rahul. It’s no secret that Rahul has been a handy run-scorer at number five. But with head coach Gautam Gambhir’s liking for left-right combination taking precedence, it has meant Axar has batted at that slot.
Rahul, meanwhile, has been pushed to number six, a place where his recent returns have gone down. A decision like this might backfire if India collapses like a pack of cards in the quest of getting fast runs in their batting innings.
Opportunity: India last won the Champions Trophy in 2013, when MS Dhoni was at the helm. Since then, they have reached two semi-finals and as many finals in 50-over ICC events. While they missed a home ODI World Cup win in 2023 and another Champions Trophy triumph in 2017, they now have a golden chance to make up for it in Dubai.
A Champions Trophy triumph will give Rohit another ICC trophy after winning T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies last year, while the win will also ensure a big result is in Gambhir’s kitty after having a tumultuous time in his coaching stint so far.
Threat: By picking five spinners in Axar, Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, India have decided to keep all options open in terms of bowling composition. It’s clear that they are going in with an intention to play three spinners in their playing eleven, especially with Dubai coming off hosting ILT20 matches earlier this month.
But what if they are asked to defend totals, and dew sets in the evening in Dubai, it would mean that their spin-pronged strategy would backfire, which then poses a big threat to their chances of winning the tournament.
India squad: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakravarthy.

Title: Nerveless Niemann overhauls Ancer to win LIV Golf Adelaide title
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:33:54 +0000
Content: Joaquin Niemann hit a stunning seven-under par final round of 65 to claim the LIV Golf Adelaide title on Sunday, finishing on 13-under par to win by three shots as Sergio Garcia’s Fireballs quartet claimed victory in the team event.
The Chilean trailed a trio of players that included Abraham Ancer by three shots at the start of the day’s play at the Grange Golf Club, prevailing in a battle with the 33-year-old down the back nine to win his third LIV Golf event.
“I’m starting to feel the chills now because I didn’t want to get out of the game rhythm because you never know what could happen, but now I feel that relief and it feels awesome,” Niemann said.
Niemann started the day on six-under par but had pulled himself into contention by the time he reached the turn, picking up four shots to put pressure on Ancer, who had been flawless after birdying the first two holes to take a clear lead.
Another birdie at the 12th by Niemann, his fifth of the round, saw him draw level with Ancer, and he responded with a birdie of his own to go back in front.
But the pressure on Ancer started to tell on the par-three 14th when the Mexican-American put his tee shot into a greenside bunker before dropping his first shot of the day.
And while Ancer reclaimed that shot on the 16th, he missed his first fairway of the day on the 17th, going on to drop out of the lead with another bogey.
Niemann held his nerve to birdie the last, prompting Ancer to bogey the 18th and slip into a share for second with Carlos Ortiz.
Ancer at least had the consolation of securing victory with Garcia, Luis Masaveu and David Puig as the Fireballs finished six shots ahead of Legion XIII to claim the team title.
“It’s bittersweet with Abe (Ancer), the way he played, he was there the whole day and it would’ve been nice to get the double,” Garcia said. “Super proud of the way they all fought in tricky conditions.”

Title: WPL: DC’s victory was largely driven by Shafali and Niki’s crucial innings, opines Mithali Raj
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:45:32 +0000
Content: Former India captain Mithali Raj opined that Delhi Capitals nerve-wracking last-ball victory in the WPL match was largely driven by Shafali Verma and Niki Parsad’s crucial innings.
Delhi Capitals registered a two-wicket win over Mumbai Indians at the BCA Stadium. Mumbai posted total of 164 on the back of Nat Sciver-Brunt’s efforts (80 not out off 59) and a fiery cameo from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (42 off 22).
Shafali was in her element from the get-go in the run-chase, hitting a six and four boundaries off the innings’ second over from Saika Ishaque. It was the Shafali show as DC scored 60 in the powerplay.
Speaking about the high-intensity match on Jio Hotstar, Mithali said, “What can I say? The kind of match we witnessed today was remarkable. Last evening’s game was high-scoring, with a chase of 201 and big hits. But today, it was all about intensity. The momentum kept shifting between the teams so frequently that until the last ball, no one could predict the winner.”
Commenting on Niki’s performance, Mithali said the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain stepped into a high-pressure match and and managed it with impressive composure.
“Delhi Capitals’ victory was largely driven by Shafali Verma’s strong start, but Niki Prasad’s crucial 35-run innings was equally significant. When wickets were falling around her, she remained at the crease, providing stability. It was her first game, and coming fresh from the ICC Women’s U-19 World Cup as a winning captain, she stepped into a high-pressure match and handled it with remarkable poise. There must have been nerves, but she fought through them brilliantly.
“Though we didn’t see much of it, her innings today was mature beyond her years. She had solid support from Alice Capsey and Sarah Bryce. In the end, as the game came down to two runs off two balls, she went for a big shot, which will come with experience. But what she has done today for Delhi Capitals is massive,” she said.
Reflecting on Shafali’s show, the former skipper added, “I think anyone stepping into Shafali Verma’s shoes would acknowledge how she has never shown a defensive approach. Right from the second ball, she started scoring runs, playing her shots with her usual flair. That’s just her style. The only way to dismiss her today was to outthink her, and I understand that feeling because I’ve been in that situation myself.
“At one point, she had too much time and wasn’t sure where to place the ball. Just before her dismissal, the fielding side adjusted their setup, bringing mid-on up and pushing deep square leg back because she had found boundaries there. She instinctively aimed to clear mid-on but ended up playing into the fielder’s hands, resulting in a crucial wicket.”
Former West Indian cricketer Stacy-Ann King commented on Niki Prasad’s brilliant innings, saying, “We saw what she could do in terms of India Under-19 team. But she didn’t have much chance to bat because of G Trisha and of course Kamalini, who were exceptional. After she started off a little shaky, she eventually just played her shots, and it was amazing.”
Stacy-Ann also shared her insights on the Mumbai Indians’ performance and said, The Harmanpreet-led side made a critical mistake during those five balls when MI didn’t complete their full 20 overs.
“When Harmanpreet spoke, she mentioned that those five balls where MI didn’t bat the full 20 overs were a critical mistake. Even scoring a single run in that phase could have made a difference. This is an opportunity for them to reassess their approach, particularly in handling their spinners,” she said.
“Hayley Matthews picked up key wickets, including Shafali and Sarah, but conceded 15 runs before that. Both teams can take valuable lessons from each other on how they approach their innings and how their bowlers strategise moving forward,” the West Indian added.

Title: Heart has ‘sweet taste’ receptors, can sense artificial sweeteners: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:11:20 +0000
Content: Researchers have found that the heart possesses “sweet taste” receptors, similar to those on our tongues, and stimulating these receptors with sweet substances can modulate the heartbeat.
The discovery opens new avenues for understanding heart function and potentially for developing novel treatments for heart failure.
The new research found that these receptors are not just present on heart muscle but also functional.
When the researchers stimulated these receptors in both human and mouse heart cells using aspartame, a common artificial sweetener, they observed a significant increase in the force of heart muscle contraction and accelerated calcium handling – key processes for a healthy heartbeat.
While taste receptors are traditionally associated with the tongue and our ability to perceive flavours, recent studies have shown that these receptors exist in other parts of the body, where they likely play different roles.
This new study is the first to identify specific “sweet taste” receptors, known as TAS1R2 and TAS1R3, on the surface of heart muscle cells.
“After you eat a meal, it’s been shown that your heart rate and blood pressure actually are increasing,” said Micah Yoder, a graduate student in the lab of Jonathan Kirk at Loyola University Chicago.
Previously, this was thought to be a neural axis that’s being signaled.
“But we’re proposing a more direct consequence, where we have a spike in our blood sugar after eating a meal, and that’s binding to these sweet taste receptors on the heart muscle cells, causing a difference in the heartbeat,” he added.
Intriguingly, the researchers also found that these receptors are more abundant in the hearts of patients with heart failure, suggesting a possible link to disease.
Further investigation revealed that stimulating the receptors triggers a cascade of molecular events within the heart cells, involving key proteins that control calcium flow and muscle contraction.
Additionally, their research may explain why high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is linked to arrhythmogenesis, or an irregular heartbeat.
Not only are these sweet taste receptors particularly stimulated by artificial sweeteners like aspartame, overstimulation of these sweet taste receptors lead to a an increase in arrhythmic like behaviour in the heart cells, researchers found.
However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of stimulating these receptors in the heart as well as how these receptors might be targeted to strengthen the heart in the case of heart failure.
The work was set to be presented at the 69th Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Los Angeles. The Biophysical Society has been established to lead development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics.

Title: US says website update routine, after removal of reference to Taiwan independence
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 07:28:34 +0000
Content: The U.S. State Department said it has made a routine update to the Taiwan section of its website, after the removal of previous wording saying it did not support Taiwan’s formal independence, among other changes that cheered the government in Taipei.
The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.
But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence”, the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organisations “where applicable”.
The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, was sworn in to his second term in the White House.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time.
“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the spokesperson said, referring to Washington’s officially taking no position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the subject.
“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.
“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialogue, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”
China’s foreign ministry has yet to respond to requests for comment on the changes in the website’s wording.
On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations”.
Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that only the island’s people can decide their future.
Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up the People’s Republic of China.

Boxing legend Mary Kom reflected on overcoming societal expectations. “In the beginning, it was very difficult because boxing is not considered a women’s sport. I just wanted to prove myself in front of all the girls and women in the country. In doing so, I have brought glory to the nation by becoming a World Champion multiple times,” she said
Two-time Paralympic champion shooter Avani Lekhara shared how knowledge helped her conquer fear: “We fear things that we don’t have knowledge about. I started gaining knowledge and improving myself, and in this way, my fear gradually decreased.”

Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:56:43 +0000
Content: A court in Mauritius has released former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on bail following his arrest on charges of money laundering, a magistrate at the court said.
Last month, the country’s former central bank governor was detained and released on bail after being charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.
An Indian Ocean archipelago, Mauritius is an offshore financial centre that markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia.
“He (Jugnauth) shall not interfere directly or indirectly with any witness or potential witness,” Rishan Chineah, the magistrate at the bail and remand court in the capital, Port Louis, said on Sunday.
The magistrate also barred Jugnauth from communicating about the case with anyone, except for investigation authorities or the court itself, and ordered him to appear on Monday to complete the bail process.
Jugnauth’s lawyer, Raouf Gulbul, told reporters his client denied the charges.
Jugnauth was provisionally charged with money laundering, the director of public prosecution told the court in a charge sheet.
In November, Mauritius’ new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam announced an audit of public finances days after questioning the accuracy of some government data compiled by the previous administration.

Title: China’s Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:13:47 +0000
Content: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium was attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S.
Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, BYD’s  Wang Chuanfu, Unitree’s Wang Xingxing, and CATL’s Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed.
Meituan’s Wang Xing, China Feihe’s  Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed.
Tencent’s 0700.HK Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country’s business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said.
The symposium also comes as DeepSeek’s AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China’s broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets.
Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development.
But China’s efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities.
“It’s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.”
Tech shares in Hong Kong have roared higher in recent weeks on a combination of optimism about the DeepSeek AI breakthrough and a thawing of authorities’ approach to internet giants.
The Hang Seng technology index. HSTECH hit a three-year high in morning trade on Monday, having rallied on Friday after Reuters reported Xi was to chair Monday’s symposium. It slipped in volatile afternoon trade and was last down 1.3%.
Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
“Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis.
“Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.” (Reuters)

Title: Maddison earns Tottenham 1-0 victory over Man Utd
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:58:10 +0000
Content: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison’s early goal proved enough for the hosts to edge a 1-0 victory over fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United on Sunday.
Maddison, back in the starting lineup after injury, tapped home a rebound from close range in the 13th minute to settle a contest in which both sides showed their frailties.
Victory eased the pressure on Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou with his side moving above United into 12th place with 30 points. United dropped to 15th with 29 points.
It was another underwhelming display by Ruben Amorim’s United although they did have their chances with Alejandro Garnacho wasting a golden opportunity in the first half.

Title: Liverpool edge past Wolves to go seven points clear at top
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:52:51 +0000
Content: Premier League leaders Liverpool extended their advantage to seven points with a trickier-than-expected 2-1 win over lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield on Sunday courtesy of goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah.
Arne Slot’s team had looked to be cruising at 2-0 after Diaz bundled in on 15 minutes and won a penalty later in the half for strike partner Salah to convert with ease – a 23rd league goal for the league’s leading marksman.
But Wolves, fighting for their lives near the bottom, gave them a few frights and punished Liverpool for a sloppy second half when Matheus Cunha curled a low shot brilliantly past Alisson in the 67th minute.
In an edgy finale, Liverpool held on for the win, taking them to 60 points and still on track for the title with nearest rivals Arsenal on 53. Both have 13 games left.
“We just managed to dig deep,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said. “The second half was a slog … everyone gets nervous. But it’s a massive win for us and another game down.”
Wolves are 17th on 19 points, two above the drop zone.
Although Liverpool were far from their best, especially in a nervy second half, victory was a huge relief after a week of unusual slip-ups including an FA Cup defeat by second-tier Plymouth and a last-gasp equaliser for Everton against them in the league.
“We’d love to dominate for the full 90 minutes but it is the Premier League and Wolves can punish you and create dangerous moments against you. It says a lot we kept fighting and kept going and got the three points,” said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk.
“At times we were sloppy as well and we couldn’t keep the ball as well as we can.”
ALL-ACTION DIAZ
In the first half, the Reds looked comfortable after Diaz slotted home when Toti Gomes’ attempted clearance dropped kindly for him. The speedy Colombian was then brought down by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa for Salah to do what he always does – score easily from the spot – in the 37th minute.
Cunha was by far Wolves’ best player and had put a free kick just over before his glorious effort from outside the box had the away fans dreaming of a comeback.
Wolves’ recently-signed midfielder Marshall Munetsi, who saw a shot superbly saved by Alisson when one-on-one, said the players were proud of their second-half performance.
“We created a lot of chances and made them uncomfortable … the second half was the identity of the team, this is what the coach wants. This is something we have to keep doing.”
With a colossal fight against relegation to come, Wolves’ coach Vitor Pereira echoed that after so nearly matching the Premier League’s best team.
“We must play the first half as we played the second half, this is what I want to see in my team – the personality, courage and identity,” he said. “Even the best players in the world, if you press them they make mistakes.”

Jaishankar emphasized India’s commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and ensuring a stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

Additionally, the two leaders unveiled the book Mandvi to Muscat: Indian Community and the Shared History of India and Oman. Brought out by the Indian Embassy in Muscat, the book highlights the deep historical connections between the Indian diaspora and Oman, underscoring centuries-old ties that continue to influence bilateral relations.
On the sidelines of the conference, Jaishankar also met with the foreign ministers of Brunei, Bangladesh, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Nepal to discuss key regional and global issues of mutual interest.

Title: Brazilian youngster Fonseca triumphs at Argentina Open
Publication Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2025 05:30:13 +0000
Content: Joao Fonseca became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP tournament on Sunday after the 18-year-old captured the Argentina Open title with a 6-4 7-6(1) win over home favourite Francisco Cerundolo.
Fonseca has established himself as one of the game’s most exciting young talents with his victory at the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah in December and his win over ninth seed Andrey Rublev in the first round of the Australian Open last month.
He lost to Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego in five sets in the second round at Melbourne Park.
“It is a dream, I work every day for these moments. Playing a final away from home, in Argentina, is difficult,” said Fonseca after denying fifth seed Cerundolo the title in front of a raucous crowd in Buenos Aires.
“It’s very special and I’ve taken another step forward in my career and I’m closer to my dream of becoming world number one,” he told a press conference.
Fonseca also defeated Argentines Tomas Martin Etcheverry, Federico Coria and Mariano Navone in the earlier rounds before beating Serbian Laslo Djere in the last four.
Cerundolo had stunned top seed Alexander Zverev of Germany in the quarter-finals before knocking out Spain’s Pedro Martinez in the semis. (Reuters)

Title: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured

Content: ‘Conclave’ named best film at BAFTAs, ‘The Brutalist’ also honoured
Papal selection thriller “Conclave” and period drama “The Brutalist” were the big winners at the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, winning four prizes each.
“Conclave”, which had led nominations with 12 nods, won the night’s most coveted award, best film, as well as outstanding British film, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
“We live in a time of a crisis of democracy and institutions that are usually used to bring us together are used to pull us apart,” “Conclave” director Edward Berger said in his acceptance speech for the outstanding British film award.
“And sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith in that situation but that’s why we make movies and that’s why we made this movie.”
“The Brutalist”, a three-and-a-half hour tale about a Hungarian immigrant architect trying to rebuild his life in the United States post-World War Two, had also been considered a frontrunner for best film. It won best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for its star, Adrien Brody.
“This film is really about this pursuit of leaving something meaningful and I think that is something we can all relate to,” Brody said in his acceptance speech.
“The Brutalist” also won original score and cinematography.
In one of the big surprises of the night, Mikey Madison won the leading actress category for portraying an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch’s son in “Anora”.
Many had considered the frontrunners to be Demi Moore, who has received multiple honours for her performance in body horror “The Substance”, and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in “Hard Truths”.
“I really wasn’t expecting this,” Madison said.
“I want to take to a moment to recognise the sex worker community … you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be your friend.”
“Anora”, considered a strong awards season contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month’s Academy Awards, was also up for best film, as was Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown”.
SALDANA, CULKIN WIN
Fellow best film nominee “Emilia Perez”, which mixes the diverse genres of musical and crime, triumphed in the film not in the English language category.
“This is too nice, you shouldn’t have done that,” director Jacques Audiard said, accepting his award. “This award is not just for me but everyone who worked tirelessly on this film.”
He thanked the film’s cast members, including an absent Karla Sofia Gascon, who had been nominated for leading actress.
Zoe Saldana won supporting actress for her portrayal of a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman.
“Emilia Perez”, had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.
In the supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin won for dramedy “A Real Pain”. The movie also picked up best original screenplay for writer-director Jesse Eisenberg.
