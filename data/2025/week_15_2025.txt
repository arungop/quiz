Title: Lok Sabha speaker highlights India’s inclusive constitutional vision at 150th IPU Assembly in Tashkent
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 13:35:18 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla today highlighted the inclusive and welfarist nature of Constitution of India, mentioning that “the spirit of the Indian Constitution is to treat all citizens equally, provide them with equal opportunities, and integrate the marginalized and backward sections of society into the ‘mainstream of progress.’”
Delivering the keynote address on the theme “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice” at the historic 150th Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Om Birla observed that “In recent years, the Indian Parliament has passed several legislations that promote social justice and security and encourage the inclusion of all sections of society.” On the occasion, he also extended Ram Navami greetings to the gathering at the 150th assembly of IPU.

Referring to the Parliament’s perennial concern for safeguarding the interests of the vulnerable segments of society, he added that “Bills like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act-2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam-2023 safeguard the interests of all sections of society.” In this context, he also referred to new labor laws and codes passed by Parliament for the welfare and social security of workers in the unorganized sector.
Stressing that Indian Parliament has taken several measures prioritising justice and rule of law, Om Birla mentioned that “By replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, India has established the primacy of justice.” Referring to functioning of parliamentary committees in achieving the goals of development and social justice, Om Birla noted that the various parliamentary committees, often referred to as mini parliaments, perform a complementary function to the efforts of Parliament and the government. He highlighted that the Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment; Committee on Women Empowerment; Committee on Labour and Skill Development, and other diverse committees monitor welfare programmes leading to implementation of schemes with effectiveness and accountability.
Om Birla stressed that Government of India works with a mission to achieve targets set for key human development indicators. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that “Under the world’s largest health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), free health insurance is being provided to the bottom 40% of India’s population.”
Praising the strong and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Om Birla said, “Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India has achieved the distinction of being the world’s fastest-growing major economy with a 105% GDP growth over the past decade and is rapidly progressing towards its goal of Viksit Bharat in 2047.” Noting that India is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on its way toward becoming the third-largest economy, Om Birla said that India is playing a leading role in the world in fields like innovation, AI, startups, space and defense technology, IT, fintech, pharma, and others.
He hoped that the discussions at the IPU Assembly would provide all delegations with new perspectives and will allow parliaments around the world to take concrete steps toward building a just, inclusive, and prosperous society.
Speaking on the role of IPU in the present world order, Om Birla mentioned that the IPU continues to add new dimensions to global parliamentary cooperation. He underlined that the theme chosen for the 150th IPU Assembly reflects the expansion of the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which is deeply rooted in Indian culture, tradition, and philosophy.
India-Vietnam Bilateral Engagement On The Sidelines of IPU
On the sidelines of the 150th IPU Summit, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met H.E. Mr. Tran Thanh Man, President, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Speaking on the occasion, Om Birla fondly recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022, marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Vietnam. He also emphasized the close cultural and historical ties between the two countries, which have strengthened through high-level discussions in recent years.
Om Birla expressed satisfaction that both countries are progressing toward sustainable development, driven by their respective visions for 2047 (India) and 2045 (Vietnam). He emphasized that cooperation in various sectors such as defense, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy has helped shape their future frameworks.
Om Birla noted that both countries’ parliamentary institutions play a key role in meeting people’s expectations and promoting public welfare, with India utilizing emerging technologies to enhance parliamentary processes and citizen participation. He also informed that the *Digital Parliament* initiative in India has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in parliamentary operations. He also highlighted the significant number of Vietnamese students benefiting from educational and training scholarships in India.
The President of the National Assembly of Vietnam extended best wishes on Ram Navami. He also emphasized the cultural ties between the two countries. The President also underlined the need for strengthening the close defence and technology ties between India and Vietnam. He extended an invitation to Om Birla to visit Vietnam. Formation of a friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a pointed dig at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy
Addressing a public gathering in Rameswaram after inaugurating the New Pamban Railway Bridge, the prime minister said that although he regularly receives letters from Tamil Nadu leaders, none of them are signed in Tamil.
“Sometimes, I am surprised when I receive letters from some leaders of Tamil Nadu — none of them are signed in Tamil. If we are truly proud of Tamil, then I would request everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil,” PM Modi said, emphasizing the importance of embracing and promoting one’s native language.
The PM also highlighted the central government’s efforts to promote Tamil language and culture globally.
“We are working continuously to ensure that Tamil language and Tamil heritage reach every corner of the world,” he added.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was felicitated by BJP leaders as he arrived to address a public meeting in Rameswaram city of Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, after inaugurating India’s vertical sea-lift bridge, the New Pamban Bridge.
Tamil Nadu Governor R. N. Ravi and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present during the felicitation.

Title: Flood threat: Vadodara launches rapid river deepening project
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:39:51 +0000
Content: The Gujarat government has launched large-scale work under the Vishwamitri River Project, aimed at enhancing the river’s flow capacity and improving the management of urban water bodies.
An official stated that the project, currently in full swing, seeks to increase the Vishwamitri River’s water-carrying capacity by 40 percent within a target period of 100 days.
Last year, Vadodara experienced severe flooding, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and led to the displacement of residents.
Determined to prevent a recurrence of such devastation, the government has fast-tracked river rejuvenation efforts. These include deepening and widening the Vishwamitri River, along with connecting key water bodies such as Ajwa Salav, Pratappura Sarovar, Dena Lake, and several city canals.
According to the official, a total of 526 machines have been deployed across various sites to execute the project on a war footing.
So far, 9.98 lakh cubic meters of soil and sludge have been excavated from the riverbed and surrounding areas.
“In addition, approximately 68 hectares of forest area have been cleared to facilitate smoother water flow. This is one of the most comprehensive flood prevention initiatives the city has ever seen. We are racing against time to complete the work before the monsoon,” said a senior project engineer.
He added that, alongside the river rejuvenation, efforts are also underway to clean and restore ten key lakes within the city.
“Work has been completed in two of these lakes, while development is ongoing in two others. In total, 474 deep rainwater recharge wells have been planned as part of the project, of which 25 have already been completed,” he said.
These wells are expected to improve groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff during heavy rainfall.
The project also includes a robust waste management component. As part of the cleaning and excavation process, 500 metric tons of plastic waste have been collected and sent to the Atladara processing plant for recycling.
Additionally, 11,000 metric tons of gravel recovered during the operation have been crushed and stored at the Atladara facility for potential reuse in infrastructure work.
Officials emphasized that the Vishwamitri River Project is not only about flood control — it is also a crucial step toward urban environmental restoration and climate resilience.
“With Vadodara’s growing population and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, the city’s natural drainage systems and water bodies require urgent and sustained attention,” they noted.

Title: Healthy start, hopeful future: Gujarat’s transformative healthcare journey
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 10:34:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Swasth Bharat, Samriddh Bharat” has served as the guiding force behind Gujarat’s remarkable progress in maternal and child healthcare under CM Bhupendra Patel, in alignment with the 2025 World Health Day theme, “Healthy Start, Hopeful Future.”
With initiatives focused on empowering women and improving neonatal care, Gujarat has halved its Maternal Mortality Rate—from 112 (2011-13) to 57 (2020). Over 14 lakh pregnant women annually receive timely check-ups, immunizations, and nutrition services. The state has also established 121 First Referral Units, 153 Blood Storage Units, and 20 Maternity ICUs, achieving an institutional delivery rate of 99.97%.
Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 54 (2005) to 23 (2020), thanks to programs like HBNC, HBYC, SAANS, and Stop Diarrhea, supported by a strong network of newborn care units.
Under SH-RBSK, over 1.61 crore children are screened annually. The initiative also facilitated 206 kidney, 37 liver, and 211 bone marrow transplants, and free treatment for thousands of children with serious health conditions.
The “Breaking the Silence” campaign has restored hearing in 3,260 children via free cochlear implants. In 2025, Gujarat won two Gold SKOCH Awards for excellence in child health.
Gujarat also pioneered digital health cards for schoolchildren, with over 1.15 crore cards issued. Between 2019–2023, the state ranked first nationally in newborn screening and congenital disorder management.

Title: Samsung seeks ways to cushion blow from US tariffs
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:53:39 +0000
Content: Tech giant Samsung Electronics may need to overhaul its global production strategy as new U.S. reciprocal tariffs could significantly impact its smartphone business, industry sources said on Sunday.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a minimum 10 percent “baseline” tariff on all imports to the United States, along with country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on goods from South Korea.
The reciprocal tariffs—covering most product categories except for items such as vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals—are set to take effect from Wednesday (U.S. time), according to Yonhap news agency.
Experts and industry analysts noted that Samsung Electronics will need to adapt to the U.S. tariff policy by leveraging its strategy of diversifying production bases.
Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, currently produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam, which now faces a 46 percent reciprocal tariff on goods entering the U.S. The remainder of its smartphone production is spread across India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea.
India faces a 26 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and Brazil just 10 percent—making Brazil a potentially attractive hub for serving the U.S. market.
Sources suggest Samsung may consider ramping up production in India, Brazil, and South Korea, particularly for premium models intended for American consumers.
Brazil, in particular, stands out due to its low tariffs and geographic proximity to the U.S., they added.
The company is expected to reassess its production strategy ahead of the summer launch of its next-generation foldable smartphones, but for now, it is proceeding cautiously.
“Nothing has been decided yet,” said an official from Samsung Electronics.
South Korea’s economy is likely to face headwinds as the U.S. administration’s reciprocal tariffs may severely impact the country’s exports to the United States, while also disrupting the global market—potentially dealing a further blow to South Korean trade, local experts warned.
They expressed serious concerns for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, especially as the Trump administration continues to implement protectionist trade policies, including 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as similarly high duties on foreign-made cars.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:18:39 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. He was also garlanded by the temple priest.
The Ramanathaswamy Shiva Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple holds mythological significance as it is believed that Lord Ram established and worshipped at this temple before crossing the Ram Setu bridge to reach Sri Lanka to rescue his wife from Ravan. It also features the longest corridor among Hindu temples in India.
Governor R.N. Ravi had also visited the temple before the inauguration of the bridge.
Earlier today, while sharing an aerial view during his return journey from Sri Lanka, PM Modi highlighted how he was able to have a “darshan” of both Ram Setu and Ayodhya’s ‘Surya Tilak’.
“On the way back from Sri Lanka a short while ago, I was blessed to have a darshan of the Ram Setu. And, as a divine coincidence, it happened at the same time as the Surya Tilak was taking place in Ayodhya. Blessed to have the darshan of both,” the PM said in a post on X.
PM Modi is also scheduled to hold roadshows in a Tamil Nadu city.

Title: Sri Lanka releases 14 Indian fishermen during PM Modi’s visit
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:40:36 +0000
Content: In a significant gesture underscoring growing bilateral goodwill, Sri Lanka on Sunday released 14 Indian fishermen during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation. 
The release followed detailed discussions between PM Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier on Saturday, during which the long-standing issue of fishermen’s arrests was taken up.
The Prime Minister, during his remarks at a joint press briefing, said, “We discussed the fishermen’s issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats.”
The arrest of Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, by Sri Lankan authorities for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters has been a recurring point of tension.
Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by Sri Lankan forces, raising concerns among coastal communities and prompting repeated appeals for intervention.
Addressing a press conference following the talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days.”
“This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister said himself during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides,” Misri added.
The release of 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during PM Modi’s visit, which included the joint inauguration of India-backed railway projects such as the upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway track and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:33:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the New Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. This landmark project is India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge, showcasing the nation’s growing engineering and infrastructural capabilities.
The 2.07-kilometre-long bridge, spanning the Palk Strait, stands as a testament to India’s engineering prowess and visionary infrastructure development. PM Modi, accompanied by Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi, flagged off the first train to cross the sea bridge.
A demonstration showcased the bridge’s functionality, with visuals capturing key moments. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) boat successfully navigated under the structure, highlighting its vertical clearance and maritime accessibility. Following the boat’s passage, a train crossed the bridge, demonstrating its structural integrity and operational readiness.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Vaishnaw hoisted the BJP flag at the Pamban Bridge site and congratulated party workers on the BJP’s foundation day.  
“The resolve of Antyodaya and the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’… Heartfelt congratulations to all workers on the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” his post read.
Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi also visited the Swamy Temple in Rameswaram ahead of the inauguration.
The story of the bridge dates back to 1914, when British engineers constructed the original Pamban Bridge—a cantilever structure with a Scherzer rolling lift span—connecting Rameswaram Island to mainland India. The new bridge, sanctioned in 2019, is three metres taller than the original, enhancing sea connectivity and accommodating maritime traffic more efficiently.
The bridge has long served as a vital link for pilgrims, tourists, and trade. However, the harsh marine environment and increasing transportation demands necessitated a modern upgrade. In 2019, the central government approved the construction of a technologically advanced, future-ready replacement.
Constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna PSU under the Ministry of Railways, the New Pamban Bridge has been designed to meet higher standards for speed, load-bearing capacity, and maritime clearance. It enhances connectivity while showcasing India’s capabilities in safety, durability, and innovation.
As India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, the New Pamban Bridge joins the ranks of other iconic international structures known for their engineering achievements—such as the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Tower Bridge in London, and the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.

Title: Lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust, hope: Amit Shah congratulates party workers on BJP’s Foundation Day
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:46:27 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated party workers on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Foundation Day on Sunday, saying that the lotus symbol has emerged as a powerful emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the people.
In a post on X, Shah said, “Today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the countrymen. The works of service, security, and cultural awakening that the BJP has undertaken in the past decade will become milestones in the days to come.”
“Crores of BJP workers, steadfastly adhering to ideological commitment, will continue to contribute to nation-building” he added. 
Recalling the party’s key achievements, including the revocation of Article 370 and the movement to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said the party has always ensured the welfare of the poor, the underprivileged, and women.
“Whether it is about taking the Shri Ram Temple movement to every individual, making the removal of Article 370 its resolve, or ensuring the welfare of the poor, the deprived, and women — BJP has, since its inception, made the nation’s interest its highest goal,” his post read.
Highlighting the party’s journey since its inception in 1980, Shah said the BJP has consistently demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies and ensuring welfare for farmers.
“In its four-decade journey, BJP has demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies, providing every poor person with housing, food, health insurance, and promoting the welfare of farmers all at once,” the home minister said.
The BJP was officially formed on April 6, 1980, based on the Panch Nishthas (Five Commitments). However, the party’s roots trace back to the formation of the Jana Sangh in 1950.
The Jana Sangh was founded by former Union Minister Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the Emergency ended in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party to oppose the Congress. However, a dispute arose over dual membership—whether members affiliated with the RSS could remain in the Janata Party. This led to the Jana Sangh members parting ways and forming the BJP on April 6, 1980.
Since its formation, the BJP has had two Prime Ministers: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.
The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it won 303 seats—the highest in its history.

Title: PM Modi, Lankan President Dissanayake launch India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:16:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.

Title: Over 50 nations want to start trade talks with US after tariffs, Trump officials say
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 07:31:58 +0000
Content: More than 50 nations have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks since U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out sweeping new tariffs, top officials said on Sunday as they defended levies that wiped out nearly $6 trillion in value from U.S. stocks last week and downplayed economic fallout.
On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump’s top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the U.S. in the global trade order. They also tried to minimize the economic shocks from last week’s tumultuous rollout, ahead of Monday’s expected bumpy opening of Asian stock markets.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the U.S. since last Wednesday’s announcement, putting Trump in a position of power.
Neither Bessent nor the other officials named the countries or offered details about the talks. But simultaneously negotiating with multiple countries could pose a logistical challenge for the Trump administration and prolong economic uncertainty.

“He’s created maximum leverage for himself,” Bessent said on NBC News’ ‘Meet the Press.’
Bessent downplayed the stock market drop and said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession based on the tariffs, citing stronger-than-anticipated U.S. jobs growth.
Trump jolted economies around the world after he announced broad tariffs on U.S. imports, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a global trade war and recession.
JPMorgan economists now estimate the tariffs will result in full-year U.S. gross domestic product declining by 0.3%, down from an earlier estimate of 1.3% growth, and that the unemployment rate will climb to 5.3% from 4.2% now.
As investors girded for the opening of stock markets in Asia, the Republican president spent the weekend in Florida, playing golf and posting a video of his swing to social media on Sunday.
TARIFF DEALMAKING
U.S. customs agents began collecting Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (4:01 a.m. GMT).
Some nations have already signaled a willingness to engage with the U.S. to avoid the duties.
Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te on Sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks with the U.S., pledging to remove trade barriers and saying Taiwanese companies will raise their U.S. investments.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would seek a reprieve from a 17% tariff on the country’s goods during a planned meeting with Trump on Monday.
An Indian government official told Reuters the country does not plan to retaliate against a 26% tariff and said talks were under way with the U.S. over a possible deal.
In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – a Trump ally – pledged on Sunday to shield businesses that suffered damage from a planned 20% tariff on goods from the European Union.
Italian wine producers and U.S. importers at a wine fair in Verona on Sunday said business had already slowed and feared more lasting damage.
NO STRATEGY TO TANK STOCK MARKET
Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after the worst week for U.S. stocks since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis five years ago.
The S&P 1500 Composite Index, among the widest measures of the U.S. market, lost nearly $6 trillion in value in the two days after Trump’s announcement and has had almost $10 trillion wiped out since mid-February, a significant blow to millions of Americans’ retirement nest eggs.
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied that the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He said there would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.
In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump shared a video that suggested his tariffs aimed to hammer the stock market on purpose in a bid to force lower interest rates.
The social media post fueled global debate over whether Trump’s tariffs were part of a permanent new tariff regime or simply a negotiating tactic that could lead to the tariffs being eased through concessions by other countries.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ that they could be the latter, saying the tariffs would remain in place “for days and weeks.”
The process used to determine the tariffs came under scrutiny last week after they were applied to uninhabited Antarctic islands populated by penguins and other tiny, remote places.
Lutnick said a comprehensive approach was needed so that small nations could not be used by larger countries to circumvent the tariffs.
“Basically (Trump) said, ‘I can’t let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them,'” Lutnick said.

Title: ‘Adolescence’ TV drama exposes global issue of teenage violence
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:55:13 +0000
Content: TV drama “Adolescence” has shocked and captivated audiences around the world, providing what campaigners say is a rare opportunity to tackle the largely hidden world of online misogyny and violence.
Since its release on Netflix on March 13, more than 96 million people have watched the British four-episode series that begins with armed police raiding the home of a terrified 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a young girl, and ends with a raw illustration of the pain of his broken family.
The action in between, with each hour-long episode shot in a dizzying single take, slowly destroys the initial disbelief that a child so young could commit such a violent crime.
It depicts a toxic online culture known loosely as the manosphere in which common teenage male insecurities about attractiveness and romantic failure can warp into resentment and hatred of the opposite sex.
“There are people who will watch it and go ‘but that boy couldn’t do that’. The point is that boy can do it,” said Susie McDonald, CEO of charity Tender that educates children and adults on healthy relationships
“Suddenly the possibility becomes normal, and so we begin to say, what on earth can we do to stop that from happening?”
The show is number one in the Netflix global Top 10 and heads the charts in almost every country – from Brazil to Bahrain – for which the streaming platform provides data.
“Although on the surface it feels like it’s a very British production … actually, the themes that it’s dealing with: what our children are doing online, what they’re listening to … I think that’s as important in America, as it is India, as it is Australia,” film critic Kaleem Aftab told Reuters.
Portuguese police produced a guide for parents to explain the hidden meaning of emojis used by young people – a plot component in the show. The Sydney Morning Herald produced a guide on how to talk to children more effectively than the parents in the programme.
British police urged parents to look for signs their child may be being radicalised online, using data showing 60% of referrals to its terrorism prevention system came from children aged 17 or under to highlight the scale of the wider problem.
HIT HOME HARD IN DOWNING STREET
“Adolescence” reached the home of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who watched it with his teenage son and daughter.
“It hit home hard,” Starmer said in a statement, backing a scheme to make the show available to schools across the country and encouraging a national conversation on the isues it raises.
“This isn’t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.”
Matt Pinkett, an author on masculinity and a teacher, described how the show had left him fizzing with lesson ideas, but said it needed to be used carefully to avoid further marginalising boys already at risk of radicalisation.
The show has created a moment that campaigners, police and educators have been waiting for: a general public prepared to accept the uncomfortable truth that they do not know what their children are doing online, and that they all need help.
“This is the start of something. What we need to do as an education profession is make sure that we take advantage of that,” said Pepe Di’Iasio, General Secretary of Britain’s Association of School and College Leaders.
McDonald said Tender was working with Netflix to produce materials teachers can use in schools, using script excerpts and clips of scenes to spark wider discussion.
“This (show) is not going to solve the problem, but it’s enabled everybody to actually notice that there is a problem,” she said.

Title: Second measles death reported in Texas as outbreak spreads to 22 U.S. states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:29:27 +0000
Content: A second child with measles has died in Texas, state officials said on Sunday, in an outbreak of the childhood disease that has resulted in nearly 500 cases in Texas and has spread across 22 states.
The unvaccinated school-aged child, who had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
“The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,” Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email.
It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late Januaryin Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is about 82%, below the 95% considered protective for those who cannot be vaccinated.
When asked about the measles death, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One that if the outbreak progresses his administration will “have to take action very strongly.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in a post on X, identified the child as 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and said he visited Texas on Sunday to comfort the family.
Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocatewho has declared that vaccination is a personal choice, said on Sunday vaccines are the best protection against measles.
“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there were 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas.
Kennedy has previously also recommended Vitamin A as a measles treatment, along with good nutrition. While Vitamin A has been shown in some studies in developing countries to lessen the severity of symptoms, it can lead to liver toxicity in high quantities.
Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, wrote on X after the child’s death was disclosed: “Everyone should be vaccinated.”
“Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies,” Cassidy wrote on X.
Cassidy had backed Kennedy’s confirmation after Kennedy promised not to make changes to vaccine oversight.
The measles vaccine is 97% effective after two shots.
He said teams from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been redeployed to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott.
The CDC on its website says the vaccine is “the best protection against measles,” which spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.
KENNEDY HEARING POSTPONED
Cassidy last week called for Kennedy to appear before the Senate health committee on April 10 to discuss the U.S. health department’s restructuring in which 10,000 people were being laid off, including from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But on Friday a committee official said the hearing would not occur on April 10 because seven days’ notice had not been given as required by committee procedure. No date has been set.
The Texas Department of State Health Services reportedon Friday 59 new measles cases in three days, a 15% jump, for a total of 481 in the state since late January.
Related measles outbreaks have been reported in other states, including New Mexico and Oklahoma. In addition, an unvaccinated New Mexico adult tested positive for measles after dying in March.
As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a weekly nationwide increase of 124 measles cases, bringing the total to 607 so far this year. That compares to a nationwide total in 2024 of 285 reported cases.
CDC officials said 97% of U.S. cases are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.
Pediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease.

Title: Djokovic motivated again after Miami run but keeping expectations
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:25:48 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic said reaching his first final of the 2025 season at the Miami Open helped him find the motivation to continue his quest for more titles as the 37-year-old looks to win his 100th ATP trophy during the clay season.
The 24-times Grand Slam champion has not won a title on the men’s tour since his ATP Finals triumph during an extraordinary 2023 although he bagged the Olympic gold medal during the Paris Games at Roland Garros last year.
Djokovic’s bid to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only three men in the professional era to claim 100 or more ATP trophies ended in a defeat by Jakub Mensik last week but the Serb said he was spurred on by his level in Miami.
“There’s no doubt it has become more difficult throughout my career but the performances in Miami, when I’m playing that way, it gives me more inspiration to keep going,” Djokovic told reporters in Monte Carlo.
“It just feels great on the court when you’re striking the ball well and winning matches. Obviously when you start losing early you have more questions and inner voices, which are bringing doubts about whether you should keep going.
“I’m glad in Miami I found that joy on the court and performance levels, so let’s see if I can carry that into clay. It’s a different surface and I’ve not had much time to get used to this tournament so my expectations aren’t that high.”
Djokovic will be without his coach Andy Murray at the ongoing Monte Carlo Masters, with the Scot expected to return in Madrid later this month.
“It was never part of the agreement to work with Andy this week,” said Djokovic.
“I was thinking about who I wanted, anyone apart from my fitness coach and physio, and my brother Marko was able to join me, so that helps me on a different level emotionally.”
Third-seed Djokovic could meet Stan Wawrinka in his opening match in Monaco.

Title: IMD issues yellow alert for Delhi, red alert for Gujarat as heatwave intensifies across states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:42:06 +0000

Title: Iran-backed militias in Iraq ready to disarm to avert Trump wrath
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:37:44 +0000
Content: Several powerful Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the U.S. Trump administration, 10 senior commanders and Iraqi officials told media.
The move to defuse tensions follows repeated warnings issued privately by U.S. officials to the Iraqi government since Trump took power in January, according to the sources who include six local commanders of four major militias.
The officials told Baghdad that unless it acted to disband the militias operating on its soil, America could target the groups with airstrikes, the people added.
Izzat al-Shahbndar, a senior Shi’ite Muslim politician close to Iraq’s governing alliance, told Reuters that discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and several militia leaders were “very advanced”, and the groups were inclined to comply with U.S. calls for disarmament.
“The factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,” he said, adding that the groups were “fully aware” they could be targeted by the U.S.
The six militia commanders interviewed in Baghdad and a southern province, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation, are from the Kataib Hezbollah, Nujabaa, Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada and Ansarullah al-Awfiyaa groups.
“Trump is ready to take the war with us to worse levels, we know that, and we want to avoid such a bad scenario,” said a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Shi’ite militia, who spoke from behind a black face mask and sunglasses.
The commanders said their main ally and patron, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military force, had given them its blessing to take whatever decisions they deemed necessary to avoid being drawn into a potentially ruinous conflict with the United States and Israel.
The militias are part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of about 10 hardline Shi’ite armed factions that collectively command about 50,000 fighters and arsenals that include long-range missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, according to two security officials who monitor militias’ activities.
The Resistance group, a key pillar of Iran’s network of regional proxy forces, have claimed responsibility for dozens of missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Gaza war erupted about 18 months ago.
Farhad Alaaeldin, Sudani’s foreign affair adviser, told Reuters in response to queries about disarmament talks that the prime minister was committed to ensuring all weapons in Iraq were under state control through “constructive dialogue with various national actors”.
The two Iraqi security officials said Sudani was pressing for disarmament from all the militias of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which declare their allegiance to Iran’s IRGC or Quds Force rather than to Baghdad.
Some groups have already largely evacuated their headquarters and reduced their presences in major cities including Mosul and Anbar since mid-January for fear of being hit by air attacks, according to officials and commanders.
Many commanders have also stepped up their security measures in that time, changing their mobile phones, vehicles and abodes more frequently, they said.
The U.S. State Department said it continued to urge Baghdad to rein in the militias. “These forces must respond to Iraq’s commander-in-chief and not to Iran,” it added.
An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that there had been instances in the past when the militias had ceased their attacks because of U.S. pressure, and was sceptical any disarmament would be long-term.
The IRGC declined to comment for this article while the Iranian and Israeli foreign ministries didn’t respond to queries.
SHAKEN: IRAN’S AXIS OF RESISTANCE
Shahbndar, the Shi’ite politician, said the Iraqi government had not yet finalised a deal with militant leaders, with a disarmament mechanism still under discussion. Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added.
While the fate of any disarmament process remains uncertain, the discussions nonetheless mark the first time the militias have been prepared to give ground to longstanding Western pressure to demilitarize.
The shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran’s regional “Axis of Resistance” which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and U.S. influence but has seen severely weakened since Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict.
Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by U.S. airstrikes since last month. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another key Iranian ally, has further weakened the Islamic Republic’s influence.
Iraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealing with the militias on its soil. The groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower.
U.S. Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias carrying out revenge attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange.
The Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rockets attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza war began and killed three U.S. soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year.
Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq’s leadership to dismantle Shi’ite militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer.
“If we do not voluntarily comply, it may be forced upon us from the outside, and by force.”

Title: Archer’s quick redemption boosts Rajasthan’s IPL campaign
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:22:49 +0000
Content: England fast bowler Jofra Archer came back from bowling the costliest spell in Indian Premier League (IPL) history last month to become the match-winner in Rajasthan Royals’ victory on Saturday.
Archer, who missed the last IPL season and went into the 2025 mega auction as a late addition, had a forgettable start to the season, getting figures of 0-76 in Rajasthan’s season-opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad last month.
His performance continued to falter in the team’s eight-wicket defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders where he remained wicketless, bowling just 2.3 overs at an economy rate exceeding 13 runs per over.
Rajasthan, however, backed Archer and the pacer repaid the trust with a crucial performance in the side’s six-run win over Chennai Super Kings followed by a match-winning 3-25 spell against Punjab Kings on Saturday.
The 30-year-old made his mark in the first over, taking two wickets — dismissing Priyansh Arya off his first delivery and sending Punjab skipper Shreyas Iyer back to the pavilion to end the over.
Rajasthan defeated Punjab by 50 runs and, after being named Player of the Match, Archer said: “When there are days like this you’ve got to make sure you cash in… enjoy the good ones, take the bad ones in your stride.”
Sandeep Sharma, Archer’s fellow pacer, said that despite the Englishman’s poor start, the team always believed in him for his experience at the international level.
“We always knew, Jofra is a world-class bowler and the scale he brings to the table or into the game is totally different and I think very few can bring that,” Sandeep told reporters.
“So all the management and team had confidence in him that the day he gets that one over, one wicket, maybe two good overs, that will boost his confidence. He is one of the IPL’s toughest bowlers to face or play.
“It was just our fourth game and I’m pretty sure with more games we’re going to get better and better.”
With Archer’s return to form alongside Sandeep, Rajasthan now have two gun pacers in their arsenal, propelling the team forward in the IPL standings.
“That (Archer-Sandeep) is a very deadly combo — one guy bowling around 150 and another bowling around 115… I can trust them with pressure overs. We all love it when he (Archer) bowls those quick overs,” Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson said.

Title: Chintan Shivir 2025 to strengthen centre-state coordination and grassroots delivery of welfare services
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:10:19 +0000

Title: Anti-Trump protesters gather in Washington, other US cities
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:07:41 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., and across the U.S. on Saturday, part of some 1,200 demonstrations that were expected to form the largest single day of protest against President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.
People streamed onto the expanse of grass surrounding the Washington Monument under gloomy skies and light rain. Organizers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend a rally at the National Mall.
Some 150 activist groups had signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests were planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.
Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among those who gathered by the stage beneath the Washington Monument.
She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”
The crowd around the memorial continued to build throughout the day. Some carried Ukrainian flags and others wore Palestinian keffiyeh scarves and carried “Free Palestine” signs, while Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives blasted Trump’s policies on stage.
Wayne Hoffman, 73, a retired money manager from West Cape May, New Jersey, said he was concerned about Trump’s economic policies, including his widespread use of tariffs.
“It’s going to cost the farmers in the red states. It’s going to cost people their jobs – certainly their 401Ks. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars,” Hoffman said.
Kyle, a 20-year-old intern from Ohio, was a lone Trump supporter, sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat and walking the fringe of the Washington, D.C., rally while engaging protesters in debate.
“Most people aren’t too hostile. A few people cuss,” said Kyle, who declined to give his last name.
Trump, who shook financial markets and upset nations around the world with a raft of trade tariffs this week, spent the day in Florida, playing a round of golf at his club in Jupiter before returning to his Mar-a-Lago compound in the afternoon.
Some four miles (6 km) from Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, more than 400 demonstrators gathered on a sunny day in protest. Drivers honked their horns in support of the pastel-and khaki-clad demonstrators as they passed by.
“Markets tank, Trump golfs,” read one sign.
At another protest in Stamford, Connecticut, Sue-ann Friedman, 84, brought a bright pink, handmade sign objecting to the administration’s moves to cut funding for medical research.
“I thought my marching days were over, and then we get somebody like Musk and Trump,” said Friedman.
Paul Kretschmann, a 74-year-old retired attorney in Stamford, said it was the first time he had ever attended a protest.
“My concern is that Social Security is going to be gutted, that we’re going to lose our benefits, and that there’s going to be nobody around to administer it in the first place,” he said. “I’m afraid that this is all part of a larger plan to dismantle the government and for Trump to maintain power.”
DOGE UNDER FIRE
With Trump’s blessing, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has scythed through the U.S. government, eliminating more than 200,000 jobs from the 2.3 million federal workforce. At times, the effort has been haphazard and forced the recall of needed specialists.
On Friday, the Internal Revenue Service began laying off more than 20,000 workers, as much as 25% of its ranks.
Several hundred people gathered outside the headquarters of the Social Security Administration, a top DOGE target, near Baltimore to protest against cuts to the agency which delivers benefits to the elderly and disabled.
Linda Falcao, who turns 65 in two months, told the crowd she had been paying into the Social Security fund since the age of 16.
“I’m terrified, I’m angry, I’m pissed, I’m bewildered this could happen to the United States,” she said. “I do love America and I’m heartbroken. I need my money. I want my money. I want my benefits!” The crowd chanted, “It’s our money!”
White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston disputed the protesters’ charge that Trump aimed to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
“President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors,” Huston said in an email.
Much of Trump’s agenda has been restrained by lawsuits contending he has overstepped his authority with attempts to fire civil servants, deport immigrants and reverse transgender rights.
Trump returned to office on January 20 with a stream of executive orders and other measures critics say are aligned with an agenda outlined by Project 2025, a deeply conservative political initiative to reshape government and consolidate presidential authority. His supporters have applauded Trump’s audacity as necessary to disrupt entrenched liberal interests.
Hours before the protests were due to kick off in the United States, hundreds of anti-Trump Americans living in Europe gathered in Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and London to voice opposition to Trump’s sweeping makeover of U.S. foreign and domestic policies.

Title: PM Modi urges Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles on World Health Day, warns of growing obesity crisis
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 04:33:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of World Health Day on Monday, urged Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles, stressing the need to combat obesity and prioritize personal fitness as crucial steps toward India’s goal of becoming a developed nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote “On World Health Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to building a healthier world. Our Government will continue to focus on healthcare and invest in the various aspects of people’s well-being. Good health is the foundation of every thriving society!”.
The Prime Minister shared a video message stressing that “health is the ultimate fortune and the ultimate wealth” and sounded the alarm on India’s rising obesity crisis. He referred to a recent report predicting that by 2050, over 440 million Indians could suffer from obesity, warning that this would pose a significant public health crisis. “This is scary. How big a crisis can this be?” he asked.
In the video, PM Modi called for action, urging citizens to make personal decisions for better health. “Adopting healthier eating habits, such as reducing oil usage, is not just a personal decision, but a social responsibility,” he stated. As part of his appeal, the Prime Minister proposed a simple yet impactful change: “I want to take a promise from you today that we all should reduce our cooking oil by 10 per cent. This will be a big step towards reducing obesity.”
PM Modi also encouraged the population to integrate regular physical activity into their daily routines. “Apart from this, we have to make exercise a part of our life. If we keep ourselves fit, it will be a big contribution to the journey of a Viksit Bharat,” he added.
The Prime Minister has consistently highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. During an episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat, he expressed concern about India’s rising obesity rates, citing alarming data from the World Health Organization (WHO). “One in every eight people in India is affected by obesity,” he revealed, noting that the prevalence of obesity has doubled in recent years, with childhood obesity increasing fourfold.
Obesity, PM Modi warned, can lead to severe health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, he emphasized that small but meaningful lifestyle changes can help combat these issues.
To further raise awareness and promote healthy living, the Prime Minister enlisted ten prominent public figures to join a nationwide campaign against obesity. The personalities involved include Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, industrialist Anand Mahindra, actor-politician Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua), Olympic medalists Manu Bhaker and Mirabai Chanu, actors Mohanlal and R. Madhavan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, philanthropist Sudha Murthy, and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.
PM Modi encouraged each of them to nominate ten more individuals, aiming to amplify the campaign’s reach and societal impact.
