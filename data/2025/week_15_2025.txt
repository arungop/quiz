Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla today highlighted the inclusive and welfarist nature of Constitution of India, mentioning that “the spirit of the Indian Constitution is to treat all citizens equally, provide them with equal opportunities, and integrate the marginalized and backward sections of society into the ‘mainstream of progress.’”
Delivering the keynote address on the theme “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice” at the historic 150th Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Om Birla observed that “In recent years, the Indian Parliament has passed several legislations that promote social justice and security and encourage the inclusion of all sections of society.” On the occasion, he also extended Ram Navami greetings to the gathering at the 150th assembly of IPU.

Referring to the Parliament’s perennial concern for safeguarding the interests of the vulnerable segments of society, he added that “Bills like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act-2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam-2023 safeguard the interests of all sections of society.” In this context, he also referred to new labor laws and codes passed by Parliament for the welfare and social security of workers in the unorganized sector.
Stressing that Indian Parliament has taken several measures prioritising justice and rule of law, Om Birla mentioned that “By replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, India has established the primacy of justice.” Referring to functioning of parliamentary committees in achieving the goals of development and social justice, Om Birla noted that the various parliamentary committees, often referred to as mini parliaments, perform a complementary function to the efforts of Parliament and the government. He highlighted that the Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment; Committee on Women Empowerment; Committee on Labour and Skill Development, and other diverse committees monitor welfare programmes leading to implementation of schemes with effectiveness and accountability.
Om Birla stressed that Government of India works with a mission to achieve targets set for key human development indicators. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that “Under the world’s largest health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), free health insurance is being provided to the bottom 40% of India’s population.”
Praising the strong and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Om Birla said, “Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India has achieved the distinction of being the world’s fastest-growing major economy with a 105% GDP growth over the past decade and is rapidly progressing towards its goal of Viksit Bharat in 2047.” Noting that India is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on its way toward becoming the third-largest economy, Om Birla said that India is playing a leading role in the world in fields like innovation, AI, startups, space and defense technology, IT, fintech, pharma, and others.
He hoped that the discussions at the IPU Assembly would provide all delegations with new perspectives and will allow parliaments around the world to take concrete steps toward building a just, inclusive, and prosperous society.
Speaking on the role of IPU in the present world order, Om Birla mentioned that the IPU continues to add new dimensions to global parliamentary cooperation. He underlined that the theme chosen for the 150th IPU Assembly reflects the expansion of the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which is deeply rooted in Indian culture, tradition, and philosophy.
India-Vietnam Bilateral Engagement On The Sidelines of IPU
On the sidelines of the 150th IPU Summit, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met H.E. Mr. Tran Thanh Man, President, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Speaking on the occasion, Om Birla fondly recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022, marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Vietnam. He also emphasized the close cultural and historical ties between the two countries, which have strengthened through high-level discussions in recent years.
Om Birla expressed satisfaction that both countries are progressing toward sustainable development, driven by their respective visions for 2047 (India) and 2045 (Vietnam). He emphasized that cooperation in various sectors such as defense, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy has helped shape their future frameworks.
Om Birla noted that both countries’ parliamentary institutions play a key role in meeting people’s expectations and promoting public welfare, with India utilizing emerging technologies to enhance parliamentary processes and citizen participation. He also informed that the *Digital Parliament* initiative in India has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in parliamentary operations. He also highlighted the significant number of Vietnamese students benefiting from educational and training scholarships in India.
The President of the National Assembly of Vietnam extended best wishes on Ram Navami. He also emphasized the cultural ties between the two countries. The President also underlined the need for strengthening the close defence and technology ties between India and Vietnam. He extended an invitation to Om Birla to visit Vietnam. Formation of a friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a pointed dig at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy
Addressing a public gathering in Rameswaram after inaugurating the New Pamban Railway Bridge, the prime minister said that although he regularly receives letters from Tamil Nadu leaders, none of them are signed in Tamil.
“Sometimes, I am surprised when I receive letters from some leaders of Tamil Nadu — none of them are signed in Tamil. If we are truly proud of Tamil, then I would request everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil,” PM Modi said, emphasizing the importance of embracing and promoting one’s native language.
The PM also highlighted the central government’s efforts to promote Tamil language and culture globally.
“We are working continuously to ensure that Tamil language and Tamil heritage reach every corner of the world,” he added.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was felicitated by BJP leaders as he arrived to address a public meeting in Rameswaram city of Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, after inaugurating India’s vertical sea-lift bridge, the New Pamban Bridge.
Tamil Nadu Governor R. N. Ravi and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present during the felicitation.

Title: Flood threat: Vadodara launches rapid river deepening project
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:39:51 +0000
Content: The Gujarat government has launched large-scale work under the Vishwamitri River Project, aimed at enhancing the river’s flow capacity and improving the management of urban water bodies.
An official stated that the project, currently in full swing, seeks to increase the Vishwamitri River’s water-carrying capacity by 40 percent within a target period of 100 days.
Last year, Vadodara experienced severe flooding, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and led to the displacement of residents.
Determined to prevent a recurrence of such devastation, the government has fast-tracked river rejuvenation efforts. These include deepening and widening the Vishwamitri River, along with connecting key water bodies such as Ajwa Salav, Pratappura Sarovar, Dena Lake, and several city canals.
According to the official, a total of 526 machines have been deployed across various sites to execute the project on a war footing.
So far, 9.98 lakh cubic meters of soil and sludge have been excavated from the riverbed and surrounding areas.
“In addition, approximately 68 hectares of forest area have been cleared to facilitate smoother water flow. This is one of the most comprehensive flood prevention initiatives the city has ever seen. We are racing against time to complete the work before the monsoon,” said a senior project engineer.
He added that, alongside the river rejuvenation, efforts are also underway to clean and restore ten key lakes within the city.
“Work has been completed in two of these lakes, while development is ongoing in two others. In total, 474 deep rainwater recharge wells have been planned as part of the project, of which 25 have already been completed,” he said.
These wells are expected to improve groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff during heavy rainfall.
The project also includes a robust waste management component. As part of the cleaning and excavation process, 500 metric tons of plastic waste have been collected and sent to the Atladara processing plant for recycling.
Additionally, 11,000 metric tons of gravel recovered during the operation have been crushed and stored at the Atladara facility for potential reuse in infrastructure work.
Officials emphasized that the Vishwamitri River Project is not only about flood control — it is also a crucial step toward urban environmental restoration and climate resilience.
“With Vadodara’s growing population and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, the city’s natural drainage systems and water bodies require urgent and sustained attention,” they noted.

Title: Healthy start, hopeful future: Gujarat’s transformative healthcare journey
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 10:34:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Swasth Bharat, Samriddh Bharat” has served as the guiding force behind Gujarat’s remarkable progress in maternal and child healthcare under CM Bhupendra Patel, in alignment with the 2025 World Health Day theme, “Healthy Start, Hopeful Future.”
With initiatives focused on empowering women and improving neonatal care, Gujarat has halved its Maternal Mortality Rate—from 112 (2011-13) to 57 (2020). Over 14 lakh pregnant women annually receive timely check-ups, immunizations, and nutrition services. The state has also established 121 First Referral Units, 153 Blood Storage Units, and 20 Maternity ICUs, achieving an institutional delivery rate of 99.97%.
Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 54 (2005) to 23 (2020), thanks to programs like HBNC, HBYC, SAANS, and Stop Diarrhea, supported by a strong network of newborn care units.
Under SH-RBSK, over 1.61 crore children are screened annually. The initiative also facilitated 206 kidney, 37 liver, and 211 bone marrow transplants, and free treatment for thousands of children with serious health conditions.
The “Breaking the Silence” campaign has restored hearing in 3,260 children via free cochlear implants. In 2025, Gujarat won two Gold SKOCH Awards for excellence in child health.
Gujarat also pioneered digital health cards for schoolchildren, with over 1.15 crore cards issued. Between 2019–2023, the state ranked first nationally in newborn screening and congenital disorder management.

Title: Samsung seeks ways to cushion blow from US tariffs
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:53:39 +0000
Content: Tech giant Samsung Electronics may need to overhaul its global production strategy as new U.S. reciprocal tariffs could significantly impact its smartphone business, industry sources said on Sunday.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a minimum 10 percent “baseline” tariff on all imports to the United States, along with country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on goods from South Korea.
The reciprocal tariffs—covering most product categories except for items such as vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals—are set to take effect from Wednesday (U.S. time), according to Yonhap news agency.
Experts and industry analysts noted that Samsung Electronics will need to adapt to the U.S. tariff policy by leveraging its strategy of diversifying production bases.
Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, currently produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam, which now faces a 46 percent reciprocal tariff on goods entering the U.S. The remainder of its smartphone production is spread across India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea.
India faces a 26 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and Brazil just 10 percent—making Brazil a potentially attractive hub for serving the U.S. market.
Sources suggest Samsung may consider ramping up production in India, Brazil, and South Korea, particularly for premium models intended for American consumers.
Brazil, in particular, stands out due to its low tariffs and geographic proximity to the U.S., they added.
The company is expected to reassess its production strategy ahead of the summer launch of its next-generation foldable smartphones, but for now, it is proceeding cautiously.
“Nothing has been decided yet,” said an official from Samsung Electronics.
South Korea’s economy is likely to face headwinds as the U.S. administration’s reciprocal tariffs may severely impact the country’s exports to the United States, while also disrupting the global market—potentially dealing a further blow to South Korean trade, local experts warned.
They expressed serious concerns for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, especially as the Trump administration continues to implement protectionist trade policies, including 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as similarly high duties on foreign-made cars.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:18:39 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. He was also garlanded by the temple priest.
The Ramanathaswamy Shiva Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple holds mythological significance as it is believed that Lord Ram established and worshipped at this temple before crossing the Ram Setu bridge to reach Sri Lanka to rescue his wife from Ravan. It also features the longest corridor among Hindu temples in India.
Governor R.N. Ravi had also visited the temple before the inauguration of the bridge.
Earlier today, while sharing an aerial view during his return journey from Sri Lanka, PM Modi highlighted how he was able to have a “darshan” of both Ram Setu and Ayodhya’s ‘Surya Tilak’.
“On the way back from Sri Lanka a short while ago, I was blessed to have a darshan of the Ram Setu. And, as a divine coincidence, it happened at the same time as the Surya Tilak was taking place in Ayodhya. Blessed to have the darshan of both,” the PM said in a post on X.
PM Modi is also scheduled to hold roadshows in a Tamil Nadu city.

Title: Sri Lanka releases 14 Indian fishermen during PM Modi’s visit
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:40:36 +0000
Content: In a significant gesture underscoring growing bilateral goodwill, Sri Lanka on Sunday released 14 Indian fishermen during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation. 
The release followed detailed discussions between PM Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier on Saturday, during which the long-standing issue of fishermen’s arrests was taken up.
The Prime Minister, during his remarks at a joint press briefing, said, “We discussed the fishermen’s issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats.”
The arrest of Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, by Sri Lankan authorities for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters has been a recurring point of tension.
Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by Sri Lankan forces, raising concerns among coastal communities and prompting repeated appeals for intervention.
Addressing a press conference following the talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days.”
“This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister said himself during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides,” Misri added.
The release of 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during PM Modi’s visit, which included the joint inauguration of India-backed railway projects such as the upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway track and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge in Tamil Nadu

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the New Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. This landmark project is India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge, showcasing the nation’s growing engineering and infrastructural capabilities.
The 2.07-kilometre-long bridge, spanning the Palk Strait, stands as a testament to India’s engineering prowess and visionary infrastructure development. PM Modi, accompanied by Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi, flagged off the first train to cross the sea bridge.
A demonstration showcased the bridge’s functionality, with visuals capturing key moments. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) boat successfully navigated under the structure, highlighting its vertical clearance and maritime accessibility. Following the boat’s passage, a train crossed the bridge, demonstrating its structural integrity and operational readiness.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Vaishnaw hoisted the BJP flag at the Pamban Bridge site and congratulated party workers on the BJP’s foundation day.  
“The resolve of Antyodaya and the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’… Heartfelt congratulations to all workers on the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” his post read.
Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi also visited the Swamy Temple in Rameswaram ahead of the inauguration.
The story of the bridge dates back to 1914, when British engineers constructed the original Pamban Bridge—a cantilever structure with a Scherzer rolling lift span—connecting Rameswaram Island to mainland India. The new bridge, sanctioned in 2019, is three metres taller than the original, enhancing sea connectivity and accommodating maritime traffic more efficiently.
The bridge has long served as a vital link for pilgrims, tourists, and trade. However, the harsh marine environment and increasing transportation demands necessitated a modern upgrade. In 2019, the central government approved the construction of a technologically advanced, future-ready replacement.
Constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna PSU under the Ministry of Railways, the New Pamban Bridge has been designed to meet higher standards for speed, load-bearing capacity, and maritime clearance. It enhances connectivity while showcasing India’s capabilities in safety, durability, and innovation.
As India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, the New Pamban Bridge joins the ranks of other iconic international structures known for their engineering achievements—such as the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Tower Bridge in London, and the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.

Title: Lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust, hope: Amit Shah congratulates party workers on BJP’s Foundation Day
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:46:27 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated party workers on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Foundation Day on Sunday, saying that the lotus symbol has emerged as a powerful emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the people.
In a post on X, Shah said, “Today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the countrymen. The works of service, security, and cultural awakening that the BJP has undertaken in the past decade will become milestones in the days to come.”
“Crores of BJP workers, steadfastly adhering to ideological commitment, will continue to contribute to nation-building” he added. 
Recalling the party’s key achievements, including the revocation of Article 370 and the movement to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said the party has always ensured the welfare of the poor, the underprivileged, and women.
“Whether it is about taking the Shri Ram Temple movement to every individual, making the removal of Article 370 its resolve, or ensuring the welfare of the poor, the deprived, and women — BJP has, since its inception, made the nation’s interest its highest goal,” his post read.
Highlighting the party’s journey since its inception in 1980, Shah said the BJP has consistently demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies and ensuring welfare for farmers.
“In its four-decade journey, BJP has demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies, providing every poor person with housing, food, health insurance, and promoting the welfare of farmers all at once,” the home minister said.
The BJP was officially formed on April 6, 1980, based on the Panch Nishthas (Five Commitments). However, the party’s roots trace back to the formation of the Jana Sangh in 1950.
The Jana Sangh was founded by former Union Minister Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the Emergency ended in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party to oppose the Congress. However, a dispute arose over dual membership—whether members affiliated with the RSS could remain in the Janata Party. This led to the Jana Sangh members parting ways and forming the BJP on April 6, 1980.
Since its formation, the BJP has had two Prime Ministers: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.
The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it won 303 seats—the highest in its history.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.
