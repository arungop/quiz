Title: Lok Sabha speaker highlights India’s inclusive constitutional vision at 150th IPU Assembly in Tashkent
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 13:35:18 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla today highlighted the inclusive and welfarist nature of Constitution of India, mentioning that “the spirit of the Indian Constitution is to treat all citizens equally, provide them with equal opportunities, and integrate the marginalized and backward sections of society into the ‘mainstream of progress.’”
Delivering the keynote address on the theme “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice” at the historic 150th Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Om Birla observed that “In recent years, the Indian Parliament has passed several legislations that promote social justice and security and encourage the inclusion of all sections of society.” On the occasion, he also extended Ram Navami greetings to the gathering at the 150th assembly of IPU.

Referring to the Parliament’s perennial concern for safeguarding the interests of the vulnerable segments of society, he added that “Bills like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act-2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam-2023 safeguard the interests of all sections of society.” In this context, he also referred to new labor laws and codes passed by Parliament for the welfare and social security of workers in the unorganized sector.
Stressing that Indian Parliament has taken several measures prioritising justice and rule of law, Om Birla mentioned that “By replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, India has established the primacy of justice.” Referring to functioning of parliamentary committees in achieving the goals of development and social justice, Om Birla noted that the various parliamentary committees, often referred to as mini parliaments, perform a complementary function to the efforts of Parliament and the government. He highlighted that the Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment; Committee on Women Empowerment; Committee on Labour and Skill Development, and other diverse committees monitor welfare programmes leading to implementation of schemes with effectiveness and accountability.
Om Birla stressed that Government of India works with a mission to achieve targets set for key human development indicators. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that “Under the world’s largest health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), free health insurance is being provided to the bottom 40% of India’s population.”
Praising the strong and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Om Birla said, “Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India has achieved the distinction of being the world’s fastest-growing major economy with a 105% GDP growth over the past decade and is rapidly progressing towards its goal of Viksit Bharat in 2047.” Noting that India is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on its way toward becoming the third-largest economy, Om Birla said that India is playing a leading role in the world in fields like innovation, AI, startups, space and defense technology, IT, fintech, pharma, and others.
He hoped that the discussions at the IPU Assembly would provide all delegations with new perspectives and will allow parliaments around the world to take concrete steps toward building a just, inclusive, and prosperous society.
Speaking on the role of IPU in the present world order, Om Birla mentioned that the IPU continues to add new dimensions to global parliamentary cooperation. He underlined that the theme chosen for the 150th IPU Assembly reflects the expansion of the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which is deeply rooted in Indian culture, tradition, and philosophy.
India-Vietnam Bilateral Engagement On The Sidelines of IPU
On the sidelines of the 150th IPU Summit, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met H.E. Mr. Tran Thanh Man, President, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Speaking on the occasion, Om Birla fondly recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022, marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Vietnam. He also emphasized the close cultural and historical ties between the two countries, which have strengthened through high-level discussions in recent years.
Om Birla expressed satisfaction that both countries are progressing toward sustainable development, driven by their respective visions for 2047 (India) and 2045 (Vietnam). He emphasized that cooperation in various sectors such as defense, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy has helped shape their future frameworks.
Om Birla noted that both countries’ parliamentary institutions play a key role in meeting people’s expectations and promoting public welfare, with India utilizing emerging technologies to enhance parliamentary processes and citizen participation. He also informed that the *Digital Parliament* initiative in India has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in parliamentary operations. He also highlighted the significant number of Vietnamese students benefiting from educational and training scholarships in India.
The President of the National Assembly of Vietnam extended best wishes on Ram Navami. He also emphasized the cultural ties between the two countries. The President also underlined the need for strengthening the close defence and technology ties between India and Vietnam. He extended an invitation to Om Birla to visit Vietnam. Formation of a friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a pointed dig at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy
Addressing a public gathering in Rameswaram after inaugurating the New Pamban Railway Bridge, the prime minister said that although he regularly receives letters from Tamil Nadu leaders, none of them are signed in Tamil.
“Sometimes, I am surprised when I receive letters from some leaders of Tamil Nadu — none of them are signed in Tamil. If we are truly proud of Tamil, then I would request everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil,” PM Modi said, emphasizing the importance of embracing and promoting one’s native language.
The PM also highlighted the central government’s efforts to promote Tamil language and culture globally.
“We are working continuously to ensure that Tamil language and Tamil heritage reach every corner of the world,” he added.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was felicitated by BJP leaders as he arrived to address a public meeting in Rameswaram city of Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, after inaugurating India’s vertical sea-lift bridge, the New Pamban Bridge.
Tamil Nadu Governor R. N. Ravi and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present during the felicitation.

Title: Flood threat: Vadodara launches rapid river deepening project
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:39:51 +0000
Content: The Gujarat government has launched large-scale work under the Vishwamitri River Project, aimed at enhancing the river’s flow capacity and improving the management of urban water bodies.
An official stated that the project, currently in full swing, seeks to increase the Vishwamitri River’s water-carrying capacity by 40 percent within a target period of 100 days.
Last year, Vadodara experienced severe flooding, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and led to the displacement of residents.
Determined to prevent a recurrence of such devastation, the government has fast-tracked river rejuvenation efforts. These include deepening and widening the Vishwamitri River, along with connecting key water bodies such as Ajwa Salav, Pratappura Sarovar, Dena Lake, and several city canals.
According to the official, a total of 526 machines have been deployed across various sites to execute the project on a war footing.
So far, 9.98 lakh cubic meters of soil and sludge have been excavated from the riverbed and surrounding areas.
“In addition, approximately 68 hectares of forest area have been cleared to facilitate smoother water flow. This is one of the most comprehensive flood prevention initiatives the city has ever seen. We are racing against time to complete the work before the monsoon,” said a senior project engineer.
He added that, alongside the river rejuvenation, efforts are also underway to clean and restore ten key lakes within the city.
“Work has been completed in two of these lakes, while development is ongoing in two others. In total, 474 deep rainwater recharge wells have been planned as part of the project, of which 25 have already been completed,” he said.
These wells are expected to improve groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff during heavy rainfall.
The project also includes a robust waste management component. As part of the cleaning and excavation process, 500 metric tons of plastic waste have been collected and sent to the Atladara processing plant for recycling.
Additionally, 11,000 metric tons of gravel recovered during the operation have been crushed and stored at the Atladara facility for potential reuse in infrastructure work.
Officials emphasized that the Vishwamitri River Project is not only about flood control — it is also a crucial step toward urban environmental restoration and climate resilience.
“With Vadodara’s growing population and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, the city’s natural drainage systems and water bodies require urgent and sustained attention,” they noted.

Title: Healthy start, hopeful future: Gujarat’s transformative healthcare journey
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 10:34:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Swasth Bharat, Samriddh Bharat” has served as the guiding force behind Gujarat’s remarkable progress in maternal and child healthcare under CM Bhupendra Patel, in alignment with the 2025 World Health Day theme, “Healthy Start, Hopeful Future.”
With initiatives focused on empowering women and improving neonatal care, Gujarat has halved its Maternal Mortality Rate—from 112 (2011-13) to 57 (2020). Over 14 lakh pregnant women annually receive timely check-ups, immunizations, and nutrition services. The state has also established 121 First Referral Units, 153 Blood Storage Units, and 20 Maternity ICUs, achieving an institutional delivery rate of 99.97%.
Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 54 (2005) to 23 (2020), thanks to programs like HBNC, HBYC, SAANS, and Stop Diarrhea, supported by a strong network of newborn care units.
Under SH-RBSK, over 1.61 crore children are screened annually. The initiative also facilitated 206 kidney, 37 liver, and 211 bone marrow transplants, and free treatment for thousands of children with serious health conditions.
The “Breaking the Silence” campaign has restored hearing in 3,260 children via free cochlear implants. In 2025, Gujarat won two Gold SKOCH Awards for excellence in child health.
Gujarat also pioneered digital health cards for schoolchildren, with over 1.15 crore cards issued. Between 2019–2023, the state ranked first nationally in newborn screening and congenital disorder management.

Title: Samsung seeks ways to cushion blow from US tariffs
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:53:39 +0000
Content: Tech giant Samsung Electronics may need to overhaul its global production strategy as new U.S. reciprocal tariffs could significantly impact its smartphone business, industry sources said on Sunday.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a minimum 10 percent “baseline” tariff on all imports to the United States, along with country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on goods from South Korea.
The reciprocal tariffs—covering most product categories except for items such as vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals—are set to take effect from Wednesday (U.S. time), according to Yonhap news agency.
Experts and industry analysts noted that Samsung Electronics will need to adapt to the U.S. tariff policy by leveraging its strategy of diversifying production bases.
Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, currently produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam, which now faces a 46 percent reciprocal tariff on goods entering the U.S. The remainder of its smartphone production is spread across India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea.
India faces a 26 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and Brazil just 10 percent—making Brazil a potentially attractive hub for serving the U.S. market.
Sources suggest Samsung may consider ramping up production in India, Brazil, and South Korea, particularly for premium models intended for American consumers.
Brazil, in particular, stands out due to its low tariffs and geographic proximity to the U.S., they added.
The company is expected to reassess its production strategy ahead of the summer launch of its next-generation foldable smartphones, but for now, it is proceeding cautiously.
“Nothing has been decided yet,” said an official from Samsung Electronics.
South Korea’s economy is likely to face headwinds as the U.S. administration’s reciprocal tariffs may severely impact the country’s exports to the United States, while also disrupting the global market—potentially dealing a further blow to South Korean trade, local experts warned.
They expressed serious concerns for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, especially as the Trump administration continues to implement protectionist trade policies, including 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as similarly high duties on foreign-made cars.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:18:39 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. He was also garlanded by the temple priest.
The Ramanathaswamy Shiva Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple holds mythological significance as it is believed that Lord Ram established and worshipped at this temple before crossing the Ram Setu bridge to reach Sri Lanka to rescue his wife from Ravan. It also features the longest corridor among Hindu temples in India.
Governor R.N. Ravi had also visited the temple before the inauguration of the bridge.
Earlier today, while sharing an aerial view during his return journey from Sri Lanka, PM Modi highlighted how he was able to have a “darshan” of both Ram Setu and Ayodhya’s ‘Surya Tilak’.
“On the way back from Sri Lanka a short while ago, I was blessed to have a darshan of the Ram Setu. And, as a divine coincidence, it happened at the same time as the Surya Tilak was taking place in Ayodhya. Blessed to have the darshan of both,” the PM said in a post on X.
PM Modi is also scheduled to hold roadshows in a Tamil Nadu city.

Title: Sri Lanka releases 14 Indian fishermen during PM Modi’s visit
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:40:36 +0000
Content: In a significant gesture underscoring growing bilateral goodwill, Sri Lanka on Sunday released 14 Indian fishermen during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation. 
The release followed detailed discussions between PM Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier on Saturday, during which the long-standing issue of fishermen’s arrests was taken up.
The Prime Minister, during his remarks at a joint press briefing, said, “We discussed the fishermen’s issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats.”
The arrest of Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, by Sri Lankan authorities for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters has been a recurring point of tension.
Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by Sri Lankan forces, raising concerns among coastal communities and prompting repeated appeals for intervention.
Addressing a press conference following the talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days.”
“This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister said himself during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides,” Misri added.
The release of 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during PM Modi’s visit, which included the joint inauguration of India-backed railway projects such as the upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway track and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:33:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the New Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. This landmark project is India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge, showcasing the nation’s growing engineering and infrastructural capabilities.
The 2.07-kilometre-long bridge, spanning the Palk Strait, stands as a testament to India’s engineering prowess and visionary infrastructure development. PM Modi, accompanied by Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi, flagged off the first train to cross the sea bridge.
A demonstration showcased the bridge’s functionality, with visuals capturing key moments. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) boat successfully navigated under the structure, highlighting its vertical clearance and maritime accessibility. Following the boat’s passage, a train crossed the bridge, demonstrating its structural integrity and operational readiness.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Vaishnaw hoisted the BJP flag at the Pamban Bridge site and congratulated party workers on the BJP’s foundation day.  
“The resolve of Antyodaya and the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’… Heartfelt congratulations to all workers on the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” his post read.
Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi also visited the Swamy Temple in Rameswaram ahead of the inauguration.
The story of the bridge dates back to 1914, when British engineers constructed the original Pamban Bridge—a cantilever structure with a Scherzer rolling lift span—connecting Rameswaram Island to mainland India. The new bridge, sanctioned in 2019, is three metres taller than the original, enhancing sea connectivity and accommodating maritime traffic more efficiently.
The bridge has long served as a vital link for pilgrims, tourists, and trade. However, the harsh marine environment and increasing transportation demands necessitated a modern upgrade. In 2019, the central government approved the construction of a technologically advanced, future-ready replacement.
Constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna PSU under the Ministry of Railways, the New Pamban Bridge has been designed to meet higher standards for speed, load-bearing capacity, and maritime clearance. It enhances connectivity while showcasing India’s capabilities in safety, durability, and innovation.
As India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, the New Pamban Bridge joins the ranks of other iconic international structures known for their engineering achievements—such as the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Tower Bridge in London, and the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.

Title: Lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust, hope: Amit Shah congratulates party workers on BJP’s Foundation Day
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:46:27 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated party workers on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Foundation Day on Sunday, saying that the lotus symbol has emerged as a powerful emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the people.
In a post on X, Shah said, “Today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the countrymen. The works of service, security, and cultural awakening that the BJP has undertaken in the past decade will become milestones in the days to come.”
“Crores of BJP workers, steadfastly adhering to ideological commitment, will continue to contribute to nation-building” he added. 
Recalling the party’s key achievements, including the revocation of Article 370 and the movement to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said the party has always ensured the welfare of the poor, the underprivileged, and women.
“Whether it is about taking the Shri Ram Temple movement to every individual, making the removal of Article 370 its resolve, or ensuring the welfare of the poor, the deprived, and women — BJP has, since its inception, made the nation’s interest its highest goal,” his post read.
Highlighting the party’s journey since its inception in 1980, Shah said the BJP has consistently demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies and ensuring welfare for farmers.
“In its four-decade journey, BJP has demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies, providing every poor person with housing, food, health insurance, and promoting the welfare of farmers all at once,” the home minister said.
The BJP was officially formed on April 6, 1980, based on the Panch Nishthas (Five Commitments). However, the party’s roots trace back to the formation of the Jana Sangh in 1950.
The Jana Sangh was founded by former Union Minister Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the Emergency ended in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party to oppose the Congress. However, a dispute arose over dual membership—whether members affiliated with the RSS could remain in the Janata Party. This led to the Jana Sangh members parting ways and forming the BJP on April 6, 1980.
Since its formation, the BJP has had two Prime Ministers: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.
The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it won 303 seats—the highest in its history.

Title: PM Modi, Lankan President Dissanayake launch India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:16:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.

Title: Over 50 nations want to start trade talks with US after tariffs, Trump officials say
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 07:31:58 +0000
Content: More than 50 nations have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks since U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out sweeping new tariffs, top officials said on Sunday as they defended levies that wiped out nearly $6 trillion in value from U.S. stocks last week and downplayed economic fallout.
On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump’s top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the U.S. in the global trade order. They also tried to minimize the economic shocks from last week’s tumultuous rollout, ahead of Monday’s expected bumpy opening of Asian stock markets.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the U.S. since last Wednesday’s announcement, putting Trump in a position of power.
Neither Bessent nor the other officials named the countries or offered details about the talks. But simultaneously negotiating with multiple countries could pose a logistical challenge for the Trump administration and prolong economic uncertainty.

“He’s created maximum leverage for himself,” Bessent said on NBC News’ ‘Meet the Press.’
Bessent downplayed the stock market drop and said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession based on the tariffs, citing stronger-than-anticipated U.S. jobs growth.
Trump jolted economies around the world after he announced broad tariffs on U.S. imports, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a global trade war and recession.
JPMorgan economists now estimate the tariffs will result in full-year U.S. gross domestic product declining by 0.3%, down from an earlier estimate of 1.3% growth, and that the unemployment rate will climb to 5.3% from 4.2% now.
As investors girded for the opening of stock markets in Asia, the Republican president spent the weekend in Florida, playing golf and posting a video of his swing to social media on Sunday.
TARIFF DEALMAKING
U.S. customs agents began collecting Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (4:01 a.m. GMT).
Some nations have already signaled a willingness to engage with the U.S. to avoid the duties.
Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te on Sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks with the U.S., pledging to remove trade barriers and saying Taiwanese companies will raise their U.S. investments.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would seek a reprieve from a 17% tariff on the country’s goods during a planned meeting with Trump on Monday.
An Indian government official told Reuters the country does not plan to retaliate against a 26% tariff and said talks were under way with the U.S. over a possible deal.
In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – a Trump ally – pledged on Sunday to shield businesses that suffered damage from a planned 20% tariff on goods from the European Union.
Italian wine producers and U.S. importers at a wine fair in Verona on Sunday said business had already slowed and feared more lasting damage.
NO STRATEGY TO TANK STOCK MARKET
Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after the worst week for U.S. stocks since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis five years ago.
The S&P 1500 Composite Index, among the widest measures of the U.S. market, lost nearly $6 trillion in value in the two days after Trump’s announcement and has had almost $10 trillion wiped out since mid-February, a significant blow to millions of Americans’ retirement nest eggs.
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied that the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He said there would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.
In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump shared a video that suggested his tariffs aimed to hammer the stock market on purpose in a bid to force lower interest rates.
The social media post fueled global debate over whether Trump’s tariffs were part of a permanent new tariff regime or simply a negotiating tactic that could lead to the tariffs being eased through concessions by other countries.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ that they could be the latter, saying the tariffs would remain in place “for days and weeks.”
The process used to determine the tariffs came under scrutiny last week after they were applied to uninhabited Antarctic islands populated by penguins and other tiny, remote places.
Lutnick said a comprehensive approach was needed so that small nations could not be used by larger countries to circumvent the tariffs.
“Basically (Trump) said, ‘I can’t let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them,'” Lutnick said.

Title: ‘Adolescence’ TV drama exposes global issue of teenage violence
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:55:13 +0000
Content: TV drama “Adolescence” has shocked and captivated audiences around the world, providing what campaigners say is a rare opportunity to tackle the largely hidden world of online misogyny and violence.
Since its release on Netflix on March 13, more than 96 million people have watched the British four-episode series that begins with armed police raiding the home of a terrified 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a young girl, and ends with a raw illustration of the pain of his broken family.
The action in between, with each hour-long episode shot in a dizzying single take, slowly destroys the initial disbelief that a child so young could commit such a violent crime.
It depicts a toxic online culture known loosely as the manosphere in which common teenage male insecurities about attractiveness and romantic failure can warp into resentment and hatred of the opposite sex.
“There are people who will watch it and go ‘but that boy couldn’t do that’. The point is that boy can do it,” said Susie McDonald, CEO of charity Tender that educates children and adults on healthy relationships
“Suddenly the possibility becomes normal, and so we begin to say, what on earth can we do to stop that from happening?”
The show is number one in the Netflix global Top 10 and heads the charts in almost every country – from Brazil to Bahrain – for which the streaming platform provides data.
“Although on the surface it feels like it’s a very British production … actually, the themes that it’s dealing with: what our children are doing online, what they’re listening to … I think that’s as important in America, as it is India, as it is Australia,” film critic Kaleem Aftab told Reuters.
Portuguese police produced a guide for parents to explain the hidden meaning of emojis used by young people – a plot component in the show. The Sydney Morning Herald produced a guide on how to talk to children more effectively than the parents in the programme.
British police urged parents to look for signs their child may be being radicalised online, using data showing 60% of referrals to its terrorism prevention system came from children aged 17 or under to highlight the scale of the wider problem.
HIT HOME HARD IN DOWNING STREET
“Adolescence” reached the home of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who watched it with his teenage son and daughter.
“It hit home hard,” Starmer said in a statement, backing a scheme to make the show available to schools across the country and encouraging a national conversation on the isues it raises.
“This isn’t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.”
Matt Pinkett, an author on masculinity and a teacher, described how the show had left him fizzing with lesson ideas, but said it needed to be used carefully to avoid further marginalising boys already at risk of radicalisation.
The show has created a moment that campaigners, police and educators have been waiting for: a general public prepared to accept the uncomfortable truth that they do not know what their children are doing online, and that they all need help.
“This is the start of something. What we need to do as an education profession is make sure that we take advantage of that,” said Pepe Di’Iasio, General Secretary of Britain’s Association of School and College Leaders.
McDonald said Tender was working with Netflix to produce materials teachers can use in schools, using script excerpts and clips of scenes to spark wider discussion.
“This (show) is not going to solve the problem, but it’s enabled everybody to actually notice that there is a problem,” she said.

Title: Second measles death reported in Texas as outbreak spreads to 22 U.S. states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:29:27 +0000
Content: A second child with measles has died in Texas, state officials said on Sunday, in an outbreak of the childhood disease that has resulted in nearly 500 cases in Texas and has spread across 22 states.
The unvaccinated school-aged child, who had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
“The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,” Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email.
It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late Januaryin Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is about 82%, below the 95% considered protective for those who cannot be vaccinated.
When asked about the measles death, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One that if the outbreak progresses his administration will “have to take action very strongly.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in a post on X, identified the child as 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and said he visited Texas on Sunday to comfort the family.
Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocatewho has declared that vaccination is a personal choice, said on Sunday vaccines are the best protection against measles.
“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there were 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas.
Kennedy has previously also recommended Vitamin A as a measles treatment, along with good nutrition. While Vitamin A has been shown in some studies in developing countries to lessen the severity of symptoms, it can lead to liver toxicity in high quantities.
Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, wrote on X after the child’s death was disclosed: “Everyone should be vaccinated.”
“Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies,” Cassidy wrote on X.
Cassidy had backed Kennedy’s confirmation after Kennedy promised not to make changes to vaccine oversight.
The measles vaccine is 97% effective after two shots.
He said teams from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been redeployed to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott.
The CDC on its website says the vaccine is “the best protection against measles,” which spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.
KENNEDY HEARING POSTPONED
Cassidy last week called for Kennedy to appear before the Senate health committee on April 10 to discuss the U.S. health department’s restructuring in which 10,000 people were being laid off, including from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But on Friday a committee official said the hearing would not occur on April 10 because seven days’ notice had not been given as required by committee procedure. No date has been set.
The Texas Department of State Health Services reportedon Friday 59 new measles cases in three days, a 15% jump, for a total of 481 in the state since late January.
Related measles outbreaks have been reported in other states, including New Mexico and Oklahoma. In addition, an unvaccinated New Mexico adult tested positive for measles after dying in March.
As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a weekly nationwide increase of 124 measles cases, bringing the total to 607 so far this year. That compares to a nationwide total in 2024 of 285 reported cases.
CDC officials said 97% of U.S. cases are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.
Pediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease.

Title: Djokovic motivated again after Miami run but keeping expectations
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:25:48 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic said reaching his first final of the 2025 season at the Miami Open helped him find the motivation to continue his quest for more titles as the 37-year-old looks to win his 100th ATP trophy during the clay season.
The 24-times Grand Slam champion has not won a title on the men’s tour since his ATP Finals triumph during an extraordinary 2023 although he bagged the Olympic gold medal during the Paris Games at Roland Garros last year.
Djokovic’s bid to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only three men in the professional era to claim 100 or more ATP trophies ended in a defeat by Jakub Mensik last week but the Serb said he was spurred on by his level in Miami.
“There’s no doubt it has become more difficult throughout my career but the performances in Miami, when I’m playing that way, it gives me more inspiration to keep going,” Djokovic told reporters in Monte Carlo.
“It just feels great on the court when you’re striking the ball well and winning matches. Obviously when you start losing early you have more questions and inner voices, which are bringing doubts about whether you should keep going.
“I’m glad in Miami I found that joy on the court and performance levels, so let’s see if I can carry that into clay. It’s a different surface and I’ve not had much time to get used to this tournament so my expectations aren’t that high.”
Djokovic will be without his coach Andy Murray at the ongoing Monte Carlo Masters, with the Scot expected to return in Madrid later this month.
“It was never part of the agreement to work with Andy this week,” said Djokovic.
“I was thinking about who I wanted, anyone apart from my fitness coach and physio, and my brother Marko was able to join me, so that helps me on a different level emotionally.”
Third-seed Djokovic could meet Stan Wawrinka in his opening match in Monaco.

Title: IMD issues yellow alert for Delhi, red alert for Gujarat as heatwave intensifies across states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:42:06 +0000

Title: Iran-backed militias in Iraq ready to disarm to avert Trump wrath
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:37:44 +0000
Content: Several powerful Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the U.S. Trump administration, 10 senior commanders and Iraqi officials told media.
The move to defuse tensions follows repeated warnings issued privately by U.S. officials to the Iraqi government since Trump took power in January, according to the sources who include six local commanders of four major militias.
The officials told Baghdad that unless it acted to disband the militias operating on its soil, America could target the groups with airstrikes, the people added.
Izzat al-Shahbndar, a senior Shi’ite Muslim politician close to Iraq’s governing alliance, told Reuters that discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and several militia leaders were “very advanced”, and the groups were inclined to comply with U.S. calls for disarmament.
“The factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,” he said, adding that the groups were “fully aware” they could be targeted by the U.S.
The six militia commanders interviewed in Baghdad and a southern province, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation, are from the Kataib Hezbollah, Nujabaa, Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada and Ansarullah al-Awfiyaa groups.
“Trump is ready to take the war with us to worse levels, we know that, and we want to avoid such a bad scenario,” said a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Shi’ite militia, who spoke from behind a black face mask and sunglasses.
The commanders said their main ally and patron, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military force, had given them its blessing to take whatever decisions they deemed necessary to avoid being drawn into a potentially ruinous conflict with the United States and Israel.
The militias are part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of about 10 hardline Shi’ite armed factions that collectively command about 50,000 fighters and arsenals that include long-range missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, according to two security officials who monitor militias’ activities.
The Resistance group, a key pillar of Iran’s network of regional proxy forces, have claimed responsibility for dozens of missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Gaza war erupted about 18 months ago.
Farhad Alaaeldin, Sudani’s foreign affair adviser, told Reuters in response to queries about disarmament talks that the prime minister was committed to ensuring all weapons in Iraq were under state control through “constructive dialogue with various national actors”.
The two Iraqi security officials said Sudani was pressing for disarmament from all the militias of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which declare their allegiance to Iran’s IRGC or Quds Force rather than to Baghdad.
Some groups have already largely evacuated their headquarters and reduced their presences in major cities including Mosul and Anbar since mid-January for fear of being hit by air attacks, according to officials and commanders.
Many commanders have also stepped up their security measures in that time, changing their mobile phones, vehicles and abodes more frequently, they said.
The U.S. State Department said it continued to urge Baghdad to rein in the militias. “These forces must respond to Iraq’s commander-in-chief and not to Iran,” it added.
An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that there had been instances in the past when the militias had ceased their attacks because of U.S. pressure, and was sceptical any disarmament would be long-term.
The IRGC declined to comment for this article while the Iranian and Israeli foreign ministries didn’t respond to queries.
SHAKEN: IRAN’S AXIS OF RESISTANCE
Shahbndar, the Shi’ite politician, said the Iraqi government had not yet finalised a deal with militant leaders, with a disarmament mechanism still under discussion. Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added.
While the fate of any disarmament process remains uncertain, the discussions nonetheless mark the first time the militias have been prepared to give ground to longstanding Western pressure to demilitarize.
The shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran’s regional “Axis of Resistance” which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and U.S. influence but has seen severely weakened since Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict.
Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by U.S. airstrikes since last month. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another key Iranian ally, has further weakened the Islamic Republic’s influence.
Iraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealing with the militias on its soil. The groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower.
U.S. Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias carrying out revenge attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange.
The Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rockets attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza war began and killed three U.S. soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year.
Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq’s leadership to dismantle Shi’ite militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer.
“If we do not voluntarily comply, it may be forced upon us from the outside, and by force.”

Title: Archer’s quick redemption boosts Rajasthan’s IPL campaign
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:22:49 +0000
Content: England fast bowler Jofra Archer came back from bowling the costliest spell in Indian Premier League (IPL) history last month to become the match-winner in Rajasthan Royals’ victory on Saturday.
Archer, who missed the last IPL season and went into the 2025 mega auction as a late addition, had a forgettable start to the season, getting figures of 0-76 in Rajasthan’s season-opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad last month.
His performance continued to falter in the team’s eight-wicket defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders where he remained wicketless, bowling just 2.3 overs at an economy rate exceeding 13 runs per over.
Rajasthan, however, backed Archer and the pacer repaid the trust with a crucial performance in the side’s six-run win over Chennai Super Kings followed by a match-winning 3-25 spell against Punjab Kings on Saturday.
The 30-year-old made his mark in the first over, taking two wickets — dismissing Priyansh Arya off his first delivery and sending Punjab skipper Shreyas Iyer back to the pavilion to end the over.
Rajasthan defeated Punjab by 50 runs and, after being named Player of the Match, Archer said: “When there are days like this you’ve got to make sure you cash in… enjoy the good ones, take the bad ones in your stride.”
Sandeep Sharma, Archer’s fellow pacer, said that despite the Englishman’s poor start, the team always believed in him for his experience at the international level.
“We always knew, Jofra is a world-class bowler and the scale he brings to the table or into the game is totally different and I think very few can bring that,” Sandeep told reporters.
“So all the management and team had confidence in him that the day he gets that one over, one wicket, maybe two good overs, that will boost his confidence. He is one of the IPL’s toughest bowlers to face or play.
“It was just our fourth game and I’m pretty sure with more games we’re going to get better and better.”
With Archer’s return to form alongside Sandeep, Rajasthan now have two gun pacers in their arsenal, propelling the team forward in the IPL standings.
“That (Archer-Sandeep) is a very deadly combo — one guy bowling around 150 and another bowling around 115… I can trust them with pressure overs. We all love it when he (Archer) bowls those quick overs,” Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson said.

Title: Chintan Shivir 2025 to strengthen centre-state coordination and grassroots delivery of welfare services
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:10:19 +0000
Content: The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is organising a two-day national review conference — Chintan Shivir 2025 — on April 7-8 in Dehradun, Uttarakhand as stated by the Ministry on Sunday. The key focus of the event will be on effective convergence, enhanced Centre-State coordination, and inclusive delivery of government services at the grassroots level.

Title: Anti-Trump protesters gather in Washington, other US cities
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:07:41 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., and across the U.S. on Saturday, part of some 1,200 demonstrations that were expected to form the largest single day of protest against President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.
People streamed onto the expanse of grass surrounding the Washington Monument under gloomy skies and light rain. Organizers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend a rally at the National Mall.
Some 150 activist groups had signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests were planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.
Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among those who gathered by the stage beneath the Washington Monument.
She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”
The crowd around the memorial continued to build throughout the day. Some carried Ukrainian flags and others wore Palestinian keffiyeh scarves and carried “Free Palestine” signs, while Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives blasted Trump’s policies on stage.
Wayne Hoffman, 73, a retired money manager from West Cape May, New Jersey, said he was concerned about Trump’s economic policies, including his widespread use of tariffs.
“It’s going to cost the farmers in the red states. It’s going to cost people their jobs – certainly their 401Ks. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars,” Hoffman said.
Kyle, a 20-year-old intern from Ohio, was a lone Trump supporter, sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat and walking the fringe of the Washington, D.C., rally while engaging protesters in debate.
“Most people aren’t too hostile. A few people cuss,” said Kyle, who declined to give his last name.
Trump, who shook financial markets and upset nations around the world with a raft of trade tariffs this week, spent the day in Florida, playing a round of golf at his club in Jupiter before returning to his Mar-a-Lago compound in the afternoon.
Some four miles (6 km) from Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, more than 400 demonstrators gathered on a sunny day in protest. Drivers honked their horns in support of the pastel-and khaki-clad demonstrators as they passed by.
“Markets tank, Trump golfs,” read one sign.
At another protest in Stamford, Connecticut, Sue-ann Friedman, 84, brought a bright pink, handmade sign objecting to the administration’s moves to cut funding for medical research.
“I thought my marching days were over, and then we get somebody like Musk and Trump,” said Friedman.
Paul Kretschmann, a 74-year-old retired attorney in Stamford, said it was the first time he had ever attended a protest.
“My concern is that Social Security is going to be gutted, that we’re going to lose our benefits, and that there’s going to be nobody around to administer it in the first place,” he said. “I’m afraid that this is all part of a larger plan to dismantle the government and for Trump to maintain power.”
DOGE UNDER FIRE
With Trump’s blessing, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has scythed through the U.S. government, eliminating more than 200,000 jobs from the 2.3 million federal workforce. At times, the effort has been haphazard and forced the recall of needed specialists.
On Friday, the Internal Revenue Service began laying off more than 20,000 workers, as much as 25% of its ranks.
Several hundred people gathered outside the headquarters of the Social Security Administration, a top DOGE target, near Baltimore to protest against cuts to the agency which delivers benefits to the elderly and disabled.
Linda Falcao, who turns 65 in two months, told the crowd she had been paying into the Social Security fund since the age of 16.
“I’m terrified, I’m angry, I’m pissed, I’m bewildered this could happen to the United States,” she said. “I do love America and I’m heartbroken. I need my money. I want my money. I want my benefits!” The crowd chanted, “It’s our money!”
White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston disputed the protesters’ charge that Trump aimed to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
“President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors,” Huston said in an email.
Much of Trump’s agenda has been restrained by lawsuits contending he has overstepped his authority with attempts to fire civil servants, deport immigrants and reverse transgender rights.
Trump returned to office on January 20 with a stream of executive orders and other measures critics say are aligned with an agenda outlined by Project 2025, a deeply conservative political initiative to reshape government and consolidate presidential authority. His supporters have applauded Trump’s audacity as necessary to disrupt entrenched liberal interests.
Hours before the protests were due to kick off in the United States, hundreds of anti-Trump Americans living in Europe gathered in Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and London to voice opposition to Trump’s sweeping makeover of U.S. foreign and domestic policies.

Title: PM Modi urges Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles on World Health Day, warns of growing obesity crisis
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 04:33:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of World Health Day on Monday, urged Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles, stressing the need to combat obesity and prioritize personal fitness as crucial steps toward India’s goal of becoming a developed nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote “On World Health Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to building a healthier world. Our Government will continue to focus on healthcare and invest in the various aspects of people’s well-being. Good health is the foundation of every thriving society!”.
The Prime Minister shared a video message stressing that “health is the ultimate fortune and the ultimate wealth” and sounded the alarm on India’s rising obesity crisis. He referred to a recent report predicting that by 2050, over 440 million Indians could suffer from obesity, warning that this would pose a significant public health crisis. “This is scary. How big a crisis can this be?” he asked.
In the video, PM Modi called for action, urging citizens to make personal decisions for better health. “Adopting healthier eating habits, such as reducing oil usage, is not just a personal decision, but a social responsibility,” he stated. As part of his appeal, the Prime Minister proposed a simple yet impactful change: “I want to take a promise from you today that we all should reduce our cooking oil by 10 per cent. This will be a big step towards reducing obesity.”
PM Modi also encouraged the population to integrate regular physical activity into their daily routines. “Apart from this, we have to make exercise a part of our life. If we keep ourselves fit, it will be a big contribution to the journey of a Viksit Bharat,” he added.
The Prime Minister has consistently highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. During an episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat, he expressed concern about India’s rising obesity rates, citing alarming data from the World Health Organization (WHO). “One in every eight people in India is affected by obesity,” he revealed, noting that the prevalence of obesity has doubled in recent years, with childhood obesity increasing fourfold.
Obesity, PM Modi warned, can lead to severe health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, he emphasized that small but meaningful lifestyle changes can help combat these issues.
To further raise awareness and promote healthy living, the Prime Minister enlisted ten prominent public figures to join a nationwide campaign against obesity. The personalities involved include Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, industrialist Anand Mahindra, actor-politician Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua), Olympic medalists Manu Bhaker and Mirabai Chanu, actors Mohanlal and R. Madhavan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, philanthropist Sudha Murthy, and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.
PM Modi encouraged each of them to nominate ten more individuals, aiming to amplify the campaign’s reach and societal impact.

Title: SC dismisses plea seeking 100 pc counting of the VVPAT slips
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:17:59 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) that there should be 100 per cent manual counting of the VVPAT slips in addition to electronic counting by the control unit of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM).
A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K.V Viswanathan declined to interfere with the decision of the Delhi High Court which had earlier dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the appellant.
During the course of the hearing, the CJI Khanna-led Bench remarked that it would not be examining the same issues over and over again.
Ultimately, the apex court dismissed the special leave petition filed by the appellant-PIL litigant.
In April 2024, the Supreme Court had dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking mandatory cross-verification of the votes cast in EVMs with VVPAT slips.
A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta said that while it acknowledged the fundamental right of voters to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted, the same cannot be equated with the right to 100 per cent counting of VVPAT slips, or a right to physical access to the VVPAT slips, which the voter should be permitted to put in the drop box.
The appellant had moved a PIL before the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the ECI to use appropriate prototype of VVPAT system in the future, in which the printer is kept open and the printed ballot, which gets cut and falls out of the printer, is subject to verification by the voter, before providing the same to a presiding officer before leaving the polling station.
Declining to entertain the matter, the Delhi HC, in its judgment passed on August 12, last year, had said that the issue raised in the PIL was no longer res integra in view of the judgment delivered by the apex court.

Title: Invest in quality stocks with strong business models amid global uncertainty: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:14:35 +0000
Content: As global economic uncertainties rise due to US trade tariff tensions, inflation risks, and volatile markets, a new report released on Monday recommended investing in quality businesses for long-term gains.
“Investors should focus on companies that have strong business models, clear earnings growth potential, and steady cash flows, especially during times of heightened macroeconomic instability,” according to the report by SBI Funds Management.
The report highlights that global financial markets have been shaken by the return of aggressive US trade policies under Trump 2.0, including steep tariff hikes. India has also been affected, with reciprocal tariffs of up to 27 per cent imposed on various sectors.
The risk of stagflation — a mix of high inflation and slow growth — also looms large, especially if the US economy slows down due to rising prices and reduced consumer sentiment.
Despite these challenges, the report notes some positive shifts in India’s market environment. The correction in equity prices and falling bond yields have brought market valuations closer to historical averages.
Sentiment, too, has returned to more neutral levels, making current market conditions more favourable for long-term investors.
The report adds that India’s central bank, the RBI, has been proactive in managing liquidity. Since December 2024, it has injected over ₹8.9 lakh crore into the system through open market operations and other liquidity tools.
These measures have helped ease market interest rates and improve the overall transmission of monetary policy.
On the global front, the economic outlook remains mixed. While developed markets like Germany, Japan, and the UK have seen rising long-term yields, the US has maintained relatively steady rates.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut policy rates at least four more times, although the impact of ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain.
In India, the rupee has shown signs of recovery after a dip earlier in the fiscal year. Forex dynamics, capital flows, and RBI interventions will continue to play a key role in shaping liquidity and interest rates.
The report expects further easing of policy rates by the RBI in the upcoming review, though the central bank may maintain a neutral stance due to global uncertainties.
For debt investors, the SBI Funds report suggests that short-term bond funds and credit-oriented strategies could offer attractive opportunities, especially in the current low-rate environment.
It also highlights that hybrid investment products might be a safer option for those seeking stability amid equity market volatility.

Title: Govt raises excise duty on petrol, diesel by Rs 2; no hike in retail prices amid global oil price crash
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:03:14 +0000
Content: The central government has announced a hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre each, effective from Tuesday. However, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas clarified that this will not lead to any increase in the retail prices of the two fuels, owing to a sharp decline in global crude oil prices.
In a post on X, the Ministry said, “The PSU Oil Marketing Companies have informed that there will be no increase in retail prices of petrol and diesel, subsequent to the increase effected in Excise Duty Rates today.”
With the hike, the excise duty on petrol now stands at Rs 13 per litre, while that on diesel has increased to Rs 10 per litre.
The government’s move comes as international oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly four years. The benchmark Brent crude has fallen to $63 per barrel—the lowest since April 2021—while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has slipped to $59.57 per barrel.
Officials said the fall in crude prices reduces input costs for oil refining and marketing companies like Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, thereby increasing their retail margins. This allows the government to raise excise duty and generate additional revenue without passing the burden onto consumers.
The Ministry explained that the revenue generated will support the government’s fiscal needs while maintaining price stability for end users.
Oil prices continued to fall on Monday, with Brent futures losing $2.43 (3.7%) to settle at $63.15 per barrel and WTI crude futures declining by 3.9% to $59.57. The decline is attributed to growing trade tensions between the US and China, raising concerns of a potential global recession and reduced crude demand. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ cartel has decided to increase oil supply, adding further pressure on prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has also cut prices for crude sold to Asian buyers in May by up to $2.3 per barrel.
Experts say the slump in crude oil prices bodes well for India, which imports nearly 85% of its oil requirement. A decline in global oil prices typically reduces India’s import bill, narrows the current account deficit, and strengthens the rupee. It also helps ease inflation through lower prices of fuel and cooking gas in the domestic market.
Additionally, the government has continued to reduce the oil import bill by purchasing discounted Russian crude despite Western pressure following the Ukraine conflict. Russia has now become India’s top crude oil supplier, surpassing Iraq and Saudi Arabia. P
Recent data indicates that nearly 38% of India’s total crude oil imports now come from Russia, making India the largest buyer of Russian seaborne oil.

Title: Dubai Crown Prince to begin official visit to India from Tuesday
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:02:03 +0000
Content: Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum will begin a two-day official visit to India on Tuesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.
Sheikh Hamdan, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is visiting at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MEA added.
This will be Sheikh Hamdan’s first official visit to India as the Crown Prince of Dubai. He will be accompanied by a delegation comprising several UAE ministers, senior officials, and a high-level business contingent.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to host a working lunch for the Crown Prince on Tuesday. During his visit to New Delhi, Sheikh Hamdan will also hold meetings with External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Following his engagements in the capital, the Crown Prince will travel to Mumbai, where he will participate in a business roundtable with key Indian and Emirati business leaders. The interaction aims to deepen economic and commercial ties between the two nations, with a focus on both traditional and emerging sectors.
“Dubai has historically played a pivotal role in facilitating India’s commercial, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges with the UAE. A significant portion of the Indian diaspora—estimated at around 4.3 million—resides and works in Dubai. The visit of His Highness the Crown Prince will further reinforce the India–UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and bolster our multifaceted ties with Dubai,” the MEA said in a statement.
The invitation for this visit was extended by EAM Jaishankar during his official trip to the UAE from January 27–29 this year. Following his meeting with the Crown Prince, Jaishankar posted on X:
“Delighted to meet Crown Prince of Dubai and DPM and Minister of Defence of UAE HH Hamdan Mohammed. A warm conversation on our deep bonds of friendship and taking them forward for the good of our people.”
The Crown Prince’s visit is expected to further cement the growing partnership between India and the UAE, particularly in trade, investment, and strategic collaboration.

Title: Kremlin says Russia is ready to do all it can to help resolve US-Iran nuclear tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:56:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia was ready to do all it could to help resolve tensions between the United States and Iran around Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Washington demands Tehran do a nuclear deal with it or be bombed.
Moscow has repeatedly offered to mediate between the two sides after warnings of military action against Iran by U.S. President Donald Trump have rattled nerves across the region.
“We are in constant consultations with our Iranian partners, including on the topic of the nuclear deal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
“This process will continue, including in the near future. And, of course, Russia is ready to make every effort, to do everything possible to contribute to this problem’s resolution by political and diplomatic means.”
During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran says it needs nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and denies it is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.
Tehran has pushed back against Trump’s demands for direct talks, with a senior Iranian official issuing a warning over the weekend to neighbours that host U.S. bases that they could be in the firing line.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last week that Trump’s comments about bombing Iran only served to “complicate the situation” and cautioned that strikes could be “catastrophic” for the wider region.
Russia has for the most part refrained from such sharp criticism of Trump.
President Vladimir Putin has moved quickly since Trump took office to repair relations with the U.S. in a rapprochement viewed with concern by Ukraine and its European allies.
Moscow has also deepened ties with Tehran since the start of the full-scale conflict in Ukraine with the two signing a strategic partnership treaty in January.

Title: Indian markets follow global sell-off amid tariff jitters, Nifty closes above 22,100
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:46:19 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets went through a major sell-off on Monday amid global crash, with domestic benchmark indices falling sharply – registering their biggest one-day fall since June 4 last year when the Lok Sabha election results were announced.
However, a slight recovery in the final trading window helped the Nifty climb back above the 22,100 mark, easing some of the day’s earlier losses.
The Sensex tumbled 2,226.79 points, or 2.95 per cent, to close at 73,137.90. During the session, it swung between an intra-day high of 73,284.24 and a low of 71,425.01. Investors lost over Rs 13.5 lakh crore at the closing.
The Nifty followed a similar path, falling 742.85 points or 3.24 per cent to settle at 22,161.60. Tata Steel fell the most by dropping over 7 per cent on both the exchanges.
This sharp decline followed the biggest drop in Asian markets in 14 years, triggered by a slump in Wall Street.
The domestic market sentiment turned negative after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs, which were met with retaliatory measures from China.
This standoff between two major global economies has raised fears of a full-blown trade war, which could push the world into recession.
“The market tumbled as the carnage over high US tariffs and the retaliation by other countries may kickstart a trade war,” said Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments Limited.
He added that though the overall impact on India may be limited when compared with other countries, investors are advised to play cautiously during this fray.
“Focus will be on pure-play domestic themes, where the rebound is likely to be fair when the dust settles,” Nair stated.
The broader market also faced heavy selling pressure. Both the Nifty Midcap100 and Smallcap100 indices ended over 3 per cent lower.
Sector-wise, metal and realty stocks were the worst hit. The Nifty Metal index fell 6.75 per cent, while the Nifty Realty index dropped 5.69 per cent.
Other sectors like IT, banking, auto, and financial services also posted losses of up to 4 per cent. Even a better-than-expected US job report, which typically boosts global sentiment, failed to calm the nerves of investors as trade concerns took centre stage.
According to Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity, the downturn was primarily driven by escalating global uncertainties.
“Weak cues from Wall Street — where markets closed lower last Friday — spilled over into global markets, including India,” Kewat said.
“Investor sentiment took a hit amid growing recession fears, exacerbated by heightened global trade tensions,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee slightly weakened against the US dollar, closing 61 paise lower at 85.84, compared to Friday’s close of 85.23.
“Rupee is expected to trade in a wide range of 85.25–86.25, with elevated volatility anticipated in the near term,” Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities said.
Gold traded in a volatile range between Rs 87,900 and Rs 88,500 as markets digested the broader impact of the ongoing China-US tariff war.
Sentiment remained cautious with investors looking for further clarity from the US on its next course of action, especially amid escalating trade tensions.
The upcoming US CPI data is expected to play a crucial role in shaping rate cut expectations, which could influence gold’s direction globally. Domestically, the RBI policy meet later this week will be closely watched, as rupee volatility is likely to add another layer of uncertainty for MCX Gold, said Trivedi.

Title: Mumbai Indians coach Charlotte Edwards steps down, takes charge of England women
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:37:32 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians have officially parted ways with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who led the team to two Women’s Premier League (WPL) titles and will now take over as the head coach of the England women’s team.
Reflecting on her exit, a Mumbai Indians spokesperson said:
“Charlotte Edwards has been a leader for whom the entire #OneFamily has enormous admiration, appreciation, and respect. The incredible achievements she has driven the team toward include winning two titles in three years, inspiring the players to bring out their best, and furthering the MI legacy. We are grateful for everything she brought to the team and wish her all the very best for her new journey.”
A former England captain, Edwards represented her country in over 300 matches, winning two World Cups and five Ashes series during a distinguished 20-year career. With 10,273 runs across 309 international appearances, including 13 centuries, she remains one of the most decorated batters in women’s cricket history.
Following England’s underwhelming ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 campaign and a 16-0 Ashes whitewash by Australia, Edwards was appointed to succeed Jon Lewis as head coach. Since retiring from international cricket in 2017, she has found success as a coach in various leagues around the world, including stints with the Southern Vipers in England’s domestic circuit, Southern Brave in The Hundred, Sydney Sixers in the Women’s Big Bash League, and Mumbai Indians in the WPL.
As Edwards embarks on this new chapter, the Mumbai Indians extended their best wishes:
“Mumbai Indians wish Charlotte Edwards all the very best in her new role with the England Women’s team. The #OneFamily will always cheer for one of the greats of the game.”

Title: Watch for global retaliation to Trump tariffs, say experts, as markets slide
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:09:18 +0000
Content: Investors should closely monitor potential retaliatory measures from the European Union and other nations in response to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, experts warned on Monday. The caution came as Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp decline, triggered by a broader global sell-off fueled by escalating trade tensions.
Economist Pankaj Jaiswal told IANS, “The world is in reset mode for the first time since World War II, due to which stock markets globally, including India, have fallen drastically.”
“There is a risk of recession and inflation across the globe due to the trade war, and the US will be the most affected by this,” he added.
Market expert Sunil Shah, speaking to IANS, said that about a 4 per cent decline in the Indian stock market was triggered by the 34 per cent tariff imposed by China in retaliation to the US tariffs.
Shah stated, “Investors know that no country is going to benefit from the US tariffs, and this is the core reason why the world’s major markets crashed today.”
Selling pressure was seen across most Asian markets. Tokyo, Shanghai, Bangkok, Seoul, and Hang Seng indices fell by up to 11 per cent.
US markets also witnessed a massive sell-off on Friday due to reciprocal tariffs. The Dow closed down by 5.50 per cent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped nearly 5.82 per cent.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets extended their losses for a third straight session on Monday, following a global sell-off fueled by escalating trade war fears.
The decline is attributed to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, which have significantly heightened the risk of a global trade war.
Oil prices have also plunged amid global uncertainties, especially after Saudi Arabia issued its biggest price cut on the commodity in years. Brent crude slipped 2.67 per cent to $63.82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate fell 2.69 per cent to $60.31.

Title: Delhi braces for heatwave; red alert issued for Gujarat and West Rajasthan: IMD
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:01:24 +0000
Content: The national capital is likely to face heatwave conditions over the next three days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. 
The agency also issued a red alert for Gujarat and West Rajasthan, where heatwave to severe heatwave conditions are expected to persist.
IMD Scientist Dr Naresh Kumar said, “Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions currently prevail in Gujarat, for which we have issued a red alert. A red alert has also been issued for West Rajasthan for the coming two days.”
Dr Kumar added that heatwave conditions are likely in Punjab over the next three days and could extend to Haryana within four days. “Delhi can see heatwave conditions in the next three days,” he said.
He further noted that a Western Disturbance is expected to affect the Western Himalayan region starting April 8, which may bring some relief in the form of falling temperatures. “A western disturbance will influence the Himalayan region from tomorrow night, and its effects will be seen in the Himalayas. Temperatures in the Himalayas will start to fall after tomorrow night and after three days in Punjab and Haryana,” he said.
The IMD also reported that the weather in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) has remained mostly unchanged over the past 24 hours. Minimum temperatures have shown no major variation, while maximum temperatures have risen slightly.
According to the IMD, maximum temperatures across most parts of Delhi have ranged between 38°C and 39°C, while minimum temperatures have stayed between 19°C and 23°C. Maximum temperatures were above normal by 2-4°C in several areas.
The sky remained mostly clear on Monday, with west-north westerly winds reaching speeds of up to 18 km/h. These conditions have contributed to the heatwave, affecting daily life across the region.
The IMD continues to monitor the situation and has advised residents, especially in regions under red alert, to take necessary precautions.

Title: India, US work on ‘early conclusion’ of trade pact
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:43:22 +0000
Content: India and the United States on Monday reaffirmed their commitment to an “early conclusion” of a bilateral trade agreement, amid ongoing global trade tensions following new tariff announcements by the US.
Talks between the two countries have gained momentum in recent weeks, particularly after US President Donald Trump announced a reciprocal tariff of 26 percent on goods imported from India. This move is part of a broader tariff framework covering nearly all of the United States’ trading partners.
“Exchanged perspectives on the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Subcontinent, Europe, Middle East/West Asia and the Caribbean,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in a post on X following a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“Agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement,” Jaishankar added, noting that both sides would remain in close contact.
This phone call marks the first publicly known interaction between cabinet officials of the two countries since Trump’s announcement last Wednesday.
A readout of the call from the US side is awaited.
India has so far refrained from announcing retaliatory tariffs, in contrast to China, which imposed a 34 percent duty on American goods on Friday in response to the US move. Most other US trading partners, including Vietnam and Japan, have opted for dialogue over retaliation. Vietnam, for instance, has offered to reduce its tariffs to zero in an effort to maintain trade relations.
On Monday, President Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform:
“Countries from all over the world are talking to us. Tough but fair parameters are being set. Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the US very poorly on trade. They don’t take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. Likewise agriculture, and many other things. It all has to change, but especially with China!!!”
Later in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet Trump. The meeting is being described as the first in-person engagement between a foreign leader and the US President focused on the newly imposed tariffs. Israel has been hit with a 17 percent tariff, despite its close military ties with the US.

Title: Indian constitution upholds equality and social justice for all, says Om Birla at 150th IPU assembly
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:23:35 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday addressed the 150th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, emphasising the inclusive and welfare-oriented nature of the Indian Constitution. In his keynote address on “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice,” Birla said that the spirit of the Constitution lies in treating all citizens equally, offering equal opportunities, and integrating marginalised and backward communities into the mainstream of development.
Highlighting India’s legislative approach, Birla stated that the Indian Parliament has in recent years passed several laws aimed at strengthening social justice and security. These include the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, 2023. He also referred to the new labour laws and codes passed to protect workers in the unorganised sector.
Birla said that replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita has reinforced the principle of justice within India’s legal system.
He underlined the importance of parliamentary committees in supporting development and social justice goals, referring to them as “mini-parliaments” that complement the work of the legislature and the executive. Committees on Social Justice and Empowerment, Women Empowerment, and Labour and Skill Development, among others, monitor welfare programmes to ensure their effective implementation.
Birla also spoke about India’s efforts to improve human development indicators. He cited Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the world’s largest health insurance programme, which provides free health coverage to the bottom 40 percent of India’s population.
Referring to India’s economic growth, Birla said the country has witnessed 105 percent GDP growth over the past decade. He credited this to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said India is on track to becoming a developed nation by 2047. Currently the world’s fifth-largest economy, India is expected to become the third-largest soon, Birla added. He also said India is playing a leading role globally in sectors such as innovation, artificial intelligence, startups, space and defence technology, IT, fintech, and pharmaceuticals.
On the role of the IPU, Birla said the forum continues to strengthen global parliamentary cooperation. He welcomed the theme of the 150th Assembly, stating that it aligns with the Indian philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—the world is one family.
On the sidelines of the summit, Birla met Tran Thanh Man, President of the National Assembly of Vietnam. Birla recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations. He underscored the historical and cultural ties between India and Vietnam, which he said have deepened through high-level dialogues.
Both leaders discussed cooperation in areas such as defence, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy. Birla noted that parliamentary institutions in both countries are key to ensuring public welfare and leveraging emerging technologies for better governance. He also highlighted India’s “Digital Parliament” initiative, which he said has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in legislative processes.
He added that a significant number of Vietnamese students are availing themselves of educational and training scholarships in India.
Tran Thanh Man extended greetings on the occasion of Ram Navami and acknowledged the cultural ties between the two nations. He called for stronger collaboration in defence and technology and invited Birla to visit Vietnam. The formation of a parliamentary friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Harry Brook has officially been named England’s new white-ball captain, taking charge of both the T20I and ODI sides. The appointment comes in the wake of Jos Buttler stepping down following England’s early exit from the ICC Champions Trophy in March.
At 26, Brook has already served as vice-captain in the white-ball setup for the past year and previously led the team during a five-match ODI series against Australia last September in Buttler’s absence. His first official assignment as full-time captain will be a home series against the West Indies, featuring three T20Is and three ODIs, scheduled for late May.
“It’s a real honour to be named England’s white-ball captain,” Brook said. “Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me.”

Title: LPG price hiked by Rs 50 per cylinder from April 8
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:15:55 +0000
Content: The Centre has announced a hike in the price of domestic LPG cylinders by Rs 50, effective from April 8. The revised rates apply to both subsidised and non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinders, including beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY).
Announcing the revision, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the price for PMUY consumers will increase from Rs 500 to Rs 550 per cylinder, while other domestic consumers will see a rise from Rs 803 to Rs 853.
Puri added that LPG prices undergo periodic reviews every two to three weeks, based on global market trends.
The hike comes just a week after a reduction in commercial LPG rates. On April 1, oil marketing companies slashed the price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder by Rs 41. In Delhi, the revised rate for commercial cylinders now stands at Rs 1,762.
India imports around 60% of the LPG it consumes, making domestic prices sensitive to international fluctuations. The average global price of LPG surged by 63%, from US$ 385 per metric tonne in July 2023 to US$ 629 per metric tonne in February 2025.
Despite rising global prices, the effective cost for PMUY beneficiaries was brought down significantly last year. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Suresh Gopi informed the Lok Sabha that the average price for PMUY users dropped by 44%, from Rs 903 in August 2023 to Rs 503 in February 2025, due to subsidies.
As per government data presented in Parliament, the number of PMUY beneficiaries has increased to 10.33 crore as of March 1, 2025. The total number of active domestic LPG consumers in the country stands at 32.94 crore.
This is the first price hike for domestic LPG cylinders since August 2024, when the last revision was implemented.

Content: The Supreme Court of India on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Supreme Court of Nepal to enhance judicial cooperation between the two countries.
According to an official statement, the MoU aims to encourage mutual exchange of information on developments in the field of law and justice, and to promote interaction among judges and judicial officers through exchange visits, training programmes, and academic initiatives.
The agreement reflects the longstanding cordial ties between India and Nepal and seeks to strengthen cooperation between their respective judiciaries.
The MoU also highlights the role of technology in reducing case backlogs, speeding up judicial processes, and improving services for stakeholders. Both sides have agreed to share information on technologies used in their courts and related institutions.
A Joint Working Group, comprising officials from both judiciaries, will be established to develop and implement plans to advance the objectives outlined in the MoU.
The agreement was signed in the presence of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Chief Justice of Nepal Prakash Man Singh Raut.
In recent years, India has signed similar judicial cooperation MoUs with several countries, including Israel, Singapore, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. In September 2023, then Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud signed an MoU with the Supreme Court of Singapore during an official visit.

Title: PM MUDRA Yojana completes 10 years; over ₹32.6 lakh crore loans sanctioned since 2015
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:33:32 +0000
Content: India on Tuesday completes a decade since the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), the flagship credit support initiative aimed at providing institutional finance to non-corporate, non-farm micro and small enterprises.
Since its launch on April 8, 2015, the scheme has sanctioned more than 52 crore loans worth ₹32.61 lakh crore, according to official data. The average loan size has grown from ₹38,000 in FY16 to ₹1.02 lakh in FY25, reflecting increased demand for higher-value loans among small enterprises.
MSME Credit Expansion
The scheme has contributed to a major rise in credit flow to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). According to a report by the State Bank of India, MSME lending rose from ₹8.51 lakh crore in FY14 to ₹27.25 lakh crore in FY24, and is projected to cross ₹30 lakh crore in FY25. The share of MSME credit in total bank credit has increased from 15.8% in FY14 to nearly 20% in FY24.
Women Account for 68% of Beneficiaries
Women make up 68% of total Mudra loan recipients. Between FY16 and FY25, the average loan per woman rose at a 13% CAGR, reaching ₹62,679, while incremental deposits by women grew at a 14% CAGR to ₹95,269. States with a higher proportion of loans to women have seen higher employment generation among women-led MSMEs, according to government data.
Focus on Social Inclusion
The SBI report notes that 50% of Mudra accounts are held by SC, ST, and OBC entrepreneurs, while 11% are held by members of minority communities. This indicates expanded access to formal finance for traditionally underserved groups.
Loan Categories and Growth
The distribution of loan categories also indicates an upward trend in business scale. Kishor loans, covering credit between ₹50,000 and ₹5 lakh, grew from 5.9 percent of the total disbursal in FY16 to 44.7 percent in FY25. Loans in the Tarun category (₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh) are also seeing increased demand. A new category, Tarun Plus, was added to support enterprises seeking credit between ₹10 lakh and ₹20 lakh.
The average loan ticket size has tripled, from ₹38,000 in FY16 to ₹1.02 lakh in FY25. Loan disbursal under the scheme rose by 36 percent in FY23.
State-wise Disbursal
Tamil Nadu leads in total disbursal among states with ₹3.23 lakh crore, followed by Uttar Pradesh (₹3.14 lakh crore), Karnataka (₹3.02 lakh crore), West Bengal (₹2.82 lakh crore), and Bihar (₹2.81 lakh crore). Maharashtra reported ₹2.74 lakh crore in disbursals. Among Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir topped the list with ₹45,815.92 crore sanctioned across over 21 lakh loan accounts.
Sector Coverage and Employment
The scheme caters to micro units engaged in manufacturing, trading, processing, and services. These enterprises—many of which operate as sole proprietorships or own-account enterprises—employ nearly 10 crore people, making them the second-largest source of employment after agriculture.
Global Acknowledgement
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has consistently recognised the scheme’s role in expanding financial access. In its 2024 report, the IMF reaffirmed that schemes like PMMY have supported the growth of self-employment and formalisation of the economy through improved access to credit. Earlier assessments in 2017, 2019, and 2023 noted the programme’s contribution to promoting women-led businesses and enhancing financial inclusion.
Lending Institutions
The scheme is implemented through Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks, NBFCs, and Microfinance Institutions, offering collateral-free loans of up to ₹20 lakh. It operates under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA).

Title: SC dismisses plea seeking 100 pc counting of the VVPAT slips
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:17:59 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) that there should be 100 per cent manual counting of the VVPAT slips in addition to electronic counting by the control unit of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM).
A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K.V Viswanathan declined to interfere with the decision of the Delhi High Court which had earlier dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the appellant.
During the course of the hearing, the CJI Khanna-led Bench remarked that it would not be examining the same issues over and over again.
Ultimately, the apex court dismissed the special leave petition filed by the appellant-PIL litigant.
In April 2024, the Supreme Court had dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking mandatory cross-verification of the votes cast in EVMs with VVPAT slips.
A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta said that while it acknowledged the fundamental right of voters to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted, the same cannot be equated with the right to 100 per cent counting of VVPAT slips, or a right to physical access to the VVPAT slips, which the voter should be permitted to put in the drop box.
The appellant had moved a PIL before the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the ECI to use appropriate prototype of VVPAT system in the future, in which the printer is kept open and the printed ballot, which gets cut and falls out of the printer, is subject to verification by the voter, before providing the same to a presiding officer before leaving the polling station.
Declining to entertain the matter, the Delhi HC, in its judgment passed on August 12, last year, had said that the issue raised in the PIL was no longer res integra in view of the judgment delivered by the apex court.

Title: Invest in quality stocks with strong business models amid global uncertainty: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:14:35 +0000
Content: As global economic uncertainties rise due to US trade tariff tensions, inflation risks, and volatile markets, a new report released on Monday recommended investing in quality businesses for long-term gains.
“Investors should focus on companies that have strong business models, clear earnings growth potential, and steady cash flows, especially during times of heightened macroeconomic instability,” according to the report by SBI Funds Management.
The report highlights that global financial markets have been shaken by the return of aggressive US trade policies under Trump 2.0, including steep tariff hikes. India has also been affected, with reciprocal tariffs of up to 27 per cent imposed on various sectors.
The risk of stagflation — a mix of high inflation and slow growth — also looms large, especially if the US economy slows down due to rising prices and reduced consumer sentiment.
Despite these challenges, the report notes some positive shifts in India’s market environment. The correction in equity prices and falling bond yields have brought market valuations closer to historical averages.
Sentiment, too, has returned to more neutral levels, making current market conditions more favourable for long-term investors.
The report adds that India’s central bank, the RBI, has been proactive in managing liquidity. Since December 2024, it has injected over ₹8.9 lakh crore into the system through open market operations and other liquidity tools.
These measures have helped ease market interest rates and improve the overall transmission of monetary policy.
On the global front, the economic outlook remains mixed. While developed markets like Germany, Japan, and the UK have seen rising long-term yields, the US has maintained relatively steady rates.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut policy rates at least four more times, although the impact of ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain.
In India, the rupee has shown signs of recovery after a dip earlier in the fiscal year. Forex dynamics, capital flows, and RBI interventions will continue to play a key role in shaping liquidity and interest rates.
The report expects further easing of policy rates by the RBI in the upcoming review, though the central bank may maintain a neutral stance due to global uncertainties.
For debt investors, the SBI Funds report suggests that short-term bond funds and credit-oriented strategies could offer attractive opportunities, especially in the current low-rate environment.
It also highlights that hybrid investment products might be a safer option for those seeking stability amid equity market volatility.

Title: Govt raises excise duty on petrol, diesel by Rs 2; no hike in retail prices amid global oil price crash
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:03:14 +0000
Content: The central government has announced a hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre each, effective from Tuesday. However, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas clarified that this will not lead to any increase in the retail prices of the two fuels, owing to a sharp decline in global crude oil prices.
In a post on X, the Ministry said, “The PSU Oil Marketing Companies have informed that there will be no increase in retail prices of petrol and diesel, subsequent to the increase effected in Excise Duty Rates today.”
With the hike, the excise duty on petrol now stands at Rs 13 per litre, while that on diesel has increased to Rs 10 per litre.
The government’s move comes as international oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly four years. The benchmark Brent crude has fallen to $63 per barrel—the lowest since April 2021—while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has slipped to $59.57 per barrel.
Officials said the fall in crude prices reduces input costs for oil refining and marketing companies like Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, thereby increasing their retail margins. This allows the government to raise excise duty and generate additional revenue without passing the burden onto consumers.
The Ministry explained that the revenue generated will support the government’s fiscal needs while maintaining price stability for end users.
Oil prices continued to fall on Monday, with Brent futures losing $2.43 (3.7%) to settle at $63.15 per barrel and WTI crude futures declining by 3.9% to $59.57. The decline is attributed to growing trade tensions between the US and China, raising concerns of a potential global recession and reduced crude demand. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ cartel has decided to increase oil supply, adding further pressure on prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has also cut prices for crude sold to Asian buyers in May by up to $2.3 per barrel.
Experts say the slump in crude oil prices bodes well for India, which imports nearly 85% of its oil requirement. A decline in global oil prices typically reduces India’s import bill, narrows the current account deficit, and strengthens the rupee. It also helps ease inflation through lower prices of fuel and cooking gas in the domestic market.
Additionally, the government has continued to reduce the oil import bill by purchasing discounted Russian crude despite Western pressure following the Ukraine conflict. Russia has now become India’s top crude oil supplier, surpassing Iraq and Saudi Arabia. P
Recent data indicates that nearly 38% of India’s total crude oil imports now come from Russia, making India the largest buyer of Russian seaborne oil.

Title: Dubai Crown Prince to begin official visit to India from Tuesday
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:02:03 +0000
Content: Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum will begin a two-day official visit to India on Tuesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.
Sheikh Hamdan, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is visiting at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MEA added.
This will be Sheikh Hamdan’s first official visit to India as the Crown Prince of Dubai. He will be accompanied by a delegation comprising several UAE ministers, senior officials, and a high-level business contingent.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to host a working lunch for the Crown Prince on Tuesday. During his visit to New Delhi, Sheikh Hamdan will also hold meetings with External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Following his engagements in the capital, the Crown Prince will travel to Mumbai, where he will participate in a business roundtable with key Indian and Emirati business leaders. The interaction aims to deepen economic and commercial ties between the two nations, with a focus on both traditional and emerging sectors.
“Dubai has historically played a pivotal role in facilitating India’s commercial, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges with the UAE. A significant portion of the Indian diaspora—estimated at around 4.3 million—resides and works in Dubai. The visit of His Highness the Crown Prince will further reinforce the India–UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and bolster our multifaceted ties with Dubai,” the MEA said in a statement.
The invitation for this visit was extended by EAM Jaishankar during his official trip to the UAE from January 27–29 this year. Following his meeting with the Crown Prince, Jaishankar posted on X:
“Delighted to meet Crown Prince of Dubai and DPM and Minister of Defence of UAE HH Hamdan Mohammed. A warm conversation on our deep bonds of friendship and taking them forward for the good of our people.”
The Crown Prince’s visit is expected to further cement the growing partnership between India and the UAE, particularly in trade, investment, and strategic collaboration.
