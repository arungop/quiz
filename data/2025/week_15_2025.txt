Title: Lok Sabha speaker highlights India’s inclusive constitutional vision at 150th IPU Assembly in Tashkent
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 13:35:18 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla today highlighted the inclusive and welfarist nature of Constitution of India, mentioning that “the spirit of the Indian Constitution is to treat all citizens equally, provide them with equal opportunities, and integrate the marginalized and backward sections of society into the ‘mainstream of progress.’”
Delivering the keynote address on the theme “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice” at the historic 150th Assembly of Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Om Birla observed that “In recent years, the Indian Parliament has passed several legislations that promote social justice and security and encourage the inclusion of all sections of society.” On the occasion, he also extended Ram Navami greetings to the gathering at the 150th assembly of IPU.

Referring to the Parliament’s perennial concern for safeguarding the interests of the vulnerable segments of society, he added that “Bills like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act-2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam-2023 safeguard the interests of all sections of society.” In this context, he also referred to new labor laws and codes passed by Parliament for the welfare and social security of workers in the unorganized sector.
Stressing that Indian Parliament has taken several measures prioritising justice and rule of law, Om Birla mentioned that “By replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, India has established the primacy of justice.” Referring to functioning of parliamentary committees in achieving the goals of development and social justice, Om Birla noted that the various parliamentary committees, often referred to as mini parliaments, perform a complementary function to the efforts of Parliament and the government. He highlighted that the Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment; Committee on Women Empowerment; Committee on Labour and Skill Development, and other diverse committees monitor welfare programmes leading to implementation of schemes with effectiveness and accountability.
Om Birla stressed that Government of India works with a mission to achieve targets set for key human development indicators. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that “Under the world’s largest health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), free health insurance is being provided to the bottom 40% of India’s population.”
Praising the strong and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Om Birla said, “Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India has achieved the distinction of being the world’s fastest-growing major economy with a 105% GDP growth over the past decade and is rapidly progressing towards its goal of Viksit Bharat in 2047.” Noting that India is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on its way toward becoming the third-largest economy, Om Birla said that India is playing a leading role in the world in fields like innovation, AI, startups, space and defense technology, IT, fintech, pharma, and others.
He hoped that the discussions at the IPU Assembly would provide all delegations with new perspectives and will allow parliaments around the world to take concrete steps toward building a just, inclusive, and prosperous society.
Speaking on the role of IPU in the present world order, Om Birla mentioned that the IPU continues to add new dimensions to global parliamentary cooperation. He underlined that the theme chosen for the 150th IPU Assembly reflects the expansion of the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which is deeply rooted in Indian culture, tradition, and philosophy.
India-Vietnam Bilateral Engagement On The Sidelines of IPU
On the sidelines of the 150th IPU Summit, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met H.E. Mr. Tran Thanh Man, President, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Speaking on the occasion, Om Birla fondly recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022, marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Vietnam. He also emphasized the close cultural and historical ties between the two countries, which have strengthened through high-level discussions in recent years.
Om Birla expressed satisfaction that both countries are progressing toward sustainable development, driven by their respective visions for 2047 (India) and 2045 (Vietnam). He emphasized that cooperation in various sectors such as defense, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy has helped shape their future frameworks.
Om Birla noted that both countries’ parliamentary institutions play a key role in meeting people’s expectations and promoting public welfare, with India utilizing emerging technologies to enhance parliamentary processes and citizen participation. He also informed that the *Digital Parliament* initiative in India has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in parliamentary operations. He also highlighted the significant number of Vietnamese students benefiting from educational and training scholarships in India.
The President of the National Assembly of Vietnam extended best wishes on Ram Navami. He also emphasized the cultural ties between the two countries. The President also underlined the need for strengthening the close defence and technology ties between India and Vietnam. He extended an invitation to Om Birla to visit Vietnam. Formation of a friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a pointed dig at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy
Addressing a public gathering in Rameswaram after inaugurating the New Pamban Railway Bridge, the prime minister said that although he regularly receives letters from Tamil Nadu leaders, none of them are signed in Tamil.
“Sometimes, I am surprised when I receive letters from some leaders of Tamil Nadu — none of them are signed in Tamil. If we are truly proud of Tamil, then I would request everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil,” PM Modi said, emphasizing the importance of embracing and promoting one’s native language.
The PM also highlighted the central government’s efforts to promote Tamil language and culture globally.
“We are working continuously to ensure that Tamil language and Tamil heritage reach every corner of the world,” he added.
Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was felicitated by BJP leaders as he arrived to address a public meeting in Rameswaram city of Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu, after inaugurating India’s vertical sea-lift bridge, the New Pamban Bridge.
Tamil Nadu Governor R. N. Ravi and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present during the felicitation.

Title: Flood threat: Vadodara launches rapid river deepening project
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:39:51 +0000
Content: The Gujarat government has launched large-scale work under the Vishwamitri River Project, aimed at enhancing the river’s flow capacity and improving the management of urban water bodies.
An official stated that the project, currently in full swing, seeks to increase the Vishwamitri River’s water-carrying capacity by 40 percent within a target period of 100 days.
Last year, Vadodara experienced severe flooding, which caused widespread damage to infrastructure and led to the displacement of residents.
Determined to prevent a recurrence of such devastation, the government has fast-tracked river rejuvenation efforts. These include deepening and widening the Vishwamitri River, along with connecting key water bodies such as Ajwa Salav, Pratappura Sarovar, Dena Lake, and several city canals.
According to the official, a total of 526 machines have been deployed across various sites to execute the project on a war footing.
So far, 9.98 lakh cubic meters of soil and sludge have been excavated from the riverbed and surrounding areas.
“In addition, approximately 68 hectares of forest area have been cleared to facilitate smoother water flow. This is one of the most comprehensive flood prevention initiatives the city has ever seen. We are racing against time to complete the work before the monsoon,” said a senior project engineer.
He added that, alongside the river rejuvenation, efforts are also underway to clean and restore ten key lakes within the city.
“Work has been completed in two of these lakes, while development is ongoing in two others. In total, 474 deep rainwater recharge wells have been planned as part of the project, of which 25 have already been completed,” he said.
These wells are expected to improve groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff during heavy rainfall.
The project also includes a robust waste management component. As part of the cleaning and excavation process, 500 metric tons of plastic waste have been collected and sent to the Atladara processing plant for recycling.
Additionally, 11,000 metric tons of gravel recovered during the operation have been crushed and stored at the Atladara facility for potential reuse in infrastructure work.
Officials emphasized that the Vishwamitri River Project is not only about flood control — it is also a crucial step toward urban environmental restoration and climate resilience.
“With Vadodara’s growing population and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, the city’s natural drainage systems and water bodies require urgent and sustained attention,” they noted.

Title: Healthy start, hopeful future: Gujarat’s transformative healthcare journey
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 10:34:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Swasth Bharat, Samriddh Bharat” has served as the guiding force behind Gujarat’s remarkable progress in maternal and child healthcare under CM Bhupendra Patel, in alignment with the 2025 World Health Day theme, “Healthy Start, Hopeful Future.”
With initiatives focused on empowering women and improving neonatal care, Gujarat has halved its Maternal Mortality Rate—from 112 (2011-13) to 57 (2020). Over 14 lakh pregnant women annually receive timely check-ups, immunizations, and nutrition services. The state has also established 121 First Referral Units, 153 Blood Storage Units, and 20 Maternity ICUs, achieving an institutional delivery rate of 99.97%.
Infant Mortality Rate dropped from 54 (2005) to 23 (2020), thanks to programs like HBNC, HBYC, SAANS, and Stop Diarrhea, supported by a strong network of newborn care units.
Under SH-RBSK, over 1.61 crore children are screened annually. The initiative also facilitated 206 kidney, 37 liver, and 211 bone marrow transplants, and free treatment for thousands of children with serious health conditions.
The “Breaking the Silence” campaign has restored hearing in 3,260 children via free cochlear implants. In 2025, Gujarat won two Gold SKOCH Awards for excellence in child health.
Gujarat also pioneered digital health cards for schoolchildren, with over 1.15 crore cards issued. Between 2019–2023, the state ranked first nationally in newborn screening and congenital disorder management.

Title: Samsung seeks ways to cushion blow from US tariffs
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:53:39 +0000
Content: Tech giant Samsung Electronics may need to overhaul its global production strategy as new U.S. reciprocal tariffs could significantly impact its smartphone business, industry sources said on Sunday.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a minimum 10 percent “baseline” tariff on all imports to the United States, along with country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on goods from South Korea.
The reciprocal tariffs—covering most product categories except for items such as vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals—are set to take effect from Wednesday (U.S. time), according to Yonhap news agency.
Experts and industry analysts noted that Samsung Electronics will need to adapt to the U.S. tariff policy by leveraging its strategy of diversifying production bases.
Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, currently produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam, which now faces a 46 percent reciprocal tariff on goods entering the U.S. The remainder of its smartphone production is spread across India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea.
India faces a 26 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and Brazil just 10 percent—making Brazil a potentially attractive hub for serving the U.S. market.
Sources suggest Samsung may consider ramping up production in India, Brazil, and South Korea, particularly for premium models intended for American consumers.
Brazil, in particular, stands out due to its low tariffs and geographic proximity to the U.S., they added.
The company is expected to reassess its production strategy ahead of the summer launch of its next-generation foldable smartphones, but for now, it is proceeding cautiously.
“Nothing has been decided yet,” said an official from Samsung Electronics.
South Korea’s economy is likely to face headwinds as the U.S. administration’s reciprocal tariffs may severely impact the country’s exports to the United States, while also disrupting the global market—potentially dealing a further blow to South Korean trade, local experts warned.
They expressed serious concerns for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, especially as the Trump administration continues to implement protectionist trade policies, including 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as similarly high duties on foreign-made cars.

Title: PM Modi offers prayers at Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:18:39 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the Ramanathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. He was also garlanded by the temple priest.
The Ramanathaswamy Shiva Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. The temple holds mythological significance as it is believed that Lord Ram established and worshipped at this temple before crossing the Ram Setu bridge to reach Sri Lanka to rescue his wife from Ravan. It also features the longest corridor among Hindu temples in India.
Governor R.N. Ravi had also visited the temple before the inauguration of the bridge.
Earlier today, while sharing an aerial view during his return journey from Sri Lanka, PM Modi highlighted how he was able to have a “darshan” of both Ram Setu and Ayodhya’s ‘Surya Tilak’.
“On the way back from Sri Lanka a short while ago, I was blessed to have a darshan of the Ram Setu. And, as a divine coincidence, it happened at the same time as the Surya Tilak was taking place in Ayodhya. Blessed to have the darshan of both,” the PM said in a post on X.
PM Modi is also scheduled to hold roadshows in a Tamil Nadu city.

Title: Sri Lanka releases 14 Indian fishermen during PM Modi’s visit
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:40:36 +0000
Content: In a significant gesture underscoring growing bilateral goodwill, Sri Lanka on Sunday released 14 Indian fishermen during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation. 
The release followed detailed discussions between PM Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier on Saturday, during which the long-standing issue of fishermen’s arrests was taken up.
The Prime Minister, during his remarks at a joint press briefing, said, “We discussed the fishermen’s issues. We agreed that we should move forward in this matter with a humane approach. We stressed the immediate release of the fishermen and the return of their boats.”
The arrest of Indian fishermen, primarily from Tamil Nadu, by Sri Lankan authorities for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters has been a recurring point of tension.
Since the beginning of 2025, 119 Indian fishermen and 16 fishing boats have reportedly been apprehended by Sri Lankan forces, raising concerns among coastal communities and prompting repeated appeals for intervention.
Addressing a press conference following the talks, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “We have been informed that the Sri Lankan authorities have taken a decision to release 11 fishermen imminently, and perhaps a few more in the coming days.”
“This was a subject that was discussed in considerable detail between the two sides. As the Prime Minister said himself during his remarks, there was an emphasis on the need to adopt a humanitarian and constructive approach to cooperation on these issues because these are ultimately issues that impact the livelihood of fishermen on both sides,” Misri added.
The release of 14 Indian fishermen comes amid a series of key diplomatic and developmental engagements during PM Modi’s visit, which included the joint inauguration of India-backed railway projects such as the upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway track and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.

Title: PM Modi inaugurates India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge in Tamil Nadu
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:33:29 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the New Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. This landmark project is India’s first vertical-lift sea bridge, showcasing the nation’s growing engineering and infrastructural capabilities.
The 2.07-kilometre-long bridge, spanning the Palk Strait, stands as a testament to India’s engineering prowess and visionary infrastructure development. PM Modi, accompanied by Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi, flagged off the first train to cross the sea bridge.
A demonstration showcased the bridge’s functionality, with visuals capturing key moments. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) boat successfully navigated under the structure, highlighting its vertical clearance and maritime accessibility. Following the boat’s passage, a train crossed the bridge, demonstrating its structural integrity and operational readiness.
Earlier in the day, Union Minister Vaishnaw hoisted the BJP flag at the Pamban Bridge site and congratulated party workers on the BJP’s foundation day.  
“The resolve of Antyodaya and the spirit of ‘Nation First, Always First’… Heartfelt congratulations to all workers on the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” his post read.
Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi also visited the Swamy Temple in Rameswaram ahead of the inauguration.
The story of the bridge dates back to 1914, when British engineers constructed the original Pamban Bridge—a cantilever structure with a Scherzer rolling lift span—connecting Rameswaram Island to mainland India. The new bridge, sanctioned in 2019, is three metres taller than the original, enhancing sea connectivity and accommodating maritime traffic more efficiently.
The bridge has long served as a vital link for pilgrims, tourists, and trade. However, the harsh marine environment and increasing transportation demands necessitated a modern upgrade. In 2019, the central government approved the construction of a technologically advanced, future-ready replacement.
Constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna PSU under the Ministry of Railways, the New Pamban Bridge has been designed to meet higher standards for speed, load-bearing capacity, and maritime clearance. It enhances connectivity while showcasing India’s capabilities in safety, durability, and innovation.
As India’s first vertical lift sea bridge, the New Pamban Bridge joins the ranks of other iconic international structures known for their engineering achievements—such as the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, Tower Bridge in London, and the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.

Title: Lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust, hope: Amit Shah congratulates party workers on BJP’s Foundation Day
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:46:27 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated party workers on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Foundation Day on Sunday, saying that the lotus symbol has emerged as a powerful emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the people.
In a post on X, Shah said, “Today, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the lotus symbol has become a new emblem of trust and hope in the hearts of the countrymen. The works of service, security, and cultural awakening that the BJP has undertaken in the past decade will become milestones in the days to come.”
“Crores of BJP workers, steadfastly adhering to ideological commitment, will continue to contribute to nation-building” he added. 
Recalling the party’s key achievements, including the revocation of Article 370 and the movement to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said the party has always ensured the welfare of the poor, the underprivileged, and women.
“Whether it is about taking the Shri Ram Temple movement to every individual, making the removal of Article 370 its resolve, or ensuring the welfare of the poor, the deprived, and women — BJP has, since its inception, made the nation’s interest its highest goal,” his post read.
Highlighting the party’s journey since its inception in 1980, Shah said the BJP has consistently demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies and ensuring welfare for farmers.
“In its four-decade journey, BJP has demonstrated how a political party can remain committed to honoring legacies, providing every poor person with housing, food, health insurance, and promoting the welfare of farmers all at once,” the home minister said.
The BJP was officially formed on April 6, 1980, based on the Panch Nishthas (Five Commitments). However, the party’s roots trace back to the formation of the Jana Sangh in 1950.
The Jana Sangh was founded by former Union Minister Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the Emergency ended in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party to oppose the Congress. However, a dispute arose over dual membership—whether members affiliated with the RSS could remain in the Janata Party. This led to the Jana Sangh members parting ways and forming the BJP on April 6, 1980.
Since its formation, the BJP has had two Prime Ministers: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.
The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it won 303 seats—the highest in its history.

Title: PM Modi, Lankan President Dissanayake launch India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura
Publication Date: Sun, 06 Apr 2025 07:16:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, jointly inaugurated and flagged off key India-backed railway projects in Anuradhapura on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in the growing bilateral infrastructure cooperation between the two nations.
At a formal ceremony held at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, the two leaders launched two major projects — the upgraded railway track of the Maho-Omanthai line and the newly constructed signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura segment.
Both projects were executed with Indian assistance and are expected to significantly improve connectivity and safety across the northern rail network.
Large crowds of enthusiastic locals gathered at the station to welcome the leaders, many of whom captured the moment on their phones as the Prime Minister and the Lankan President arrived together.
The railway projects have been implemented by IRCON International Limited, a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.
Speaking to IANS, IRCON CMD Hari Mohan Gupta said, “Today is a very fortunate day that our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the President of Sri Lanka together are dedicating to the nation an upgraded railway project spanning 128 kilometres, which was in a very bad condition earlier.”
“It’s a moment of great honour for India and Sri Lanka,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi and President Dissanayake visited the revered Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple to seek blessings.
The temple, a major spiritual and civilisational site, houses the sacred Bodhi tree believed to have grown from a sapling brought from India by Theri Sanghamitta, daughter of Emperor Ashoka.
As a mark of goodwill, the chief priest of the temple tied a Raksha Sutra (protective thread) on Prime Minister Modi’s wrist during the visit.
Highlighting the symbolic nature of the visit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “President Dissanayake and the Prime Minister will travel together to the historic city of Anuradhapura. They will pay their respects at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi temple, which holds a special significance in the India-Sri Lanka civilisational partnership. The sapling brought by Theri Sanghamitta from India was planted in the precincts of this temple.”
Earlier in the day, PM Modi arrived in Anuradhapura to a ceremonial Guard of Honour presented by the Sri Lankan Air Force.
Sharing a moment from the visit, Prime Minister Modi posted a photo with the Lankan President on X, stating, “In Anuradhapura with my friend, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.”
The two leaders had on Saturday also held wide-ranging discussions in Colombo aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across various sectors.
Following the talks, Prime Minister Modi was conferred with the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushan, one of the island nation’s highest civilian honours — a recognition of India’s unwavering support and the Prime Minister’s personal contribution to deepening bilateral ties.
The day also witnessed the signing and exchange of several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), with both leaders jointly unveiling new India-supported initiatives across the infrastructure, energy, and development sectors.

Title: Over 50 nations want to start trade talks with US after tariffs, Trump officials say
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 07:31:58 +0000
Content: More than 50 nations have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks since U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out sweeping new tariffs, top officials said on Sunday as they defended levies that wiped out nearly $6 trillion in value from U.S. stocks last week and downplayed economic fallout.
On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump’s top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the U.S. in the global trade order. They also tried to minimize the economic shocks from last week’s tumultuous rollout, ahead of Monday’s expected bumpy opening of Asian stock markets.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the U.S. since last Wednesday’s announcement, putting Trump in a position of power.
Neither Bessent nor the other officials named the countries or offered details about the talks. But simultaneously negotiating with multiple countries could pose a logistical challenge for the Trump administration and prolong economic uncertainty.

“He’s created maximum leverage for himself,” Bessent said on NBC News’ ‘Meet the Press.’
Bessent downplayed the stock market drop and said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession based on the tariffs, citing stronger-than-anticipated U.S. jobs growth.
Trump jolted economies around the world after he announced broad tariffs on U.S. imports, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a global trade war and recession.
JPMorgan economists now estimate the tariffs will result in full-year U.S. gross domestic product declining by 0.3%, down from an earlier estimate of 1.3% growth, and that the unemployment rate will climb to 5.3% from 4.2% now.
As investors girded for the opening of stock markets in Asia, the Republican president spent the weekend in Florida, playing golf and posting a video of his swing to social media on Sunday.
TARIFF DEALMAKING
U.S. customs agents began collecting Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (4:01 a.m. GMT).
Some nations have already signaled a willingness to engage with the U.S. to avoid the duties.
Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te on Sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks with the U.S., pledging to remove trade barriers and saying Taiwanese companies will raise their U.S. investments.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would seek a reprieve from a 17% tariff on the country’s goods during a planned meeting with Trump on Monday.
An Indian government official told Reuters the country does not plan to retaliate against a 26% tariff and said talks were under way with the U.S. over a possible deal.
In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – a Trump ally – pledged on Sunday to shield businesses that suffered damage from a planned 20% tariff on goods from the European Union.
Italian wine producers and U.S. importers at a wine fair in Verona on Sunday said business had already slowed and feared more lasting damage.
NO STRATEGY TO TANK STOCK MARKET
Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after the worst week for U.S. stocks since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis five years ago.
The S&P 1500 Composite Index, among the widest measures of the U.S. market, lost nearly $6 trillion in value in the two days after Trump’s announcement and has had almost $10 trillion wiped out since mid-February, a significant blow to millions of Americans’ retirement nest eggs.
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied that the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He said there would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.
In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump shared a video that suggested his tariffs aimed to hammer the stock market on purpose in a bid to force lower interest rates.
The social media post fueled global debate over whether Trump’s tariffs were part of a permanent new tariff regime or simply a negotiating tactic that could lead to the tariffs being eased through concessions by other countries.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ that they could be the latter, saying the tariffs would remain in place “for days and weeks.”
The process used to determine the tariffs came under scrutiny last week after they were applied to uninhabited Antarctic islands populated by penguins and other tiny, remote places.
Lutnick said a comprehensive approach was needed so that small nations could not be used by larger countries to circumvent the tariffs.
“Basically (Trump) said, ‘I can’t let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them,'” Lutnick said.

Title: ‘Adolescence’ TV drama exposes global issue of teenage violence
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:55:13 +0000
Content: TV drama “Adolescence” has shocked and captivated audiences around the world, providing what campaigners say is a rare opportunity to tackle the largely hidden world of online misogyny and violence.
Since its release on Netflix on March 13, more than 96 million people have watched the British four-episode series that begins with armed police raiding the home of a terrified 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a young girl, and ends with a raw illustration of the pain of his broken family.
The action in between, with each hour-long episode shot in a dizzying single take, slowly destroys the initial disbelief that a child so young could commit such a violent crime.
It depicts a toxic online culture known loosely as the manosphere in which common teenage male insecurities about attractiveness and romantic failure can warp into resentment and hatred of the opposite sex.
“There are people who will watch it and go ‘but that boy couldn’t do that’. The point is that boy can do it,” said Susie McDonald, CEO of charity Tender that educates children and adults on healthy relationships
“Suddenly the possibility becomes normal, and so we begin to say, what on earth can we do to stop that from happening?”
The show is number one in the Netflix global Top 10 and heads the charts in almost every country – from Brazil to Bahrain – for which the streaming platform provides data.
“Although on the surface it feels like it’s a very British production … actually, the themes that it’s dealing with: what our children are doing online, what they’re listening to … I think that’s as important in America, as it is India, as it is Australia,” film critic Kaleem Aftab told Reuters.
Portuguese police produced a guide for parents to explain the hidden meaning of emojis used by young people – a plot component in the show. The Sydney Morning Herald produced a guide on how to talk to children more effectively than the parents in the programme.
British police urged parents to look for signs their child may be being radicalised online, using data showing 60% of referrals to its terrorism prevention system came from children aged 17 or under to highlight the scale of the wider problem.
HIT HOME HARD IN DOWNING STREET
“Adolescence” reached the home of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who watched it with his teenage son and daughter.
“It hit home hard,” Starmer said in a statement, backing a scheme to make the show available to schools across the country and encouraging a national conversation on the isues it raises.
“This isn’t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.”
Matt Pinkett, an author on masculinity and a teacher, described how the show had left him fizzing with lesson ideas, but said it needed to be used carefully to avoid further marginalising boys already at risk of radicalisation.
The show has created a moment that campaigners, police and educators have been waiting for: a general public prepared to accept the uncomfortable truth that they do not know what their children are doing online, and that they all need help.
“This is the start of something. What we need to do as an education profession is make sure that we take advantage of that,” said Pepe Di’Iasio, General Secretary of Britain’s Association of School and College Leaders.
McDonald said Tender was working with Netflix to produce materials teachers can use in schools, using script excerpts and clips of scenes to spark wider discussion.
“This (show) is not going to solve the problem, but it’s enabled everybody to actually notice that there is a problem,” she said.

Title: Second measles death reported in Texas as outbreak spreads to 22 U.S. states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:29:27 +0000
Content: A second child with measles has died in Texas, state officials said on Sunday, in an outbreak of the childhood disease that has resulted in nearly 500 cases in Texas and has spread across 22 states.
The unvaccinated school-aged child, who had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
“The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,” Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email.
It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late Januaryin Gaines County, where the vaccination rate is about 82%, below the 95% considered protective for those who cannot be vaccinated.
When asked about the measles death, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One that if the outbreak progresses his administration will “have to take action very strongly.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in a post on X, identified the child as 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and said he visited Texas on Sunday to comfort the family.
Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocatewho has declared that vaccination is a personal choice, said on Sunday vaccines are the best protection against measles.
“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there were 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas.
Kennedy has previously also recommended Vitamin A as a measles treatment, along with good nutrition. While Vitamin A has been shown in some studies in developing countries to lessen the severity of symptoms, it can lead to liver toxicity in high quantities.
Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, wrote on X after the child’s death was disclosed: “Everyone should be vaccinated.”
“Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies,” Cassidy wrote on X.
Cassidy had backed Kennedy’s confirmation after Kennedy promised not to make changes to vaccine oversight.
The measles vaccine is 97% effective after two shots.
He said teams from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been redeployed to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott.
The CDC on its website says the vaccine is “the best protection against measles,” which spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.
KENNEDY HEARING POSTPONED
Cassidy last week called for Kennedy to appear before the Senate health committee on April 10 to discuss the U.S. health department’s restructuring in which 10,000 people were being laid off, including from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But on Friday a committee official said the hearing would not occur on April 10 because seven days’ notice had not been given as required by committee procedure. No date has been set.
The Texas Department of State Health Services reportedon Friday 59 new measles cases in three days, a 15% jump, for a total of 481 in the state since late January.
Related measles outbreaks have been reported in other states, including New Mexico and Oklahoma. In addition, an unvaccinated New Mexico adult tested positive for measles after dying in March.
As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a weekly nationwide increase of 124 measles cases, bringing the total to 607 so far this year. That compares to a nationwide total in 2024 of 285 reported cases.
CDC officials said 97% of U.S. cases are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.
Pediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease.

Title: Djokovic motivated again after Miami run but keeping expectations
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 06:25:48 +0000
Content: Novak Djokovic said reaching his first final of the 2025 season at the Miami Open helped him find the motivation to continue his quest for more titles as the 37-year-old looks to win his 100th ATP trophy during the clay season.
The 24-times Grand Slam champion has not won a title on the men’s tour since his ATP Finals triumph during an extraordinary 2023 although he bagged the Olympic gold medal during the Paris Games at Roland Garros last year.
Djokovic’s bid to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only three men in the professional era to claim 100 or more ATP trophies ended in a defeat by Jakub Mensik last week but the Serb said he was spurred on by his level in Miami.
“There’s no doubt it has become more difficult throughout my career but the performances in Miami, when I’m playing that way, it gives me more inspiration to keep going,” Djokovic told reporters in Monte Carlo.
“It just feels great on the court when you’re striking the ball well and winning matches. Obviously when you start losing early you have more questions and inner voices, which are bringing doubts about whether you should keep going.
“I’m glad in Miami I found that joy on the court and performance levels, so let’s see if I can carry that into clay. It’s a different surface and I’ve not had much time to get used to this tournament so my expectations aren’t that high.”
Djokovic will be without his coach Andy Murray at the ongoing Monte Carlo Masters, with the Scot expected to return in Madrid later this month.
“It was never part of the agreement to work with Andy this week,” said Djokovic.
“I was thinking about who I wanted, anyone apart from my fitness coach and physio, and my brother Marko was able to join me, so that helps me on a different level emotionally.”
Third-seed Djokovic could meet Stan Wawrinka in his opening match in Monaco.

Title: IMD issues yellow alert for Delhi, red alert for Gujarat as heatwave intensifies across states
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:42:06 +0000

Title: Iran-backed militias in Iraq ready to disarm to avert Trump wrath
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:37:44 +0000
Content: Several powerful Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the U.S. Trump administration, 10 senior commanders and Iraqi officials told media.
The move to defuse tensions follows repeated warnings issued privately by U.S. officials to the Iraqi government since Trump took power in January, according to the sources who include six local commanders of four major militias.
The officials told Baghdad that unless it acted to disband the militias operating on its soil, America could target the groups with airstrikes, the people added.
Izzat al-Shahbndar, a senior Shi’ite Muslim politician close to Iraq’s governing alliance, told Reuters that discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and several militia leaders were “very advanced”, and the groups were inclined to comply with U.S. calls for disarmament.
“The factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,” he said, adding that the groups were “fully aware” they could be targeted by the U.S.
The six militia commanders interviewed in Baghdad and a southern province, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation, are from the Kataib Hezbollah, Nujabaa, Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada and Ansarullah al-Awfiyaa groups.
“Trump is ready to take the war with us to worse levels, we know that, and we want to avoid such a bad scenario,” said a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful Shi’ite militia, who spoke from behind a black face mask and sunglasses.
The commanders said their main ally and patron, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military force, had given them its blessing to take whatever decisions they deemed necessary to avoid being drawn into a potentially ruinous conflict with the United States and Israel.
The militias are part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of about 10 hardline Shi’ite armed factions that collectively command about 50,000 fighters and arsenals that include long-range missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, according to two security officials who monitor militias’ activities.
The Resistance group, a key pillar of Iran’s network of regional proxy forces, have claimed responsibility for dozens of missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Gaza war erupted about 18 months ago.
Farhad Alaaeldin, Sudani’s foreign affair adviser, told Reuters in response to queries about disarmament talks that the prime minister was committed to ensuring all weapons in Iraq were under state control through “constructive dialogue with various national actors”.
The two Iraqi security officials said Sudani was pressing for disarmament from all the militias of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which declare their allegiance to Iran’s IRGC or Quds Force rather than to Baghdad.
Some groups have already largely evacuated their headquarters and reduced their presences in major cities including Mosul and Anbar since mid-January for fear of being hit by air attacks, according to officials and commanders.
Many commanders have also stepped up their security measures in that time, changing their mobile phones, vehicles and abodes more frequently, they said.
The U.S. State Department said it continued to urge Baghdad to rein in the militias. “These forces must respond to Iraq’s commander-in-chief and not to Iran,” it added.
An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that there had been instances in the past when the militias had ceased their attacks because of U.S. pressure, and was sceptical any disarmament would be long-term.
The IRGC declined to comment for this article while the Iranian and Israeli foreign ministries didn’t respond to queries.
SHAKEN: IRAN’S AXIS OF RESISTANCE
Shahbndar, the Shi’ite politician, said the Iraqi government had not yet finalised a deal with militant leaders, with a disarmament mechanism still under discussion. Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added.
While the fate of any disarmament process remains uncertain, the discussions nonetheless mark the first time the militias have been prepared to give ground to longstanding Western pressure to demilitarize.
The shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran’s regional “Axis of Resistance” which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and U.S. influence but has seen severely weakened since Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict.
Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by U.S. airstrikes since last month. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another key Iranian ally, has further weakened the Islamic Republic’s influence.
Iraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealing with the militias on its soil. The groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower.
U.S. Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias carrying out revenge attacks on Israel and U.S. bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange.
The Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rockets attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza war began and killed three U.S. soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year.
Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq’s leadership to dismantle Shi’ite militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer.
“If we do not voluntarily comply, it may be forced upon us from the outside, and by force.”

Title: Archer’s quick redemption boosts Rajasthan’s IPL campaign
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:22:49 +0000
Content: England fast bowler Jofra Archer came back from bowling the costliest spell in Indian Premier League (IPL) history last month to become the match-winner in Rajasthan Royals’ victory on Saturday.
Archer, who missed the last IPL season and went into the 2025 mega auction as a late addition, had a forgettable start to the season, getting figures of 0-76 in Rajasthan’s season-opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad last month.
His performance continued to falter in the team’s eight-wicket defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders where he remained wicketless, bowling just 2.3 overs at an economy rate exceeding 13 runs per over.
Rajasthan, however, backed Archer and the pacer repaid the trust with a crucial performance in the side’s six-run win over Chennai Super Kings followed by a match-winning 3-25 spell against Punjab Kings on Saturday.
The 30-year-old made his mark in the first over, taking two wickets — dismissing Priyansh Arya off his first delivery and sending Punjab skipper Shreyas Iyer back to the pavilion to end the over.
Rajasthan defeated Punjab by 50 runs and, after being named Player of the Match, Archer said: “When there are days like this you’ve got to make sure you cash in… enjoy the good ones, take the bad ones in your stride.”
Sandeep Sharma, Archer’s fellow pacer, said that despite the Englishman’s poor start, the team always believed in him for his experience at the international level.
“We always knew, Jofra is a world-class bowler and the scale he brings to the table or into the game is totally different and I think very few can bring that,” Sandeep told reporters.
“So all the management and team had confidence in him that the day he gets that one over, one wicket, maybe two good overs, that will boost his confidence. He is one of the IPL’s toughest bowlers to face or play.
“It was just our fourth game and I’m pretty sure with more games we’re going to get better and better.”
With Archer’s return to form alongside Sandeep, Rajasthan now have two gun pacers in their arsenal, propelling the team forward in the IPL standings.
“That (Archer-Sandeep) is a very deadly combo — one guy bowling around 150 and another bowling around 115… I can trust them with pressure overs. We all love it when he (Archer) bowls those quick overs,” Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson said.

Title: Chintan Shivir 2025 to strengthen centre-state coordination and grassroots delivery of welfare services
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:10:19 +0000
Content: The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is organising a two-day national review conference — Chintan Shivir 2025 — on April 7-8 in Dehradun, Uttarakhand as stated by the Ministry on Sunday. The key focus of the event will be on effective convergence, enhanced Centre-State coordination, and inclusive delivery of government services at the grassroots level.

Title: Anti-Trump protesters gather in Washington, other US cities
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:07:41 +0000
Content: Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., and across the U.S. on Saturday, part of some 1,200 demonstrations that were expected to form the largest single day of protest against President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.
People streamed onto the expanse of grass surrounding the Washington Monument under gloomy skies and light rain. Organizers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend a rally at the National Mall.
Some 150 activist groups had signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests were planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.
Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among those who gathered by the stage beneath the Washington Monument.
She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”
The crowd around the memorial continued to build throughout the day. Some carried Ukrainian flags and others wore Palestinian keffiyeh scarves and carried “Free Palestine” signs, while Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives blasted Trump’s policies on stage.
Wayne Hoffman, 73, a retired money manager from West Cape May, New Jersey, said he was concerned about Trump’s economic policies, including his widespread use of tariffs.
“It’s going to cost the farmers in the red states. It’s going to cost people their jobs – certainly their 401Ks. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars,” Hoffman said.
Kyle, a 20-year-old intern from Ohio, was a lone Trump supporter, sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat and walking the fringe of the Washington, D.C., rally while engaging protesters in debate.
“Most people aren’t too hostile. A few people cuss,” said Kyle, who declined to give his last name.
Trump, who shook financial markets and upset nations around the world with a raft of trade tariffs this week, spent the day in Florida, playing a round of golf at his club in Jupiter before returning to his Mar-a-Lago compound in the afternoon.
Some four miles (6 km) from Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, more than 400 demonstrators gathered on a sunny day in protest. Drivers honked their horns in support of the pastel-and khaki-clad demonstrators as they passed by.
“Markets tank, Trump golfs,” read one sign.
At another protest in Stamford, Connecticut, Sue-ann Friedman, 84, brought a bright pink, handmade sign objecting to the administration’s moves to cut funding for medical research.
“I thought my marching days were over, and then we get somebody like Musk and Trump,” said Friedman.
Paul Kretschmann, a 74-year-old retired attorney in Stamford, said it was the first time he had ever attended a protest.
“My concern is that Social Security is going to be gutted, that we’re going to lose our benefits, and that there’s going to be nobody around to administer it in the first place,” he said. “I’m afraid that this is all part of a larger plan to dismantle the government and for Trump to maintain power.”
DOGE UNDER FIRE
With Trump’s blessing, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has scythed through the U.S. government, eliminating more than 200,000 jobs from the 2.3 million federal workforce. At times, the effort has been haphazard and forced the recall of needed specialists.
On Friday, the Internal Revenue Service began laying off more than 20,000 workers, as much as 25% of its ranks.
Several hundred people gathered outside the headquarters of the Social Security Administration, a top DOGE target, near Baltimore to protest against cuts to the agency which delivers benefits to the elderly and disabled.
Linda Falcao, who turns 65 in two months, told the crowd she had been paying into the Social Security fund since the age of 16.
“I’m terrified, I’m angry, I’m pissed, I’m bewildered this could happen to the United States,” she said. “I do love America and I’m heartbroken. I need my money. I want my money. I want my benefits!” The crowd chanted, “It’s our money!”
White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston disputed the protesters’ charge that Trump aimed to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
“President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors,” Huston said in an email.
Much of Trump’s agenda has been restrained by lawsuits contending he has overstepped his authority with attempts to fire civil servants, deport immigrants and reverse transgender rights.
Trump returned to office on January 20 with a stream of executive orders and other measures critics say are aligned with an agenda outlined by Project 2025, a deeply conservative political initiative to reshape government and consolidate presidential authority. His supporters have applauded Trump’s audacity as necessary to disrupt entrenched liberal interests.
Hours before the protests were due to kick off in the United States, hundreds of anti-Trump Americans living in Europe gathered in Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and London to voice opposition to Trump’s sweeping makeover of U.S. foreign and domestic policies.

Title: PM Modi urges Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles on World Health Day, warns of growing obesity crisis
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 04:33:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of World Health Day on Monday, urged Indians to adopt healthier lifestyles, stressing the need to combat obesity and prioritize personal fitness as crucial steps toward India’s goal of becoming a developed nation.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote “On World Health Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to building a healthier world. Our Government will continue to focus on healthcare and invest in the various aspects of people’s well-being. Good health is the foundation of every thriving society!”.
The Prime Minister shared a video message stressing that “health is the ultimate fortune and the ultimate wealth” and sounded the alarm on India’s rising obesity crisis. He referred to a recent report predicting that by 2050, over 440 million Indians could suffer from obesity, warning that this would pose a significant public health crisis. “This is scary. How big a crisis can this be?” he asked.
In the video, PM Modi called for action, urging citizens to make personal decisions for better health. “Adopting healthier eating habits, such as reducing oil usage, is not just a personal decision, but a social responsibility,” he stated. As part of his appeal, the Prime Minister proposed a simple yet impactful change: “I want to take a promise from you today that we all should reduce our cooking oil by 10 per cent. This will be a big step towards reducing obesity.”
PM Modi also encouraged the population to integrate regular physical activity into their daily routines. “Apart from this, we have to make exercise a part of our life. If we keep ourselves fit, it will be a big contribution to the journey of a Viksit Bharat,” he added.
The Prime Minister has consistently highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. During an episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat, he expressed concern about India’s rising obesity rates, citing alarming data from the World Health Organization (WHO). “One in every eight people in India is affected by obesity,” he revealed, noting that the prevalence of obesity has doubled in recent years, with childhood obesity increasing fourfold.
Obesity, PM Modi warned, can lead to severe health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, he emphasized that small but meaningful lifestyle changes can help combat these issues.
To further raise awareness and promote healthy living, the Prime Minister enlisted ten prominent public figures to join a nationwide campaign against obesity. The personalities involved include Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, industrialist Anand Mahindra, actor-politician Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua), Olympic medalists Manu Bhaker and Mirabai Chanu, actors Mohanlal and R. Madhavan, singer Shreya Ghoshal, philanthropist Sudha Murthy, and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.
PM Modi encouraged each of them to nominate ten more individuals, aiming to amplify the campaign’s reach and societal impact.

Title: SC dismisses plea seeking 100 pc counting of the VVPAT slips
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:17:59 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) that there should be 100 per cent manual counting of the VVPAT slips in addition to electronic counting by the control unit of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM).
A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K.V Viswanathan declined to interfere with the decision of the Delhi High Court which had earlier dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the appellant.
During the course of the hearing, the CJI Khanna-led Bench remarked that it would not be examining the same issues over and over again.
Ultimately, the apex court dismissed the special leave petition filed by the appellant-PIL litigant.
In April 2024, the Supreme Court had dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking mandatory cross-verification of the votes cast in EVMs with VVPAT slips.
A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta said that while it acknowledged the fundamental right of voters to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted, the same cannot be equated with the right to 100 per cent counting of VVPAT slips, or a right to physical access to the VVPAT slips, which the voter should be permitted to put in the drop box.
The appellant had moved a PIL before the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the ECI to use appropriate prototype of VVPAT system in the future, in which the printer is kept open and the printed ballot, which gets cut and falls out of the printer, is subject to verification by the voter, before providing the same to a presiding officer before leaving the polling station.
Declining to entertain the matter, the Delhi HC, in its judgment passed on August 12, last year, had said that the issue raised in the PIL was no longer res integra in view of the judgment delivered by the apex court.

Title: Invest in quality stocks with strong business models amid global uncertainty: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:14:35 +0000
Content: As global economic uncertainties rise due to US trade tariff tensions, inflation risks, and volatile markets, a new report released on Monday recommended investing in quality businesses for long-term gains.
“Investors should focus on companies that have strong business models, clear earnings growth potential, and steady cash flows, especially during times of heightened macroeconomic instability,” according to the report by SBI Funds Management.
The report highlights that global financial markets have been shaken by the return of aggressive US trade policies under Trump 2.0, including steep tariff hikes. India has also been affected, with reciprocal tariffs of up to 27 per cent imposed on various sectors.
The risk of stagflation — a mix of high inflation and slow growth — also looms large, especially if the US economy slows down due to rising prices and reduced consumer sentiment.
Despite these challenges, the report notes some positive shifts in India’s market environment. The correction in equity prices and falling bond yields have brought market valuations closer to historical averages.
Sentiment, too, has returned to more neutral levels, making current market conditions more favourable for long-term investors.
The report adds that India’s central bank, the RBI, has been proactive in managing liquidity. Since December 2024, it has injected over ₹8.9 lakh crore into the system through open market operations and other liquidity tools.
These measures have helped ease market interest rates and improve the overall transmission of monetary policy.
On the global front, the economic outlook remains mixed. While developed markets like Germany, Japan, and the UK have seen rising long-term yields, the US has maintained relatively steady rates.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut policy rates at least four more times, although the impact of ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain.
In India, the rupee has shown signs of recovery after a dip earlier in the fiscal year. Forex dynamics, capital flows, and RBI interventions will continue to play a key role in shaping liquidity and interest rates.
The report expects further easing of policy rates by the RBI in the upcoming review, though the central bank may maintain a neutral stance due to global uncertainties.
For debt investors, the SBI Funds report suggests that short-term bond funds and credit-oriented strategies could offer attractive opportunities, especially in the current low-rate environment.
It also highlights that hybrid investment products might be a safer option for those seeking stability amid equity market volatility.

Title: Govt raises excise duty on petrol, diesel by Rs 2; no hike in retail prices amid global oil price crash
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:03:14 +0000
Content: The central government has announced a hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre each, effective from Tuesday. However, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas clarified that this will not lead to any increase in the retail prices of the two fuels, owing to a sharp decline in global crude oil prices.
In a post on X, the Ministry said, “The PSU Oil Marketing Companies have informed that there will be no increase in retail prices of petrol and diesel, subsequent to the increase effected in Excise Duty Rates today.”
With the hike, the excise duty on petrol now stands at Rs 13 per litre, while that on diesel has increased to Rs 10 per litre.
The government’s move comes as international oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly four years. The benchmark Brent crude has fallen to $63 per barrel—the lowest since April 2021—while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has slipped to $59.57 per barrel.
Officials said the fall in crude prices reduces input costs for oil refining and marketing companies like Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, thereby increasing their retail margins. This allows the government to raise excise duty and generate additional revenue without passing the burden onto consumers.
The Ministry explained that the revenue generated will support the government’s fiscal needs while maintaining price stability for end users.
Oil prices continued to fall on Monday, with Brent futures losing $2.43 (3.7%) to settle at $63.15 per barrel and WTI crude futures declining by 3.9% to $59.57. The decline is attributed to growing trade tensions between the US and China, raising concerns of a potential global recession and reduced crude demand. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ cartel has decided to increase oil supply, adding further pressure on prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has also cut prices for crude sold to Asian buyers in May by up to $2.3 per barrel.
Experts say the slump in crude oil prices bodes well for India, which imports nearly 85% of its oil requirement. A decline in global oil prices typically reduces India’s import bill, narrows the current account deficit, and strengthens the rupee. It also helps ease inflation through lower prices of fuel and cooking gas in the domestic market.
Additionally, the government has continued to reduce the oil import bill by purchasing discounted Russian crude despite Western pressure following the Ukraine conflict. Russia has now become India’s top crude oil supplier, surpassing Iraq and Saudi Arabia. P
Recent data indicates that nearly 38% of India’s total crude oil imports now come from Russia, making India the largest buyer of Russian seaborne oil.

Title: Dubai Crown Prince to begin official visit to India from Tuesday
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:02:03 +0000
Content: Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum will begin a two-day official visit to India on Tuesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.
Sheikh Hamdan, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is visiting at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MEA added.
This will be Sheikh Hamdan’s first official visit to India as the Crown Prince of Dubai. He will be accompanied by a delegation comprising several UAE ministers, senior officials, and a high-level business contingent.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to host a working lunch for the Crown Prince on Tuesday. During his visit to New Delhi, Sheikh Hamdan will also hold meetings with External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Following his engagements in the capital, the Crown Prince will travel to Mumbai, where he will participate in a business roundtable with key Indian and Emirati business leaders. The interaction aims to deepen economic and commercial ties between the two nations, with a focus on both traditional and emerging sectors.
“Dubai has historically played a pivotal role in facilitating India’s commercial, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges with the UAE. A significant portion of the Indian diaspora—estimated at around 4.3 million—resides and works in Dubai. The visit of His Highness the Crown Prince will further reinforce the India–UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and bolster our multifaceted ties with Dubai,” the MEA said in a statement.
The invitation for this visit was extended by EAM Jaishankar during his official trip to the UAE from January 27–29 this year. Following his meeting with the Crown Prince, Jaishankar posted on X:
“Delighted to meet Crown Prince of Dubai and DPM and Minister of Defence of UAE HH Hamdan Mohammed. A warm conversation on our deep bonds of friendship and taking them forward for the good of our people.”
The Crown Prince’s visit is expected to further cement the growing partnership between India and the UAE, particularly in trade, investment, and strategic collaboration.

Title: Kremlin says Russia is ready to do all it can to help resolve US-Iran nuclear tensions
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:56:44 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia was ready to do all it could to help resolve tensions between the United States and Iran around Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Washington demands Tehran do a nuclear deal with it or be bombed.
Moscow has repeatedly offered to mediate between the two sides after warnings of military action against Iran by U.S. President Donald Trump have rattled nerves across the region.
“We are in constant consultations with our Iranian partners, including on the topic of the nuclear deal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
“This process will continue, including in the near future. And, of course, Russia is ready to make every effort, to do everything possible to contribute to this problem’s resolution by political and diplomatic means.”
During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran says it needs nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and denies it is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.
Tehran has pushed back against Trump’s demands for direct talks, with a senior Iranian official issuing a warning over the weekend to neighbours that host U.S. bases that they could be in the firing line.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last week that Trump’s comments about bombing Iran only served to “complicate the situation” and cautioned that strikes could be “catastrophic” for the wider region.
Russia has for the most part refrained from such sharp criticism of Trump.
President Vladimir Putin has moved quickly since Trump took office to repair relations with the U.S. in a rapprochement viewed with concern by Ukraine and its European allies.
Moscow has also deepened ties with Tehran since the start of the full-scale conflict in Ukraine with the two signing a strategic partnership treaty in January.

Title: Indian markets follow global sell-off amid tariff jitters, Nifty closes above 22,100
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:46:19 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets went through a major sell-off on Monday amid global crash, with domestic benchmark indices falling sharply – registering their biggest one-day fall since June 4 last year when the Lok Sabha election results were announced.
However, a slight recovery in the final trading window helped the Nifty climb back above the 22,100 mark, easing some of the day’s earlier losses.
The Sensex tumbled 2,226.79 points, or 2.95 per cent, to close at 73,137.90. During the session, it swung between an intra-day high of 73,284.24 and a low of 71,425.01. Investors lost over Rs 13.5 lakh crore at the closing.
The Nifty followed a similar path, falling 742.85 points or 3.24 per cent to settle at 22,161.60. Tata Steel fell the most by dropping over 7 per cent on both the exchanges.
This sharp decline followed the biggest drop in Asian markets in 14 years, triggered by a slump in Wall Street.
The domestic market sentiment turned negative after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs, which were met with retaliatory measures from China.
This standoff between two major global economies has raised fears of a full-blown trade war, which could push the world into recession.
“The market tumbled as the carnage over high US tariffs and the retaliation by other countries may kickstart a trade war,” said Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments Limited.
He added that though the overall impact on India may be limited when compared with other countries, investors are advised to play cautiously during this fray.
“Focus will be on pure-play domestic themes, where the rebound is likely to be fair when the dust settles,” Nair stated.
The broader market also faced heavy selling pressure. Both the Nifty Midcap100 and Smallcap100 indices ended over 3 per cent lower.
Sector-wise, metal and realty stocks were the worst hit. The Nifty Metal index fell 6.75 per cent, while the Nifty Realty index dropped 5.69 per cent.
Other sectors like IT, banking, auto, and financial services also posted losses of up to 4 per cent. Even a better-than-expected US job report, which typically boosts global sentiment, failed to calm the nerves of investors as trade concerns took centre stage.
According to Sundar Kewat of Ashika Institutional Equity, the downturn was primarily driven by escalating global uncertainties.
“Weak cues from Wall Street — where markets closed lower last Friday — spilled over into global markets, including India,” Kewat said.
“Investor sentiment took a hit amid growing recession fears, exacerbated by heightened global trade tensions,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee slightly weakened against the US dollar, closing 61 paise lower at 85.84, compared to Friday’s close of 85.23.
“Rupee is expected to trade in a wide range of 85.25–86.25, with elevated volatility anticipated in the near term,” Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities said.
Gold traded in a volatile range between Rs 87,900 and Rs 88,500 as markets digested the broader impact of the ongoing China-US tariff war.
Sentiment remained cautious with investors looking for further clarity from the US on its next course of action, especially amid escalating trade tensions.
The upcoming US CPI data is expected to play a crucial role in shaping rate cut expectations, which could influence gold’s direction globally. Domestically, the RBI policy meet later this week will be closely watched, as rupee volatility is likely to add another layer of uncertainty for MCX Gold, said Trivedi.

Title: Mumbai Indians coach Charlotte Edwards steps down, takes charge of England women
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:37:32 +0000
Content: Mumbai Indians have officially parted ways with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who led the team to two Women’s Premier League (WPL) titles and will now take over as the head coach of the England women’s team.
Reflecting on her exit, a Mumbai Indians spokesperson said:
“Charlotte Edwards has been a leader for whom the entire #OneFamily has enormous admiration, appreciation, and respect. The incredible achievements she has driven the team toward include winning two titles in three years, inspiring the players to bring out their best, and furthering the MI legacy. We are grateful for everything she brought to the team and wish her all the very best for her new journey.”
A former England captain, Edwards represented her country in over 300 matches, winning two World Cups and five Ashes series during a distinguished 20-year career. With 10,273 runs across 309 international appearances, including 13 centuries, she remains one of the most decorated batters in women’s cricket history.
Following England’s underwhelming ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 campaign and a 16-0 Ashes whitewash by Australia, Edwards was appointed to succeed Jon Lewis as head coach. Since retiring from international cricket in 2017, she has found success as a coach in various leagues around the world, including stints with the Southern Vipers in England’s domestic circuit, Southern Brave in The Hundred, Sydney Sixers in the Women’s Big Bash League, and Mumbai Indians in the WPL.
As Edwards embarks on this new chapter, the Mumbai Indians extended their best wishes:
“Mumbai Indians wish Charlotte Edwards all the very best in her new role with the England Women’s team. The #OneFamily will always cheer for one of the greats of the game.”

Title: Watch for global retaliation to Trump tariffs, say experts, as markets slide
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:09:18 +0000
Content: Investors should closely monitor potential retaliatory measures from the European Union and other nations in response to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, experts warned on Monday. The caution came as Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp decline, triggered by a broader global sell-off fueled by escalating trade tensions.
Economist Pankaj Jaiswal told IANS, “The world is in reset mode for the first time since World War II, due to which stock markets globally, including India, have fallen drastically.”
“There is a risk of recession and inflation across the globe due to the trade war, and the US will be the most affected by this,” he added.
Market expert Sunil Shah, speaking to IANS, said that about a 4 per cent decline in the Indian stock market was triggered by the 34 per cent tariff imposed by China in retaliation to the US tariffs.
Shah stated, “Investors know that no country is going to benefit from the US tariffs, and this is the core reason why the world’s major markets crashed today.”
Selling pressure was seen across most Asian markets. Tokyo, Shanghai, Bangkok, Seoul, and Hang Seng indices fell by up to 11 per cent.
US markets also witnessed a massive sell-off on Friday due to reciprocal tariffs. The Dow closed down by 5.50 per cent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped nearly 5.82 per cent.
Meanwhile, Indian stock markets extended their losses for a third straight session on Monday, following a global sell-off fueled by escalating trade war fears.
The decline is attributed to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, which have significantly heightened the risk of a global trade war.
Oil prices have also plunged amid global uncertainties, especially after Saudi Arabia issued its biggest price cut on the commodity in years. Brent crude slipped 2.67 per cent to $63.82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate fell 2.69 per cent to $60.31.

Title: Delhi braces for heatwave; red alert issued for Gujarat and West Rajasthan: IMD
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:01:24 +0000
Content: The national capital is likely to face heatwave conditions over the next three days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. 
The agency also issued a red alert for Gujarat and West Rajasthan, where heatwave to severe heatwave conditions are expected to persist.
IMD Scientist Dr Naresh Kumar said, “Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions currently prevail in Gujarat, for which we have issued a red alert. A red alert has also been issued for West Rajasthan for the coming two days.”
Dr Kumar added that heatwave conditions are likely in Punjab over the next three days and could extend to Haryana within four days. “Delhi can see heatwave conditions in the next three days,” he said.
He further noted that a Western Disturbance is expected to affect the Western Himalayan region starting April 8, which may bring some relief in the form of falling temperatures. “A western disturbance will influence the Himalayan region from tomorrow night, and its effects will be seen in the Himalayas. Temperatures in the Himalayas will start to fall after tomorrow night and after three days in Punjab and Haryana,” he said.
The IMD also reported that the weather in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) has remained mostly unchanged over the past 24 hours. Minimum temperatures have shown no major variation, while maximum temperatures have risen slightly.
According to the IMD, maximum temperatures across most parts of Delhi have ranged between 38°C and 39°C, while minimum temperatures have stayed between 19°C and 23°C. Maximum temperatures were above normal by 2-4°C in several areas.
The sky remained mostly clear on Monday, with west-north westerly winds reaching speeds of up to 18 km/h. These conditions have contributed to the heatwave, affecting daily life across the region.
The IMD continues to monitor the situation and has advised residents, especially in regions under red alert, to take necessary precautions.

Title: India, US work on ‘early conclusion’ of trade pact
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:43:22 +0000
Content: India and the United States on Monday reaffirmed their commitment to an “early conclusion” of a bilateral trade agreement, amid ongoing global trade tensions following new tariff announcements by the US.
Talks between the two countries have gained momentum in recent weeks, particularly after US President Donald Trump announced a reciprocal tariff of 26 percent on goods imported from India. This move is part of a broader tariff framework covering nearly all of the United States’ trading partners.
“Exchanged perspectives on the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Subcontinent, Europe, Middle East/West Asia and the Caribbean,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in a post on X following a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“Agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement,” Jaishankar added, noting that both sides would remain in close contact.
This phone call marks the first publicly known interaction between cabinet officials of the two countries since Trump’s announcement last Wednesday.
A readout of the call from the US side is awaited.
India has so far refrained from announcing retaliatory tariffs, in contrast to China, which imposed a 34 percent duty on American goods on Friday in response to the US move. Most other US trading partners, including Vietnam and Japan, have opted for dialogue over retaliation. Vietnam, for instance, has offered to reduce its tariffs to zero in an effort to maintain trade relations.
On Monday, President Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform:
“Countries from all over the world are talking to us. Tough but fair parameters are being set. Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the US very poorly on trade. They don’t take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. Likewise agriculture, and many other things. It all has to change, but especially with China!!!”
Later in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet Trump. The meeting is being described as the first in-person engagement between a foreign leader and the US President focused on the newly imposed tariffs. Israel has been hit with a 17 percent tariff, despite its close military ties with the US.

Title: Indian constitution upholds equality and social justice for all, says Om Birla at 150th IPU assembly
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:23:35 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday addressed the 150th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, emphasising the inclusive and welfare-oriented nature of the Indian Constitution. In his keynote address on “Parliamentary Action for Social Development and Justice,” Birla said that the spirit of the Constitution lies in treating all citizens equally, offering equal opportunities, and integrating marginalised and backward communities into the mainstream of development.
Highlighting India’s legislative approach, Birla stated that the Indian Parliament has in recent years passed several laws aimed at strengthening social justice and security. These include the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, 2023. He also referred to the new labour laws and codes passed to protect workers in the unorganised sector.
Birla said that replacing the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita has reinforced the principle of justice within India’s legal system.
He underlined the importance of parliamentary committees in supporting development and social justice goals, referring to them as “mini-parliaments” that complement the work of the legislature and the executive. Committees on Social Justice and Empowerment, Women Empowerment, and Labour and Skill Development, among others, monitor welfare programmes to ensure their effective implementation.
Birla also spoke about India’s efforts to improve human development indicators. He cited Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the world’s largest health insurance programme, which provides free health coverage to the bottom 40 percent of India’s population.
Referring to India’s economic growth, Birla said the country has witnessed 105 percent GDP growth over the past decade. He credited this to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said India is on track to becoming a developed nation by 2047. Currently the world’s fifth-largest economy, India is expected to become the third-largest soon, Birla added. He also said India is playing a leading role globally in sectors such as innovation, artificial intelligence, startups, space and defence technology, IT, fintech, and pharmaceuticals.
On the role of the IPU, Birla said the forum continues to strengthen global parliamentary cooperation. He welcomed the theme of the 150th Assembly, stating that it aligns with the Indian philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—the world is one family.
On the sidelines of the summit, Birla met Tran Thanh Man, President of the National Assembly of Vietnam. Birla recalled his visit to Vietnam in April 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations. He underscored the historical and cultural ties between India and Vietnam, which he said have deepened through high-level dialogues.
Both leaders discussed cooperation in areas such as defence, technology, infrastructure, and nuclear energy. Birla noted that parliamentary institutions in both countries are key to ensuring public welfare and leveraging emerging technologies for better governance. He also highlighted India’s “Digital Parliament” initiative, which he said has improved efficiency, transparency, and productivity in legislative processes.
He added that a significant number of Vietnamese students are availing themselves of educational and training scholarships in India.
Tran Thanh Man extended greetings on the occasion of Ram Navami and acknowledged the cultural ties between the two nations. He called for stronger collaboration in defence and technology and invited Birla to visit Vietnam. The formation of a parliamentary friendship group between India and Vietnam was also discussed.

Content: Harry Brook has officially been named England’s new white-ball captain, taking charge of both the T20I and ODI sides. The appointment comes in the wake of Jos Buttler stepping down following England’s early exit from the ICC Champions Trophy in March.
At 26, Brook has already served as vice-captain in the white-ball setup for the past year and previously led the team during a five-match ODI series against Australia last September in Buttler’s absence. His first official assignment as full-time captain will be a home series against the West Indies, featuring three T20Is and three ODIs, scheduled for late May.
“It’s a real honour to be named England’s white-ball captain,” Brook said. “Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me.”

Title: LPG price hiked by Rs 50 per cylinder from April 8
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:15:55 +0000
Content: The Centre has announced a hike in the price of domestic LPG cylinders by Rs 50, effective from April 8. The revised rates apply to both subsidised and non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinders, including beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY).
Announcing the revision, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the price for PMUY consumers will increase from Rs 500 to Rs 550 per cylinder, while other domestic consumers will see a rise from Rs 803 to Rs 853.
Puri added that LPG prices undergo periodic reviews every two to three weeks, based on global market trends.
The hike comes just a week after a reduction in commercial LPG rates. On April 1, oil marketing companies slashed the price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder by Rs 41. In Delhi, the revised rate for commercial cylinders now stands at Rs 1,762.
India imports around 60% of the LPG it consumes, making domestic prices sensitive to international fluctuations. The average global price of LPG surged by 63%, from US$ 385 per metric tonne in July 2023 to US$ 629 per metric tonne in February 2025.
Despite rising global prices, the effective cost for PMUY beneficiaries was brought down significantly last year. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Suresh Gopi informed the Lok Sabha that the average price for PMUY users dropped by 44%, from Rs 903 in August 2023 to Rs 503 in February 2025, due to subsidies.
As per government data presented in Parliament, the number of PMUY beneficiaries has increased to 10.33 crore as of March 1, 2025. The total number of active domestic LPG consumers in the country stands at 32.94 crore.
This is the first price hike for domestic LPG cylinders since August 2024, when the last revision was implemented.

Content: The Supreme Court of India on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Supreme Court of Nepal to enhance judicial cooperation between the two countries.
According to an official statement, the MoU aims to encourage mutual exchange of information on developments in the field of law and justice, and to promote interaction among judges and judicial officers through exchange visits, training programmes, and academic initiatives.
The agreement reflects the longstanding cordial ties between India and Nepal and seeks to strengthen cooperation between their respective judiciaries.
The MoU also highlights the role of technology in reducing case backlogs, speeding up judicial processes, and improving services for stakeholders. Both sides have agreed to share information on technologies used in their courts and related institutions.
A Joint Working Group, comprising officials from both judiciaries, will be established to develop and implement plans to advance the objectives outlined in the MoU.
The agreement was signed in the presence of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Chief Justice of Nepal Prakash Man Singh Raut.
In recent years, India has signed similar judicial cooperation MoUs with several countries, including Israel, Singapore, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. In September 2023, then Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud signed an MoU with the Supreme Court of Singapore during an official visit.

Title: PM MUDRA Yojana completes 10 years; over ₹32.6 lakh crore loans sanctioned since 2015
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:33:32 +0000
Content: India on Tuesday completes a decade since the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), the flagship credit support initiative aimed at providing institutional finance to non-corporate, non-farm micro and small enterprises.
Since its launch on April 8, 2015, the scheme has sanctioned more than 52 crore loans worth ₹32.61 lakh crore, according to official data. The average loan size has grown from ₹38,000 in FY16 to ₹1.02 lakh in FY25, reflecting increased demand for higher-value loans among small enterprises.
MSME Credit Expansion
The scheme has contributed to a major rise in credit flow to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). According to a report by the State Bank of India, MSME lending rose from ₹8.51 lakh crore in FY14 to ₹27.25 lakh crore in FY24, and is projected to cross ₹30 lakh crore in FY25. The share of MSME credit in total bank credit has increased from 15.8% in FY14 to nearly 20% in FY24.
Women Account for 68% of Beneficiaries
Women make up 68% of total Mudra loan recipients. Between FY16 and FY25, the average loan per woman rose at a 13% CAGR, reaching ₹62,679, while incremental deposits by women grew at a 14% CAGR to ₹95,269. States with a higher proportion of loans to women have seen higher employment generation among women-led MSMEs, according to government data.
Focus on Social Inclusion
The SBI report notes that 50% of Mudra accounts are held by SC, ST, and OBC entrepreneurs, while 11% are held by members of minority communities. This indicates expanded access to formal finance for traditionally underserved groups.
Loan Categories and Growth
The distribution of loan categories also indicates an upward trend in business scale. Kishor loans, covering credit between ₹50,000 and ₹5 lakh, grew from 5.9 percent of the total disbursal in FY16 to 44.7 percent in FY25. Loans in the Tarun category (₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh) are also seeing increased demand. A new category, Tarun Plus, was added to support enterprises seeking credit between ₹10 lakh and ₹20 lakh.
The average loan ticket size has tripled, from ₹38,000 in FY16 to ₹1.02 lakh in FY25. Loan disbursal under the scheme rose by 36 percent in FY23.
State-wise Disbursal
Tamil Nadu leads in total disbursal among states with ₹3.23 lakh crore, followed by Uttar Pradesh (₹3.14 lakh crore), Karnataka (₹3.02 lakh crore), West Bengal (₹2.82 lakh crore), and Bihar (₹2.81 lakh crore). Maharashtra reported ₹2.74 lakh crore in disbursals. Among Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir topped the list with ₹45,815.92 crore sanctioned across over 21 lakh loan accounts.
Sector Coverage and Employment
The scheme caters to micro units engaged in manufacturing, trading, processing, and services. These enterprises—many of which operate as sole proprietorships or own-account enterprises—employ nearly 10 crore people, making them the second-largest source of employment after agriculture.
Global Acknowledgement
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has consistently recognised the scheme’s role in expanding financial access. In its 2024 report, the IMF reaffirmed that schemes like PMMY have supported the growth of self-employment and formalisation of the economy through improved access to credit. Earlier assessments in 2017, 2019, and 2023 noted the programme’s contribution to promoting women-led businesses and enhancing financial inclusion.
Lending Institutions
The scheme is implemented through Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks, NBFCs, and Microfinance Institutions, offering collateral-free loans of up to ₹20 lakh. It operates under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA).

Title: SC dismisses plea seeking 100 pc counting of the VVPAT slips
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:17:59 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) that there should be 100 per cent manual counting of the VVPAT slips in addition to electronic counting by the control unit of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM).
A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K.V Viswanathan declined to interfere with the decision of the Delhi High Court which had earlier dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the appellant.
During the course of the hearing, the CJI Khanna-led Bench remarked that it would not be examining the same issues over and over again.
Ultimately, the apex court dismissed the special leave petition filed by the appellant-PIL litigant.
In April 2024, the Supreme Court had dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking mandatory cross-verification of the votes cast in EVMs with VVPAT slips.
A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta said that while it acknowledged the fundamental right of voters to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted, the same cannot be equated with the right to 100 per cent counting of VVPAT slips, or a right to physical access to the VVPAT slips, which the voter should be permitted to put in the drop box.
The appellant had moved a PIL before the Delhi High Court seeking directions to the ECI to use appropriate prototype of VVPAT system in the future, in which the printer is kept open and the printed ballot, which gets cut and falls out of the printer, is subject to verification by the voter, before providing the same to a presiding officer before leaving the polling station.
Declining to entertain the matter, the Delhi HC, in its judgment passed on August 12, last year, had said that the issue raised in the PIL was no longer res integra in view of the judgment delivered by the apex court.

Title: Invest in quality stocks with strong business models amid global uncertainty: SBI report
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:14:35 +0000
Content: As global economic uncertainties rise due to US trade tariff tensions, inflation risks, and volatile markets, a new report released on Monday recommended investing in quality businesses for long-term gains.
“Investors should focus on companies that have strong business models, clear earnings growth potential, and steady cash flows, especially during times of heightened macroeconomic instability,” according to the report by SBI Funds Management.
The report highlights that global financial markets have been shaken by the return of aggressive US trade policies under Trump 2.0, including steep tariff hikes. India has also been affected, with reciprocal tariffs of up to 27 per cent imposed on various sectors.
The risk of stagflation — a mix of high inflation and slow growth — also looms large, especially if the US economy slows down due to rising prices and reduced consumer sentiment.
Despite these challenges, the report notes some positive shifts in India’s market environment. The correction in equity prices and falling bond yields have brought market valuations closer to historical averages.
Sentiment, too, has returned to more neutral levels, making current market conditions more favourable for long-term investors.
The report adds that India’s central bank, the RBI, has been proactive in managing liquidity. Since December 2024, it has injected over ₹8.9 lakh crore into the system through open market operations and other liquidity tools.
These measures have helped ease market interest rates and improve the overall transmission of monetary policy.
On the global front, the economic outlook remains mixed. While developed markets like Germany, Japan, and the UK have seen rising long-term yields, the US has maintained relatively steady rates.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut policy rates at least four more times, although the impact of ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain.
In India, the rupee has shown signs of recovery after a dip earlier in the fiscal year. Forex dynamics, capital flows, and RBI interventions will continue to play a key role in shaping liquidity and interest rates.
The report expects further easing of policy rates by the RBI in the upcoming review, though the central bank may maintain a neutral stance due to global uncertainties.
For debt investors, the SBI Funds report suggests that short-term bond funds and credit-oriented strategies could offer attractive opportunities, especially in the current low-rate environment.
It also highlights that hybrid investment products might be a safer option for those seeking stability amid equity market volatility.

Title: Govt raises excise duty on petrol, diesel by Rs 2; no hike in retail prices amid global oil price crash
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:03:14 +0000
Content: The central government has announced a hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre each, effective from Tuesday. However, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas clarified that this will not lead to any increase in the retail prices of the two fuels, owing to a sharp decline in global crude oil prices.
In a post on X, the Ministry said, “The PSU Oil Marketing Companies have informed that there will be no increase in retail prices of petrol and diesel, subsequent to the increase effected in Excise Duty Rates today.”
With the hike, the excise duty on petrol now stands at Rs 13 per litre, while that on diesel has increased to Rs 10 per litre.
The government’s move comes as international oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly four years. The benchmark Brent crude has fallen to $63 per barrel—the lowest since April 2021—while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has slipped to $59.57 per barrel.
Officials said the fall in crude prices reduces input costs for oil refining and marketing companies like Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, thereby increasing their retail margins. This allows the government to raise excise duty and generate additional revenue without passing the burden onto consumers.
The Ministry explained that the revenue generated will support the government’s fiscal needs while maintaining price stability for end users.
Oil prices continued to fall on Monday, with Brent futures losing $2.43 (3.7%) to settle at $63.15 per barrel and WTI crude futures declining by 3.9% to $59.57. The decline is attributed to growing trade tensions between the US and China, raising concerns of a potential global recession and reduced crude demand. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ cartel has decided to increase oil supply, adding further pressure on prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has also cut prices for crude sold to Asian buyers in May by up to $2.3 per barrel.
Experts say the slump in crude oil prices bodes well for India, which imports nearly 85% of its oil requirement. A decline in global oil prices typically reduces India’s import bill, narrows the current account deficit, and strengthens the rupee. It also helps ease inflation through lower prices of fuel and cooking gas in the domestic market.
Additionally, the government has continued to reduce the oil import bill by purchasing discounted Russian crude despite Western pressure following the Ukraine conflict. Russia has now become India’s top crude oil supplier, surpassing Iraq and Saudi Arabia. P
Recent data indicates that nearly 38% of India’s total crude oil imports now come from Russia, making India the largest buyer of Russian seaborne oil.

Title: Dubai Crown Prince to begin official visit to India from Tuesday
Publication Date: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:02:03 +0000
Content: Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum will begin a two-day official visit to India on Tuesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.
Sheikh Hamdan, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is visiting at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MEA added.
This will be Sheikh Hamdan’s first official visit to India as the Crown Prince of Dubai. He will be accompanied by a delegation comprising several UAE ministers, senior officials, and a high-level business contingent.
Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to host a working lunch for the Crown Prince on Tuesday. During his visit to New Delhi, Sheikh Hamdan will also hold meetings with External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Following his engagements in the capital, the Crown Prince will travel to Mumbai, where he will participate in a business roundtable with key Indian and Emirati business leaders. The interaction aims to deepen economic and commercial ties between the two nations, with a focus on both traditional and emerging sectors.
“Dubai has historically played a pivotal role in facilitating India’s commercial, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges with the UAE. A significant portion of the Indian diaspora—estimated at around 4.3 million—resides and works in Dubai. The visit of His Highness the Crown Prince will further reinforce the India–UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and bolster our multifaceted ties with Dubai,” the MEA said in a statement.
The invitation for this visit was extended by EAM Jaishankar during his official trip to the UAE from January 27–29 this year. Following his meeting with the Crown Prince, Jaishankar posted on X:
“Delighted to meet Crown Prince of Dubai and DPM and Minister of Defence of UAE HH Hamdan Mohammed. A warm conversation on our deep bonds of friendship and taking them forward for the good of our people.”
The Crown Prince’s visit is expected to further cement the growing partnership between India and the UAE, particularly in trade, investment, and strategic collaboration.

Title: Europe just had warmest March on record
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 07:29:59 +0000
Content: Europe experienced its warmest March since records began, as climate change continues to push temperatures to unprecedented levels, European Union scientists said on Tuesday.
Globally, last month was the planet’s second-warmest March on record – exceeded only by March in 2024, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.
March continued a run of extraordinary heat, in which 20 of the last 21 months saw an average global temperature of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (35 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Last year was the planet’s hottest on record.
The global average temperature in March was 1.6 degrees Celsius higher than in pre-industrial times.
The main driver of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, according to the scientific consensus among climate scientists.
Samantha Burgess, strategic lead at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the C3S service, noted that Europe also experienced extremes in both heavy rain and drought.
Europe last month recorded “many areas experiencing their driest March on record and others their wettest March on record for at least the past 47 years,” Burgess said.
Climate change is making some regions drier, and fuelling the heatwaves that can make droughts more severe, by enhancing evaporation rates, drying out soil and vegetation.
But the warming of the planet also exacerbates the heavy rainfall that can cause flooding. That’s because warmer air holds more moisture, so storm clouds are “heavier” before they eventually break.
Arctic sea ice fell to its lowest monthly extent last month for any March in the 47-year record of satellite data, C3S said. The previous three months had all also set a record low for the respective month.
C3S’ temperature records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.

Title: Astronomers spot two white dwarfs doomed to die in a quadruple detonation
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 07:18:48 +0000
Content: Astronomers have spotted two hefty white dwarf stars – highly compact stellar embers – orbiting close together that appear destined to die in an extraordinarily violent quadruple detonation.
The two stars, gravitationally bound to each other in what is called a binary system, are located in our Milky Way galaxy about 160 light-years from Earth – relatively close in cosmic terms. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
White dwarfs are among the most compact celestial objects. Stars with up to eight times the mass of our sun appear destined to end up this way. They eventually burn up all the hydrogen they use as fuel. Gravity then causes them to collapse and blow off their outer layers in a “red giant” stage, eventually leaving behind a compact core roughly the diameter of Earth – the white dwarf.
“White dwarfs are the stellar remnants of the vast majority of stars, and from time to time we find systems where two white dwarfs closely orbit each other,” said James Munday, a PhD researcher at the University of Warwick in England and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
The researchers used data from four ground-based telescopes to study this binary system. One of the white dwarfs has a mass about 83% that of our sun and the other about 72%. No other known white dwarf binary has a larger combined mass, Munday said.
“They are both about as big as the Earth. One has a diameter about 20% larger and the other about 50% larger. That gives you an idea of how dense they are. It’s the sun compressed onto the size of Earth. Their masses when they were regular stars were probably around three to four times the mass of the sun,” said University of Warwick astrophysicist and study co-author Ingrid Pelisoli.
A few hundred binary systems composed of two white dwarf stars are known. These two orbit closest to each other of any of them. They are about 25 times closer to each other than our solar system’s innermost planet Mercury is to the sun, completing an orbit every roughly 14 hours.
With the gap between them very gradually narrowing as the binary system loses energy, the fact that they are so massive and so close ensures their demise over a large timescale.
When they get closer to each other, the heavier of the two white dwarfs, because of its greater gravitational strength, will begin to draw material from the lighter one’s outer layer and increase in mass past the threshold beyond which a white dwarf experiences a thermonuclear explosion.
This will set the stage for a complex explosion called a type 1a supernova, in this instance involving a quadruple detonation.
“White dwarfs are made up of layers, much like an onion. Their inner layer is a core of carbon and oxygen, surrounded by a helium layer and finally by a hydrogen layer,” Pelisoli said.
“The less-massive star will transfer mass to the massive one when they start interacting. This will lead the helium layer (of the heavier one) to become too massive, triggering an explosion. This then triggers a second explosion in the carbon-oxygen core. The shock wave from these explosions in turn triggers a third explosion in the remaining helium layer of the companion, which triggers a fourth explosion in its carbon-oxygen core,” Pelisoli added.
This quadruple detonation is expected to take about four seconds, start to finish. But it will not come anytime soon.
The researchers calculate that it will occur approximately 22.6 billion years from now. The universe is about 13.8 billion years old. When the explosion occurs, it would appear from the perspective of Earth about 10 times brighter than the moon in the night sky – if Earth, now about 4.5 billion years old, still exists.
This is the first time a binary system apparently headed for such a fate has been identified. If the two white dwarfs were far enough apart that the heavier one would not siphon material from the lighter one, they could survive in perpetual peace.
“In a wider orbit, they could indeed live stably without any catastrophic future, but here we know that the explosion will light up our side of the galaxy,” Munday said.

Title: IPL 2025: Bowlers won it for us, says Patidar after RCB beat MI by 12 runs
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 07:14:37 +0000
Content: Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar praised the lionhearted effort by his bowlers on a dew-plagued wicket for their 12-run win over the Mumbai Indians that ended their 10-year win-drought at the Wankhede Stadium in the Indian Premier League on Monday
Krunal Pandya claimed 4-45, including three wickets in the final over as RCB quelled a brilliant fight back by MI, fuelled by a blazing half-century by Tilak Varma (56) and a 15-ball 42 by Hardik Pandya, who had brought Mumbai from needing 132 off 56 balls to 41 off 18. Though both Varma and Hardik were out in quick succession, Mumbai Indians needed 28 off 12 balls but fell short by 12 runs. Mumbai Indians ended with 209/9 while chasing RCB’s 221/5 built on quickfire half-centuries by Virat Kohli (67) and skipper Patidar (64).
Though Patidar was declared the Player of the Match for his astute handling of the bowling in a tense situation, he said the bowlers were the heroes, and one of them should have got the award.
“It was a really amazing match. It was very hard. The way the bowlers have shown their courage was amazing to watch. This award goes to the bowling unit. It is not easy to stop any team, especially at this ground, and the way they have done it was incredible. The way the fast bowlers executed their plans was amazing,” said Patidar after the match.
He showered special praise on Krunal Pandya for the final over he bowled on Monday.
“The way KP (Krunal Pandya) bowled that last over, it was not easy and the way he bowled was amazing. The way he showed courage was fantastic. It was pretty clear (at the second time-out) that we had to take the game as much deep as we could, and then we could use one over of KP at the last. The wicket was really amazing to bat on. Typical Mumbai wicket, and the ball was coming nicely onto the bat with bounce,” said Patidar.
The Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain said he decided to go berserk in the hunt for quick runs after Hardik Pandya completed his fourth over. Pandya was the best bowler for MI on Monday as he claimed 2-45.
RCB’s left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya said it was difficult bowling against his brother Hardik, but said both wanted to win the match, and on Monday, only one Pandya could have won it.
“The bond that we have, at the end of the day, we knew only one (Pandya) would win. But the love and affection we have for each other is very natural. He batted well. We won, and I also wanted to win; he also wanted to win.
“I feel for him. When I came on to bowl, when Santner was batting, the leg-side was shorter. The amount of games I have played in the last ten years, whatever experience I had, it had to come in, right?
“Sometimes, you want to commit, but you know it is important to commit 100%, so the execution becomes much on your side. I was clear in a way where I wanted to commit fully to whatever ball I wanted to bowl,” said Krunal.
Hardik said his team put up a big fight but fell short by two hits. “We fell short with two hits, don’t know what to say. The way the wicket was, the bowlers did not really have much space to hide. It came down to execution. You can stop the batters, but I don’t want to be harsh on the bowlers. It was a tough track, not many options. 5-10, maybe 12 runs I can say (we conceded more),” said Hardik.

Title: PM Modi marks 10 years of Mudra Yojana, highlights empowerment of entrepreneurs across India
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 06:59:02 +0000
Content: In a special interaction to mark the 10th anniversary of the Mudra Yojana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday engaged with several beneficiaries from across India. The event, held at PM Modi’s residence, provided a platform for these beneficiaries to share their success stories, underscoring the transformative impact of Mudra loans on their lives and businesses.
PM Modi extended his heartfelt gratitude to the attendees and invited them to share their success stories. He noted that Mudra Yojana is not limited to any specific group but aims to empower the youth and provide them with the resources needed to stand on their own feet. “This scheme is a silent revolution that has shifted societal attitudes about entrepreneurship,” he said, emphasizing the role of the youth, particularly women, in driving this transformation.
During the interaction, PM Modi engaged with a diverse group of beneficiaries who have used the Mudra loans to fuel their entrepreneurial ambitions. One such beneficiary, Rana Das from Nagaland, shared how his pet supplies and services business, K9 World, flourished thanks to the financial support from the Mudra Yojana. PM Modi encouraged him to showcase his progress to the banks that provided the loan, highlighting how success stories like his inspire further trust and confidence in the system.
Another beneficiary, Gopi Krishna from Kerala, shared his journey of becoming a successful entrepreneur in the renewable energy sector. He recounted his decision to leave his job in Dubai after learning about the Mudra Loan and noted that the solar installations under the PM Surya Ghar initiative had not only transformed his business but also helped local households reduce their electricity bills significantly.
The Prime Minister also interacted with young entrepreneurs, including a female business owner from Raipur, who shared her experience of turning her home cooking venture into a thriving café business. She praised the Mudra Yojana for offering collateral-free loans, which many youth are unaware of, and encouraged others to take bold steps toward entrepreneurship.
PM Modi emphasized that the Mudra Yojana has had a profound impact on women, who make up a significant proportion of the scheme’s beneficiaries. He noted that women are not only applying for loans but are also leading the way in repayments. The scheme, he said, has provided them with opportunities to build their own businesses, furthering economic self-reliance.
One of the most inspiring stories came from Mudassir Naqshbandi, owner of Bake My Cake in Baramulla, Kashmir, who transitioned from job seeker to job creator with the help of a Mudra loan. With 42 employees working in his business, Mudassir shared how the scheme had allowed him to scale his operations and improve his community’s economic stability.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the success of a woman entrepreneur from Andhra Pradesh who, with a ₹2 lakh Mudra loan, started a business producing jute bags and trained rural women in her community. Her success, PM Modi noted, reflects the transformative power of the Mudra Yojana in fostering self-reliance and entrepreneurship among marginalized groups.
In his address, PM Modi praised the significant growth of the Mudra Yojana, which has sanctioned loans worth ₹32.61 lakh crore to over 52 crore beneficiaries. “This is a monumental achievement that is unparalleled globally,” he said. He further emphasized that the expansion of the loan limit from ₹5 lakh to ₹20 lakh reflects the government’s trust in the entrepreneurial spirit of India’s citizens.
The Prime Minister urged all beneficiaries to spread awareness about the Mudra Yojana in their communities, encouraging others to leverage the scheme to start their own ventures. “Small steps can lead to great changes,” he remarked, sharing a motivational story of a tribal group in Gujarat who, with the help of a small loan, transitioned from performing traditional music to forming a professional band.
PM Modi also expressed his commitment to continuously improving the scheme by seeking feedback from beneficiaries and identifying areas for further reforms. He highlighted the government’s focus on empowering the common people of India, noting that ₹33 lakh crore has been disbursed to citizens under the Mudra Yojana without the need for guarantees or collateral.
The Union Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, was also present at the event.
Since its inception in April 2015, the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has been a cornerstone of India’s efforts to foster entrepreneurship and self-reliance, particularly among women and youth, by providing easy access to finance for small businesses.

Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah, during his visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, reaffirmed the government’s unwavering commitment to national security and the welfare of the armed and paramilitary forces. In a series of significant engagements, Shah visited the Border Outpost (BOP) ‘Vinay’ in Kathua, interacted with Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, and later met with the families of martyred Jammu and Kashmir policemen in Jammu.
At the Vinay BOP, located along the international border in Kathua district, Shah paid homage to Assistant Commandant Vinay Prasad of the BSF, who was martyred in 2019. He was accompanied by Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, Union Minister Jitendra Singh, Home Secretary Govind Mohan, Director of the Intelligence Bureau, and the Director-General of BSF, among other dignitaries.
Shah inaugurated several newly developed infrastructure projects aimed at bolstering security and improving living conditions for BSF personnel. These included eight women barracks, a G+1 watchtower, high-mast lighting, and a composite BOP — all developed at the cost of Rs. 47.22 crore.
Addressing BSF personnel, Shah praised their tireless dedication in safeguarding India’s borders under the most challenging climatic and geographical conditions. He emphasized that the BSF has always served as the first line of defense and has made invaluable contributions during every conflict with Pakistan. Highlighting the growing role of technology in border security, Shah informed that two models of electronic surveillance systems are being piloted to aid soldiers in real-time monitoring and prompt response. He added that more than 26 technology-based initiatives are underway, including tunnel detection and anti-drone systems, with positive results expected by March next year.
The Home Minister reiterated that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government is committed to reducing the hardships faced by security forces. He cited several welfare schemes like Ayushman CAPF, ex-gratia payments, insurance coverage, and the Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme as key examples of the Centre’s support.
Meeting with the families of martyred policemen of J&K
Shah also met with the families of martyred Jammu and Kashmir policemen in Jammu and handed over appointment letters to nine nominees on compassionate grounds. Paying tribute to the fallen heroes, Shah acknowledged their supreme sacrifice in combating terrorism over the past three and a half decades.
He stated that significant strides have been made in curbing terrorism and weakening separatist ideologies under the current administration, although the mission is not yet fully accomplished. Shah specifically mentioned the case of 12-year-old Yuvraj Singh, son of martyr SGCT Jaswant Singh, recommending his appointment on compassionate grounds upon attaining adulthood.
The Home Minister also expressed deep respect to the family of Shashi Bhushan Abrol, Deputy Manager/Designer at APCO Construction Company, who was killed during a terrorist attack at the Sonamarg Tunnel project in October 2024.
Shah emphasized the importance of honouring the ideals of the martyrs, stating that their courage and commitment would continue to inspire the nation to strive for a secure and prosperous India. He called upon citizens to uphold the values of duty, honour, and service to ‘Maa Bharti’.

He stressed the importance of expanding this partnership into emerging sectors such as digital technology, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and nuclear energy, alongside traditional areas of cooperation, according to a statement from the Lok Sabha Secretariat.
During his meeting with the President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Birla underscored India’s ancient democratic values and their evolution through the Constitution. He pointed to grassroots empowerment and inclusive governance as key features of Indian democracy, citing the 33 percent reservation for women in local bodies and the recently enacted Nari Shakti Vandan Act, the first legislation passed in the new Parliament building, which enhances women’s representation in state and central legislatures.
Birla also invoked India’s civilizational ideals of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family) and Sarvajan Hitaya (For the Welfare of All), noting these values have long guided Indian governance. Reflecting on India’s 75 years of constitutional democracy, he emphasized the role of progressive legislation in driving transformative socio-economic change.
Stressing the elevation of India-Uzbekistan relations to a Strategic Partnership, Birla noted that India is now among Uzbekistan’s top ten trading partners. He called for greater parliamentary engagement, promoting dialogue to share governance practices and deepen mutual understanding.
Appreciating Uzbekistan’s growing interest in Indian culture—including music, dance, and yoga—Birla also lauded the increasing enrollment of Indian students in Uzbek universities. He expressed confidence that the Tashkent meetings would further reinforce bilateral and parliamentary ties between the two nations.

Title: Celebrating 10 years of MUDRA, PM Modi emphasizes financial inclusion and social empowerment
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 06:30:07 +0000
Content: As India celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his heartfelt congratulations to the beneficiaries of the scheme, highlighting its transformative impact on millions of lives across the country. In a series of post on X, the Prime Minister expressed his pride in the success of MUDRA, which has played a pivotal role in empowering marginalized communities, fostering entrepreneurship, and driving inclusive economic growth in India.
“Today, as we mark #10YearsOfMUDRA, I would like to congratulate all those whose lives have been transformed thanks to this scheme. Over this decade, MUDRA Yojana has turned several dreams into reality, empowering people who were previously overlooked with the financial support to shine. It illustrates that for the people of India, nothing is impossible!” said Prime Minister Modi.
The PM also emphasized the scheme’s focus on social inclusion, noting that nearly half of MUDRA beneficiaries come from the SC, ST, and OBC communities, while more than 70% of the beneficiaries are women. “Every Mudra loan carries with it dignity, self-respect, and opportunity. In addition to financial inclusion, this scheme has also ensured social inclusion and economic freedom,” he added.
Since its launch on April 8, 2015, the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana has sanctioned over 52 crore loans, totaling ₹32.61 lakh crore. The average loan size has grown significantly, from ₹38,000 in FY16 to ₹1.02 lakh in FY25, reflecting the increasing demand for higher-value loans among small enterprises.
The scheme has played a key role in the rise of credit flow to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to a report by the State Bank of India, MSME lending surged from ₹8.51 lakh crore in FY14 to ₹27.25 lakh crore in FY24, with projections indicating it will exceed ₹30 lakh crore in FY25. The share of MSME credit in total bank credit has increased from 15.8% in FY14 to nearly 20% in FY24, underscoring the growing importance of MSMEs in India’s economy.
Women have been significant beneficiaries of the MUDRA scheme, with women accounting for 68% of the total recipients. The average loan for women has risen at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%, reaching ₹62,679 between FY16 and FY25. Women-led MSMEs, particularly in states with higher proportions of loans to women, have seen notable increases in employment generation, according to government data.
MUDRA has also made substantial strides in ensuring expanded access to formal finance for traditionally underserved groups. Fifty percent of MUDRA accounts are held by entrepreneurs from SC, ST, and OBC communities, while 11% of accounts are held by members of minority communities.
Loan disbursals under MUDRA have seen a remarkable shift toward larger loans. Loans in the Kishor category (₹50,000 to ₹5 lakh) grew from just 5.9% of total disbursals in FY16 to 44.7% in FY25. Additionally, loans in the Tarun category (₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh) and the newly introduced Tarun Plus category (₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh) have also witnessed increased demand.
Tamil Nadu leads in total disbursals, with ₹3.23 lakh crore, followed closely by Uttar Pradesh (₹3.14 lakh crore) and Karnataka (₹3.02 lakh crore). Other states, including West Bengal and Bihar, have also seen substantial contributions. Among Union Territories, Jammu and Kashmir has recorded ₹45,815.92 crore across over 21 lakh loan accounts.
MUDRA caters to micro enterprises engaged in a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, trading, processing, and services. These small businesses—often sole proprietorships or own-account enterprises—employ nearly 10 crore people, making them the second-largest source of employment in India after agriculture.
The scheme has garnered global recognition for its contribution to expanding financial access and promoting entrepreneurship. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has praised MUDRA for supporting self-employment and the formalization of the economy. The IMF’s 2024 report reaffirms the significant role of schemes like PMMY in fostering the growth of women-led businesses and enhancing financial inclusion.
The MUDRA Yojana is implemented through a network of lending institutions, including Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and Microfinance Institutions. These institutions offer collateral-free loans of up to ₹20 lakh under the scheme, which operates under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA).

Title: Government strengthens nutrition and childcare initiatives through Poshan Pakhwada 2025 and Palna schemes
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:42:30 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has launched the 7th edition of Poshan Pakhwada, being observed from April 8 to 22, as part of the government’s intensified efforts to tackle malnutrition. Running in collaboration with multiple ministries and state departments, this year’s campaign underscores four core themes—maternal and infant nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life, promotion of the Poshan Tracker app, community-based management of malnutrition (CMAM), and encouraging a healthy lifestyle to combat childhood obesity, as stated by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on Monday.
Poshan Pakhwada 2025
Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Annpurna Devi, is scheduled to visit Arunachal Pradesh to review ongoing nutrition initiatives, while Minister of State Savitri Thakur will inaugurate the campaign by addressing Anganwadi workers, officials of the State WCD departments, and representatives from 18 partner ministries via webcast. Community-level outreach such as village camps, home visits, and educational drives will form the backbone of this outcome-oriented campaign.
Since its inception in 2018, Poshan Abhiyaan has emerged as a flagship mission aimed at improving nutritional outcomes for women and children. Central to the 2025 campaign is the emphasis on the first 1,000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday, widely recognized as a critical window for brain and body development. This period will be used to educate families about proper breastfeeding, balanced diets, and early childhood stimulation—particularly in tribal and remote areas where local diets play a significant role.
Technology is also playing a pivotal role. The AI-enabled Poshan Tracker, launched in 2021, has now registered all Anganwadi centres in India and enables real-time tracking of beneficiaries, meal distribution, and health metrics. Families can now self-register via the web application to monitor their own nutritional progress. The CMAM protocol, introduced in October 2023, further enables Anganwadi workers to identify and treat acutely malnourished children at the grassroots level.
Palna Scheme under Mission Shakti
The government is also addressing the increasing need for childcare support through the Palna Scheme, implemented under the Samarthya sub-scheme of Mission Shakti. Palna provides quality crèche services for children aged six months to six years, helping working mothers balance employment and childcare responsibilities in today’s nuclear family settings. The scheme supports daycare, early stimulation, preschool education, nutritional meals, growth monitoring, and immunization.
Initially known as the National Crèche Scheme, Palna was restructured in 2022 and is now a centrally sponsored program shared between the Centre and States/UTs in a 60:40 ratio (90:10 for special category states). It mandates crèche facilities in establishments with 50 or more employees under the amended Maternity Benefit Act.
There are two types of crèches under Palna—Standalone Crèches and Anganwadi-cum-Crèches (AWCCs). As of March 2025, 11,395 AWCCs have been approved across 34 States and UTs, and 1,761 are operational, serving 28,783 children. Additionally, 1,284 Standalone Crèches are functioning with 23,368 beneficiaries. The government aims to establish 17,000 new AWCCs in 2024–25.
Each crèche accommodates up to 25 children and is designed to be located near the child’s home or mother’s workplace to ensure ease of access and continued breastfeeding. Creche Workers and Helpers receive a monthly honorarium, with States having the option to top-up from their own funds.

Title: ‘One State, One RRB’: Govt notifies amalgamation of 26 regional rural banks
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:17:25 +0000
Content: The Department of Financial Services (DFS) under the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday notified the amalgamation of 26 Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) as part of the fourth phase of RRB consolidation. The move follows the principle of “One State, One RRB” and aims to improve operational efficiency and cost rationalization.
The decision, based on an official statement issued by the Ministry, comes after the government initiated a stakeholder consultation process in November 2024. The amalgamation covers RRBs operating across 10 states and one union territory.
According to the Ministry, the consolidation is expected to enhance the scale of operations and optimize resource use, building on the success of previous phases of amalgamation that have improved the performance of RRBs.
Prior to the latest restructuring, 43 RRBs were operational across 26 states and 2 union territories. Following the merger, the total number of RRBs has been reduced to 28. These banks collectively operate more than 22,000 branches, serving around 700 districts nationwide. Approximately 92% of these branches are located in rural and semi-urban areas, reaffirming the banks’ core mandate of rural financial inclusion.
This marks the fourth round of RRB amalgamations undertaken by the government. In the first phase (FY 2006 to FY 2010), the number of RRBs was reduced from 196 to 82. The second phase (FY 2013 to FY 2015) brought the number down to 56, while the third phase (FY 2019 to FY 2021) further reduced it to 43.

Power Grid was the only stock that closed lower. The positive sentiment was also reflected in global markets.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 posted a stunning 6 per cent gain, while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.58 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.51 per cent.
Investors are now keenly awaiting the outcome of the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (RBI MPC) meeting on rate cut and others.
Alongside the policy review, upcoming corporate earnings for the fourth quarter (Q4) and other key macroeconomic indicators will also guide investor sentiment through the week.
“Market sentiment remains upbeat as investors bet on a steady policy from the central bank and strong domestic fundamentals,” experts noted.
“India is getting ready for the RBI MPC tomorrow, where we expect 25bps rate cut (in line with consensus),” said Jaykrishna Gandhi of Emkay Global Financial Services.
He added that “we also expect a possible change in stance to ‘accommodative’ to give directional easing bias.”

Title: PLI boost: India’s smartphone exports cross Rs 2 lakh crore for 1st time in FY25
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:29:01 +0000
Content: India’s smartphone exports reached a new milestone in the financial year 2024–25 (FY25), surpassing ₹2 lakh crore for the first time, Union Minister for Electronics and IT, Ashwini Vaishnaw, announced on Tuesday.
In a post on X, the minister described it as yet another record-breaking achievement under the government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
According to Vaishnaw, smartphone exports rose by 54% compared to the previous financial year, as global value chains (GVCs) continued to integrate with India’s growing electronics manufacturing sector.
“The rise in exports is creating massive employment opportunities, with Indian MSMEs becoming part of the global supply network and the local electronics manufacturing ecosystem expanding rapidly,” the minister said.
Earlier industry data had revealed that smartphone exports from India had already crossed ₹1.75 lakh crore during the first 11 months (April to February) of FY25 — surpassing last year’s performance well before the end of the fiscal year.
The sharp growth is largely attributed to the PLI scheme, which has not only driven exports but also significantly reduced smartphone imports. Today, 99% of smartphones used in India are manufactured domestically.
The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) had projected smartphone exports to touch $20 billion (around ₹1.68 lakh crore) in FY25, but actual figures exceeded expectations by a wide margin.
Apple emerged as the single largest contributor to this export surge, with its iPhone supply chain accounting for nearly 70% of total smartphone exports. Foxconn’s facility in Tamil Nadu alone contributed about 50% of all shipments, recording a 40% year-on-year growth.
Tata Electronics also played a vital role in India’s iPhone production, contributing through its Wistron facility in Karnataka and a 60% stake in Pegatron’s Tamil Nadu operations. These developments have positioned Tata as a key player in Apple’s India-based manufacturing strategy.
Meanwhile, reports suggest that Apple is exploring the possibility of increasing its iPhone exports from India to the United States. The move is being considered as a temporary strategy to bypass high tariffs on Chinese goods and manage rising import costs.

Title: Study strengthens link between maternal diabetes and autism
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:25:52 +0000
Content: A large new study adds to evidence that diabetes during pregnancy is linked with an increased risk of brain and nervous system problems in children, including autism, researchers say.
Whether diabetes actually causes those problems remains unclear. But when mothers have diabetes while pregnant, children are 28% more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, according to an analysis of data pooled from 202 earlier studies involving more than 56 million mother-child pairs.
The risks for children of mothers with diabetes during pregnancy were 25% higher for autism, 30% higher for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 32% higher for intellectual disability. They were also 20% higher for trouble with communication, 17% higher for movement problems and 16% higher for learning disorders than in children whose mothers did not have diabetes while pregnant.
Diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy appeared to confer a 39% higher risk for one or more of these neurodevelopmental disorders compared with gestational diabetes that begins in pregnancy and often resolves afterward, the researchers reported in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.
Diabetes affects up to 9% of pregnancies in the United States, with the incidence rising, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Seven of the earlier studies compared affected children with siblings. These analyses did not find an effect from mothers’ diabetes, which suggests that shared genetic or familial factors might be contributing to the increased risk, the authors noted.
The findings emphasize the importance of medical support for women at risk of developing diabetes and the continuous monitoring of their children, the researchers said.
The association of maternal diabetes with autism in offspring is well known, said Dr. Magdalena Janecka of NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who studies links between in utero exposures and child development but was not involved in the new research.
A large “meta-analysis” like this one allows for analyses of subgroups, such as mothers with pre-existing vs gestational diabetes, or children with autism vs those with ADHD or movement disorders, but it cannot prove cause and effect, Janecka said.
“Meta-analyses allow us to compare groups more precisely. At the same time, they are not bringing us any closer to understanding the causes or the underlying mechanisms.”
The study comes as Trump administration health officials have called for further research into whether vaccines are a cause of autism, a claim long championed by new Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that has been debunked by established science.

Title: S Jaishankar welcomes Crown Prince of Dubai on his first official visit to India
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 09:45:49 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar welcomed UAE’s Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on his first official visit to India on Tuesday.
In a post on X, Jaishankar expressed his pleasure at receiving the Crown Prince and highlighted the positive sentiment regarding the wide-ranging cooperation and vibrant ties between the two nations. “Delighted to welcome Crown Prince of Dubai and DPM & Minister of Defence of UAE HH @HamdanMohammed at the start of his first official visit to India. Value his positive sentiments for our wide-ranging cooperation and vibrant ties,” the External Affairs Minister wrote.
The Crown Prince’s visit, which will run from April 8 to 9, marks a new chapter in the growing strategic and economic ties between India and the UAE. Upon his arrival in New Delhi, the Crown Prince was accorded a ceremonial guard of honour. He was received by Union Minister of State for Tourism & Petroleum and Natural Gas, Suresh Gopi, at the Palam Airport.
This visit is significant, as it is the first official trip of the Crown Prince to India in his current capacity. He is accompanied by senior government officials, ministers, and a prominent business delegation, reflecting the expanding depth of the India-UAE partnership. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated that the Crown Prince’s visit is expected to further strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries.
As part of his visit, the Crown Prince will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for discussions on enhancing bilateral ties. He will also hold separate talks with key Indian ministers, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
In addition to his engagements in the capital, the Crown Prince will travel to Mumbai, where he will participate in a business roundtable with leading business figures from both India and the UAE. The roundtable is expected to focus on boosting trade and investment in traditional sectors like infrastructure and energy, as well as emerging fields such as fintech, innovation, and sustainability.
Dubai has long served as a key hub for India’s commercial and cultural exchanges with the UAE, with the Indian diaspora playing an integral role in strengthening ties. With over 4.3 million Indians living in the UAE, a majority of whom reside in Dubai, the people-to-people connections between the two nations remain a strong foundation for bilateral relations.
The visit is also expected to further elevate the India-UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, expanding both institutional and grassroots-level ties between India and Dubai. Diplomatic relations between the two nations were formally established in 1972, and bilateral engagements have grown significantly, particularly since Prime Minister Modi’s historic visit to the UAE in 2015.

Title: New India a ‘Land of Opportunities’ with rapid reforms: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:31:55 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday said that New India has emerged as a “Land of Opportunities” due to rapid reforms across various sectors, particularly in healthcare, education, and technology. He was addressing Indian students at the Samarkand Medical University during his visit to Uzbekistan as head of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation (IPD) for the 150th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
According to an official statement, Birla said that national initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat have opened up vast opportunities in India’s healthcare sector. As the scheme continues to expand to include both public and private hospitals, it is creating more avenues for Foreign Medical Graduates (FMGs) to gain hands-on experience and contribute to India’s growing healthcare system, he added.
Birla also pointed out the rapid growth in medical education and research in India, saying it offers students ample opportunities to work with academic and research institutions.
He praised Indian students studying abroad as “ambassadors of Indian values and culture,” noting that despite living far from home, they remain rooted in Indian traditions and play a role in strengthening India’s ties with their host countries. Birla said these students are cultural and educational representatives of India and are instrumental in building cooperation between India and Uzbekistan.
The Lok Sabha Speaker assured the students that the Government of India is committed to supporting the welfare of Indian nationals abroad. Citing the ‘Help’ portal and proactive support from Indian embassies, Birla said the government ensures that overseas students do not face obstacles in their education, safety, or career development.
“Indian doctors have a global identity,” he said, encouraging students to uphold this legacy. “India has always produced exceptional medical professionals, and your global experience will shape the future of healthcare worldwide.”
He urged the students to not only develop their academic expertise but also embrace values such as dedication and compassion.
Later in the day, Birla interacted with members of the Indian diaspora in Uzbekistan. He described their affection for India as “inspirational” and said their continued efforts strengthen India’s global identity.
Highlighting India’s position as the world’s fastest-growing economy, he said that the diaspora has an important role to play in India’s development journey. “Through investment and innovation, the Indian community abroad can contribute to building a developed India,” he said.
On the sidelines of the IPU Assembly in Tashkent, Speaker Birla also held a meeting with Shalva Papuashvili, Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia. The two leaders discussed strengthening parliamentary diplomacy and deepening cooperation in trade, tourism, and innovation.
Birla thanked Georgia for its support to India at multilateral forums and appreciated its hospitality towards the Indian community. He emphasised the cultural bonds between the two nations and proposed enhanced youth exchange programmes, digital collaboration, and stronger people-to-people ties.

Title: Centre enacts Waqf Law Reforms to promote transparency, women’s inclusion
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:18:22 +0000
Content: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which came into effect on Tuesday, introduces key provisions aimed at strengthening the rights and representation of Muslim women in the governance and benefits structure of Waqf institutions, according to an official statement.
Among the major reforms introduced by the amended law is the protection of inheritance rights for women in family Waqf arrangements, also known as Waqf-alal-aulad. The statement notes that under Section 3A(2), no property can be dedicated to Waqf unless female heirs have first received their rightful inheritance share, thereby preventing the misuse of Waqf declarations to deny women property rights.
The amended law also expands the objectives of family Waqf to include financial support for widows, divorced women, and orphans. Section 3(r)(iv) allows Waqf funds to be used for their welfare and maintenance, aligning the legislation with Islamic principles of social justice and economic support.
To improve gender representation, the Act mandates the inclusion of at least two Muslim women in every State Waqf Board (Section 14) and the Central Waqf Council (Section 9). According to the release, this reform is intended to ensure women have a formal role in decision-making regarding the use and management of Waqf resources.
The government also highlighted targeted areas where women’s participation in governance is expected to have a direct impact. These include the allocation of scholarships for Muslim girls, provision of healthcare and maternity services, legal support for inheritance and domestic violence cases, and microfinance opportunities for women entrepreneurs.
The bill further calls for the creation of vocational training centres and self-help groups to promote financial independence among Muslim women. These centres are expected to offer training in sectors such as healthcare, business, and fashion design, enabling women to secure employment or launch their own enterprises.
In a move to improve transparency and reduce misuse of resources, the law also mandates the digitisation of Waqf records. Officials say this will help ensure that funds designated for women’s welfare are properly accounted for and utilised.
Describing the amendments as a significant shift from the past, the official statement said the reforms aim to correct long-standing inequalities by giving women a voice in governance and access to financial support through the Waqf system.
“The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, is a step towards making Waqf institutions more inclusive, transparent and responsive to the needs of all sections of the Muslim community, especially women,” the statement read.

Title: Rajnath Singh meets UAE Crown Prince and Defence Minister to boost bilateral defence ties
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:00:51 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a meeting with Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in New Delhi on Tuesday.
According to the Ministry of Defence, both leaders expressed satisfaction with the current level of defence cooperation, which includes institutional mechanisms, joint military exercises, and exchange of training programmes.
They acknowledged the need to further scale up defence collaboration in line with progress achieved in other sectors such as trade and business, in keeping with the shared vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
Training exchanges were identified as a key area of future cooperation, with both sides noting that such initiatives would promote mutual understanding of each other’s defence ecosystems and help strengthen bilateral ties.
The ministers also expressed satisfaction over the active cooperation between their respective coast guard forces. They agreed to formalise this collaboration through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with the aim of enhancing maritime security.
The leaders highlighted the importance of defence industry collaboration as an integral component of bilateral ties. They discussed the potential for enhancing partnerships in defence manufacturing and emphasised the need to explore joint ventures and co-production opportunities.
Both sides welcomed the growing participation in each other’s defence exhibitions and expos, and reaffirmed the importance of the India-UAE Defence Partnership Forum. The Forum, they noted, has the potential to lead to strategic industrial partnerships and technology-sharing agreements under initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Make in Emirates’.
In a post on X, Defence Minister Singh said that the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and the UAE remains a key priority for India.
“In the coming years, we are eager to work closely in areas such as defence cooperation, co-production and co-development projects, innovation and technology. Both India and the UAE are committed to work towards peace and prosperity in the region,” he stated.
India and the UAE signed an MoU on Defence Cooperation in 2003, followed by another on Defence Industry Cooperation in 2017. The two countries share longstanding cultural and economic ties, which continue to form the foundation of their bilateral relationship.

Title: Waqf Amendment Act comes into effect; centre issues gazette notification
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:56:49 +0000
Content: The Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 officially came into force on Tuesday, following the issuance of a Gazette notification by the Central Government.
The Act had received the assent of President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday, two days after its passage in Parliament.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 (14 of 2025), the Central Government hereby appoints the 8th day of April, 2025 as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,” stated the official notification published in the Gazette of India.
The amended legislation brings substantial changes to the original Waqf Act. Key reforms include the separation of trusts from Waqf entities, the adoption of digital tools for property management, the creation of a centralised online portal to enhance transparency, and the restriction of Waqf property dedication to practicing Muslims only.
The law also includes provisions to protect ‘Waqf by User’ properties—those historically used by the community—and recognises women’s rights in family Waqf arrangements.
The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier in the week and cleared by the Rajya Sabha in the early hours of Friday, April 4, following a marathon 17-hour debate.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the legislation as a “watershed moment” in India’s ongoing efforts to reform and modernise the administration of Waqf properties.
According to the government, the amended Act is intended to bring greater transparency and accountability to the management of Waqf assets, while ensuring equitable representation of all Muslim communities in the functioning of Waqf Boards.
However, the legislation has drawn sharp criticism from several opposition parties, who allege that the government is using the law to further a polarising agenda.
Following its enactment, multiple Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the Act.
Anticipating legal challenges, the Centre has filed a caveat in the apex court, requesting that no order be passed without hearing its side.

Title: Trump set to sign executive orders to boost US coal
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:15:04 +0000
Content: U.S. President Donald Trump will sign executive orders on Tuesday to boost the coal industry, a senior White House official and two sources told Reuters, in his latest action that runs counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions.
At the beginning of the century, coal generated more than half of U.S. power. Its share has sunk to less than 20%, according to the Energy Information Administration, as fracking and other drilling techniques have hiked production of U.S natural gas. Growth in solar and wind power has also cut coal use.
Trump, a Republican, campaigned on a promise to increase U.S. energy output and has sought to roll back energy and environmental regulations since taking office January 20.
He is scheduled to sign energy related orders at the White House at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT), the White House said.
The actions will also include efforts to save coal plants that were likely to be retired, said the sources close to the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
U.S. power demand is rising for the first time in two decades as energy-intensive data centers for artificial intelligence, electric cars, and crypto currencies increase consumption.
The orders will direct Energy Secretary Chris Wright to determine whether coal used in the production of steel is a “critical mineral” the White House official said. It also directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to acknowledge the end of of a moratorium that paused coal leasing on federal lands and to prioritize coal leasing.
When burned, coal releases more of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel. It also emits criteria pollutants that are blamed for lung and heart illnesses. Much of its use has declined on regulations from Democrats, including former President Joe Biden.
Coal backers have said that existing U.S. coal plants only provide power to the grid about 40% of the time and that number can be boosted through deregulation and other measures.

Content: President Droupadi Murmu, during her ongoing State Visit to Portugal, met with the President of the Portuguese Parliament, Assembleia da República, Jose Pedro Aguiar-Branco, on Tuesday. The two leaders held wide-ranging discussions on bilateral and global issues, with both agreeing that regular exchanges between the Parliaments of India and Portugal would help deepen people-to-people connections.
President Murmu was given a ceremonial Guard of Honour upon her arrival at the Assembleia da República and was warmly welcomed by Aguiar-Branco.
“President Droupadi Murmu held productive talks with the President of Assembleia da República, Jose Pedro Aguiar-Branco. Both sides discussed ways to strengthen India-Portugal relations. President Murmu also interacted with Members of Parliament and members of the India-Portugal Parliamentary Friendship Group,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.
On Monday evening, President Murmu was honoured with the ‘City Key of Lisbon’ by the Mayor of Lisbon at a special ceremony held at the City Hall.
In her remarks, the President expressed gratitude to the Mayor and the people of Lisbon for the warm gesture. She praised Lisbon for its openness, cultural richness, and its tradition of tolerance and respect for diversity.
She noted that Lisbon is a global city at the forefront of innovation, digital transformation, and public infrastructure. President Murmu said that these are areas where India and Portugal can further enhance their cooperation.
Later that evening, President Murmu attended a banquet hosted in her honour by Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa at the Palacio da Ajuda.
In her address at the banquet, President Murmu reflected on the centuries-old cultural ties between India and Portugal, highlighting the shared heritage visible in architecture, historical sites, languages, and cuisine.
“This year holds special significance as we celebrate 50 years of India-Portugal bilateral relations. With our natural synergy and scope for collaboration across diverse sectors, our historic ties are evolving into a dynamic and forward-looking partnership,” she said.
President Murmu expressed satisfaction with the steady growth in cooperation between India and Portugal in various areas, including science and technology, defence, information technology, start-ups, research, and education.
“As a knowledge-based economy, India is leveraging its strengths in science and technology, ICT, digital public infrastructure, and innovation to create an inclusive and sustainable development model. We consider Portugal a valued partner in these efforts,” she noted.
She also acknowledged Portugal’s efforts in promoting India’s relationship with the European Union. She recalled that the first India-EU Summit was held in 2000 during Portugal’s presidency of the EU, and again in May 2021, under Portugal’s leadership, the historic ‘India-EU+27 Leaders’ Summit’ took place in Portugal.
President Murmu concluded by expressing confidence that India-Portugal relations will grow even stronger in the years ahead, benefiting not only both nations but also contributing positively to the global community.

Title: Government strengthens nutrition and childcare initiatives through Poshan Pakhwada 2025 and Palna schemes
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:42:30 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has launched the 7th edition of Poshan Pakhwada, being observed from April 8 to 22, as part of the government’s intensified efforts to tackle malnutrition. Running in collaboration with multiple ministries and state departments, this year’s campaign underscores four core themes—maternal and infant nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life, promotion of the Poshan Tracker app, community-based management of malnutrition (CMAM), and encouraging a healthy lifestyle to combat childhood obesity, as stated by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on Monday.
Poshan Pakhwada 2025
Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Annpurna Devi, is scheduled to visit Arunachal Pradesh to review ongoing nutrition initiatives, while Minister of State Savitri Thakur will inaugurate the campaign by addressing Anganwadi workers, officials of the State WCD departments, and representatives from 18 partner ministries via webcast. Community-level outreach such as village camps, home visits, and educational drives will form the backbone of this outcome-oriented campaign.
Since its inception in 2018, Poshan Abhiyaan has emerged as a flagship mission aimed at improving nutritional outcomes for women and children. Central to the 2025 campaign is the emphasis on the first 1,000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday, widely recognized as a critical window for brain and body development. This period will be used to educate families about proper breastfeeding, balanced diets, and early childhood stimulation—particularly in tribal and remote areas where local diets play a significant role.
Technology is also playing a pivotal role. The AI-enabled Poshan Tracker, launched in 2021, has now registered all Anganwadi centres in India and enables real-time tracking of beneficiaries, meal distribution, and health metrics. Families can now self-register via the web application to monitor their own nutritional progress. The CMAM protocol, introduced in October 2023, further enables Anganwadi workers to identify and treat acutely malnourished children at the grassroots level.
Palna Scheme under Mission Shakti
The government is also addressing the increasing need for childcare support through the Palna Scheme, implemented under the Samarthya sub-scheme of Mission Shakti. Palna provides quality crèche services for children aged six months to six years, helping working mothers balance employment and childcare responsibilities in today’s nuclear family settings. The scheme supports daycare, early stimulation, preschool education, nutritional meals, growth monitoring, and immunization.
Initially known as the National Crèche Scheme, Palna was restructured in 2022 and is now a centrally sponsored program shared between the Centre and States/UTs in a 60:40 ratio (90:10 for special category states). It mandates crèche facilities in establishments with 50 or more employees under the amended Maternity Benefit Act.
There are two types of crèches under Palna—Standalone Crèches and Anganwadi-cum-Crèches (AWCCs). As of March 2025, 11,395 AWCCs have been approved across 34 States and UTs, and 1,761 are operational, serving 28,783 children. Additionally, 1,284 Standalone Crèches are functioning with 23,368 beneficiaries. The government aims to establish 17,000 new AWCCs in 2024–25.
Each crèche accommodates up to 25 children and is designed to be located near the child’s home or mother’s workplace to ensure ease of access and continued breastfeeding. Creche Workers and Helpers receive a monthly honorarium, with States having the option to top-up from their own funds.

Title: Rajasthan CM, deputy CM condole passing of Brahma Kumaris chief Dadi Ratan Mohini
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:28:03 +0000
Content: Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma has expressed condolences on the passing of Dadi Ratan Mohini, the chief administrator of the Brahma Kumaris. She passed away on Tuesday at the age of 101 in a private hospital in Ahmedabad.
CM Sharma said, “I am deeply saddened by the news of the demise of Dadi Ratanmohini, the Chief Rajyogini of Brahma Kumari Ishwariya Vishwavidyalaya. Her demise is an irreparable loss to the spiritual world. May Lord Ram grant strength to the bereaved followers to bear this immense loss. Om Shanti.”
Deputy Chief Minister Diya Kumari also paid tribute to the spiritual leader. In a post on X, she wrote, “I am shocked to hear the news of Dadi Ratan Mohini’s passing. Dadi’s life and her contributions to the upliftment of society serve as an inspiration to all of us.”
Born on March 25, 1925, in Hyderabad, Sindh (now in Pakistan), Dadi Ratan Mohini was drawn to spirituality from an early age and played a pivotal role in shaping the Brahma Kumaris movement. She remained active in her spiritual service until the final days of her life.
She began her journey by mentoring young women in spiritual practice before fully dedicating herself to the Brahma Kumaris institution. Over the decades, she was instrumental in nurturing thousands of women and expanding the organization’s outreach across India and abroad.

Title: ‘One State, One RRB’: Govt notifies amalgamation of 26 regional rural banks
Publication Date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:17:25 +0000
Content: The Department of Financial Services (DFS) under the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday notified the amalgamation of 26 Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) as part of the fourth phase of RRB consolidation. The move follows the principle of “One State, One RRB” and aims to improve operational efficiency and cost rationalization.
The decision, based on an official statement issued by the Ministry, comes after the government initiated a stakeholder consultation process in November 2024. The amalgamation covers RRBs operating across 10 states and one union territory.
According to the Ministry, the consolidation is expected to enhance the scale of operations and optimize resource use, building on the success of previous phases of amalgamation that have improved the performance of RRBs.
Prior to the latest restructuring, 43 RRBs were operational across 26 states and 2 union territories. Following the merger, the total number of RRBs has been reduced to 28. These banks collectively operate more than 22,000 branches, serving around 700 districts nationwide. Approximately 92% of these branches are located in rural and semi-urban areas, reaffirming the banks’ core mandate of rural financial inclusion.
This marks the fourth round of RRB amalgamations undertaken by the government. In the first phase (FY 2006 to FY 2010), the number of RRBs was reduced from 196 to 82. The second phase (FY 2013 to FY 2015) brought the number down to 56, while the third phase (FY 2019 to FY 2021) further reduced it to 43.

Title: S Jaishankar responds to Trump’s tariff comments, highlights India’s strategy for bilateral trade deal
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 07:13:55 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar on Wednesday addressed the ongoing debate over the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, emphasizing India’s clear strategy of engaging with the United States on a bilateral trade agreement. Speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit, Jaishankar stated that India aims to conclude a trade deal with the US by the fall of this year.
When asked about the potential impact of the tariffs, Jaishankar replied, “I don’t think it is possible to speak about the impact because we don’t know.” He emphasized that India’s strategy has been focused on constructive engagement with the Trump administration, with the goal of reaching a bilateral trade agreement.
“Our strategy is pretty clear; we decided that we will engage with the Trump administration earlier on these set of issues, and we were very open with them, constructive with them as they were with us. What we agreed to do was try to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement by the fall of this year,” Jaishankar explained.
The EAM further noted that, to his knowledge, India is the only country that has reached such an understanding with the US since President Trump resumed office for his second term. “To the best of my knowledge, and I could be corrected here, I think we are the only country after President Trump has resumed the presidency the second time, which has actually reached such an understanding in principle,” Jaishankar added.
While acknowledging the impact of tariffs on countries worldwide, Jaishankar pointed out that each nation is adopting its own strategy to deal with the US. “In our case, our strategy has a goal, which is to see whether it is possible to actually deal with this situation by concluding a bilateral trade agreement,” he said. He also added that India had been pursuing a trade deal with the US even during Trump’s first term.
Jaishankar noted that the current tariff situation had created an opportunity for deeper engagement, but emphasized that negotiating a trade deal with the US was not a negative development for India. “So from the Indian perspective, working out a bilateral deal with the United States is not a negative or unwanted situation, on the contrary, it is something which has long been our objective,” he stated.
The EAM highlighted that since Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US, bilateral trade negotiations have gained momentum, with multiple rounds of engagement. “We’ve had more discussions with the Americans in the last six weeks than I suspect we’ve had with the Europeans in the last two years,” Jaishankar remarked.
This statement comes amid US President Donald Trump’s remarks on Tuesday, where he mocked countries affected by US tariffs for their eagerness to negotiate with him. Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump claimed that countries were calling him up, offering to do “anything” to secure a deal. He emphasized that his negotiation skills were superior to those of Congress, pointing to China’s 104% tariffs as a testament to his negotiating power.

Title: Piyush Goyal highlights Strategic India-UAE Partnership at Dubai-India Business Forum in Mumbai
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 07:07:10 +0000
Content: India and the UAE are on track to achieve $100 billion in non-oil trade, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday.
Speaking at the Dubai-India Business Forum in Mumbai, Goyal highlighted the deepening strategic partnership between the two nations and described the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) as “a defining moment” in bilateral ties.
“Our goal to take non-oil trade to $100 billion is within reach. The speed and scale at which our partnership is growing is truly inspiring,” he said.
The forum, organised by Dubai Chambers, was attended by Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, who is on a two-day official visit to India.
Goyal lauded the UAE’s pivotal role in India’s outreach to Africa and acknowledged the impact of investments in logistics and digital infrastructure. He particularly appreciated DP World’s contribution to India’s logistics ecosystem transformation.
Describing the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and the UAE as a “defining moment,” Goyal expressed confidence that the goal of achieving $100 billion in non-oil trade is within reach.
On the education front, he announced ongoing efforts to deepen academic collaboration. “After the launch of an IIT campus in Dubai, we are now planning to establish campuses of the Indian Institute of Management and Indian Institute of Foreign Trade,” he said.
He also thanked the UAE for its support to the Indian diaspora, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Over 2 million Indians call the UAE home, and you have cared for them like your own family,” he added.
Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Goyal said, “India is not just a workforce, we are a world force.” He noted that India is on track to become the fourth-largest economy by 2025 and the third-largest by 2027, with ambitions to reach a $30-35 trillion economy by 2047.
Goyal invited greater investment and collaboration in emerging sectors such as nuclear energy, critical minerals, green hydrogen, fintech, food security, and advanced manufacturing. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. We have many mountains yet to climb,” he said, urging businesses from both countries to seize the opportunities ahead.

Title: US company resurrects the extinct dire wolf, or some version of it
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 06:35:44 +0000
Content: The dire wolf was one of the most formidable predators in the Americas during the last Ice Age, possessing a body more stout and a skull more robust than those of modern wolves. The species went extinct along with many others as the Ice Age ended.
Roughly 13,000 years later, a U.S. company has taken a step aimed at bringing the dire wolf back from oblivion – aside from the TV versions in the popular “Game of Thrones” fantasy series. Dallas-based Colossal Biosciences has announced the birth of three genetically engineered wolf pups – all with striking white fur – created with the help of ancient DNA obtained from fossilized remains of dire wolves.
The company is calling them dire wolves and is referring to this as the world’s first successfully “de-extincted” animal. The same approach can be used to resurrect other extinct species for which ancient DNA is available, according to the company.
Outside experts are more cautious, describing the pups as genetically modified gray wolves because the process used to create them involved editing the genes of that species to add dire wolf traits. The gray wolf is the closest living relative of the dire wolf.
There are two male pups, named Romulus and Remus after Rome’s legendary founders who were suckled by a she-wolf, and one female, named Khaleesi in honor of a “Game of Thrones” character.
All three are large for their age compared to gray wolves, according to Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief science officer. Romulus and Remus, both six months old, are around 80 pounds (36 kg) while Khaleesi, at two months old, is around 25 pounds (11 kg).
Dire wolves were as much as 25% bigger than gray wolves, with a slightly wider head and a stronger jaw, the company said.
Company scientists extracted ancient DNA from two dire wolf fossils – a tooth from Sheridan Pit, Ohio, approximately 13,000 years old, and an inner ear bone from American Falls, Idaho, roughly 72,000 years old.
Twenty genes of gray wolves were edited with this DNA to include dire wolf traits in gray wolf cells. Through cloning, embryos were created from the edited gray wolf cells, and these were implanted in surrogate domesticated dog mothers. Three different dogs gave birth to the pups.
“We define de-extinction success as bringing back the functional ecological traits that made dire wolves unique contributors to their ecosystem, and our dire wolves are an example of that,” Shapiro said.
Asked whether it is proper to call the pups dire wolves, Shapiro said, “I feel like this debate misses the point a bit. Remember that species classifications are human constructs that often don’t map well onto natural populations. We invented them to help make sense of the natural world.”
“De-extinction is not creating perfect genetic copies of individual animals. It’s about restoring lost ecological functions and enhancing biodiversity,” Shapiro added.
‘SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS’
Corey Bradshaw, a professor of global ecology at Flinders University in Australia, voiced skepticism about the company’s announcement and the practicality of reviving an extinct species.
“So yes, they have slightly genetically modified wolves, maybe. And that’s probably the best that you’re going to get. And those slight modifications seem to have been derived from retrieved dire wolf material. Does that make it a dire wolf? No. Does it make a slightly modified gray wolf? Yes,” Bradshaw told Reuters TV.
Shapiro said the pups are thriving on a secure ecological preserve spanning more than 2,000 acres (810 hectares). The company did not give the location. Shapiro said they eventually could weigh 100 to 150 pounds (45-68 kg) and stand 32 to 40 inches (81-102 cm) at the shoulder.
Dire wolves once roamed widely in North and South America as one of the most successful Ice Age predators, alongside the likes of saber-toothed cats and giant short-faced bears. In North America, their fossils have been discovered as far north as Alaska and down into southern Mexico. Numerous dire wolf fossils have been found at the Rancho La Brea tar pits site in Los Angeles.
Previous research could not resolve their evolutionary origin, causing speculation that jackals may be their closest living relative. Colossal said its high-quality dire wolf genome revealed that the gray wolf is the closest living relative, sharing 99.5% of their DNA code with dire wolves.
Its scientists also determined that the dire wolf lineage emerged between 3.5 and 2.5 million years ago as a consequence of hybridization between two ancient lineages of canids.
“Some extinct species, like the dire wolf, hold deep cultural significance for indigenous peoples or played important roles in human history. Their restoration could help preserve cultural heritage and traditional ecological knowledge,” Shapiro said.

Title: “Those who thought India will move slowly, steadily are seeing fast and fearless India”: PM Modi
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:18:30 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Waqf legislation aims to ensure dignity for all, particularly the marginalised, while accusing the Congress of engaging in “appeasement politics.”
Speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit in New Delhi, PM Modi said those who once believed India would move forward slowly and cautiously will now witness a nation that is fast and fearless. He added that when growth is driven by aspirations, it becomes both inclusive and sustainable.
He said India has sprinted ahead at double the speed, doubling the size of its economy in a decade.
PM Modi said “appeasement politics” has been a significant challenge to India’s growth. Referring to the recent amendment to the Waqf-related laws passed by Parliament, the Prime Minister noted that the debate surrounding Waqf stems from the politics of appeasement, which is not a new phenomenon.
“The seeds of appeasement were sown during India’s freedom struggle,” he said. He questioned why India, unlike other nations that gained independence, had to face partition as a condition for freedom. He attributed this to the prioritization of power over national interest at the time. He stated that the idea of a separate nation was not rooted in the aspirations of ordinary Muslim families but was propagated by a few extremists, supported by certain Congress leaders to secure sole claims to power.
The Prime Minister said that Congress gained power through appeasement politics and some extremist leaders made wealth. However, he questioned what the common Muslim received in return. He highlighted that poor and marginalized Muslims were left with neglect, illiteracy, and unemployment. He emphasized that Muslim women faced injustice, citing the Shah Bano case where their constitutional rights “were sacrificed to appeasement”. He noted that women were silenced and pressured not to question, while extremists were given free rein to suppress their rights.
“Appeasement politics is fundamentally against the core concept of social justice in India,” PM Modi said. He criticized some parties for using it as a tool for vote-bank politics. PM Modi said that the 2013 amendment to the Waqf Act was an attempt to appease extremist elements and land mafias. He noted that the amendment created an illusion of being above the Constitution, restricting the very pathways to justice that the Constitution had opened. He emphasized the adverse consequences of the 2013 amendment, “which emboldened land mafias”.
He cited examples such as Waqf claims on Christian community lands in Kerala, disputes over Gurudwara lands in Haryana, and claims on farmers’ lands in Karnataka.
He pointed out that entire villages and thousands of hectares of land across states are now entangled in NOC and legal complexities. The Prime Minister remarked that whether it was temples, churches, gurudwaras, farms, or government lands, people lost confidence in retaining ownership of their properties. A single notice would leave individuals scrambling for documents to prove ownership of their own homes and fields. He questioned the nature of such a law, which was meant to deliver justice but instead became a source of fear.
He said the Waqf law now serves the interests of all communities, including the Muslim community and the sanctity of Waqf will now be preserved, and the rights of marginalized Muslims, women, and children will be safeguarded.
He highlighted that the debate on the Waqf Bill was the second-longest in India’s parliamentary history, with 16 hours of discussion across both houses. He noted that the Joint Parliamentary Committee held 38 meetings and engaged in 128 hours of deliberation. Additionally, nearly one crore online suggestions were received from across the country. “This demonstrates that democracy in India is no longer confined to Parliament alone but is being strengthened through public participation,” he said.
He emphasized the roadmap for India’s progress by 2047, stating that continuous deliberation at every step will yield valuable insights.
“The world’s eyes and expectations are on India,” he said, highlighting that within a span of a few years, India has risen from being the 11th to the 5th largest economy.
“Despite numerous global challenges, India has sprinted ahead at double the speed, doubling the size of its economy in just one decade”. He remarked that those who once believed India would progress slowly and steadily are now witnessing a ‘Fast and Fearless India’.
He expressed confidence that India will soon become the world’s third-largest economy. “This unprecedented growth is being driven by the ambitions and aspirations of India’s youth,” he said.
Noting that the first 100 days of the year are nearing completion in a couple of days, the Prime Minister highlighted that the decisions made during this period reflect the aspirations of India’s youth.
“These 100 days were not just about decisions but about laying the foundation for the future,” he emphasised.
PM Modi stated that policies have been transformed into pathways for possibilities. He highlighted key initiatives, including zero tax on income up to Rs 12 lakh, benefiting young professionals and entrepreneurs. He noted the addition of 10,000 new medical seats and 6,500 new IIT seats, marking an expansion in education and acceleration in innovation.
PM Modi also mentioned the establishment of 50,000 new Atal Tinkering Labs, ensuring innovation reaches every corner of the country. He remarked that these labs will ignite a chain reaction of innovation. Highlighting the creation of Centers of Excellence for AI and skill development, providing youth with opportunities to become future-ready, PM Modi also announced 10,000 new PM Research Fellowships to simplify the journey from ideas to impact.
He remarked that just as the space sector was opened, the nuclear energy sector will now also be opened, removing boundaries and fostering innovation. He mentioned the introduction of social security for youth engaged in the gig economy, ensuring that those previously invisible are now at the center of policies. He also highlighted term loans of up to Rs two crore for SC/ST and women entrepreneurs, emphasizing that inclusivity is now a policy, not just a promise. These decisions will directly benefit India’s youth, as the progress of the nation is tied to the progress of its youth, he added.
“The achievements of the past 100 days demonstrate that India is unstoppable, unyielding, and unwavering in its progress,” he said, noting that during this period, India became the fourth country in the world to achieve satellite docking and undocking capabilities.
He noted the successful testing of the semi-cryogenic engine and the milestone of surpassing 100 gigawatts of solar capacity. He also emphasized the record coal production of 1,000 million tons and the launch of the National Critical Mineral Mission.
PM Modi also mentioned the decision to establish the 8th Pay Commission for Central Government employees and the increase in fertilizer subsidies for farmers, underscoring the government’s priority for the welfare of farmers. He highlighted the mass housewarming ceremony for over 3 lakh families in Chhattisgarh and the distribution of more than 65 lakh property cards under the Swamitva scheme. The Prime Minister remarked that in these 100 days, one of the world’s highest tunnels, the Sonamarg Tunnel, was dedicated to the nation. He noted the addition of INS Surat, INS Nilgiri, and INS Vagsheer to the Indian Navy’s strength. He also cited the approval for the purchase of ‘Made in India’ light combat helicopters for the Army.
“This mantra of performance is the true energy behind a rising India”, the Prime Minister said. He shared his recent visit to Rameswaram, where he had the opportunity to inaugurate the historic Pamban Bridge. He highlighted that over 125 years ago, the British constructed a bridge there, which witnessed history, endured storms, and suffered significant damage from a cyclone. Despite years of public demand, previous governments failed to act. He emphasized that it was under his government that worked on the new Pamban Bridge began and the nation now has its first vertical lift rail-sea bridge.
Emphasising that delaying projects hampers the nation’s progress, while performance and swift action drive development, the PM said, “delay is the enemy of development, and our government is committed to defeating this enemy”.
He cited the example of Assam’s Bogibeel Bridge, whose foundation was laid by former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda in 1997 and initiated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, the project stalled under subsequent governments, causing hardships for millions in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, he added.
He highlighted that his government restarted the project in 2014 and completed it within four years, in 2018. He also mentioned Kerala’s Kollam Bypass Road project, which had been pending since 1972. He noted that the previous governments worked on it for 50 years, while the project was completed within five years, under his government.
PM Modi remarked that discussions on Navi Mumbai Airport began in 1997, and it received approval in 2007. However, he highlighted that the Congress government did not take action on the project. He stressed that his government expedited the project, and the day is not far when commercial flights will commence from Navi Mumbai Airport.
Highlighting the significance of April 8, marking the 10th anniversary of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the Prime Minister remarked that earlier, even opening a bank account without a guarantor was a challenge, and bank loans were a distant dream for ordinary families.
“Mudra Yojana did not demand guarantees but placed trust in the people,” he said.
He emphasized that over the past decade, 11 crore dreams have been given wings through the Mudra Yojana. He noted that approximately Rs 33 lakh crore has been disbursed under the scheme, reaching villages and small towns–a figure…

Title: RBI revises FY25-26 GDP growth estimate to 6.5% amid tariff hurdles
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:18:01 +0000
Content: India’s real GDP growth forecast has been revised downwards to 6.5% for the current financial year 2025-26, from the earlier expectation of 6.7%, as highlighted by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra during the policy announcement on Wednesday.
The Governor noted that this growth projection follows a strong performance of 9.2% recorded in the previous financial year, 2024-25, as per figures released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).
He said, “The real GDP, as you are all aware, is expected to grow at 6.5% this year, according to the MOSPI figures. This comes on top of the 9.2% growth rate observed in the previous year, 2024-2025.”
Speaking on the economic outlook, Malhotra mentioned that the agriculture sector is expected to perform well this year, due to healthy reservoir levels and strong crop production. He also highlighted that manufacturing activity is picking up pace, with business expectations remaining positive. Meanwhile, the services sector continues to show resilience, contributing steadily to economic growth.
He acknowledged that growth is improving after a weak performance in the first half of the previous financial year, although it still remains below the level the country aspires to achieve.
On the demand side, the Governor stated that the positive outlook for agriculture is likely to support rural demand, which remains strong. Urban consumption is also gradually increasing, aided by a rise in discretionary spending.
Investment activity has gained momentum, Malhotra added, and is expected to improve further. This improvement is driven by sustained higher-capacity utilization, continued government spending on infrastructure, strong balance sheets of banks and corporates, and easier financial conditions.
He said, “Investment activity has gained traction and is expected to improve further on the back of sustained higher-capacity utilization, the government’s continued focus on infrastructure spending, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, along with the easing of financial conditions.”
However, Malhotra cautioned that merchandise exports may face pressure due to global uncertainties. On the other hand, services exports are expected to stay resilient and support overall growth momentum.

Title: Trump mocks tariff-hit nations, announces upcoming pharma tariffs
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:17:56 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump took aim at nations impacted by tariffs on Tuesday, mocking their desperate attempts to negotiate with him. Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump boasted about his superior negotiating skills, claiming that countries hit by tariffs were eager to strike deals with the United States.
“They are dying to make a deal—’please sir make a deal, I’ll do anything, I’ll do anything sir,'” Trump said, emphasizing his confidence in handling international negotiations.
Trump further dismissed concerns from some ‘rebel’ Republicans who argued that Congress should take over tariff negotiations. He asserted that if Congress had handled the situation, China would not have faced a 104% tariff. “If that were the case, China wouldn’t have been slapped with 104 per cent tariffs, and vice versa,” he said.
Mocking Congress, the President warned that any attempt by lawmakers to take control of tariff negotiations would harm the U.S. economy. “Congress takes over negotiating to sell America fast because you’re going to go busted,” Trump remarked. He predicted that such negotiations would be a victory for China, suggesting that under Congress’s approach, the U.S. would end up paying tariffs to China instead of the other way around.
Trump also promised to announce major tariffs targeting the pharmaceutical sector in the near future. “Tariffs on pharma will be there because we don’t make our own pharma drugs; they are made in another country,” he explained. The President argued that the U.S. is being overcharged for pharmaceuticals, with some drugs priced at over USD 10 more than in other countries.
“We are going to tariff pharma in such a way that companies will come rushing to us very soon,” he said, adding that the U.S. market’s size would attract pharmaceutical companies to relocate their manufacturing operations back to the U.S. “Very shortly, we will announce a major tariff on pharma, and when these companies hear that, they will leave China and other countries because most of their products are sold here. And they will be opening their plants here,” Trump concluded.

Title: RBI cuts repo rate by 25 bps to 6% amid deepening global trade war
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 05:06:08 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday cut the repo rate by 25 basis points, reducing it from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, in a bid to support the economy amid growing global headwinds stemming from sweeping tariffs and retaliatory duties imposed by US President Donald Trump on several countries, including India.
Announcing the decision after the MPC’s three-day meeting held on April 7, 8, and 9, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra stated, “After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic and financial conditions and outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent with immediate effect.”
This marks the second consecutive rate cut in recent months. On February 7, the central bank had reduced the repo rate from 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent.
Governor Malhotra highlighted the global economic turbulence that influenced the committee’s decision. “To deliberate and decide on the policy reparations, the global economic outlook is fast changing. The recent trade tariff-related measures have exacerbated uncertainties, clouding the economic outlook across regions and posing new headwinds for global growth and inflation. Amidst this turbulence, the US dollar has weakened appreciably,” he stated.
Malhotra also emphasized that domestic growth is showing signs of recovery after a sluggish first half of the last financial year (2024-25) but remains below desired levels. “Growth is improving after a weak performance in the first half of the last financial year (2024-2025), although it still remains lower than what we aspire for,” he said.
He added, “Consequently, the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate, under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility, shall stand adjusted to 5.75 percent, and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, or the Bank Rate, shall stand adjusted to 6.25 percent.”
The MPC also adjusted key rates under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate now stands at 5.75 percent, while the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate have been revised to 6.25 percent.
On inflation, the Governor painted an optimistic picture and said, “The Monetary Policy Committee noted that inflation is currently below the target. It is supported by a sharp fall in food inflation. Moreover, there is a decisive improvement in the inflation outlook. As per projections, there is now greater confidence in a durable alignment of headline inflation with a target of 4 percent over a 12-month horizon.”

Title: PM Modi emphasizes importance of Jain literature and spiritual heritage at Navkar Mahamantra Divas
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 04:52:59 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday highlighted the vital role of Jain literature in shaping India’s intellectual and spiritual heritage, calling it the “backbone of India’s intellectual grandeur.” Speaking at the ‘Navkar Mahamantra Divas’ event at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital, PM Modi emphasized that preserving ancient Jain texts is a national responsibility.
“The literature of Jainism is the backbone of India’s intellectual grandeur. Preserving this knowledge is our duty,” PM Modi stated during his address.
The Prime Minister also underscored the significance of granting Classical Language status to Prakrit and Pali—ancient languages integral to Jain and Buddhist traditions. “That is why we have granted Classical Language status to Prakrit and Pali,” he noted, highlighting the cultural and scholarly importance of these languages.
Reflecting on his personal connection to Jainism, PM Modi shared that his early exposure to Jain teachings in Gujarat, where the influence of Jainism is deeply embedded, shaped his spiritual journey. “Since childhood, I have been in the company of Jain Acharyas,” he said. He also spoke reverently of chanting the Navkar Mantra, describing it as a moment of deep reverence and connection with the five supreme beings: Panch Parmeshthi.
The Prime Minister pointed to the architectural and cultural influence of Jainism in the new Parliament building, mentioning the ‘Shardula Dwar,’ the idol of a Tirthankara at the Lok Sabha entrance, and the depiction of all 24 Tirthankaras on the walls. “A magnificent painting of Lord Mahavir adorns the roof of the Constitution Hall,” he added, emphasizing Jainism’s profound impact on India’s national identity.
PM Modi linked spirituality to the nation’s progress, asserting that a developed India should not only embrace technological advancements but also remain rooted in its ancient traditions. “A developed India means progress as well as heritage—an India that will not stop, that will not pause, that will touch great heights without being severed from its roots,” he said.
In this context, the Prime Minister announced the launch of the ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission,’ an initiative unveiled in the 2025 Union Budget. The mission aims to survey and digitize millions of ancient manuscripts across the country. “Many important texts are slowly disappearing. Through this mission, we will connect antiquity with modernity,” PM Modi explained. He also highlighted the potential of Artificial Intelligence in making India’s spiritual legacy globally accessible.
The Prime Minister also drew attention to efforts to retrieve ancient heritage from abroad, including the return of more than 20 statues of Tirthankaras in recent years. “This is a matter of national pride,” he said, emphasizing the government’s commitment to reclaiming India’s cultural heritage.
Referring to the Gyan Bharatam initiative as an “Amrit Sankalp,” PM Modi stated that India will preserve its knowledge systems and inspire the world by blending technology with spirituality.
Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister inaugurated the Navkar Mahamantra Divas at Vigyan Bhawan, a significant spiritual and cultural event dedicated to the revered Jain chant. During the event, attended by members of the Jain community and spiritual leaders, PM Modi led the collective chanting of the Navkar Mahamantra, describing it as a spiritually energizing and unifying experience.
The event, which also included the participation of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, aimed to celebrate the timeless teachings of Jain philosophy, promoting values such as inner peace, self-realization, and harmony. Religious scholars, Jain monks, dignitaries, and hundreds of followers gathered for the occasion, emphasizing Jainism’s teachings on nonviolence, truth, self-discipline, and inner transformation.

Title: Australia’s Will Pucovski announces shock retirement at 27 due to concussion struggles
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 04:45:25 +0000
Content: Former test batsman Will Pucovski has confirmed his retirement from cricket at the age of 27 as the Australian continues to battle concussion symptoms more than a year after being struck by a ball in a domestic match.
The Melbourne native was once seen as the future of Australian cricket as he made a half-century on his test debut against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2021.
It was to prove his only international match, though, as he suffered a shoulder injury in the field and was never able to break back into the squad due to repeated instances of concussion.
Pucovski confirmed to radio station SEN on Tuesday that he was still suffering symptoms more than a year after being hit in the helmet by a delivery from Tasmania fast bowler Riley Meredith in a Sheffield Shield match in Hobart.
“From there it’s been a tough year, a lot of the symptoms didn’t go away, which has led me to this decision,” said the former Victoria number three, who has battled headaches, dizziness and lethargy.
“It’s unfortunately gotten to a stage now where a year or so down the track (I am) still suffering, still don’t really have the answers I have been looking for in terms of why I am still getting these symptoms, and it’s come time to make this decision.”
The setback he suffered against Tasmania was the 13th known instance of concussion over his career which began with huge promise as the right-hander racked up runs in Victoria’s top order.
While on the cusp of playing test cricket, Pucovski withdrew himself from selection several times to manage mental health problems linked to concussion.
He told SEN he was still suffering from fatigue and with “things on his left side.”
He said his next move would be in coaching with his local team, the Melbourne Cricket Club, which would help soften the blow of never playing again.
“I am 27 and hopefully I have a good life ahead of me … I don’t want to do any more damage to my brain,” he said.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower ahead of RBI MPC decisions as reciprocal tariffs kick in
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 04:31:20 +0000
Content: Indian equity indices opened lower on Wednesday, following their global peers, as US President Donald Trump threatened reciprocal tariffs on the global pharmaceutical sector.
Ahead of the RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decisions, where a 25 bps repo rate cut is likely, along with a shift in stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative,’ the Sensex was down 302 points, or 0.41 percent, at 73,939, and the Nifty was down 107 points, or 0.48 percent, at 22,433 in early trade.
Along with large-cap stocks, mid-cap and small-cap stocks also fell. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 436 points, or 0.87 percent, at 49,402, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was down 150 points, or 0.98 percent, at 15,238.
On the sectoral front, auto, FMCG, and consumption stocks were major gainers. IT, PSU Bank, pharma, metal, realty, infra, and commodities were the major laggards.
In the Sensex pack, Power Grid, Nestle, HUL, M&M, ITC, Asian Paints, and Bharti Airtel were major gainers. Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finserv, Tata Steel, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Tech, TCS, and Sun Pharma were major losers.
Selling was seen in major Asian markets, with Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Seoul all in the red. The US markets closed lower on Tuesday due to recession fears.
The US has announced it will impose an additional 50 percent tariff on imports from China in response to the 34 percent retaliatory tariffs China announced last week.
The additional 50 percent duty on Chinese imports will bring the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods to 104 percent. Trump’s sweeping tariffs have raised fears of a recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades.

Title: Over ₹900 crore allocated for sewerage projects in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by NMCG
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:41:30 +0000
Content: The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) on Wednesday approved a series of projects aimed at pollution control and river rejuvenation in the 61st Executive Committee meeting, chaired by Director General Rajeev Kumar Mital.
Among the key approvals, the Executive Committee sanctioned sewerage management projects worth over ₹900 crore. A major project in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, focusing on the prevention of pollution in the Ramganga River, received the green light. The ₹409.93 crore initiative includes the construction of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) with capacities of 15 MLD and 65 MLD in Zone-3 and Zone-4 respectively. Additionally, five major drains in the region will be intercepted and diverted to minimize direct sewage discharge into the river.
In Bihar, a project in Arrah town was approved at an estimated cost of ₹328.29 crore. This includes the construction of a 47 MLD capacity STP and a 19.5 km sewer network. Implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Model, the project also covers the plant’s operation and maintenance for 15 years. The scheme aims to provide a long-term solution to sewage issues in Arrah and reduce untreated wastewater flowing into the Ganga.
Another major project was approved for Kanpur city in Uttar Pradesh, targeting the interception and diversion of 14 untapped drains. With an estimated cost of ₹138.11 crore, the initiative is expected to significantly improve the city’s drainage and sanitation system by channeling sewage to treatment plants through newly proposed sewage pumping stations and manholes.
In West Bengal, the Executive Committee approved an Integrated Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant (FSTP) for Pujali Municipality under the Namami Gange programme. With a total cost of ₹5.96 crore, the project involves setting up an 8 KLD capacity facility aimed at improving urban sanitation and protecting water resources.
The Committee also cleared a nature-based solution project for the rejuvenation of the Yamuna River in Delhi. The initiative includes the installation of pilot CAMUS-SBT (Continuous Advanced Mite Utilizing System – Soil-Based Treatment) plants in the Shahdara drain to treat liquid pollutants. These 5 MLD capacity plants aim to meet water quality standards set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
Further, the EC approved the establishment of the NMCG-IIT Delhi-Dutch Collaboratory for Intelligent River Systems and Clean Yamuna (IND-RIVERS), under the India-Netherlands Water Strategic Partnership. The collaboratory will serve as a centre of excellence focusing on urban rivers and nature-based solutions, bringing together academia, government, and international expertise to develop action-oriented research and practical interventions.
The meeting also approved a project for the study and documentation of traditional wooden boat-making practices that have existed for centuries in the Ganga basin.
Additionally, the Delhi Development Authority’s Biodiversity Parks will be developed as Knowledge cum-Skill Development Centres for the National Mission for Clean Ganga. With a sanctioned cost of ₹8.64 crore, the initiative will be implemented in partnership with Delhi’s Yamuna Biodiversity Park, serving as a hub for research, education, and skill development in river conservation.
According to the official statement, the approved projects are expected to provide a strong impetus to the ongoing efforts under Namami Gange, contributing to pollution control, sustainable water management, and the preservation of riverine heritage.

Title: Unemployment slightly declines nationwide, reveals NSO survey
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:56:54 +0000
Content: The latest Annual Report of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), shows a marginal improvement in labour force indicators across both rural and urban regions of the country. The data, based on the first visit of the PLFS conducted from January to December 2024, presents calendar year-wise estimates of labour market indicators under both Current Weekly Status (CWS) and Principal and Subsidiary Status (PS+SS).
According to the report, the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) under the Current Weekly Status in urban areas increased for both men and women. Among urban males, LFPR rose from 74.3% in 2023 to 75.6% in 2024, while for females, it saw a modest rise from 25.5% to 25.8%. This led to an overall increase in urban LFPR from 50.3% to 51.0%. However, the all-India LFPR under CWS remained unchanged at 56.2%, indicating only slight variations across different categories.
Similarly, the Worker Population Ratio (WPR) in urban areas registered a small increase from 47.0% to 47.6%, suggesting some improvement in employment levels. At the national level, the overall WPR under CWS showed minimal change, rising marginally from 53.4% in 2023 to 53.5% in 2024.
Unemployment rates under the CWS showed mixed trends. In rural areas, the overall unemployment rate declined slightly from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both male and female unemployment rates in rural areas showed marginal reductions. In contrast, urban male unemployment increased from 6.0% to 6.1%, while female unemployment dropped from 8.9% to 8.2%, keeping the overall urban unemployment rate stable at 6.7%. The nationwide unemployment rate under CWS dropped slightly from 5.0% to 4.9%, suggesting minor improvements in employment opportunities.
One notable trend was the reduction in the percentage of unpaid helpers in household enterprises among rural females, which declined from 19.9% in 2023 to 18.1% in 2024. According to the report, this may have contributed to the slight decline in both LFPR and WPR in this group.
Under the Principal and Subsidiary Status (PS+SS), labour force participation rates remained largely stable. The overall LFPR declined marginally from 59.8% in 2023 to 59.6% in 2024. Similarly, the WPR under PS+SS also saw a slight decrease at the national level, from 58.0% to 57.7%, indicating a minor dip in employment despite steady participation levels.
Unemployment under PS+SS recorded a marginal increase nationwide, rising from 3.1% in 2023 to 3.2% in 2024. Although the change is minimal, it reflects slight variations in employment dynamics across regions.
The PLFS, launched by the NSO in April 2017, aims to provide more frequent labour force data. It generates quarterly estimates for urban areas under the Current Weekly Status and annual estimates for both urban and rural areas under both CWS and PS+SS.
For the 2024 calendar year estimates, data was collected from 12,749 First Stage Units (FSUs), including 6,982 villages and 5,767 urban blocks. A total of 1,01,957 households were surveyed — 55,846 in rural areas and 46,111 in urban areas — covering 4,15,549 individuals (2,40,492 in rural areas and 1,75,057 in urban areas).

Title: Russia says bombing Iran will not work after Trump threats
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:42:07 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday the world was getting tired of endless threats against Iran and that bombing the Islamic Republic would not bring peace, cautioning that Tehran was already taking preventative measures.
Iran is approaching weekend talks with the United States over its nuclear programme warily, with little confidence in progress and deep suspicions about U.S. intentions, Iranian officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
The talks were announced on Monday by U.S. President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House in January and has repeatedly threatened Washington’s decades-long foe Iran with military action if it does not agree to a deal.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was aware of the “quite harsh rhetoric” and that Tehran was taking preventative measures, and suggested the focus should be contacts rather than confrontation.
“Indeed, the world is growing tired of the endless threats against Iran,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said when asked by Reuters to clarify Russia’s approach. “There is a growing understanding that bombing cannot pave the way to peace.”
Iran’s nuclear programme, which began in the 1950s with support from then-ally the United States, has long been the subject of dispute between world powers and Iran, whose 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into one of the biggest foes of Washington.
The U.S., Israel and some European powers say Iran is covertly trying to develop a nuclear weapon, an assertion denied by Tehran which has in recent years built a partnership with Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power.
While Moscow has bought weapons from Iran for the war in Ukraine and signed a 20-year strategic partnership deal with Tehran earlier this year, their relationship has been deeply troubled at times since the 16th century when Muscovy officially established relations with the Persian Empire.
Iranian officials say that Moscow often talks tough but is wary of getting dragged into a major war in the Middle East. The partnership deal signed between Iran and Russia did not include a mutual defence clause.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept on good terms with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, especially since both Russia and Iran are cast as enemies by the West. But Moscow is keen not to trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
Russia, Zakharova said, wants “effective negotiable solutions” that would both reduce Western suspicions about Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and restore trust while ensuring a balance of interests – and avoid a crisis.
The United States during Donald Trump’s first presidency unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal that limited Iran’s nuclear work and allowed for more inspections and a loosening of sanctions against it.
The U.S. withdrawal prompted Iran to scrap and then massively breach the deal’s limits on uranium enrichment, widely seen as a key pathway to developing material for nuclear bombs.
“Tehran cannot be held responsible for the consequences of the illegal actions of those who, through their shortsightedness and erroneous forecasting, undermined agreements,” Zakharova said.

Title: India aims to finalise trade deal with US by fall 2025: EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:31:40 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday said that India is working towards finalizing a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States by the fall of 2025 — making it the only country to have reached such an understanding with the US under President Donald Trump’s second term.
Speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit in New Delhi, Jaishankar said the two nations had agreed early on to constructively engage on trade issues and aim for a comprehensive agreement. “What we agreed to do was to try to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement by the fall of this year,” he said, referring to ongoing discussions that followed the Modi-Trump summit in Washington, D.C.
India is currently facing 27% tariffs under the US’s reciprocal tariff regime. Jaishankar noted that the trade deal is intended to address such issues and ensure a strategic path forward. “Our strategy has a goal — to deal with the situation by concluding a BTA,” he said, adding that a trade deal has long been India’s objective.
The two countries have also set a target to expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, expert-level discussions under the BTA framework will begin virtually in the coming weeks, paving the way for in-person negotiations.

Title: AI can have medical care biases too, a study reveals
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:29:43 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence models may recommend different treatments for the same medical condition based solely on a patient’s socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, researchers warn.
The researchers invented nearly three dozen different patients and asked nine healthcare large language AI models how each one should be managed, in a thousand different emergency room situations.
Despite identical clinical details, the AI models occasionally altered decisions based on patients’ personal characteristics, affecting priority for care, diagnostic testing, treatment approach, and mental health evaluation, the researchers reported in Nature Medicine.
For example, advanced diagnostic tests such as CT scans or MRI were more often recommended for high-income patients, while low-income patients were more frequently advised to undergo no further testing, somewhat mimicking real-world healthcare inequities.
The problems were seen in both proprietary and open-source AI models, the researchers found.
“AI has the power to revolutionize healthcare, but only if it’s developed and used responsibly,” study co-leader Dr. Girish Nadkarni of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York said in a statement.
“By identifying where these models may introduce bias, we can work to refine their design, strengthen oversight, and build systems that ensure patients remain at the heart of safe, effective care,” added coauthor Dr. Eyal Klang, also of the Icahn School.
Potential fixes for Sjogren’s saliva and tears symptoms
Researchers are closer to being able to fix the life-altering dryness of the mouth and eyes that afflicts patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, based on success of two approaches tested in mice.
The symptoms of the autoimmune disorder can make it hard to speak, eat and sleep. But exactly how the disease shuts down the body’s production of tears and saliva has been a mystery until now, researchers reported in the International Journal of Oral Science.
Their new study found that early in the progression of Sjogren’s syndrome, a protein called tricellulin, which clasps together the cells of the glands that produce tears and saliva, is destroyed.
Loss of the tight cellular junctions results in inadequate saliva secretion, the researchers found.
Two possible interventions – an investigational drug (AT1001) and an experimental molecule – each restored saliva secretion in the mice, one by repairing the cell junctions and the other by stopping the breakdown of the junctions before it began.
Both restored normal gland function, offering a potential blueprint for human treatment, the researchers said.
“This changes how we think about treating Sjogren’s syndrome,” study leader Dr. Xin Cong of Peking University said in a statement.
“We’re moving beyond simply calming inflammation. Now we can fix the actual structural damage in the glands,” Xin said. “What’s even more encouraging is that both approaches worked, which gives us real confidence in developing patient-ready therapies.”
Experimental drug shows promise for one type of MS
An experimental drug originally developed to treat lymphomas is the first-ever to show an effect against a form of multiple sclerosis for which no approved treatments are available, researchers reported at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in San Diego.
Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, an investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrated a 31% delay in the onset of six-month confirmed disability progression in patients with non-active, non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, in a clinical trial.
“This is the first clinical trial showing a positive effect in delaying disability progression in non-relapsing SPMS, a later form of the disease where neurological function gradually worsens over time and disability increases relentlessly,” study leader Dr. Robert Fox of the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement.
With 1,131 patients enrolled in the trial, the rate of confirmed disability progression at six months was 22.6% in the tolebrutinib group versus 30.7% in the placebo group, according to a report of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
More patients receiving tolebrutinib achieved improvement in disability, with a six-month confirmed disability improvement rate of 8.6% versus 4.5% with placebo, the researchers also reported.
Markers of disease activity, including inflammation and tissue damage, also were reduced with tolebrutinib compared with placebo.
Serious adverse events, particularly liver complications, were more frequent with tolebrutinib, which is currently under review for potential U.S. approval.
“It appears that about one in 200 patients will have severe elevation of liver enzymes during the first three months of use, so careful monitoring is important, and the drug should be stopped immediately in those with liver enzyme elevations,” Fox said.
Separately, in two studies of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, tolebrutinib was not superior to Sanofi’s Aubagio (teriflunomide) in decreasing annualized relapse rates, according to a second report in the same journal.

Title: India proposes BIMSTEC Agriculture Centre of Excellence at Kathmandu ministerial meet
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:02:30 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare and Rural Development Shivraj Singh Chouhan led the Indian delegation at the 3rd BIMSTEC Agriculture Ministerial Meeting (BAMM), held in Kathmandu, Nepal, on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by agriculture ministers and senior officials from all seven BIMSTEC member nations — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
The high-level dialogue aimed to strengthen regional cooperation in agriculture, fisheries, and livestock. BIMSTEC, which connects South and Southeast Asia, continues to play a crucial role in advancing regional development and food security. Agriculture remains one of the core sectors of BIMSTEC cooperation.
In his address, Chouhan reaffirmed India’s commitment to regional agricultural collaboration and emphasized BIMSTEC’s alignment with India’s “Neighbourhood First” and “Act East” policies. Highlighting India’s agricultural reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he spoke of initiatives such as direct cash transfers to farmers, institutional credit access, the Soil Health Card, crop insurance, the National Food Security Mission, and the “Namo Drone Didi” scheme empowering rural women through drone technology.
Chouhan announced that India has taken the lead under the BIMSTEC Agriculture Cooperation 2023–2027 framework by organizing capacity-building workshops in seed development, animal health, and pest management. India is also offering fully-funded BIMSTEC scholarships for M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies in agriculture to students from member countries.
A major highlight of India’s participation was its proposal to establish a BIMSTEC Centre of Excellence for Agriculture Cooperation in India. The centre will focus on areas such as precision farming, natural and organic agriculture, climate risk mitigation, gender equality, and the use of artificial intelligence in agriculture. It is envisioned as a hub for sharing knowledge, emerging technologies like drones and digital tools, and best practices across the region to enhance food and nutritional security.
Chouhan also invited BIMSTEC countries to participate in the upcoming World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit 2025, announced by Prime Minister Modi. The event, scheduled in Mumbai from May 1–4, aims to foster international collaboration in media, entertainment, and digital innovation.

Title: Cabinet approves Rs 1,600 crore for modernisation of irrigation infrastructure under PMKSY
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:01:16 +0000
Content: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave its approval for the Modernization of Command Area Development and Water Management (M-CADWM) as a sub-scheme of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). This initiative, with an initial outlay of Rs. 1600 crore, is set to run for the period 2025-2026 and is designed to significantly enhance the irrigation infrastructure in India.
The primary goal of M-CADWM is to modernize the irrigation water supply network, ensuring that irrigation water reaches the designated farming clusters from existing canals or other water sources. This will help farmers, particularly those engaged in small-scale farming, by improving water efficiency through the use of advanced technologies such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies will assist in better water accounting and management, directly contributing to increased Water Use Efficiency (WUE) at the farm level.
A key feature of the M-CADWM scheme is the implementation of underground pressurized piped irrigation systems, extending up to 1 hectare per farm. This infrastructure will be developed to enhance micro-irrigation practices, enabling farmers to use water more effectively and ultimately increasing agricultural production and productivity.
In addition to modernizing the irrigation systems, the scheme aims to build sustainable farming practices. It proposes the Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) to Water User Societies (WUS), empowering these communities to manage irrigation assets independently. To ensure long-term success, these societies will receive handholding support for the next five years, helping them connect with economic entities like Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) or Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS). This linkage will further strengthen their economic position and promote sustainable water management practices.
The M-CADWM scheme also seeks to make agriculture more appealing to youth by encouraging the adoption of modern irrigation techniques, creating new opportunities for young people in the agricultural sector. This is expected to boost youth engagement in farming and improve overall agricultural practices across the country.

Title: Sensex slips 380 points amid US Tariff concerns; RBI cuts repo rate to 6%
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:52:07 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market ended in negative territory on Wednesday, weighed down by weak global cues and concerns over fresh US trade tariffs, despite a repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent from 6.25 per cent, aiming to support economic growth amid global uncertainties. Alongside the rate cut, the RBI also shifted its policy stance from ‘accommodative’ to ‘neutral.’
However, investor sentiment remained subdued. The Sensex fell 379.93 points, or 0.51 per cent, to settle at 73,847.15. Similarly, the Nifty dropped 136.70 points, or 0.61 per cent, ending the session at 22,399.15.
Among the top gainers on the Sensex were Nestle India, which rose over 3 per cent, Hindustan Unilever, which gained 2.52 per cent, and Titan, up 1.66 per cent. Other gainers included Adani Ports, Power Grid, Asian Paints, and ITC.
On the losing side, State Bank of India (SBI), Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, and Larsen & Toubro were among the worst performers, with some stocks falling as much as 3.4 per cent.
Broader markets also witnessed selling pressure. The BSE Midcap index declined 0.73 per cent, while the Smallcap index slipped 1.08 per cent.
Sector-wise, the most pronounced losses were seen in Nifty IT, Pharma, PSU Bank, Realty, and Healthcare indices, which declined between 1.11 per cent and 2.25 per cent.
“Global financial markets are witnessing renewed selling pressure following the enactment of reciprocal tariffs,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. He added that while the RBI’s rate cut and shift in policy stance were constructive steps, they failed to significantly lift market sentiment amid growing recessionary fears.
Ajit Mishra, SVP of Technical Research at Religare Broking, noted that the announcement of new US tariffs on China triggered a gap-down opening and led to a largely range-bound session.
Markets will remain closed on April 10 in observance of Mahavir Jayanti.

The bypass, with a total length of 19.2 km, will span the states of Punjab and Haryana and will be developed under the Hybrid Annuity Mode.
According to an official statement, the proposed bypass will begin at the junction with National Highway-7 (Zirakpur-Patiala) and end at the junction with National Highway-5 (Zirakpur-Parwanoo). It will follow the Punjab Government’s Master Plan alignment in Zirakpur and extend up to Panchkula in Haryana. The project is being developed as part of the National Highway (Original) programme under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, which aims to enhance integrated transport infrastructure across the country.
The Zirakpur Bypass is expected to ease heavy congestion currently experienced in Zirakpur, Panchkula, and surrounding areas. It is designed to divert through-traffic from key corridors such as Patiala, Delhi, and Mohali Aerocity, while also improving direct connectivity to Himachal Pradesh. The project is aimed at reducing travel time and ensuring smoother traffic flow on the heavily congested urban stretches of NH-7, NH-5, and NH-152.
The bypass is part of a larger initiative to decongest the Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali urban agglomeration through the development of a road network envisioned as a ring road. The Zirakpur Bypass forms a crucial segment of this broader infrastructure plan.

Title: CPEC Projects Stagnate: Lost Momentum and Lingering Questions
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:44:38 +0000
Content: The daring hijack of the Jaffar Express in March 2025 by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has once again brought the region’s resentments into sharp focus. The assault, which claimed at least 90 Pakistani soldiers’ lives and saw around 450 passengers taken hostage, highlights the BLA’s commitment to freeing Balochistan from what they view as systematic exploitation by Pakistan. Years of alleged human rights abuses, forced disappearances and economic marginalisation have fuelled widespread disillusionment among Baloch communities, who see foreign-led projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a further encroachment on their land.
Balochistan itself is a paradox: it is Pakistan’s largest province, home to immense natural wealth, yet it has the lowest literacy rate and ranks second worst in multi-dimensional poverty among the country’s four provinces, according to the UNDP. Local sentiment holds that if the province was historically exploited by Pakistan’s authorities, it is now jointly exploited by Pakistan and China. The BLA, along with other separatist groups, has repeatedly targeted Chinese nationals and infrastructure not only in Balochistan but across Pakistan, viewing these ventures as an extension of the same neglect that has dominated the province’s past.
CPEC, part of China’s sweeping Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), was launched in 2015 with a purported budget of USD 62 billion. It aimed to develop a 3,000-kilometre network of roads, railways and pipelines to link Gwadar and Karachi ports to China’s Xinjiang region. Behind the grand rhetoric, however, progress appears anything but smooth. Several major projects remain stalled after their official approvals, as reported by Dawn and other credible international publications. The slow pace of development has even prompted Pakistan’s Planning Minister, Ahsan Iqbal, to call upon economic authorities in Pakistan and its diplomatic missions in China to reassess delayed ventures and engage with concerned Chinese authorities, a clear sign of rising frustration within Pakistan’s corridors of power.
Yet what of the so-called “Phase II” of CPEC? In May 2024, at the 13th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, Islamabad requested over USD 17 billion in loans from China to revive key infrastructure schemes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif followed up with a visit to China in June, anticipating major new investments. What materialised was merely a 32-point joint statement offering vague commitments to upgrade CPEC into multiple “corridors”—growth, livelihood, innovation, green and open. The only tangible development was a staged USD 6.7-billion loan for upgrading the Main-Line-1 (ML-1) railway from Karachi to Peshawar, which, in fact, was not a new project but a rehashed plan to modernise a colonial-era track. Plans to upgrade a section of the Karakoram Highway also failed to yield fresh Chinese funding.
CPEC’s first phase had already exposed serious shortcomings: of the USD 28 billion earmarked for infrastructure and energy, many ventures remain stuck on paper. Fourteen power projects were reportedly completed, two are under construction and five appear nowhere near implementation. Six transport projects did take off, but another thirteen are languishing. Out of nine proposed Special Economic Zones (SEZs), only four are currently under construction. Job creation targets also have not come close to the original promise: of the more than two million positions envisioned, barely 250,000 have materialised, according to official figures.
A further complication arises from India’s staunch opposition to the Belt and Road Initiative in Pakistan. India maintains that CPEC violates its sovereignty and territorial integrity because several of its projects pass through Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, which India regards as an integral part of its territory. 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan Liberation Army’s escalating attacks reveal local hostility towards both federal authorities and international investors. The recent hijacking was not simply about seizing a train; it was a statement that Balochistan’s grievances will not be easily quelled by high-level announcements or carefully worded joint statements. Whether future discussions will actually address the socio-political fault lines that have plagued Balochistan for decades remains uncertain.
One thing, however, is abundantly clear: as long as local disenchantment collides with glacial progress and geopolitical disputes, CPEC risks being remembered less for the prosperity it promised and more for the turbulence it continues to generate. Is this the fate of a once-touted “game changer”, an unfulfilled vision overshadowed by violence, delays and deepening mistrust? The answer seems to lie in plain sight

Title: Bank of India, UCO Bank cut lending rates after RBI repo rate slash
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:27:53 +0000
Content: Hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, two major public sector banks — Bank of India and UCO Bank — on Wednesday reduced their lending rates, bringing relief to both existing and new borrowers.
The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra, lowered the key policy rate from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent earlier in the day.
This marks the second consecutive rate cut under Malhotra’s leadership and is aimed at supporting economic growth amid rising global challenges, including a steep 26 per cent tariff imposed by the US on Indian exports.
Responding swiftly to the RBI’s move, Bank of India reduced its Repo-Based Lending Rate (RBLR) to 8.85 per cent, down from 9.10 per cent. The new rate came into effect immediately on April 9.
Similarly, UCO Bank also cut its repo-linked lending rate to 8.8 per cent, with the revised rate becoming effective from Thursday.
Both banks announced the rate cuts through separate regulatory filings, citing the RBI’s latest policy decision as the reason for the revision.
The move is expected to make loans cheaper, encouraging increased borrowing by both individuals and businesses. Experts noted that other banks are likely to follow suit in the coming days, passing on the benefits of the RBI’s rate cut to customers across the country.
While announcing the decision, Governor Malhotra also revealed a shift in the RBI’s policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative,’ indicating the central bank’s willingness to support growth through a more relaxed monetary policy.
“Our stance provides policy rate guidance without any direct guidance on liquidity management,” he said.
The RBI has already infused over $80 billion into the banking system in the past two months, along with a rate cut in February — the first such move in five years.

He underlined the potential for deeper mutual engagement between India and Uzbekistan in areas such as the environment, language, culture, and education. Recalling Prime Minister Modi’s earlier visit to Uzbekistan, Birla noted the widespread popularity of Indian films and music in the country and referenced Uzbek Radio’s 50 years of Hindi-language broadcasting in 2012.
The Speaker emphasized that both India and Uzbekistan, despite having different historical trajectories, are now on paths of development and progress. He also recalled that India was among the first countries to recognize Uzbekistan’s independence and expressed hope that both nations would continue to work together to promote global values such as peace, stability, and human development.
Birla said that India and Uzbekistan have developed strong bilateral cooperation across various sectors, including politics, trade, investment, defense, security, counter-terrorism, science and technology, nuclear energy, space, and information technology. He added that the cultural and educational ties between the two nations further reinforce their relationship.
During his visit to Uzbekistan as the head of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation for the 150th Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Assembly, Birla also held bilateral talks with Nurdinjon Ismoilov, Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In the official statement, Birla highlighted the transparency and effectiveness of India’s electoral management system, noting that the successful conduct of a large-scale electoral process reflects the system’s efficiency. He further said that India’s democratic development since independence has been driven by the active participation of its citizens.

Title: India marks World Homoeopathy Day with record-breaking symposium in Gujarat
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:41:16 +0000
Content: Today, India joined the global community in celebrating World Homoeopathy Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy. The occasion was marked by the country’s largest-ever Homoeopathy Symposium, held at the Mahatma Mandir Convention & Exhibition Centre in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, showcasing India’s growing leadership in this centuries-old system of medicine.
Jointly organized by the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), the National Commission for Homoeopathy (NCH), and the National Institute of Homoeopathy (NIH), the event brought together thousands of stakeholders — including doctors, researchers, pharmaceutical professionals, and policymakers — to discuss the future of homeopathy in India and beyond.
Highlighting the scientific strength of this gentle healing system, the symposium featured research presentations, expert discussions, and India’s largest homeopathy industry exhibition, with a focus on innovation, collaboration, and global recognition of Indian homeopathy.
Homoeopathy in India: a trusted system with a strong backbone
With over 3.45 lakh registered homeopathic doctors, 277 hospitals, and 8,593 dispensaries across the country, homeopathy continues to be a preferred system of healthcare for over 100 million Indians. The country also boasts 8,697 homeopathy beds in AYUSH wellness centres, ensuring comprehensive care even in non-emergency cases.
In terms of education, India has 277 homeopathy colleges, including 197 undergraduate, 3 standalone postgraduate, and 77 integrated UG/PG institutions, under the aegis of NCH. These institutions are supported by 7,092 teaching faculty members, nurturing the next generation of BHMS graduates.
The pharmaceutical sector is equally robust, with 384 companies manufacturing homoeopathic medicines and 1,117 official pharmacopoeial monographs ensuring quality and consistency in drug production.
Legal and Institutional Framework
A comprehensive legal and institutional infrastructure backs homeopathy in India. After decades of regulation under the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973, the system was modernized with the enactment of the National Commission for Homoeopathy Act, 2020, which came into force on July 5, 2021.
The National Commission for Homoeopathy (NCH) now oversees professional regulation, while the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) leads scientific inquiry through a network of 35 research centres and treatment facilities. Additionally, the Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (PCIM&H) ensures the quality of medicines and acts as the central drug testing and appellate laboratory for the sector.
The recent introduction of the National Commission for Homoeopathy (Medical Research in Homoeopathy) Regulation, 2023 has laid down rigorous, evidence-based standards for conducting research, reinforcing India’s commitment to scientific validation in the field.
A Global Vision
As the second-largest system of medicine in the world, homeopathy continues to play a vital role in India’s public health strategy. With active promotion under the Ministry of Ayush, the country is positioning itself as a global hub for homeopathy research, education, and manufacturing.
World Homoeopathy Day 2025 celebrations underscore the nation’s commitment to advancing this time-tested system through innovation, regulation, and global partnerships—ensuring that the healing legacy of homeopathy continues to thrive in the 21st century.

Title: China retaliates as Trump trade tariffs kick in
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:10:13 +0000
Content: China will impose 84% tariffs on U.S. goods from Thursday, up from the 34% previously announced, its finance ministry said on Wednesday, firing the latest salvo in a global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries took effect earlier on Wednesday, including massive 104% duties on Chinese goods. The European Union is also preparing its own retaliatory measures for later on Wednesday.
Trump’s punishing tariffs – which he says aim to end U.S. trade deficits with many countries – have upended a global trading order in place for decades, raising fears of recession and wiping trillions of dollars off the market value of major firms.
Global markets took a pummelling on Wednesday as Trump’s eye-watering 104% tariffs on China came into effect, and a savage selloff in U.S. bonds sparked fears that foreign funds were fleeing U.S. assets.
Markets fell further after China retaliated. European shares extended their losses. Oil prices plunged to even deeper four-year lows and U.S. stock index futures fell sharply.
As it announced its new tariffs, China’s finance ministry said in a statement: “The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.”
Beijing also imposed restrictions on 18 U.S. companies, mostly in defence-related industries, adding to the 60 or so American firms punished over Trump’s tariffs.
‘GAME OF CHICKEN’
China’s move to impose 84% retaliatory tariffs is a losing proposition for Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.
“I think it’s unfortunate that the Chinese actually don’t want to come and negotiate, because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system,” he told Fox Business Network.
This week had already brought crisis-era volatility to markets, wiping trillions of dollars off the value of stocks and hammering commodities and emerging markets.
U.S. Treasuries were also caught up in the market turmoil and extended heavy losses in a sign investors are dumping even their safest assets, and the dollar, a traditional safe haven, was weaker against other major currencies.
“The U.S. and China are stuck in an unprecedented, and expensive, game of chicken, and it seems that both sides are unwilling to back down,” said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
Trump nearly doubled duties on Chinese imports, which had been set at 54% last week, in response to previous counter-tariffs from Beijing.

Title: Over ₹900 crore allocated for sewerage projects in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by NMCG
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:41:30 +0000
Content: The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) on Wednesday approved a series of projects aimed at pollution control and river rejuvenation in the 61st Executive Committee meeting, chaired by Director General Rajeev Kumar Mital.
Among the key approvals, the Executive Committee sanctioned sewerage management projects worth over ₹900 crore. A major project in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, focusing on the prevention of pollution in the Ramganga River, received the green light. The ₹409.93 crore initiative includes the construction of two sewage treatment plants (STPs) with capacities of 15 MLD and 65 MLD in Zone-3 and Zone-4 respectively. Additionally, five major drains in the region will be intercepted and diverted to minimize direct sewage discharge into the river.
In Bihar, a project in Arrah town was approved at an estimated cost of ₹328.29 crore. This includes the construction of a 47 MLD capacity STP and a 19.5 km sewer network. Implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Model, the project also covers the plant’s operation and maintenance for 15 years. The scheme aims to provide a long-term solution to sewage issues in Arrah and reduce untreated wastewater flowing into the Ganga.
Another major project was approved for Kanpur city in Uttar Pradesh, targeting the interception and diversion of 14 untapped drains. With an estimated cost of ₹138.11 crore, the initiative is expected to significantly improve the city’s drainage and sanitation system by channeling sewage to treatment plants through newly proposed sewage pumping stations and manholes.
In West Bengal, the Executive Committee approved an Integrated Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant (FSTP) for Pujali Municipality under the Namami Gange programme. With a total cost of ₹5.96 crore, the project involves setting up an 8 KLD capacity facility aimed at improving urban sanitation and protecting water resources.
The Committee also cleared a nature-based solution project for the rejuvenation of the Yamuna River in Delhi. The initiative includes the installation of pilot CAMUS-SBT (Continuous Advanced Mite Utilizing System – Soil-Based Treatment) plants in the Shahdara drain to treat liquid pollutants. These 5 MLD capacity plants aim to meet water quality standards set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
Further, the EC approved the establishment of the NMCG-IIT Delhi-Dutch Collaboratory for Intelligent River Systems and Clean Yamuna (IND-RIVERS), under the India-Netherlands Water Strategic Partnership. The collaboratory will serve as a centre of excellence focusing on urban rivers and nature-based solutions, bringing together academia, government, and international expertise to develop action-oriented research and practical interventions.
The meeting also approved a project for the study and documentation of traditional wooden boat-making practices that have existed for centuries in the Ganga basin.
Additionally, the Delhi Development Authority’s Biodiversity Parks will be developed as Knowledge cum-Skill Development Centres for the National Mission for Clean Ganga. With a sanctioned cost of ₹8.64 crore, the initiative will be implemented in partnership with Delhi’s Yamuna Biodiversity Park, serving as a hub for research, education, and skill development in river conservation.
According to the official statement, the approved projects are expected to provide a strong impetus to the ongoing efforts under Namami Gange, contributing to pollution control, sustainable water management, and the preservation of riverine heritage.

Title: Unemployment slightly declines nationwide, reveals NSO survey
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:56:54 +0000
Content: The latest Annual Report of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), shows a marginal improvement in labour force indicators across both rural and urban regions of the country. The data, based on the first visit of the PLFS conducted from January to December 2024, presents calendar year-wise estimates of labour market indicators under both Current Weekly Status (CWS) and Principal and Subsidiary Status (PS+SS).
According to the report, the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) under the Current Weekly Status in urban areas increased for both men and women. Among urban males, LFPR rose from 74.3% in 2023 to 75.6% in 2024, while for females, it saw a modest rise from 25.5% to 25.8%. This led to an overall increase in urban LFPR from 50.3% to 51.0%. However, the all-India LFPR under CWS remained unchanged at 56.2%, indicating only slight variations across different categories.
Similarly, the Worker Population Ratio (WPR) in urban areas registered a small increase from 47.0% to 47.6%, suggesting some improvement in employment levels. At the national level, the overall WPR under CWS showed minimal change, rising marginally from 53.4% in 2023 to 53.5% in 2024.
Unemployment rates under the CWS showed mixed trends. In rural areas, the overall unemployment rate declined slightly from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both male and female unemployment rates in rural areas showed marginal reductions. In contrast, urban male unemployment increased from 6.0% to 6.1%, while female unemployment dropped from 8.9% to 8.2%, keeping the overall urban unemployment rate stable at 6.7%. The nationwide unemployment rate under CWS dropped slightly from 5.0% to 4.9%, suggesting minor improvements in employment opportunities.
One notable trend was the reduction in the percentage of unpaid helpers in household enterprises among rural females, which declined from 19.9% in 2023 to 18.1% in 2024. According to the report, this may have contributed to the slight decline in both LFPR and WPR in this group.
Under the Principal and Subsidiary Status (PS+SS), labour force participation rates remained largely stable. The overall LFPR declined marginally from 59.8% in 2023 to 59.6% in 2024. Similarly, the WPR under PS+SS also saw a slight decrease at the national level, from 58.0% to 57.7%, indicating a minor dip in employment despite steady participation levels.
Unemployment under PS+SS recorded a marginal increase nationwide, rising from 3.1% in 2023 to 3.2% in 2024. Although the change is minimal, it reflects slight variations in employment dynamics across regions.
The PLFS, launched by the NSO in April 2017, aims to provide more frequent labour force data. It generates quarterly estimates for urban areas under the Current Weekly Status and annual estimates for both urban and rural areas under both CWS and PS+SS.
For the 2024 calendar year estimates, data was collected from 12,749 First Stage Units (FSUs), including 6,982 villages and 5,767 urban blocks. A total of 1,01,957 households were surveyed — 55,846 in rural areas and 46,111 in urban areas — covering 4,15,549 individuals (2,40,492 in rural areas and 1,75,057 in urban areas).

Title: Russia says bombing Iran will not work after Trump threats
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:42:07 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday the world was getting tired of endless threats against Iran and that bombing the Islamic Republic would not bring peace, cautioning that Tehran was already taking preventative measures.
Iran is approaching weekend talks with the United States over its nuclear programme warily, with little confidence in progress and deep suspicions about U.S. intentions, Iranian officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
The talks were announced on Monday by U.S. President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House in January and has repeatedly threatened Washington’s decades-long foe Iran with military action if it does not agree to a deal.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was aware of the “quite harsh rhetoric” and that Tehran was taking preventative measures, and suggested the focus should be contacts rather than confrontation.
“Indeed, the world is growing tired of the endless threats against Iran,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said when asked by Reuters to clarify Russia’s approach. “There is a growing understanding that bombing cannot pave the way to peace.”
Iran’s nuclear programme, which began in the 1950s with support from then-ally the United States, has long been the subject of dispute between world powers and Iran, whose 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into one of the biggest foes of Washington.
The U.S., Israel and some European powers say Iran is covertly trying to develop a nuclear weapon, an assertion denied by Tehran which has in recent years built a partnership with Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power.
While Moscow has bought weapons from Iran for the war in Ukraine and signed a 20-year strategic partnership deal with Tehran earlier this year, their relationship has been deeply troubled at times since the 16th century when Muscovy officially established relations with the Persian Empire.
Iranian officials say that Moscow often talks tough but is wary of getting dragged into a major war in the Middle East. The partnership deal signed between Iran and Russia did not include a mutual defence clause.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept on good terms with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, especially since both Russia and Iran are cast as enemies by the West. But Moscow is keen not to trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
Russia, Zakharova said, wants “effective negotiable solutions” that would both reduce Western suspicions about Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and restore trust while ensuring a balance of interests – and avoid a crisis.
The United States during Donald Trump’s first presidency unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal that limited Iran’s nuclear work and allowed for more inspections and a loosening of sanctions against it.
The U.S. withdrawal prompted Iran to scrap and then massively breach the deal’s limits on uranium enrichment, widely seen as a key pathway to developing material for nuclear bombs.
“Tehran cannot be held responsible for the consequences of the illegal actions of those who, through their shortsightedness and erroneous forecasting, undermined agreements,” Zakharova said.

Title: India aims to finalise trade deal with US by fall 2025: EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:31:40 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday said that India is working towards finalizing a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States by the fall of 2025 — making it the only country to have reached such an understanding with the US under President Donald Trump’s second term.
Speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit in New Delhi, Jaishankar said the two nations had agreed early on to constructively engage on trade issues and aim for a comprehensive agreement. “What we agreed to do was to try to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement by the fall of this year,” he said, referring to ongoing discussions that followed the Modi-Trump summit in Washington, D.C.
India is currently facing 27% tariffs under the US’s reciprocal tariff regime. Jaishankar noted that the trade deal is intended to address such issues and ensure a strategic path forward. “Our strategy has a goal — to deal with the situation by concluding a BTA,” he said, adding that a trade deal has long been India’s objective.
The two countries have also set a target to expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, expert-level discussions under the BTA framework will begin virtually in the coming weeks, paving the way for in-person negotiations.

Title: OpenAI countersues Elon Musk, claims harassment
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 07:11:26 +0000
Content: OpenAI countersued Elon Musk on Wednesday, citing a pattern of harassment by Musk and asking a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the future structure of the firm that helped launch the AI revolution.
Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case. In order for OpenAI to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year.
“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,” the company wrote in a filing in Musk’s existing lawsuit against OpenAI in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
OpenAI asked the judge to stop Musk from any further attacks, as well as be “held responsible for the damage he has already caused.”
The two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year.
Musk’s legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a post on X, the social media platform which Musk owns, OpenAI said: “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit.”
Musk’s xAI last month acquired X in a deal that values the social media company at $33 billion and allows the value of his artificial intelligence firm to be shared with co-investors in X.
Last year, Musk, who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla TSLA.O, sued OpenAI and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission — to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. Musk did not respond to a request for comment on the OpenAI filing.
OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations, while Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor.
At stake in the lawsuit is the ChatGPT maker’s transition to a for-profit model, which the startup says is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race.
Altman, who has said OpenAI is not for sale, rejected a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid earlier this year from a Musk-led consortium with a “no thank you.”

Title: ASEAN bloc seeks dialogue with US on tariffs but won’t retaliate
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:53:55 +0000
Content: Southeast Asian countries are pressing for dialogue with the United States on trade tariffs and will not impose retaliatory measures, economic ministers of the regional bloc ASEAN said on Thursday.
Before a 90-day pause was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on the implementation of U.S. tariffs, six of nine Southeast Asian countries targeted by the U.S. administration were slapped with much bigger-than-expected tariffs of between 32% and 49%.
By comparison, the level for the European Union was 20%, Japan’s was 24% and India’s 27%.
“We express our common intention to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with the U.S. to address trade-related concerns. Open communication and collaboration will be crucial to ensuring a balanced and sustainable relationship,” the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ economic ministers said in a statement, which expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact.
Following a meeting on Thursday, the ministers said they reaffirmed their support for a predictable, fair, and rules-based multilateral trading system.
The 10-member ASEAN is collectively the world’s fifth-biggest economy. Its members are heavily reliant on exports as a driver of growth.

Title: India’s exports surge to record $820 billion in 2024-25 despite global challenges
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:32:57 +0000
Content: India’s goods and services exports have crossed a record $820 billion in financial year 2024-25, which represents a close to 6 per cent increase over the corresponding figure of $778 billion for the previous financial year, despite the economic uncertainties in global markets, according to data compiled by the Commerce Ministry.
The figures were revealed at a meeting held by Commerce and Industry Minister (CIM) Piyush Goyal with the Export Promotion Councils and industry bodies here to discuss the emerging trade scenario.
The minister complimented the exporters for the all-time high achievement in exports in spite of multiple headwinds, including the Red Sea crisis, Israel-Hamas conflict spilling over to the Gulf region, continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and slow growth in some developed economies. The Minister lauded the exporters for their resilience and efforts.
During the meeting, CIM Goyal also apprised the exporters regarding ongoing discussions with the US for a mutually beneficial multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). The talks were kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was one of the first global leaders to agree on the BTA in his meeting with President Trump in February 2025.
The minister assured the exporters that the government will work to provide a conducive environment to enable them to successfully navigate the recent changes in the global trade environment.
He said the country is working in a proactive manner and exploring solutions which are in the best interest of the nation. The team working on BTA is exploring the right mix and the right balance, and he exhorted the exporters not to panic and look at the silver lining in the present scenario. He assured that the team is working with speed but not in undue haste to ensure the right outcome for the country.
Goyal said that different countries are approaching tariff imposition differently. However, as far as India is concerned, there is a potential for an increase in manufacturing and, creation of additional jobs because it can attract big players in the global supply chain as India has been able to establish itself as a trusted and reliable partner and with a predictable business-friendly destination.
Various Export Promotion Councils, representing a wide array of sectors, presented their views and outlook in light of the emerging challenges in global trade and requested the government to take proactive measures to support the export industry in these challenging times.
The meeting was attended by Export Promotion Councils, Industry bodies and officials from Commerce and line ministries.

Title: Delhi govt to begin distribution of Ayushman Bharat cards today
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:29:35 +0000
Content: The Delhi government is set to commence the distribution of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) health cards to residents of the national capital starting Thursday, following their registration under the scheme.
The health cards will be distributed to the beneficiaries at 3 p.m. at Plenary Hall in Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan.
The PM-JAY, launched in 2018, aims to alleviate the financial burden of healthcare on economically vulnerable families across India.
With the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Health Authority (NHA) of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Department of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the Government of NCT of Delhi, the national capital has officially become the 35th state or union territory to implement the scheme.
West Bengal now remains the only state yet to adopt PM-JAY.
Following the agreement, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta announced a major boost to the initiative by declaring an additional health cover of Rs 5 lakh to be provided by the state government, over and above the Rs 5 lakh coverage under the central scheme.
“Around 6.54 lakh families in Delhi will now be able to reap benefits from AB PM-JAY, with the card distribution for the scheme to be initiated from 10th April 2025 onwards,” said CM Gupta.
Delhi Health Minister Pankaj Singh, speaking to IANS on Wednesday, said that approximately 2.60 lakh residents have already been enrolled as beneficiaries in the first phase and will receive their Ayushman Health cards over the next 40 to 42 days.
“About 400-500 people will get Ayushman Bharat card on Day 1,” he stated. He also criticised the previous AAP-led administration for blocking the scheme, which he said was driven by “myopic political interests” and had deprived the people of Delhi of their rightful benefits.
“The previous government had blocked the Central healthcare scheme for its myopic political interests. The people of Delhi remained deprived of the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, but now, they will be entitled to receive all benefits, as any other citizen of the country,” Singh said.
He further noted that a transparent and efficient system has been put in place to ensure hassle-free registration, timely fund disbursal, and prevention of interference by middlemen.
“As soon as a beneficiary gets himself or herself registered, their details will be updated on the portal, and they will also receive a message on their mobile phones,” the Health Minister added.
The implementation of PM-JAY in Delhi marks a significant step toward strengthening healthcare access for low-income families in the capital and integrating them into the country’s largest government-sponsored health protection scheme.

Title: India and UK reaffirm free trade agreement, support supply chains
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:35:37 +0000
Content: Amid the changing world trade order, India and the UK have reaffirmed their commitment to furthering the bilateral relations between the two nations, including continuing negotiations at pace towards a mutually beneficial Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).
This was the key outcome of the ‘13th Economic and Financial Dialogue’ in London, co-chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, UK.
“The UK side was pleased to update on its forthcoming Industrial Strategy, where partnership can support the Industrial Strategy’s priority growth-driving sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and life sciences, where UK expertise and research capability can complement India’s emerging role as a global manufacturing hub, as well as in clean energy, professional and business services, financial services, the creative industries, and defence to support jobs and economic growth,” according too a join statement issued after the event.
Both sides look forward to the signing of the ‘India-UK Defence Industrial Roadmap’ to strengthen ties between industrial sectors and support supply chains.
India and the UK also welcomed the financial services trade over recent years and commit to work together to grow this further.
“The Financial Markets Dialogue (FMD) held in GIFT City IFSC, India, in December 2024, provided an opportunity to deepen our cooperation across banking, insurance, pensions, capital markets, and sustainable finance, and our teams will meet for the next FMD in London later this year,” according to the joint statement.
The UK welcomed the approval granted to insurance companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas and the proposal under consideration to enable pension companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas.
Both sides noted the role that UK bond markets can play in supporting capital-raising for Indian corporates, including through rupee-denominated Masala Bonds, and agree to work together to boost opportunities and create supportive policy framework for expanding this further.
They also discussed the potential for greater internationalisation of the Indian rupee, welcomed India permitting the opening of rupee accounts in overseas jurisdictions, and agreed to explore the role that London as a global financial centre and hub for foreign exchange can play in supporting the internationalisation of India’s currency.
“We agreed that the UK asset management sector can complement the UK-India Infrastructure Financing Bridge and support increasing opportunities for Indian investors to access global funds. Both sides agree to work together on a supportive policy framework and to use the next Financial Markets Dialogue to discuss this further,” according to the joint statement.
The UK and India recognised the importance of transition finance for mobilising capital to support sustainable development. Both sides welcomed each other’s work on this issue, including the UK government-commissioned Transition Finance Market Review.
“We have a shared ambition to ensure economic stability, increase investment, and reform our economies to drive growth and prosperity across both our countries. We celebrate our strong economic partnership, with bilateral trade valued at over 40 billion pounds and significant foreign direct investment stocks in both directions,” said the statement.

Title: Trump pauses tariffs on countries like India that did not hit back
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:28:21 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs for trading partner countries that have not retaliated with higher levies on American goods — such as India — and further hiked the levy on China to 125 per cent for hitting back.
India has not retaliated to the 26 per cent levy by Trump and has engaged the administration in negotiations, like nearly 70 other countries. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday discussed “early conclusion” of a bilateral trade agreement.
The pause and the additional tariff on China came after Beijing hit back to Trump’s second round of additional 50 per cent hike — over the 34 per cent announced earlier, which had taken the total levies to 104 per cent. China retaliated with additional tariffs taking up its levy on imports from America to 84 per cent.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 per cent, effective immediately,” President Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10 per cent, also effective immediately,” he said further.
It was not immediately clear if goods from these countries will be tariffed at the lowered rate of 10 per cent during this pause period of 90 days or they will not be charged the rate originally announced by the president.
US markets have been in a turmoil since the reciprocal rates went into effect and calls had emerged from some key Wall Street influencers such as Bill Ackman for a 90-day pause.
Trump has also faced some push-back to the tariff from a key adviser, Elon Musk who has criticized them and engaged in a public spat with Peter Navarro, a key trade adviser to the President.

Title: Bhagwan Mahavir’s ideals give strength to countless people, says PM Modi
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:19:10 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his greetings to the nation on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, saying Bhagwan Mahavir’s ideals give strength to countless people worldwide. 
Commemorating the birth of Lord Mahavira, the 24th and final Tīrthankara of Jainism, PM Modi said his teachings have been beautifully preserved and popularised by the Jain community.
In a post on his X handle, PM Modi said, “We all bow to Bhagwan Mahavir, who always emphasised on non-violence, truth and compassion. His ideals give strength to countless people all around the world. His teachings have been beautifully preserved and popularised by the Jain community. Inspired by Bhagwan Mahavir, they have excelled in different walks of life and contributed to societal well-being.”
PM Modi highlighted his government’s efforts in preserving heritage. He further said, “Our Government will always work to fulfil the vision of Bhagwan Mahavir. Last year, we conferred the status of Classical Language on Prakrit, a decision which received a lot of appreciation.”
This year marks the 2623rd birth anniversary of the revered spiritual leader, celebrated with devotion and grandeur across India. Mahavir Jayanti, one of the most significant religious festivals in Jainism, is observed on the 13th day of the waxing moon in the Chaitra month, as per the Jain calendar. According to religious texts, Mahavira was born in 599 B.C. in Kundalagrama, near present-day Patna, Bihar.
On Wednesday, PM Modi participated in the Navkar Mahamantra Divas at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan and chanted the ‘Navkar Mahamantra‘ with people from more than 108 countries.
He said it is not just a mantra but the centre of faith. He added that the Mahamantra is the key to life and its significance is not just spiritual. He added that it shows the path to everyone from self to society and presents a journey to the people to the world from within.
The Prime Minister also listed nine resolutions one should take on the Navkar Mahamantra Divas.
In a symbolic gesture of humility and reverence, PM Modi attended the Navkar Mahamantra programme on Wednesday without wearing footwear and chose to sit among the public instead of occupying the dais.

Title: CPEC Projects Stagnate: Lost Momentum and Lingering Questions
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:44:38 +0000
Content: The daring hijack of the Jaffar Express in March 2025 by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has once again brought the region’s resentments into sharp focus. The assault, which claimed at least 90 Pakistani soldiers’ lives and saw around 450 passengers taken hostage, highlights the BLA’s commitment to freeing Balochistan from what they view as systematic exploitation by Pakistan. Years of alleged human rights abuses, forced disappearances and economic marginalisation have fuelled widespread disillusionment among Baloch communities, who see foreign-led projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a further encroachment on their land.
Balochistan itself is a paradox: it is Pakistan’s largest province, home to immense natural wealth, yet it has the lowest literacy rate and ranks second worst in multi-dimensional poverty among the country’s four provinces, according to the UNDP. Local sentiment holds that if the province was historically exploited by Pakistan’s authorities, it is now jointly exploited by Pakistan and China. The BLA, along with other separatist groups, has repeatedly targeted Chinese nationals and infrastructure not only in Balochistan but across Pakistan, viewing these ventures as an extension of the same neglect that has dominated the province’s past.
CPEC, part of China’s sweeping Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), was launched in 2015 with a purported budget of USD 62 billion. It aimed to develop a 3,000-kilometre network of roads, railways and pipelines to link Gwadar and Karachi ports to China’s Xinjiang region. Behind the grand rhetoric, however, progress appears anything but smooth. Several major projects remain stalled after their official approvals, as reported by Dawn and other credible international publications. The slow pace of development has even prompted Pakistan’s Planning Minister, Ahsan Iqbal, to call upon economic authorities in Pakistan and its diplomatic missions in China to reassess delayed ventures and engage with concerned Chinese authorities, a clear sign of rising frustration within Pakistan’s corridors of power.
Yet what of the so-called “Phase II” of CPEC? In May 2024, at the 13th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, Islamabad requested over USD 17 billion in loans from China to revive key infrastructure schemes. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif followed up with a visit to China in June, anticipating major new investments. What materialised was merely a 32-point joint statement offering vague commitments to upgrade CPEC into multiple “corridors”—growth, livelihood, innovation, green and open. The only tangible development was a staged USD 6.7-billion loan for upgrading the Main-Line-1 (ML-1) railway from Karachi to Peshawar, which, in fact, was not a new project but a rehashed plan to modernise a colonial-era track. Plans to upgrade a section of the Karakoram Highway also failed to yield fresh Chinese funding.
CPEC’s first phase had already exposed serious shortcomings: of the USD 28 billion earmarked for infrastructure and energy, many ventures remain stuck on paper. Fourteen power projects were reportedly completed, two are under construction and five appear nowhere near implementation. Six transport projects did take off, but another thirteen are languishing. Out of nine proposed Special Economic Zones (SEZs), only four are currently under construction. Job creation targets also have not come close to the original promise: of the more than two million positions envisioned, barely 250,000 have materialised, according to official figures.
A further complication arises from India’s staunch opposition to the Belt and Road Initiative in Pakistan. India maintains that CPEC violates its sovereignty and territorial integrity because several of its projects pass through Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, which India regards as an integral part of its territory. 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan Liberation Army’s escalating attacks reveal local hostility towards both federal authorities and international investors. The recent hijacking was not simply about seizing a train; it was a statement that Balochistan’s grievances will not be easily quelled by high-level announcements or carefully worded joint statements. Whether future discussions will actually address the socio-political fault lines that have plagued Balochistan for decades remains uncertain.
One thing, however, is abundantly clear: as long as local disenchantment collides with glacial progress and geopolitical disputes, CPEC risks being remembered less for the prosperity it promised and more for the turbulence it continues to generate. Is this the fate of a once-touted “game changer”, an unfulfilled vision overshadowed by violence, delays and deepening mistrust? The answer seems to lie in plain sight

Title: Bank of India, UCO Bank cut lending rates after RBI repo rate slash
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:27:53 +0000
Content: Hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, two major public sector banks — Bank of India and UCO Bank — on Wednesday reduced their lending rates, bringing relief to both existing and new borrowers.
The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra, lowered the key policy rate from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent earlier in the day.
This marks the second consecutive rate cut under Malhotra’s leadership and is aimed at supporting economic growth amid rising global challenges, including a steep 26 per cent tariff imposed by the US on Indian exports.
Responding swiftly to the RBI’s move, Bank of India reduced its Repo-Based Lending Rate (RBLR) to 8.85 per cent, down from 9.10 per cent. The new rate came into effect immediately on April 9.
Similarly, UCO Bank also cut its repo-linked lending rate to 8.8 per cent, with the revised rate becoming effective from Thursday.
Both banks announced the rate cuts through separate regulatory filings, citing the RBI’s latest policy decision as the reason for the revision.
The move is expected to make loans cheaper, encouraging increased borrowing by both individuals and businesses. Experts noted that other banks are likely to follow suit in the coming days, passing on the benefits of the RBI’s rate cut to customers across the country.
While announcing the decision, Governor Malhotra also revealed a shift in the RBI’s policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative,’ indicating the central bank’s willingness to support growth through a more relaxed monetary policy.
“Our stance provides policy rate guidance without any direct guidance on liquidity management,” he said.
The RBI has already infused over $80 billion into the banking system in the past two months, along with a rate cut in February — the first such move in five years.

Title: Over 600 Uzbek students learning Hindi, says Om Birla
Publication Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:23:44 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, during his visit to Uzbekistan, appreciated the deep interest shown by Uzbek scholars in Indian languages and culture. Interacting with Indologists, teachers, and students at the Lal Bahadur Shastri School in Tashkent, Birla highlighted the scholars’ contributions in strengthening the historic ties between India and Uzbekistan through their literary, academic, and research work in Indian languages such as Hindi and Sanskrit.
According to an official statement, Birla said that over 600 students at the school are learning Hindi and have developed a strong appreciation for Indian linguistic and cultural heritage. He also mentioned that Uzbek scholars have expressed their knowledge of Indian languages in their literary works and many Indologists have received prestigious awards for their contributions, including recognition from India and other nations.
Referring to collaborative educational efforts, Birla highlighted the creation of an Uzbek-Hindi dictionary by teachers in Uzbekistan, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He underlined the potential for deeper mutual engagement between India and Uzbekistan in areas such as the environment, language, culture, and education. Recalling Prime Minister Modi’s earlier visit to Uzbekistan, Birla noted the widespread popularity of Indian films and music in the country and referenced Uzbek Radio’s 50 years of Hindi-language broadcasting in 2012.
The Speaker emphasized that both India and Uzbekistan, despite having different historical trajectories, are now on paths of development and progress. He also recalled that India was among the first countries to recognize Uzbekistan’s independence and expressed hope that both nations would continue to work together to promote global values such as peace, stability, and human development.
Birla said that India and Uzbekistan have developed strong bilateral cooperation across various sectors, including politics, trade, investment, defense, security, counter-terrorism, science and technology, nuclear energy, space, and information technology. He added that the cultural and educational ties between the two nations further reinforce their relationship.
During his visit to Uzbekistan as the head of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation for the 150th Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Assembly, Birla also held bilateral talks with Nurdinjon Ismoilov, Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In the official statement, Birla highlighted the transparency and effectiveness of India’s electoral management system, noting that the successful conduct of a large-scale electoral process reflects the system’s efficiency. He further said that India’s democratic development since independence has been driven by the active participation of its citizens.

Title: Brazil to hold preliminary talks ahead of COP30 climate summit
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:53:19 +0000
Content: Brazil has scheduled the preliminary round of negotiations that help countries prepare for the global climate summit, known as COP30, for October, roughly a month before the main event starts at the Amazonian city of Belem, the government’s special secretary for COP30, Valter Correia da Silva, told Reuters on Wednesday.
The early negotiations, called the Pre-COP, will take place in Brasilia, the nation’s capital, on Oct. 14 and 15, he said. Despite being a much smaller event, with only the main negotiators, the Pre-COP has gained importance this year because countries are struggling to deliver their new pledges to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
So far, more than 90% of countries have failed to meet the February deadline for submitting their new NDCs, as the world has turned its attention to wars and trade disputes, and financing for climate projects has dried up. The United Nations decided to extend the deadline to September.
“The pre-COP this year can help make Belem a success or a failure. Brazil’s intention is for the talks there to lead to effective negotiations a month later,” a source who follows the issue told Reuters.

Title: Russia and US hold second round of talks in Istanbul
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:42:00 +0000
Content: Russia and the United States on Thursday began the second round of consultations in Istanbul, focusing on the normalisation of operation of their respective embassies.
The Russian delegation is led by Moscow’s Ambassador to Washington, Alexander Darchiev while the US delegation is headed by Sonata Coulter, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.
The consultations between the two delegations, taking place at the Russian Consulate General in Istanbul, may last for several hours, reports indicated.
“We should say that the substantial part of the talks is already behind us, but on the whole, the negotiations may take four or five hours,” Russia’s state-run news agency TASS quoted a source as saying.
According to Darchiev, Russia is set for a serious discussion with the United States regarding the return of diplomatic property wrongfully confiscated by Washington.
The agenda also includes issues of diplomats’ movements around the host country, visa and financial restrictions.
“This is about addressing the ‘toxic legacy’ of the previous US administration, which imposed severe restrictions on the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in the United States,” Darchiev said.
The previous round of Russia-US consultations was held at the US Consul General’s residence in Istanbul on February 27. That meeting lasted over six hours.
After the conclusion of the first round of meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow and Washington have agreed on joint measures aimed at ensuring the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions.
The ministry further added that the two sides discussed ways to resolve “numerous irritants” in bilateral relations.
“Joint steps were agreed upon to ensure the unimpeded financing of the activities of the diplomatic missions of Russia and the United States on a reciprocal basis, and to create the appropriate conditions for diplomats to perform their official duties,” it stated.
The two sides agreed on joint steps to ensure the unhindered financing of their diplomatic missions on a reciprocal basis and to create suitable conditions for diplomats to carry out their official duties.
Moscow also said that it raised the issue of its diplomatic property in the US, specifically six real estate properties that were “illegally seized” between 2016 and 2018.
Additionally, Russia proposed that the US consider restoring direct flights and stressed the need for tangible results that would help improve bilateral relations in the interests of both nations, it said.
Moscow and Washington have agreed to continue their diplomatic contacts, the statement detailed.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that officials in Istanbul “agreed on joint steps to ensure the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions in both countries and to create appropriate conditions for diplomats to carry out their duties effectively”.
Over the past decade, Russia and the US have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats, significantly reducing their embassy staffing levels.

Title: India defies global office rental slump, clocks double-digit growth: Report
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:38:10 +0000
Content: While global office rental markets continue to face headwinds, India’s office sector is bucking the trend with sustained growth in office leasing and rentals, according to a report by real estate firm Vestian released on Thursday.
According to the report, India reported the highest ever leasing of 70.7 Mn sq ft in 2024, registering an annual increase of 16 per cent. Sub-dollar rentals across India’s top seven cities fuelled this momentum, making the country a key outlier in an otherwise subdued global landscape.
In stark contrast to major global cities like New York, Seattle, Boston, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, which have witnessed rental declines over the last five years, India witnessed a steady upward movement.
Notably, while some Western markets such as London and Miami posted increases of 31 per cent and 53 per cent respectively, the broader global sentiment reflects a slowdown due to rising vacancy rates and rapidly changing workplace strategies, the report states.
India’s office market is expected to maintain this growth pattern in the future, majorly driven by strong leasing momentum, favourable demographics, and strategic infrastructure development, it added.
Shrinivas Rao, CEO of Vestian, said that the decline in office space rents in the global market is influenced by the emergence of technologies like generative AI, as well as changes in office space utilisation strategies.
These factors contribute to the uncertainties faced by the office sector.
The combination of reduced demand, along with businesses downsizing or relocating, has led to higher vacancy rates globally, which in turn puts downward pressure on rents.
Furthermore, in 2024 alone, rental rates in Indian cities surged between 3.8 per cent and 8.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
India remains resilient, driven by strong demand from the IT sector and Global Capability Centres (GCCs). While global cities continue to see demand for premium office spaces, India’s affordability and expansion-driven leasing set it apart. As a cost-effective hub, India is poised for steady growth.
Rao said that the influx of new businesses and company expansions has led to significant demand for office spaces in India.
Global firms are aggressively seeking office space in the country due to robust economic growth compared to other major economies of the world, rich demographic dividend, large consumer base, rapid urbanisation, and the easy availability of skilled workforce at competitive rates, particularly in technology and finance. This demand is driving the need for high-quality office spaces.
Prime commercial hubs like Mumbai’s BKC and Delhi’s Central Business District i.e. Connaught Place and adjoining areas, command high rentals, with average rent reaching $3-4 per sq ft a month.
Strong economic activities, upcoming mega infrastructure projects, and the expansion of GCCs continue to drive rental appreciation across the major cities of India, the Vestian report added.

Title: Inclusion of mixed team event at LA28 enhances Olympic table tennis: ITTF
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:34:33 +0000
Content: The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has said the introduction of the mixed team event for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games “significantly enhances the Olympic table tennis program.”
The decision was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the men’s and women’s doubles events are set to replace the men’s and women’s team events. The number of table tennis events at LA28 will be increased to six – men’s and women’s singles, men’s and women’s doubles, mixed doubles, and mixed team.
“This historic development significantly enhances the Olympic table tennis program,” read a statement from the ITTF.
The mixed team event was first launched at the ITTF Mixed Team World Cup held in Chengdu, China, in December 2023. For the ITTF, this innovative format brings men’s and women’s players together in combined teams, highlighting the sport’s strong commitment to gender equality, integration, and teamwork.
“Its Olympic debut at LA28 promises to captivate fans worldwide, delivering an inclusive, dynamic, and strategically rich competition reflective of the sport’s global appeal,” the ITTF noted.
It also marks the return of the men’s and women’s doubles events to the Olympic table tennis program for the first time since Beijing 2008, where they were replaced by team events, reports Xinhua.
Table tennis first appeared in the Olympic Games at Seoul 1988 with four events: men’s and women’s singles, and men’s and women’s doubles. Until Rio 2016, Olympic table tennis events remained at four. At Tokyo 2020, mixed doubles made its Olympic debut, further advancing gender equality within the sport.
“Now, the sport will feature six events at the next Olympic Games in Los Angeles – a remarkable rise that highlights table tennis’s growing stature on the Olympic stage,” the ITTF remarked.
ITTF president Petra Sorling said the decision by the IOC Executive Board “builds on the incredible momentum table tennis is experiencing and is a testament to its growing universal appeal.”
“After the resounding success of table tennis at Paris 2024, the introduction of the mixed team event in Los Angeles marks another historic milestone, fully aligned with our vision of a dynamic, inclusive future for our sport,” she added.

Title: OpenAI countersues Elon Musk, claims harassment
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 07:11:26 +0000
Content: OpenAI countersued Elon Musk on Wednesday, citing a pattern of harassment by Musk and asking a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the future structure of the firm that helped launch the AI revolution.
Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case. In order for OpenAI to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year.
“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,” the company wrote in a filing in Musk’s existing lawsuit against OpenAI in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
OpenAI asked the judge to stop Musk from any further attacks, as well as be “held responsible for the damage he has already caused.”
The two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year.
Musk’s legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a post on X, the social media platform which Musk owns, OpenAI said: “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit.”
Musk’s xAI last month acquired X in a deal that values the social media company at $33 billion and allows the value of his artificial intelligence firm to be shared with co-investors in X.
Last year, Musk, who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla TSLA.O, sued OpenAI and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission — to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. Musk did not respond to a request for comment on the OpenAI filing.
OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations, while Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor.
At stake in the lawsuit is the ChatGPT maker’s transition to a for-profit model, which the startup says is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race.
Altman, who has said OpenAI is not for sale, rejected a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid earlier this year from a Musk-led consortium with a “no thank you.”

Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:53:55 +0000
Content: Southeast Asian countries are pressing for dialogue with the United States on trade tariffs and will not impose retaliatory measures, economic ministers of the regional bloc ASEAN said on Thursday.
Before a 90-day pause was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on the implementation of U.S. tariffs, six of nine Southeast Asian countries targeted by the U.S. administration were slapped with much bigger-than-expected tariffs of between 32% and 49%.
By comparison, the level for the European Union was 20%, Japan’s was 24% and India’s 27%.
“We express our common intention to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with the U.S. to address trade-related concerns. Open communication and collaboration will be crucial to ensuring a balanced and sustainable relationship,” the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ economic ministers said in a statement, which expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact.
Following a meeting on Thursday, the ministers said they reaffirmed their support for a predictable, fair, and rules-based multilateral trading system.
The 10-member ASEAN is collectively the world’s fifth-biggest economy. Its members are heavily reliant on exports as a driver of growth.

Title: India’s exports surge to record $820 billion in 2024-25 despite global challenges
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:32:57 +0000
Content: India’s goods and services exports have crossed a record $820 billion in financial year 2024-25, which represents a close to 6 per cent increase over the corresponding figure of $778 billion for the previous financial year, despite the economic uncertainties in global markets, according to data compiled by the Commerce Ministry.
The figures were revealed at a meeting held by Commerce and Industry Minister (CIM) Piyush Goyal with the Export Promotion Councils and industry bodies here to discuss the emerging trade scenario.
The minister complimented the exporters for the all-time high achievement in exports in spite of multiple headwinds, including the Red Sea crisis, Israel-Hamas conflict spilling over to the Gulf region, continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and slow growth in some developed economies. The Minister lauded the exporters for their resilience and efforts.
During the meeting, CIM Goyal also apprised the exporters regarding ongoing discussions with the US for a mutually beneficial multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). The talks were kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was one of the first global leaders to agree on the BTA in his meeting with President Trump in February 2025.
The minister assured the exporters that the government will work to provide a conducive environment to enable them to successfully navigate the recent changes in the global trade environment.
He said the country is working in a proactive manner and exploring solutions which are in the best interest of the nation. The team working on BTA is exploring the right mix and the right balance, and he exhorted the exporters not to panic and look at the silver lining in the present scenario. He assured that the team is working with speed but not in undue haste to ensure the right outcome for the country.
Goyal said that different countries are approaching tariff imposition differently. However, as far as India is concerned, there is a potential for an increase in manufacturing and, creation of additional jobs because it can attract big players in the global supply chain as India has been able to establish itself as a trusted and reliable partner and with a predictable business-friendly destination.
Various Export Promotion Councils, representing a wide array of sectors, presented their views and outlook in light of the emerging challenges in global trade and requested the government to take proactive measures to support the export industry in these challenging times.
The meeting was attended by Export Promotion Councils, Industry bodies and officials from Commerce and line ministries.

Title: Delhi govt to begin distribution of Ayushman Bharat cards today
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:29:35 +0000
Content: The Delhi government is set to commence the distribution of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) health cards to residents of the national capital starting Thursday, following their registration under the scheme.
The health cards will be distributed to the beneficiaries at 3 p.m. at Plenary Hall in Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan.
The PM-JAY, launched in 2018, aims to alleviate the financial burden of healthcare on economically vulnerable families across India.
With the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Health Authority (NHA) of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Department of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the Government of NCT of Delhi, the national capital has officially become the 35th state or union territory to implement the scheme.
West Bengal now remains the only state yet to adopt PM-JAY.
Following the agreement, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta announced a major boost to the initiative by declaring an additional health cover of Rs 5 lakh to be provided by the state government, over and above the Rs 5 lakh coverage under the central scheme.
“Around 6.54 lakh families in Delhi will now be able to reap benefits from AB PM-JAY, with the card distribution for the scheme to be initiated from 10th April 2025 onwards,” said CM Gupta.
Delhi Health Minister Pankaj Singh, speaking to IANS on Wednesday, said that approximately 2.60 lakh residents have already been enrolled as beneficiaries in the first phase and will receive their Ayushman Health cards over the next 40 to 42 days.
“About 400-500 people will get Ayushman Bharat card on Day 1,” he stated. He also criticised the previous AAP-led administration for blocking the scheme, which he said was driven by “myopic political interests” and had deprived the people of Delhi of their rightful benefits.
“The previous government had blocked the Central healthcare scheme for its myopic political interests. The people of Delhi remained deprived of the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, but now, they will be entitled to receive all benefits, as any other citizen of the country,” Singh said.
He further noted that a transparent and efficient system has been put in place to ensure hassle-free registration, timely fund disbursal, and prevention of interference by middlemen.
“As soon as a beneficiary gets himself or herself registered, their details will be updated on the portal, and they will also receive a message on their mobile phones,” the Health Minister added.
The implementation of PM-JAY in Delhi marks a significant step toward strengthening healthcare access for low-income families in the capital and integrating them into the country’s largest government-sponsored health protection scheme.

Title: India and UK reaffirm free trade agreement, support supply chains
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:35:37 +0000
Content: Amid the changing world trade order, India and the UK have reaffirmed their commitment to furthering the bilateral relations between the two nations, including continuing negotiations at pace towards a mutually beneficial Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).
This was the key outcome of the ‘13th Economic and Financial Dialogue’ in London, co-chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, UK.
“The UK side was pleased to update on its forthcoming Industrial Strategy, where partnership can support the Industrial Strategy’s priority growth-driving sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and life sciences, where UK expertise and research capability can complement India’s emerging role as a global manufacturing hub, as well as in clean energy, professional and business services, financial services, the creative industries, and defence to support jobs and economic growth,” according too a join statement issued after the event.
Both sides look forward to the signing of the ‘India-UK Defence Industrial Roadmap’ to strengthen ties between industrial sectors and support supply chains.
India and the UK also welcomed the financial services trade over recent years and commit to work together to grow this further.
“The Financial Markets Dialogue (FMD) held in GIFT City IFSC, India, in December 2024, provided an opportunity to deepen our cooperation across banking, insurance, pensions, capital markets, and sustainable finance, and our teams will meet for the next FMD in London later this year,” according to the joint statement.
The UK welcomed the approval granted to insurance companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas and the proposal under consideration to enable pension companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas.
Both sides noted the role that UK bond markets can play in supporting capital-raising for Indian corporates, including through rupee-denominated Masala Bonds, and agree to work together to boost opportunities and create supportive policy framework for expanding this further.
They also discussed the potential for greater internationalisation of the Indian rupee, welcomed India permitting the opening of rupee accounts in overseas jurisdictions, and agreed to explore the role that London as a global financial centre and hub for foreign exchange can play in supporting the internationalisation of India’s currency.
“We agreed that the UK asset management sector can complement the UK-India Infrastructure Financing Bridge and support increasing opportunities for Indian investors to access global funds. Both sides agree to work together on a supportive policy framework and to use the next Financial Markets Dialogue to discuss this further,” according to the joint statement.
The UK and India recognised the importance of transition finance for mobilising capital to support sustainable development. Both sides welcomed each other’s work on this issue, including the UK government-commissioned Transition Finance Market Review.
“We have a shared ambition to ensure economic stability, increase investment, and reform our economies to drive growth and prosperity across both our countries. We celebrate our strong economic partnership, with bilateral trade valued at over 40 billion pounds and significant foreign direct investment stocks in both directions,” said the statement.

Title: Trump pauses tariffs on countries like India that did not hit back
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:28:21 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs for trading partner countries that have not retaliated with higher levies on American goods — such as India — and further hiked the levy on China to 125 per cent for hitting back.
India has not retaliated to the 26 per cent levy by Trump and has engaged the administration in negotiations, like nearly 70 other countries. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday discussed “early conclusion” of a bilateral trade agreement.
The pause and the additional tariff on China came after Beijing hit back to Trump’s second round of additional 50 per cent hike — over the 34 per cent announced earlier, which had taken the total levies to 104 per cent. China retaliated with additional tariffs taking up its levy on imports from America to 84 per cent.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 per cent, effective immediately,” President Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10 per cent, also effective immediately,” he said further.
It was not immediately clear if goods from these countries will be tariffed at the lowered rate of 10 per cent during this pause period of 90 days or they will not be charged the rate originally announced by the president.
US markets have been in a turmoil since the reciprocal rates went into effect and calls had emerged from some key Wall Street influencers such as Bill Ackman for a 90-day pause.
Trump has also faced some push-back to the tariff from a key adviser, Elon Musk who has criticized them and engaged in a public spat with Peter Navarro, a key trade adviser to the President.

Title: Brazil to hold preliminary talks ahead of COP30 climate summit
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:53:19 +0000
Content: Brazil has scheduled the preliminary round of negotiations that help countries prepare for the global climate summit, known as COP30, for October, roughly a month before the main event starts at the Amazonian city of Belem, the government’s special secretary for COP30, Valter Correia da Silva, told Reuters on Wednesday.
The early negotiations, called the Pre-COP, will take place in Brasilia, the nation’s capital, on Oct. 14 and 15, he said. Despite being a much smaller event, with only the main negotiators, the Pre-COP has gained importance this year because countries are struggling to deliver their new pledges to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
So far, more than 90% of countries have failed to meet the February deadline for submitting their new NDCs, as the world has turned its attention to wars and trade disputes, and financing for climate projects has dried up. The United Nations decided to extend the deadline to September.
“The pre-COP this year can help make Belem a success or a failure. Brazil’s intention is for the talks there to lead to effective negotiations a month later,” a source who follows the issue told Reuters.

Title: Russia and US hold second round of talks in Istanbul
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:42:00 +0000
Content: Russia and the United States on Thursday began the second round of consultations in Istanbul, focusing on the normalisation of operation of their respective embassies.
The Russian delegation is led by Moscow’s Ambassador to Washington, Alexander Darchiev while the US delegation is headed by Sonata Coulter, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.
The consultations between the two delegations, taking place at the Russian Consulate General in Istanbul, may last for several hours, reports indicated.
“We should say that the substantial part of the talks is already behind us, but on the whole, the negotiations may take four or five hours,” Russia’s state-run news agency TASS quoted a source as saying.
According to Darchiev, Russia is set for a serious discussion with the United States regarding the return of diplomatic property wrongfully confiscated by Washington.
The agenda also includes issues of diplomats’ movements around the host country, visa and financial restrictions.
“This is about addressing the ‘toxic legacy’ of the previous US administration, which imposed severe restrictions on the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in the United States,” Darchiev said.
The previous round of Russia-US consultations was held at the US Consul General’s residence in Istanbul on February 27. That meeting lasted over six hours.
After the conclusion of the first round of meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow and Washington have agreed on joint measures aimed at ensuring the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions.
The ministry further added that the two sides discussed ways to resolve “numerous irritants” in bilateral relations.
“Joint steps were agreed upon to ensure the unimpeded financing of the activities of the diplomatic missions of Russia and the United States on a reciprocal basis, and to create the appropriate conditions for diplomats to perform their official duties,” it stated.
The two sides agreed on joint steps to ensure the unhindered financing of their diplomatic missions on a reciprocal basis and to create suitable conditions for diplomats to carry out their official duties.
Moscow also said that it raised the issue of its diplomatic property in the US, specifically six real estate properties that were “illegally seized” between 2016 and 2018.
Additionally, Russia proposed that the US consider restoring direct flights and stressed the need for tangible results that would help improve bilateral relations in the interests of both nations, it said.
Moscow and Washington have agreed to continue their diplomatic contacts, the statement detailed.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that officials in Istanbul “agreed on joint steps to ensure the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions in both countries and to create appropriate conditions for diplomats to carry out their duties effectively”.
Over the past decade, Russia and the US have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats, significantly reducing their embassy staffing levels.

Title: India defies global office rental slump, clocks double-digit growth: Report
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 12:38:10 +0000
Content: While global office rental markets continue to face headwinds, India’s office sector is bucking the trend with sustained growth in office leasing and rentals, according to a report by real estate firm Vestian released on Thursday.
According to the report, India reported the highest ever leasing of 70.7 Mn sq ft in 2024, registering an annual increase of 16 per cent. Sub-dollar rentals across India’s top seven cities fuelled this momentum, making the country a key outlier in an otherwise subdued global landscape.
In stark contrast to major global cities like New York, Seattle, Boston, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, which have witnessed rental declines over the last five years, India witnessed a steady upward movement.
Notably, while some Western markets such as London and Miami posted increases of 31 per cent and 53 per cent respectively, the broader global sentiment reflects a slowdown due to rising vacancy rates and rapidly changing workplace strategies, the report states.
India’s office market is expected to maintain this growth pattern in the future, majorly driven by strong leasing momentum, favourable demographics, and strategic infrastructure development, it added.
Shrinivas Rao, CEO of Vestian, said that the decline in office space rents in the global market is influenced by the emergence of technologies like generative AI, as well as changes in office space utilisation strategies.
These factors contribute to the uncertainties faced by the office sector.
The combination of reduced demand, along with businesses downsizing or relocating, has led to higher vacancy rates globally, which in turn puts downward pressure on rents.
Furthermore, in 2024 alone, rental rates in Indian cities surged between 3.8 per cent and 8.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
India remains resilient, driven by strong demand from the IT sector and Global Capability Centres (GCCs). While global cities continue to see demand for premium office spaces, India’s affordability and expansion-driven leasing set it apart. As a cost-effective hub, India is poised for steady growth.

“We express our common intention to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with the U.S. to address trade-related concerns. Open communication and collaboration will be crucial to ensuring a balanced and sustainable relationship,” the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ economic ministers said in a statement, which expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact.
Following a meeting on Thursday, the ministers said they reaffirmed their support for a predictable, fair, and rules-based multilateral trading system.
The 10-member ASEAN is collectively the world’s fifth-biggest economy. Its members are heavily reliant on exports as a driver of growth.

Title: India’s exports surge to record $820 billion in 2024-25 despite global challenges
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:32:57 +0000
Content: India’s goods and services exports have crossed a record $820 billion in financial year 2024-25, which represents a close to 6 per cent increase over the corresponding figure of $778 billion for the previous financial year, despite the economic uncertainties in global markets, according to data compiled by the Commerce Ministry.
The figures were revealed at a meeting held by Commerce and Industry Minister (CIM) Piyush Goyal with the Export Promotion Councils and industry bodies here to discuss the emerging trade scenario.
The minister complimented the exporters for the all-time high achievement in exports in spite of multiple headwinds, including the Red Sea crisis, Israel-Hamas conflict spilling over to the Gulf region, continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and slow growth in some developed economies. The Minister lauded the exporters for their resilience and efforts.
During the meeting, CIM Goyal also apprised the exporters regarding ongoing discussions with the US for a mutually beneficial multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). The talks were kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was one of the first global leaders to agree on the BTA in his meeting with President Trump in February 2025.
The minister assured the exporters that the government will work to provide a conducive environment to enable them to successfully navigate the recent changes in the global trade environment.
He said the country is working in a proactive manner and exploring solutions which are in the best interest of the nation. The team working on BTA is exploring the right mix and the right balance, and he exhorted the exporters not to panic and look at the silver lining in the present scenario. He assured that the team is working with speed but not in undue haste to ensure the right outcome for the country.
Goyal said that different countries are approaching tariff imposition differently. However, as far as India is concerned, there is a potential for an increase in manufacturing and, creation of additional jobs because it can attract big players in the global supply chain as India has been able to establish itself as a trusted and reliable partner and with a predictable business-friendly destination.
Various Export Promotion Councils, representing a wide array of sectors, presented their views and outlook in light of the emerging challenges in global trade and requested the government to take proactive measures to support the export industry in these challenging times.
The meeting was attended by Export Promotion Councils, Industry bodies and officials from Commerce and line ministries.

Title: Delhi govt to begin distribution of Ayushman Bharat cards today
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:29:35 +0000
Content: The Delhi government is set to commence the distribution of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) health cards to residents of the national capital starting Thursday, following their registration under the scheme.
The health cards will be distributed to the beneficiaries at 3 p.m. at Plenary Hall in Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan.
The PM-JAY, launched in 2018, aims to alleviate the financial burden of healthcare on economically vulnerable families across India.
With the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the National Health Authority (NHA) of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Department of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the Government of NCT of Delhi, the national capital has officially become the 35th state or union territory to implement the scheme.
West Bengal now remains the only state yet to adopt PM-JAY.
Following the agreement, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta announced a major boost to the initiative by declaring an additional health cover of Rs 5 lakh to be provided by the state government, over and above the Rs 5 lakh coverage under the central scheme.
“Around 6.54 lakh families in Delhi will now be able to reap benefits from AB PM-JAY, with the card distribution for the scheme to be initiated from 10th April 2025 onwards,” said CM Gupta.
Delhi Health Minister Pankaj Singh, speaking to IANS on Wednesday, said that approximately 2.60 lakh residents have already been enrolled as beneficiaries in the first phase and will receive their Ayushman Health cards over the next 40 to 42 days.
“About 400-500 people will get Ayushman Bharat card on Day 1,” he stated. He also criticised the previous AAP-led administration for blocking the scheme, which he said was driven by “myopic political interests” and had deprived the people of Delhi of their rightful benefits.
“The previous government had blocked the Central healthcare scheme for its myopic political interests. The people of Delhi remained deprived of the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, but now, they will be entitled to receive all benefits, as any other citizen of the country,” Singh said.
He further noted that a transparent and efficient system has been put in place to ensure hassle-free registration, timely fund disbursal, and prevention of interference by middlemen.
“As soon as a beneficiary gets himself or herself registered, their details will be updated on the portal, and they will also receive a message on their mobile phones,” the Health Minister added.
The implementation of PM-JAY in Delhi marks a significant step toward strengthening healthcare access for low-income families in the capital and integrating them into the country’s largest government-sponsored health protection scheme.

Title: India and UK reaffirm free trade agreement, support supply chains
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:35:37 +0000
Content: Amid the changing world trade order, India and the UK have reaffirmed their commitment to furthering the bilateral relations between the two nations, including continuing negotiations at pace towards a mutually beneficial Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).
This was the key outcome of the ‘13th Economic and Financial Dialogue’ in London, co-chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, UK.
“The UK side was pleased to update on its forthcoming Industrial Strategy, where partnership can support the Industrial Strategy’s priority growth-driving sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and life sciences, where UK expertise and research capability can complement India’s emerging role as a global manufacturing hub, as well as in clean energy, professional and business services, financial services, the creative industries, and defence to support jobs and economic growth,” according too a join statement issued after the event.
Both sides look forward to the signing of the ‘India-UK Defence Industrial Roadmap’ to strengthen ties between industrial sectors and support supply chains.
India and the UK also welcomed the financial services trade over recent years and commit to work together to grow this further.
“The Financial Markets Dialogue (FMD) held in GIFT City IFSC, India, in December 2024, provided an opportunity to deepen our cooperation across banking, insurance, pensions, capital markets, and sustainable finance, and our teams will meet for the next FMD in London later this year,” according to the joint statement.
The UK welcomed the approval granted to insurance companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas and the proposal under consideration to enable pension companies in GIFT IFSC to invest overseas.
Both sides noted the role that UK bond markets can play in supporting capital-raising for Indian corporates, including through rupee-denominated Masala Bonds, and agree to work together to boost opportunities and create supportive policy framework for expanding this further.
They also discussed the potential for greater internationalisation of the Indian rupee, welcomed India permitting the opening of rupee accounts in overseas jurisdictions, and agreed to explore the role that London as a global financial centre and hub for foreign exchange can play in supporting the internationalisation of India’s currency.
“We agreed that the UK asset management sector can complement the UK-India Infrastructure Financing Bridge and support increasing opportunities for Indian investors to access global funds. Both sides agree to work together on a supportive policy framework and to use the next Financial Markets Dialogue to discuss this further,” according to the joint statement.
The UK and India recognised the importance of transition finance for mobilising capital to support sustainable development. Both sides welcomed each other’s work on this issue, including the UK government-commissioned Transition Finance Market Review.
“We have a shared ambition to ensure economic stability, increase investment, and reform our economies to drive growth and prosperity across both our countries. We celebrate our strong economic partnership, with bilateral trade valued at over 40 billion pounds and significant foreign direct investment stocks in both directions,” said the statement.

Title: Trump pauses tariffs on countries like India that did not hit back
Publication Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 04:28:21 +0000
Content: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs for trading partner countries that have not retaliated with higher levies on American goods — such as India — and further hiked the levy on China to 125 per cent for hitting back.
India has not retaliated to the 26 per cent levy by Trump and has engaged the administration in negotiations, like nearly 70 other countries. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday discussed “early conclusion” of a bilateral trade agreement.
The pause and the additional tariff on China came after Beijing hit back to Trump’s second round of additional 50 per cent hike — over the 34 per cent announced earlier, which had taken the total levies to 104 per cent. China retaliated with additional tariffs taking up its levy on imports from America to 84 per cent.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 per cent, effective immediately,” President Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10 per cent, also effective immediately,” he said further.
It was not immediately clear if goods from these countries will be tariffed at the lowered rate of 10 per cent during this pause period of 90 days or they will not be charged the rate originally announced by the president.
US markets have been in a turmoil since the reciprocal rates went into effect and calls had emerged from some key Wall Street influencers such as Bill Ackman for a 90-day pause.
Trump has also faced some push-back to the tariff from a key adviser, Elon Musk who has criticized them and engaged in a public spat with Peter Navarro, a key trade adviser to the President.

Title: PM Modi launches over Rs 3,880-crore development projects in Varanasi
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:27:58 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated and laid the foundation for a slew of development projects worth over Rs 3,880 crore in Varanasi, spanning infrastructure, education, energy, public services, and cultural preservation.
Continuing his focus on modernizing infrastructure and improving connectivity, the Prime Minister launched key road projects, including a bridge linking the Varanasi Ring Road to Sarnath, flyovers at Bhikharipur and Manduadih crossings, and an underpass tunnel on NH-31 near Varanasi International Airport. These projects are collectively valued at over Rs 980 crore.
In the energy sector, PM Modi inaugurated two 400 KV and one 220 KV substations along with transmission lines in Jaunpur, Chandauli, and Ghazipur worth over Rs 1,045 crore. He also laid the foundation for a 220 KV substation in Chaukaghat and a 132 KV substation in Ghazipur, alongside plans to expand Varanasi’s power distribution network, valued at Rs 775 crore.
The Prime Minister also inaugurated a transit hostel at the police line and new barracks at the PAC campus in Ramnagar. Foundation stones were laid for new administrative and residential facilities at various police stations, enhancing the city’s law enforcement infrastructure.
In the field of education, he inaugurated a Government Polytechnic College at Pindra, the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Government College in Barki, 356 rural libraries, and 100 Anganwadi centres. He also laid the foundation for the renovation of 77 primary schools under the Smart City Mission and announced a new building for the Kasturba Gandhi School at Cholapur.
To boost sports facilities, PM Modi laid the foundation for a synthetic hockey turf with floodlights and a spectator gallery at Uday Pratap College, as well as a mini stadium in Shivpur.
Significant investments were also announced in public amenities and beautification. These include the redevelopment of Samne Ghat and Shastri Ghat along the Ganga River, improvements in six municipal wards, and 130 rural drinking water schemes under the Jal Jeevan Mission, valued at over Rs 345 crore. Plans for urban landscaping and sculpture installations were also unveiled.
In support of local artisans and small businesses, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for the MSME Unity Mall, aimed at promoting traditional crafts. Infrastructure work was also launched under the Transport Nagar Scheme in Mohansarai, and a 1 MW solar power plant was inaugurated at the Water Treatment Plant in Bhelupur. He also announced the construction of community halls in 40 gram panchayats and beautification of public parks.
In a key gesture toward senior citizens, PM Modi distributed Ayushman Vay Vandana health cards. Recognizing local heritage, he presented Geographical Indication (GI) certificates for products such as tabla, traditional paintings, thandai, and tiranga barfi.
Further supporting the rural economy, the Prime Minister transferred over Rs 105 crore in bonuses to milk suppliers associated with Banas Dairy, reaffirming his commitment to the dairy and agricultural sectors.

Title: Indian Women’s hockey team gears up for five-match series in Australia
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:27:29 +0000
Content: The Indian women’s hockey team is set to embark on a high-stakes tour of Australia for a five-match series scheduled from April 26 to May 4. The tour will kick off with two matches against Australia A, followed by three clashes against the world No. 5-ranked Hockeyroos. All matches will take place at the Perth Hockey Stadium.
India will open the tour with back-to-back games against Australia A on April 26 and 27, before facing the senior Australian women’s team on May 1, 3, and 4 in what promises to be intense and closely contested encounters.
Ranked ninth in the FIH World Rankings, India will look to carry forward their recent momentum and fine-tune their preparations ahead of the European leg of the FIH Pro League 2024–25, which begins in June.
The team heads into the series on a confident note, following a spirited performance against world No. 1 Netherlands in Bhubaneswar, where they held the Dutch to a 2-2 draw and clinched a bonus point in a thrilling shootout—bringing their home leg of the Pro League to a positive close.
India can also draw inspiration from recent success against Australia. In their last meeting during the FIH Pro League 2023–24, India secured a narrow 1-0 victory. The two sides share a compelling rivalry, notably when India stunned the three-time Olympic champions 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to reach the semi-finals. In the 2022 Commonwealth Games semi-final, the teams played out a 1-1 draw in regulation time, with Australia prevailing in the shootout.
However, Australia holds the historical advantage, having won 10 of the 16 matches between the two sides since 2013. India has won three, while three matches have ended in draws.
Speaking about the upcoming tour, Indian women’s team head coach Harendra Singh said, “This tour is a crucial part of our preparation for the European leg of the Pro League. Playing against a quality side like Australia will challenge our players and provide valuable insights into our progress. We’ve shown our potential against top teams, like the Netherlands, and we aim to build on that momentum.”
He added, “Our matches with Australia have always been competitive. While they’ve had the upper hand historically, we’ve proven in recent years that we can match them. The team is motivated and putting in the hard yards at the camp to refine our strategies and enhance cohesion before we leave for Perth.”
Ahead of the tour, the players are undergoing intense training at the ongoing Senior Women’s National Coaching Camp at SAI, Bengaluru, focusing on tactical drills and strengthening team synergy.

Title: Russia and US bring ballerina and tech smuggler back home in prisoner swap
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:02:25 +0000
Content: A Russian-American ballerina who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in Russia for donating to a charity aiding Ukraine landed in Washington on Thursday after being freed in exchange for a man the U.S. had accused of forming a global smuggling ring to spirit sensitive electronics to Russia’s military.
The exchange, which took place on the tarmac of an airport in Abu Dhabi, indicates significant detailed contacts between President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants to strike a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine.
Ksenia Karelina is a dual citizen whom a Russian court found guilty last year of treason for donating $51.80 to a U.S.-based charity providing humanitarian support to Ukraine.
When the plane carrying Karelina landed in Washington late on Thursday night, she was met by her boyfriend, UFC fighter Chris van Heerden, who hugged and kissed her as others around them cheered.
During the exchange, Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in 2023 in Cyprus at the request of the United States after being accused of exporting sensitive microelectronics, was shown by Russian state television walking past Karelina towards a Russian plane, where he underwent medical check-ups.
“Petrov was exchanged for U.S. citizen Ksenia Karelina, who also holds Russian citizenship and was sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony for treason in the form of financial assistance to a foreign state,” said Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
A U.S. official told Reuters that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff brought up the case of Karelina with Putin during a call last week and that Putin’s reaction was to “do something as a goodwill gesture because he wants to settle the war.”
U.S. talks with Russia and Ukraine about ending the war were to continue and Witkoff would travel to Russia soon, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also involved in the negotiations, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe brought the deal over the finish line, a second U.S. official said.
Trump publicly thanked Russia for the release of the ballerina. He said he had received a call advocating for her release from a friend, UFC Chairman Dana White.
“They released the young ballerina, and she is now out, and that was great. So we appreciate that. We hope that we’re going to be able to make a deal relatively soon with Russia and Ukraine to stop the fighting,” Trump told reporters.
Two sources close to the swap who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Putin’s special envoy for international economic cooperation, Kirill Dmitriev, played a role in discussions.
Dmitriev, a Stanford University-educated former Goldman Sachs investment banker, is one of the most U.S.-savvy members of Russia’s elite, with close relations to some key members of the Trump team. He met Witkoff in Washington last week.
AMERICANS STILL IN JAIL
The United States lists several Americans – some dual citizens – who are in jail in Russia, including Stephen Hubbard, an English teacher who Washington has officially declared as wrongfully detained.
U.S. teacher Marc Fogel was released from a Russian prison in February during a visit by Witkoff to Moscow. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Dmitriev were involved in those negotiations.
In August 2024, the U.S. and Russia carried out their biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War, with 24 prisoners gaining their freedom, including U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich and ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.
The U.S. Justice Department said last year that Petrov had participated in a scheme to procure U.S.-sourced microelectronics for manufacturers supplying weaponry and other equipment to the Russian military.
The department also said that Petrov had formed an elaborate tech-smuggling syndicate which spirited sensitive technology to Russia’s military-industrial complex through a web of shell companies. Petrov was unavailable for comment.

Title: India poised to outperform emerging markets amid global uncertainty: Jefferies
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:47:23 +0000
Content: Global brokerage firm Jefferies has issued an “overweight” rating on India, citing the country’s resilience and potential to outperform other emerging markets (EMs) despite growing global economic uncertainties. In its latest research note, Jefferies said while absolute index performance remains difficult to forecast, India is likely to emerge as a relative outperformer compared to its EM peers.
A key factor behind this optimism is India’s limited trade dependence on the US and China, the two largest economies currently navigating trade tensions and economic slowdowns. India’s exports to the US account for just 2.3% of its GDP, even though the US remains India’s largest export destination. This modest trade exposure provides a cushion against any aggressive US trade policies.
Jefferies noted that while the US has imposed tariffs of 26% on Indian goods, these levies are still less severe than those imposed on other Asian economies such as China, Indonesia, and Taiwan. Moreover, the Indian government is reportedly optimistic about securing more favourable trade terms through ongoing bilateral negotiations with Washington.
Another positive factor working in India’s favour is the sharp decline in Brent crude prices, which have fallen nearly 20% year-to-date to around $60 per barrel. As a major net oil importer, India stands to gain significantly from the price drop. According to Jefferies, the fall in oil prices supports India’s current account balance, helps offset any loss from the US trade surplus, and offers a fiscal boost through increased revenues from fuel duties.
The brokerage has expressed a bullish outlook on sectors such as banking, power, telecom, automobiles, and real estate, which are expected to benefit from improving domestic macroeconomic conditions and investor confidence.
Investor sentiment in Indian equities has also remained strong. In March 2025, both foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) turned net buyers. According to a report by JM Financial Securities, FIIs invested $975 million, while DIIs made more significant net purchases of $4.3 billion** during the month.
A significant shift in FII behaviour was observed in March. While FIIs were net sellers until March 19, they turned aggressive buyers in the second half of the month, investing $3.6 billion into Indian equity markets, marking a remarkable turnaround in sentiment.
Meanwhile, global trade dynamics continue to shift. US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that trading partners who fail to reach a new trade agreement with the US by July 9, when the current 90-day negotiation pause ends, will face reciprocal tariffs on their exports to the US. This announcement adds further uncertainty to the global trade landscape, potentially impacting countries with heavier trade exposure.

Title: Dollar sinks to decade-low vs Swiss franc as US hit by loss of confidence
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:34:08 +0000
Content: The dollar slumped on Friday as waning confidence in the U.S. economy prompted investors to ditch U.S. assets to the benefit of safe havens such as the Swiss franc, yen, and euro, as well as gold.
The yellow metal recorded a new all-time peak, and the franc notched a fresh decade high.
Investors dumped Wall Street stocks overnight, as a powerful relief rally on Wednesday – when President Donald Trump abruptly paused higher tariff rates on dozens of trading partners – reversed course in a frenetic 24-hour period for markets. Longer-dated U.S. Treasuries are also selling off, putting 10-year yields on course for their biggest weekly jump since 2001.
Trump’s 90-day respite, which came despite his insistence for days that his policies would never change, didn’t include China. Instead, he ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports to an effective 145% rate, further escalating a high-stakes confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.
The Chinese yuan had tumbled to an all-time low in offshore trading on Tuesday, but erased all those losses a day later, and surged again on Thursday. It initially strengthened in the latest session as well, before trading slightly weaker.
“I’m deeply concerned about a lack of confidence among investors in the U.S. now,” said Nomura strategist Naka Matsuzawa. “It’s a no-confidence vote from not just the equity market but also Treasury market participants in the Trump administration and its policies.”
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asserted on Wednesday that the tariff pullback had been the plan all along to bring countries to the bargaining table. Trump, though, later indicated that the near-panic in markets that had unfolded since his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements had factored into his thinking.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly threatened an array of punitive measures on trading partners, only to revoke some of them at the last minute. The on-again, off-again approach has baffled world leaders and spooked business executives, who say the uncertainty has made it difficult to forecast market conditions.
The dollar dropped as much as 1.2% to 0.81405 Swiss franc for the first time since January 2015, extending Thursday’s nearly 4% plunge.
The U.S. currency slid 1.1% to as low as 142.88 yen, the weakest since September 30.
The euro surged as much as 1.7% to $1.13855, a level last seen in February 2022.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against those three currencies and three more major counterparts, sagged as much as 1.2%, taking it temporarily below the 100 level for the first time since July 2023.
The U.S. currency dropped as much as 0.3% to 7.2903 yuan in the offshore market CNH=D3 in early trading, but was last up 0.1% to 7.3232. In the previous two sessions, it slid 1.5%.
The People’s Bank of China on Friday lifted its official yuan midpoint guidance fix for the first time in seven days, reflecting the broad weakness in the dollar.
China watchers have interpreted the central bank’s actions as a signal it is open to gradual yuan weakening, but not a sharp move lower.
Gold jumped as much as 1.5% to an unprecedented $3,219.84 per ounce.
Elsewhere, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed nearly 10 basis points early on Friday to 4.488%.
“Trump blinked on higher yields, but that doesn’t mean 10-year yields can’t retest 4.50% while the USD sells off in tandem,” said Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets.
“I think we are entering a pure ‘sell USD’ regime,” he said. “Rate differentials are losing their sway over the USD for the first time in my life.”

Title: Iran is giving talks with US a ‘genuine chance’, foreign ministry says
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:33:38 +0000
Content: Iran is giving talks with its arch foe the United States this weekend “a genuine chance”, the Iranian foreign ministry’s spokesperson posted on X on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a surprise announcement on Monday that Washington and Tehran were poised to begin direct talks in Oman on Saturday over Iran’s nuclear program, warning that the Islamic Republic would be in “great danger” if the talks were unsuccessful.
The announcement caused some confusion because Iran had said the talks would be indirect with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Iran, previously stating it wouldn’t be bullied into negotiations, said that the U.S. should value this decision despite “their prevailing confrontational hoopla.”
“We intend to assess the other side’s intent and resolve this Saturday,” Esmaeil Baghaei added.
Iran’s state media said the talks would be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff, with the intermediation of Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi.

Title: Amit Shah hails govt’s crackdown on drug cartels after Assam seizure
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:13:19 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah, on Thursday praised the government’s aggressive stance against drug trafficking, saying that the Modi government is “mowing down drug cartels with full might.” This comes after a massive drug seizure in Assam on Sunday, which dealt a serious blow to narcotics syndicates operating in the region.
In a post on X, Shah said, “In our vision to build a drug-free Bharat, our agencies launched massive operations strangling drug cartels and seized 30.4 kg of methamphetamine tablets while arresting three people in Assam. Our offensives against drugs will continue with ruthless force. Congratulations to the NCB, Assam Police, and the CRPF on this major breakthrough”.
Details of the operation
On April 6, the NCB, in collaboration with the Assam Police and the CRPF, carried out a series of successful operations against drug trafficking networks operating in Assam. This operation, which had been meticulously planned for over three months, resulted in the seizure of 30.4 kg of methamphetamine, also known as “YABA,” in two separate incidents.
The first major seizure took place when NCB officials, acting on intelligence, intercepted a car in Silchar, Assam. The vehicle contained 9.9 kg of methamphetamine, concealed in the boot of the car. The sole occupant, a resident of Churachandpur in Manipur, was arrested on the spot. Authorities are continuing their investigations to identify the links between this seizure and the broader drug trafficking network.
Later that evening, a joint operation involving the NCB, Assam Police, and the CRPF led to the interception of a Mahindra Thar in Silchar. Upon searching the vehicle, officers discovered 20.5 kg of methamphetamine, hidden inside the spare tire. Two individuals from Churachandpur, Manipur, were arrested in connection with this haul. Investigations are ongoing to uncover further connections and the full scope of the operation.
This operation follows a series of similar successful seizures by the NCB in the region. On March 13, 2025, the NCB had seized 110 kg of methamphetamine in two separate operations. The first operation in Silchar led to the arrest of one individual, a resident of Moreh, Manipur, with 7.5 kg of methamphetamine. The second seizure in Lilong, near Imphal, Manipur, netted 102.5 kg of methamphetamine, and three individuals were arrested.
Further investigations are underway in these cases, as the authorities continue to work toward dismantling transnational drug trafficking syndicates operating across India and its neighboring countries.
NCB’s efforts in Northeast
The NCB has been stepping up its efforts in the Northeast region, setting up new zonal units in Siliguri, Itanagar, Agartala, and Imphal, as well as a regional headquarters in Guwahati. Additionally, a newly operationalized Field Office in Aizawl, Mizoram, has already achieved success with the seizure of 10.814 kg of methamphetamine on March 24, leading to the arrest of six individuals, including two foreign nationals from Myanmar.

Title: PM Modi calls PM-JAY rollout in Delhi a ‘revolutionary step’ for healthcare
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 05:57:33 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) in Delhi, calling it a “revolutionary step” in strengthening the capital’s healthcare system — a move made possible, he said, by the “double-engine” BJP government.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “A revolutionary step related to Delhi’s health sector! This mission of the double-engine government is going to be extremely beneficial for lakhs of my brothers and sisters here. I am very happy that Delhiites will now also be able to get their treatment under the Ayushman Yojana.”
The rollout of PM-JAY in Delhi officially began on Thursday under the broader Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM).
Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda and Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta launched the scheme by distributing Ayushman cards to the first batch of 30 beneficiaries in the national capital.
At the launch event, Nadda announced that all senior citizens aged 70 years and above in Delhi, regardless of income level, will be covered under the Ayushman Vay Vandana Yojana, providing them with expanded access to healthcare services.
Chief Minister Rekha Gupta shared details of the infrastructure development planned under PM-ABHIM.
“For the NCT of Delhi, an amount of Rs 1,749 crore has been approved for the establishment of 1,139 Urban Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM), the strengthening of 11 Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), and the development of 9 Critical Care Blocks (CCBs) during the scheme period.”
The scheme’s rollout follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on April 5, paving the way for its implementation in the capital.
Launched in 2018, PM-JAY provides an annual health coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary care, primarily targeting economically vulnerable groups. The Delhi government has further supplemented this coverage with an additional Rs 5 lakh per family, taking the total health benefit to Rs 10 lakh per year per beneficiary family.
Crucially, the scheme’s portability allows residents of Delhi to access benefits at any of the 30,000+ empaneled hospitals across India, ensuring treatment options beyond the city’s borders.

Title: President Murmu calls for deeper economic ties with Slovakia, highlights India’s growth and cultural bond
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 05:23:21 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday addressed the Slovakia-India Business Forum in Bratislava, underscoring the deep-rooted and friendly ties between India and Slovakia, and calling for expanded economic cooperation between the two nations.
“India and Slovakia have historically shared close and friendly relations. It is now time to explore the diversification of our trade basket and strengthen economic ties,” President Murmu said on the second day of her official visit to Slovakia. She stressed the importance of building on existing partnerships and exploring new avenues in emerging sectors.
Expressing gratitude for Slovakia’s warm hospitality, President Murmu praised the country’s appreciation of Indian culture. “It is heartening to see that India’s heritage and traditions are quite popular among our Slovak friends. From Yoga and Ayurveda to Indian cuisine, the love for Indian culture evident in Slovakia is a testimony to the growing strong ties between the people of the two countries,” she said.
Highlighting India’s inclusive growth, she added, “Our growth has not only been inspiring but also inclusive, ensuring that it benefits all sections of society. Even as India embraces modernity and technology, our progress remains deeply rooted in the wisdom of our ancient philosophical traditions.”
She emphasized that Indian classical philosophy promotes ethical conduct, self-knowledge, and introspection, offering a holistic view of life.
Describing the India-Slovakia relationship as a “living bridge,” the Ministry of External Affairs posted on X:
“Connecting with the India-Slovakia living bridge! President Droupadi Murmu addressed the vibrant Indian diaspora at a community reception organised in Bratislava. In her address, the President highlighted India’s growth story and advancements, and also commended the Indian community for their contribution in deepening the India-Slovakia ties.”
Later in the day, President Murmu, accompanied by Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, visited the Jaguar Land Rover manufacturing facility in Bratislava. The leaders toured the plant’s production lines and discussed opportunities for industrial collaboration.
The President highlighted India’s growing strengths in renewable energy, digital technology, IT, telecom, automotive, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, space, and fintech. “India is on course to becoming a $5 trillion economy,” she said, expressing confidence in achieving that goal with the support of partners like Slovakia.
She also pointed to Slovakia’s strong industrial base and strategic location in Europe as key advantages. “Slovakia presents significant potential for deeper trade and investment ties. I invite Slovak companies to join India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative,” she said. The Business Forum, she added, is an ideal platform for forming mutually beneficial partnerships.
In a symbolic gesture, President Murmu and President Pellegrini jointly planted a Linden tree — Slovakia’s national tree — at City Park in Nitra. The President also shared details about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam” tree-planting initiative with her Slovak counterpart.
Earlier in the day, President Murmu was conferred with the Doctorate Honoris Causa by Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra. The honorary degree recognized her contributions to public service, social justice, education, and the promotion of cultural diversity.

Title: Jawbone from Taiwan shows geographic reach of enigmatic archaic humans
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 05:13:25 +0000
Content: Molecular analysis has determined that a jawbone recovered off Taiwan’s coast came from a Denisovan, showing that this enigmatic lineage of archaic humans once inhabited a vast expanse in eastern Eurasia in environments ranging from cold and arid to warm and humid.
Scientists were unable to extract DNA from the fossil – part of the lower jaw, with five teeth attached – but identified two protein variants present in the remains that they knew were specific to Denisovans, rather than either Neanderthals or our species Homo sapiens, based on previously studied fossils.
Protein fragments in the dental enamel of the fossil related to the Y-chromosome, showing that the individual was male.
Determining the age of the fossil has been difficult, as the researchers were unable to use traditional dating methods. They estimate that it is either 10,000 to 70,000 years old or 130,000 to 190,000 years old, based on animal fossils associated with its discovery. That means there is a chance it is the youngest-known fossil of a Denisovan individual.
The mandible, along with various animal fossils, was retrieved from the seafloor through dredging during commercial fishing operations in the Penghu Channel, which once was dry land. It eventually ended up in a Taiwanese antique shop, where it was bought in 2008 and later donated to a museum in Taiwan.
The existence of Denisovans was unknown until researchers in 2010 announced the discovery of their remains in Denisova Cave in Siberia, with genetic evidence showing them to be a sister group to Neanderthals, the stoutly built extinct archaic humans who inhabited parts of Eurasia. Both experienced significant interactions with Homo sapiens, including interbreeding, before vanishing soon after for reasons not fully understood.
From genetics, scientists have determined that Denisovans diverged from Neanderthals around 400,000 years ago. When Denisovans disappeared remains unclear.
Denisovans are known only from scrappy remains of bones and teeth, with nothing close to a complete skeleton discovered to date. That means that any newly identified fossils are important in adding to the knowledge of what they looked like as well as where they lived.
“We can only estimate their jawbone and teeth shapes from the results of this study, but at least the mandible of Denisovan male individuals was very robust and their cheek teeth were large compared with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens,” said biological anthropologist Takumi Tsutaya of the Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI, in Japan, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science.
Confirmed Denisovan fossils now have been identified from three places – the Penghu Channel remains, teeth and a small finger bone fragment from Denisova Cave in Russia and a mandible and rib fragment from Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau in China’s Gansu province. A molar from Cobra Cave in Laos is also believed to be from a Denisovan based on its shape.
This shows not only that Denisovans inhabited wide swathes of Eurasia – the distance from Denisova Cave to the Penghu Channel is about 2,800 miles (4,500 km) – but that they did so in very different environments. These ranged from the chilly Siberian mountains to the high elevations of the Tibetan Plateau to the warmth of Laos and the subtropical shoreline of Taiwan.
“Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,” said molecular anthropologist and study co-author Frido Welker of the University of Copenhagen.
The youngest-known Denisovan fossil determined by scientific dating methods is the rib fragment from Baishiya Karst Cave, at around 40,000 years old. That coincides roughly with the date of the youngest-known Neanderthal remains. Our species trekked out of Africa and entered into regions inhabited by Neanderthals and Denisovans, with both those groups becoming extinct not long afterward.
“We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,” Welker said. “A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.”

Title: India’s forex reserves surge to $676.3 billion
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:15:52 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves rose sharply by $10.8 billion to reach $676.3 billion in the week ended April 4, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s latest data released on Friday. This marks the fifth straight week of gains in the country’s forex reserves.
A major contributor to this increase was the rise in foreign currency assets, which grew by $9 billion to $574.08 billion. Gold reserves also saw a notable rise of $1.5 billion, bringing the total to $79.36 billion. Additionally, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) climbed by $186 million to $18.36 billion.
In the previous week ending March 28, reserves had already touched a five-month high of $665.4 billion after a $6.6 billion surge.
The recent uptrend comes after a period of decline that was attributed to revaluation losses and the Reserve Bank of India’s interventions in the forex market to reduce rupee volatility. However, the past five weeks have reversed that trend, indicating a stronger external position.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of $704.89 billion in September 2024.
A healthy forex reserve position not only reflects robust economic fundamentals but also strengthens the rupee against the US dollar. It gives the RBI greater flexibility to intervene in the foreign exchange markets—especially during periods of volatility—by selling dollars to support the domestic currency.
In contrast, a shrinking reserve limits the central bank’s ability to stabilise the rupee in times of stress.
Meanwhile, India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a three-year low of $14.05 billion in February, down from $22.99 billion in January. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the improvement came as exports remained steady while imports declined—signaling resilience in the external sector despite ongoing global economic uncertainties triggered by geopolitical tensions.

Title: India’s industrial output grows 2.9% in February 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:44:47 +0000
Content: India’s Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose 2.9% year-on-year in February 2025, a moderate expansion compared to the 5.0% growth recorded in January, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
The data reflects a mixed performance across sectors. Manufacturing, which has the highest weight in the IIP, grew 2.9%, while electricity generation rose 3.6% and mining increased by 1.6%.
The overall IIP stood at 151.3 in February, up from 147.1 in the same month last year.
Within the manufacturing sector, 14 out of 23 industry groups posted positive growth. The strongest contributors were the production of basic metals (5.8%), motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (8.9%), and other non-metallic mineral products (8%).
Auto components, alloy steel products, cement, and prefabricated concrete blocks were among the key drivers.
Use-based classification showed strong momentum in capital goods, which grew 8.2%, and infrastructure/construction goods, which rose by 6.6%. Primary goods expanded by 2.8%, while consumer durables posted a 3.8% rise. However, consumer non-durables saw a decline of 2.1%.
The data also included the first revision of January 2025 figures and the final revision for November 2024, compiled at response rates of 94% and 95% respectively.
The IIP for March 2025 is scheduled for release on April 28.

Title: China raises duties on US goods to 125%, calls Trump tariff hikes a ‘joke’
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:17:03 +0000
Content: China hiked its levies on imports of U.S. goods to 125% on Friday, hitting back at Donald Trump’s decision to single out the world’s No.2 economy for higher duties, while dismissing the U.S. president’s tariff strategy as “a joke.”
Investors had been waiting to see how Beijing would respond to Trump’s move on Wednesday to effectively raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% while announcing a 90-day pause on duties on dozens of other countries’ goods. The yuan slipped to levels last seen during the global financial crisis on Thursday but rebounded slightly on Friday.
“The U.S. side’s imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, runs counter to basic economic principles and common sense, and is simply an act of unilateral bullying and coercion,” China’s Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The tit-for-tat increases stand to make goods trade between the world’s two largest economies impossible, analysts say, with import duties above around 35% wiping out Chinese exporters’ profit margins and making American offerings in China similarly overly expensive.

Beijing indicated on Friday that this would be the last time it matched the U.S., in the event that Trump takes his tariffs any higher.
“Even if the U.S. continues to impose even higher tariffs, it would no longer have any economic significance and would go down as a joke in the history of world economics,” the Finance Ministry’s statement added.
“If the U.S. continues to play a numbers game with tariffs, China will not respond,” it added. However it left the door open for Beijing to turn to other types of retaliation, reiterating that China would fight the U.S. to the end.
On Thursday, Beijing said it would immediately restrict imports of Hollywood films in response to Trump’s tariff increases. Earlier this week, China focused its sights on U.S. services exports, issuing a travel advisory for citizens visiting the U.S. and an alert for students considering studying in the U.S. state of Ohio.
UBS analysts said in a note that China’s declaration that it would not retaliate in kind against any further tariff increases was “an acknowledgement that trade between the two countries has essentially been completely severed”.
Both sides now tax 100% of each other’s goods, after China increased the percentage of two-way trade it subjects to taxes from 63% on April 9, following the U.S. broadening the scope of its duties from 67% in February.
Average U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports now stand at 135%, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, more than 40 times higher than before the first U.S.-China trade war kicked off in 2018.
SEEKING TO BUILD ALLIANCES
Beijing is seeking to rally trading partners to its cause.
In his first public comments on the tariffs, President Xi Jinping told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing that China and the European Union should “fulfill their international responsibilities… and jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, China’s state news agency Xinhua reported.
Xi begins a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia next week, aiming to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours as trade tension escalates with the United States.
Eric Orlander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, said improved market access in areas like agriculture would likely be on the table when Xi meets his Vietnamese, Malaysian and Cambodian counterparts rather than “big free trade deals”.
“China’s best offer to Vietnam is stability. Don’t underestimate how important that is at a time like this,” Orlander added.
Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has sought to get ahead of U.S. negotiators, holding video calls this week with his counterparts from the EU and Malaysia, which is chairing ASEAN this year, as well as Saudi Arabia and South Africa, by way of reaching out to Gulf countries and the Group of 20 and BRICS nations.
Beijing and Brusselsagreed on Thursday to restart talks on trade relief and to immediately carry out negotiations on electric vehicle price commitments, according to a readout of his meeting with European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic, meaning a truce to a longstanding spat could be forthcoming.
A rapprochement with Europe would take China’s trade war with the West back to a single front — the U.S.
“China remains open to negotiations with the U.S., but threatening and pressuring are not the right way to engage with China,” the country’s Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.

Title: Sensex soars over 1,300 points as Trump suspends tariffs till July 9
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:12:12 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets surged sharply on Thursday, with the Sensex climbing over 1,300 points, after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on trade tariffs for most countries, including India. The move buoyed investor sentiment despite lingering concerns over renewed trade tensions between the US and China.
The Sensex jumped 1,310.11 points, or 1.77%, to close at 75,157.26. During the session, it touched an intra-day high of 75,467.33 and a low of 74,762.84. The broader Nifty 50 index also rallied, gaining 429.40 points, or 1.92%, to settle at 22,828.55.
While the Nifty faced resistance around its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), closing slightly below its intraday peak, analysts remain cautiously optimistic.
“The trend remains bearish unless the index decisively crosses the 23,000 mark, where significant open interest has built up. On the downside, support lies at 22,750 — a breach of which could trigger further weakness,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.
The rally was broad-based, with strong buying across all sectors. The BSE Midcap index rose 1.84%, while the Smallcap index surged 3.04%.
Among sectoral indices, metals led the charge, with the Nifty Metal index gaining over 4%. Energy, pharma, auto, and banking stocks also posted robust gains. Hindalco emerged as the top performer on the Nifty, rising 6.52%, followed by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, and Coal India — all up between 4.4% and 4.8%.
Despite the upbeat mood in Indian markets, Asian equities were mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225, South Korea’s KOSPI, and Singapore’s Straits Times ended in negative territory. The cautious tone followed China’s decision to retaliate against recent US tariff hikes by announcing import duties of up to 125% on select American goods. This comes in response to Trump’s move to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to an effective 145%.
“Despite global volatility, Indian equities cheered the temporary relief in the global trade environment, triggering a rally across market segments,” analysts noted.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee also traded higher, gaining 0.70 to close at 86.00 against the US dollar. The local currency was supported by a weaker dollar index and improved investor confidence following the US move to relax tariffs on Indian goods by 10% for the next three months.

Title: NSE adds over 2 crore new investor accounts in just 6 months
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:42:20 +0000
Content: The total number of investor accounts on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has surpassed 22 crore this month, marking a sharp rise of over 2 crore accounts in just six months since it crossed the 20-crore mark in October 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the number of unique registered investors stood at 11.3 crore, up from 11 crore on January 20, 2025. It’s important to note that one investor can hold multiple accounts across different brokers, resulting in more than one client code.
Maharashtra continues to lead with the highest number of investor accounts at 3.8 crore, followed by Uttar Pradesh (2.4 crore), Gujarat (1.9 crore), and Rajasthan and West Bengal, with approximately 1.3 crore accounts each. Together, these states account for nearly 49% of all investor accounts, while the top 10 states contribute around 75% of the total.
Over the past five years, the NSE’s benchmark Nifty 50 index has delivered an impressive 22% annualised return, while the Nifty 500 has yielded an even higher return of 25% annually. These gains underscore the wealth creation potential for investors during this period.
Meanwhile, the NSE’s Investor Protection Fund (IPF) grew by over 23% year-on-year, reaching ₹2,459 crore as of March 31, 2025.
“The rapid growth in India’s investor base—with over 2 crore new accounts added in just six months—reflects strong investor confidence in India’s economic trajectory despite global challenges,” said Sriram Krishnan, Chief Business Development Officer, NSE.
He attributed this growth to accelerated digital transformation and the rising popularity of mobile trading platforms, which have made capital markets more accessible to investors across Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities.
Krishnan also pointed to the success of initiatives aimed at deepening retail participation, including widespread financial literacy campaigns and simplified KYC procedures.
According to recently released data, the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rose to ₹410.87 lakh crore ($4.81 trillion) in FY25 (as of March 31), up from ₹384.2 lakh crore ($4.61 trillion) in FY24—an increase of 6.94% year-on-year. The total number of companies listed on the NSE stood at 2,720 as of March 31, 2025.

Title: Impact of tariffs on developing countries could be ‘catastrophic’, says UN trade agency
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:40:43 +0000
Content: Sweeping tariffs on imports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and countermeasures could have a “catastrophic” impact on developing countries, hitting even harder than foreign aid cuts, the director of the United Nations trade agency said on Friday.
Global trade could shrink by 3-7% and global gross domestic product by 0.7%, with developing countries the worst affected, the International Trade Centre said.
“It is huge,” Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the International Trade Centre, told Reuters. “If this escalation between China and the U.S. continues it will result in an 80% reduction in trade between the countries, and the ripple effect of that across the board can be catastrophic.”
Global markets remained in turmoil on Friday. Trump this week announced a 90-day tariff pause on dozens of countries but hiked the duties on Chinese goods to an effective rate of 145%. On Friday, Beijing increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% in a trade war that threatens to up-end global supply chains.
“Tariffs could have a much more harmful impact than the removal of foreign aid,” Coke-Hamilton said, warning that developing economies risk sliding back on the economic gains they made in recent years.
Some of the world’s least developed countries, including Lesotho, Cambodia, Laos, Madagascar and Myanmar, may look to improve regional trade relations to absorb the loss of some of the U.S. market for their exports, the ITC said.
Bangladesh, the world’s second largest apparel exporter, could lose $3.3 billion in annual exports to the U.S. by 2029 if the U.S. tariff of 37% stays after the pause, ITC data found. It may look to European markets as an alternative as they still hold growth potential, Coke-Hamilton suggested.
The projections by the International Trade Centre, the joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, which seeks to help countries develop through exports, are based on data it gathered before Trump’s 90-day pause and subsequent hikes on duties on Chinese imports.

Title: Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah signs contract extension to 2027
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:37:37 +0000
Content: Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has ended months of speculation about his future by signing a two-year contract extension at Anfield, the Premier League leaders said on Friday.
The 32-year-old, who joined the club in 2017 from AS Roma, could have left the club for free in the summer with his contract previously set to expire in June.
“I’m very excited. We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football,” Salah said in a club statement.
“It’s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football.“
He paid tribute to the club’s fans, and pledged to keep working hard to bring them results.
“Keep supporting us and we’ll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we’re going to win more trophies.”
Salah is Liverpool’s third-highest goalscorer of all time with 243 goals in 394 games.
In his eight years at the club Liverpool have won a Premier League title – most likely about to become two titles – as well as one Champions League crown, an FA Cup, two League Cups, the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.
He has been a stand-out performer for Liverpool this season, scoring 32 goals in all competitions and leads the race for the Premier League’s golden boot with 27 goals.
Liverpool are 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal with seven games left to play.
‘THE STORY WILL CONTINUE’
“My family also feels at home, we enjoy every moment in this city and every moment in the club,” Salah said.
“Its a special moment always when we play at Anfield. There is no place like that. The warmth you feel inside the song before the game. Every time I score a goal and they sing my song, it is something special, and the story will continue.”
British media had reported on Wednesday that Liverpool had made a breakthrough in negotiations over a new deal for the Egypt international after months of deadlock.
Salah was reported to be the subject of interest from the big-money Saudi Pro League but is widely seen as key to Liverpool’s hopes of consistently winning silverware given his own consistency over the years.
Liverpool manager Arne Slot said he had known for a while that Salah would be extending his deal but understands the relief Liverpool fans have felt after the announcement.
“For the fans, it was a pleasant surprise. But I knew for a bit longer that things were heading in the right direction,” he told reporters in a news conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League home game against West Ham United.
“Happy, of course. He has shown at this club for so many years in a row how much of a value he is for the club and the team. As like all our fans and his team-mates, we are very happy that he has extended for two more years.
“And hopefully, he can show on Sunday again how important he has been for us all season.”
Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, who is out of contract at the end of the season, is also being tipped to extend his stay on Merseyside, while full back Trent Alexander-Arnold has been linked with a move to Real Madrid.

Title: Prada brings Versace home to create Italian luxury contender
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:32:15 +0000
Content: Prada’s deal to buy Versace revives hopes for a ‘Made in Italy’ luxury champion after many other family-founded brands ended up in French, Swiss or U.S. hands, and comes as many Italian groups are outperforming the struggling sector.
The $1.375 billion deal brings one of fashion’s best-known Italian labels back under Italian control after it was sold to U.S-listed Capri Holdings, then known as Michael Kors, for $2.15 billion including debt in 2018.
Despite Italy accounting for 50% to 55% of global personal luxury goods production, according to consultancy Bain’s estimates, the country lacks a group with a scale that matches up to French players such as LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering.
Milan-based Prada, controlled by designer Miuccia Prada and husband Patrizio Bertelli and listed in Hong Kong with a market capitalisation of about 14 billion euros ($15 billion), is the largest Italian luxury fashion group by revenue.
But the group, which also includes the fast-growing Miu Miu label, has been a relative minnow in terms of stock market valuation compared with the likes of Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH.
The Versace deal comes after Andrea Guerra became Prada’s CEO in 2023 to bridge a change in generation, with Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of the company’s main owners and its chief marketing officer, regarded as the heir apparent.
“Prada’s ambition to become a leading Italian luxury conglomerate is a significant move in a market that is dominated by French groups. It’s exactly what many Italians have been hoping for”, said Achim Berg, a fashion and luxury industry adviser.
The combined revenue of the five biggest Italian-owned listed luxury groups – Prada, Moncler, Ermenegildo Zegna, Brunello Cucinelli and Ferragamo – is still well below Kering’s roughly 17 billion euros, even after a big fall in sales at the French group last year.
Company founder Brunello Cucinelli summed up the difference in approach on the two sides of the Alps in typically colourful fashion.
“Our esteemed French counterparts are great financiers,” he told the Milano Fashion Global Summit 2024 last October.
“But we Italians regard our ‘tiny big’ companies as if they were our little children, so we want to look after them and hand them down to a next generation,” he added.
AMBITIOUS MOVE
While LVMH and Kering have swallowed many Italian brands, even the larger Italian groups have until now been comparatively reluctant to make big acquisitions.
“This acquisition represents Prada’s serious attempt to build a group – and a much more ambitious one compared to their past ventures with Helmut Lang and Jil Sander,” Berg said.
Prada’s chairman and co-owner Patrizio Bertelli defined the acquisition of those two brands – which were bought at the turn of the century and sold a few years later – as “strategic mistakes”. The group has since focused mainly on organic growth, with the exception of acquisitions of suppliers.
Both Prada and Versace have their roots in Milan and still have headquarters there, just four kilometres (2.5 miles) apart.
Milan-based Moncler, the mountain gear brand that was bought and revived by Italian entrepreneur and current main shareholder Remo Ruffini in 2003, has also shown some interest in dealmaking, buying Italian streetwear brand Stone Island in a 1.15-billion-euro deal agreed in late 2020.
Moncler’s net cash position of 1.3 billion euros has fuelled analyst talk of more deals, but the group has denied such speculation.
Jil Sander is now part of Italian entrepreneur Renzo Rosso’s OTB Group, which also includes brands such as Diesel and Maison Margiela. But with annual sales of 1.7 billion euros, it remains relatively small.
The big Paris-based groups, meanwhile, have continued to make forays into Italy, underscoring the challenge an enlarged Prada would face to compete with them.
In the latest deals, Kering bought a 30% stake in Italian maison Valentino in 2023, and LVMH last year helped to take Tod’s private and took a 10% stake in Moncler’s top shareholder.
In the longer-term, eyes are on companies such as Milan-based Armani and Dolce & Gabbana, among the few in Italy that are still fully family-owned and unlisted.
Their ultimate fates could be decisive in any effort to create a true Italian powerhouse in global fashion.

Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:16:10 +0000
Content: Former Real Madrid and Netherlands coach Leo Beenhakker has died at the age of 82, the LaLiga club said on Thursday.
The Dutchman coached clubs such as Feyenoord and Ajax Amsterdam as well as the Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago and Poland national teams.
He led Ajax to the Eredivisie title in the 1979-80 and 1989-90 seasons before winning the Dutch top-flight again with Feyenoord in 1998-99.
However, Beenhakker’s most successful stint came at Madrid, where he won three LaLiga titles, one Copa del Rey and two Supercopa de Espana trophies.
“Real Madrid, its president and board of directors, are deeply saddened by the death of Leo Beenhakker, the legendary Real Madrid coach who led the Whites between 1986 and 1989, and in 1992,” the Spanish side said in a statement.
“Real Madrid would like to express their condolences and affection to his family, clubs, and loved ones.
“Leo Beenhakker has passed away at the age of 82. Real Madrid extends its condolences to all Madridistas. May he rest in peace.”

Title: India-Italy partnership continues to grow and evolve: EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:33:51 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday held “productive discussions” with visiting Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, and Italy’s Minister of University and Research, Anna Maria Bernini, in New Delhi. The talks focused on reviewing and enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC), maritime and security affairs, research, technology, education, and culture.
“Also exchanged views on contemporary global developments, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, and West Asia. Our partnership continues to develop and evolve, guided by the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025-29 agreed by our leadership,” Jaishankar posted on X after the meeting.
This high-level engagement marked an important step forward in implementing the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025–2029, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in November 2024 during the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The Action Plan outlines a shared vision for strengthening the strategic partnership between India and Italy, with a focus on achieving tangible outcomes that will benefit both nations.
“They have directed us to work with our respective industries, as well as with scientific establishments and higher education institutions, to facilitate business collaborations, co-production, innovation, and the exchange of knowledge and talent between our two countries,” said Jaishankar while addressing the India-Italy Business, Science and Technology Forum earlier in the day.
He emphasised that India has been working closely with like-minded partners in recent years to build resilient and trusted partnerships that serve not only economic but also strategic interests.
“For us, Italy ranks high on that list. In many sectors, there is a natural complementarity that we need to leverage. Whether it is energy, transport, food processing, or light engineering, Italy has the technologies and best practices that make collaboration fruitful,” he noted.
Jaishankar also highlighted India’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific and its outreach towards the west.
“Given both geography and strategic engagement, it makes perfect sense to link what Italy is doing in the Mediterranean with what India is undertaking in the Arabian Sea. This alignment offers mutual benefit,” he said.
Referring to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, Jaishankar described it as a landmark initiative launched during India’s G20 Presidency. The corridor, which Italy refers to as the “Cotton Road,” is expected to establish a new global axis for economic activities, energy flow, and communications, with both countries playing key roles.

Title: Dust storm hits Delhi; trees uprooted, weather disruptions reported across North India
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:09:09 +0000
Content: A dust storm swept through several parts of Delhi on Friday evening, uprooting trees and forcing residents to shut windows as strong winds carried dust into homes. The sudden weather change caused disruptions in traffic as fallen trees and branches obstructed roads, while flight operations in northern India were also impacted.
This marks the second consecutive day Delhi has experienced a dust storm.
Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an Orange Alert for thunderstorms, lightning, and hailstorms in four districts of Himachal Pradesh, while Yellow Alerts were issued for four other districts.
According to weather reports, districts including Chamba, Kangra, Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Mandi, Shimla, and Hamirpur witnessed thunderstorms and lightning accompanied by light to moderate rainfall in the past 24 hours. Gohar in Mandi recorded the highest rainfall at 19 mm, followed by Pandokhar in the same district with 14 mm. Other regions received light showers. Hailstorm activity was reported in Banjar (Kullu), Sundernagar (Mandi), and parts of Shimla.
Just days ago, areas such as Sundernagar, Bhuntar, and Dharamshala were reeling under heatwave conditions. However, the recent rainfall has brought much-needed relief, with temperatures dropping by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius, bringing them closer to seasonal norms.
As of Friday, thunderstorm and lightning activity was recorded in Chamba, Kangra, Una, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Solan, and Shimla. Several areas also received light morning rain.
IMD officials expect the weather activity to persist throughout the day, with a high likelihood of hailstorms in Kullu, Mandi, Kangra, and Chamba districts. Thunderstorms and lightning are also expected in these regions.
“Thunderstorms, lightning, and hailstorms are likely in parts of Himachal Pradesh. An Orange Alert has been issued for districts expected to see more intense activity, while Yellow Alerts are in place for regions with moderate weather events. People are advised to remain indoors during severe weather,” said IMD scientist Sandeep Kumar Sharma.

Title: Italy eyes deeper investment ties with India, boost in bilateral trade
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:00:19 +0000
Content: Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, on Friday expressed strong interest in expanding economic cooperation with India. Speaking at the “Italy-India Business, Science and Technology Forum,” Tajani said Italy is keen to invest more in India, increase exports, and encourage greater Indian investments in Italy.
He described India as a vital partner for ensuring stability in the Indo-Pacific region—a key factor in strengthening global trade. “India is an economy with enormous potential, and we are committed to deepening our collaboration,” Tajani said.
Highlighting the robust bilateral relationship, he added, “Italy and India are natural economic partners. Our bilateral trade has surpassed $14 billion, and we want to take this further. This includes expanding our trade, increasing Italian investments in India, and welcoming more Indian investments in Italy.”
He noted that areas such as innovation, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, space technology, and defence present significant opportunities for joint ventures and partnerships between the two nations.
India’s Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, also present at the forum, echoed Tajani’s views. He emphasised that the bilateral trade relationship holds untapped potential and can grow further through seamless cooperation, facilitation of investments, and elimination of barriers to doing business.
Goyal noted that India’s economy is on a trajectory to expand from $4 trillion to $30–35 trillion by 2047. “Our vision of Viksit Bharat makes India a compelling case for deeper engagement with the European Union, particularly with Italy,” he said.
He also pointed to new areas for cooperation, including fashion, luxury goods, food processing, pharmaceuticals, tourism, green technology, advanced manufacturing, and automobiles.
Amidst global uncertainties, Goyal said, the Italy-India partnership offers reassurance and promise. He described the forum as a timely platform to advance the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025–29, launched by Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Giorgia Meloni in November 2024. “It is an ambitious, forward-looking roadmap focused on trade, investment, and innovation,” he said.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar added that the combination of India’s growth trajectory and the technological capabilities of Italian industry creates a strong foundation for collaboration. “Make in India today offers a powerful platform for this partnership to flourish,” he said.

Title: India’s forex reserves surge to $676.3 billion
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:15:52 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves rose sharply by $10.8 billion to reach $676.3 billion in the week ended April 4, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s latest data released on Friday. This marks the fifth straight week of gains in the country’s forex reserves.
A major contributor to this increase was the rise in foreign currency assets, which grew by $9 billion to $574.08 billion. Gold reserves also saw a notable rise of $1.5 billion, bringing the total to $79.36 billion. Additionally, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) climbed by $186 million to $18.36 billion.
In the previous week ending March 28, reserves had already touched a five-month high of $665.4 billion after a $6.6 billion surge.
The recent uptrend comes after a period of decline that was attributed to revaluation losses and the Reserve Bank of India’s interventions in the forex market to reduce rupee volatility. However, the past five weeks have reversed that trend, indicating a stronger external position.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of $704.89 billion in September 2024.
A healthy forex reserve position not only reflects robust economic fundamentals but also strengthens the rupee against the US dollar. It gives the RBI greater flexibility to intervene in the foreign exchange markets—especially during periods of volatility—by selling dollars to support the domestic currency.
In contrast, a shrinking reserve limits the central bank’s ability to stabilise the rupee in times of stress.
Meanwhile, India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a three-year low of $14.05 billion in February, down from $22.99 billion in January. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the improvement came as exports remained steady while imports declined—signaling resilience in the external sector despite ongoing global economic uncertainties triggered by geopolitical tensions.

Title: India’s industrial output grows 2.9% in February 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:44:47 +0000
Content: India’s Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose 2.9% year-on-year in February 2025, a moderate expansion compared to the 5.0% growth recorded in January, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
The data reflects a mixed performance across sectors. Manufacturing, which has the highest weight in the IIP, grew 2.9%, while electricity generation rose 3.6% and mining increased by 1.6%.
The overall IIP stood at 151.3 in February, up from 147.1 in the same month last year.
Within the manufacturing sector, 14 out of 23 industry groups posted positive growth. The strongest contributors were the production of basic metals (5.8%), motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (8.9%), and other non-metallic mineral products (8%).
Auto components, alloy steel products, cement, and prefabricated concrete blocks were among the key drivers.
Use-based classification showed strong momentum in capital goods, which grew 8.2%, and infrastructure/construction goods, which rose by 6.6%. Primary goods expanded by 2.8%, while consumer durables posted a 3.8% rise. However, consumer non-durables saw a decline of 2.1%.
The data also included the first revision of January 2025 figures and the final revision for November 2024, compiled at response rates of 94% and 95% respectively.
The IIP for March 2025 is scheduled for release on April 28.

Title: China raises duties on US goods to 125%, calls Trump tariff hikes a ‘joke’
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:17:03 +0000
Content: China hiked its levies on imports of U.S. goods to 125% on Friday, hitting back at Donald Trump’s decision to single out the world’s No.2 economy for higher duties, while dismissing the U.S. president’s tariff strategy as “a joke.”
Investors had been waiting to see how Beijing would respond to Trump’s move on Wednesday to effectively raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% while announcing a 90-day pause on duties on dozens of other countries’ goods. The yuan slipped to levels last seen during the global financial crisis on Thursday but rebounded slightly on Friday.
“The U.S. side’s imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, runs counter to basic economic principles and common sense, and is simply an act of unilateral bullying and coercion,” China’s Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The tit-for-tat increases stand to make goods trade between the world’s two largest economies impossible, analysts say, with import duties above around 35% wiping out Chinese exporters’ profit margins and making American offerings in China similarly overly expensive.

Beijing indicated on Friday that this would be the last time it matched the U.S., in the event that Trump takes his tariffs any higher.
“Even if the U.S. continues to impose even higher tariffs, it would no longer have any economic significance and would go down as a joke in the history of world economics,” the Finance Ministry’s statement added.
“If the U.S. continues to play a numbers game with tariffs, China will not respond,” it added. However it left the door open for Beijing to turn to other types of retaliation, reiterating that China would fight the U.S. to the end.
On Thursday, Beijing said it would immediately restrict imports of Hollywood films in response to Trump’s tariff increases. Earlier this week, China focused its sights on U.S. services exports, issuing a travel advisory for citizens visiting the U.S. and an alert for students considering studying in the U.S. state of Ohio.
UBS analysts said in a note that China’s declaration that it would not retaliate in kind against any further tariff increases was “an acknowledgement that trade between the two countries has essentially been completely severed”.
Both sides now tax 100% of each other’s goods, after China increased the percentage of two-way trade it subjects to taxes from 63% on April 9, following the U.S. broadening the scope of its duties from 67% in February.
Average U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports now stand at 135%, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, more than 40 times higher than before the first U.S.-China trade war kicked off in 2018.
SEEKING TO BUILD ALLIANCES
Beijing is seeking to rally trading partners to its cause.
In his first public comments on the tariffs, President Xi Jinping told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing that China and the European Union should “fulfill their international responsibilities… and jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, China’s state news agency Xinhua reported.
Xi begins a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia next week, aiming to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours as trade tension escalates with the United States.
Eric Orlander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, said improved market access in areas like agriculture would likely be on the table when Xi meets his Vietnamese, Malaysian and Cambodian counterparts rather than “big free trade deals”.
“China’s best offer to Vietnam is stability. Don’t underestimate how important that is at a time like this,” Orlander added.
Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has sought to get ahead of U.S. negotiators, holding video calls this week with his counterparts from the EU and Malaysia, which is chairing ASEAN this year, as well as Saudi Arabia and South Africa, by way of reaching out to Gulf countries and the Group of 20 and BRICS nations.
Beijing and Brusselsagreed on Thursday to restart talks on trade relief and to immediately carry out negotiations on electric vehicle price commitments, according to a readout of his meeting with European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic, meaning a truce to a longstanding spat could be forthcoming.
A rapprochement with Europe would take China’s trade war with the West back to a single front — the U.S.
“China remains open to negotiations with the U.S., but threatening and pressuring are not the right way to engage with China,” the country’s Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.

Title: Sensex soars over 1,300 points as Trump suspends tariffs till July 9
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:12:12 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets surged sharply on Thursday, with the Sensex climbing over 1,300 points, after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on trade tariffs for most countries, including India. The move buoyed investor sentiment despite lingering concerns over renewed trade tensions between the US and China.
The Sensex jumped 1,310.11 points, or 1.77%, to close at 75,157.26. During the session, it touched an intra-day high of 75,467.33 and a low of 74,762.84. The broader Nifty 50 index also rallied, gaining 429.40 points, or 1.92%, to settle at 22,828.55.
While the Nifty faced resistance around its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), closing slightly below its intraday peak, analysts remain cautiously optimistic.
“The trend remains bearish unless the index decisively crosses the 23,000 mark, where significant open interest has built up. On the downside, support lies at 22,750 — a breach of which could trigger further weakness,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.
The rally was broad-based, with strong buying across all sectors. The BSE Midcap index rose 1.84%, while the Smallcap index surged 3.04%.
Among sectoral indices, metals led the charge, with the Nifty Metal index gaining over 4%. Energy, pharma, auto, and banking stocks also posted robust gains. Hindalco emerged as the top performer on the Nifty, rising 6.52%, followed by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, and Coal India — all up between 4.4% and 4.8%.
Despite the upbeat mood in Indian markets, Asian equities were mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225, South Korea’s KOSPI, and Singapore’s Straits Times ended in negative territory. The cautious tone followed China’s decision to retaliate against recent US tariff hikes by announcing import duties of up to 125% on select American goods. This comes in response to Trump’s move to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to an effective 145%.
“Despite global volatility, Indian equities cheered the temporary relief in the global trade environment, triggering a rally across market segments,” analysts noted.
Meanwhile, the Indian rupee also traded higher, gaining 0.70 to close at 86.00 against the US dollar. The local currency was supported by a weaker dollar index and improved investor confidence following the US move to relax tariffs on Indian goods by 10% for the next three months.

Title: NSE adds over 2 crore new investor accounts in just 6 months
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:42:20 +0000
Content: The total number of investor accounts on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has surpassed 22 crore this month, marking a sharp rise of over 2 crore accounts in just six months since it crossed the 20-crore mark in October 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the number of unique registered investors stood at 11.3 crore, up from 11 crore on January 20, 2025. It’s important to note that one investor can hold multiple accounts across different brokers, resulting in more than one client code.
Maharashtra continues to lead with the highest number of investor accounts at 3.8 crore, followed by Uttar Pradesh (2.4 crore), Gujarat (1.9 crore), and Rajasthan and West Bengal, with approximately 1.3 crore accounts each. Together, these states account for nearly 49% of all investor accounts, while the top 10 states contribute around 75% of the total.
Over the past five years, the NSE’s benchmark Nifty 50 index has delivered an impressive 22% annualised return, while the Nifty 500 has yielded an even higher return of 25% annually. These gains underscore the wealth creation potential for investors during this period.
Meanwhile, the NSE’s Investor Protection Fund (IPF) grew by over 23% year-on-year, reaching ₹2,459 crore as of March 31, 2025.
“The rapid growth in India’s investor base—with over 2 crore new accounts added in just six months—reflects strong investor confidence in India’s economic trajectory despite global challenges,” said Sriram Krishnan, Chief Business Development Officer, NSE.
He attributed this growth to accelerated digital transformation and the rising popularity of mobile trading platforms, which have made capital markets more accessible to investors across Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities.
Krishnan also pointed to the success of initiatives aimed at deepening retail participation, including widespread financial literacy campaigns and simplified KYC procedures.
According to recently released data, the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rose to ₹410.87 lakh crore ($4.81 trillion) in FY25 (as of March 31), up from ₹384.2 lakh crore ($4.61 trillion) in FY24—an increase of 6.94% year-on-year. The total number of companies listed on the NSE stood at 2,720 as of March 31, 2025.

Title: Impact of tariffs on developing countries could be ‘catastrophic’, says UN trade agency
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:40:43 +0000
Content: Sweeping tariffs on imports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and countermeasures could have a “catastrophic” impact on developing countries, hitting even harder than foreign aid cuts, the director of the United Nations trade agency said on Friday.
Global trade could shrink by 3-7% and global gross domestic product by 0.7%, with developing countries the worst affected, the International Trade Centre said.
“It is huge,” Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the International Trade Centre, told Reuters. “If this escalation between China and the U.S. continues it will result in an 80% reduction in trade between the countries, and the ripple effect of that across the board can be catastrophic.”
Global markets remained in turmoil on Friday. Trump this week announced a 90-day tariff pause on dozens of countries but hiked the duties on Chinese goods to an effective rate of 145%. On Friday, Beijing increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% in a trade war that threatens to up-end global supply chains.
“Tariffs could have a much more harmful impact than the removal of foreign aid,” Coke-Hamilton said, warning that developing economies risk sliding back on the economic gains they made in recent years.
Some of the world’s least developed countries, including Lesotho, Cambodia, Laos, Madagascar and Myanmar, may look to improve regional trade relations to absorb the loss of some of the U.S. market for their exports, the ITC said.
Bangladesh, the world’s second largest apparel exporter, could lose $3.3 billion in annual exports to the U.S. by 2029 if the U.S. tariff of 37% stays after the pause, ITC data found. It may look to European markets as an alternative as they still hold growth potential, Coke-Hamilton suggested.
The projections by the International Trade Centre, the joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, which seeks to help countries develop through exports, are based on data it gathered before Trump’s 90-day pause and subsequent hikes on duties on Chinese imports.

Title: India showcases BioE3 Policy and biorefinery initiatives at Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 in Seoul
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:23:28 +0000
Content: In a significant move to reaffirm its commitment to clean energy innovation, India highlighted its BioE3 Policy and Integrated Biorefinery Mission at the Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 held in Seoul, South Korea from April 9 to 11. The gathering brought together global leaders in clean energy to accelerate collaborative innovation and sustainable solutions.
The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), under the Ministry of Science & Technology, co-leads the Mission Integrated Biorefinery in partnership with the Netherlands, as part of the Mission Innovation (MI) 2.0 framework. The term “Mission Innovation” was originally coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during COP21, alongside former French President François Hollande, underlining India’s pivotal role in advancing global clean energy efforts.
At the Seoul gathering, the Indian delegation, including senior representatives from DBT, engaged in discussions with international stakeholders on advancing biorefinery approaches for sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. A key highlight was the presentation of India’s BioE3 (Biotechnology for Environment, Energy, and Economy) Policy, which was lauded for its role in addressing climate challenges and fostering a low-carbon manufacturing ecosystem.
The BioE3 Policy emphasizes sustainable, low-carbon production through biotechnology, aiming to create an innovation-driven manufacturing landscape. Delegates shared insights on India’s initiatives in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Bioenergy (CCUB) integration for biomanufacturing, furthering dialogue on green technology development.
Focused roundtable discussions and sessions also explored Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) opportunities in biomass-based biomanufacturing. The Indian delegation participated in strategic visits to clean energy facilities, including sessions at Hanyang University and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, organized in coordination with the Indian Embassy in Seoul.
Participants unanimously recognized the potential of bioinnovations to contribute meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts.

Title: Om Birla fulfills promise, attends wedding of martyr’s daughter with ‘Mayra’ ceremony
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:31:55 +0000
Content: In a heartwarming and emotional moment, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla visited the home of Pulwama martyr Hemraj Meena to attend the wedding of the martyr’s daughter, fulfilling a promise he made six years ago. Birla arrived with ‘Mayra’—a traditional wedding custom in Rajasthan where the maternal uncle (mama) brings gifts and blessings to his sister’s home for her daughter’s wedding.
The home of Veerangana Madhubala, widow of martyr Hemraj, was filled with joy and celebration for the first time since her husband’s martyrdom in the 2019 Pulwama attack. The presence of Om Birla as a ‘brother’ figure to Madhubala added a deep emotional layer to the occasion. Birla had promised to stand by the family as a brother during their difficult times and today, he honored that bond by participating in the Mayra ceremony.
Birla had met the family after the martyrdom of CRPF jawan Hemraj and vowed to support them through every phase of life. Since then, Madhubala has tied rakhi and performed brotherly rituals for Birla on Raksha Bandhan and Bhai Dooj each year. His presence at the wedding of her daughter was seen as a reaffirmation of that brotherly relationship.
During the ceremony, Om Birla draped a traditional chunari over Madhubala, symbolizing his support and blessings. In return, she performed the traditional ’tilak’ and ‘aarti’ rituals, marking the sacred bond of brother and sister. Rajasthan Energy Minister and Sangod MLA Heeralal Nagar also accompanied Birla and participated in the rituals.
The event was filled with emotional moments, especially when tributes were paid to martyr Hemraj Meena. Speaker Birla, Madhubala, and the entire family remembered the braveheart with tearful eyes and heavy hearts. Birla also offered floral tributes at the statue of the martyr, emphasizing the nation’s gratitude and respect for the ultimate sacrifice.

Title: Cold winds sweep Beijing, closing key sites, disrupting travel
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:27:41 +0000
Content: China’s capital hunkered down on Saturday as rare typhoon-like gales swept northern regions, forcing the closure of historic sites and disrupting travel while bringing late snowfalls and hailstone showers in some areas.
Windows shook and cars were rocked by gusts of wind driven by a cold vortex from neighbouring Mongolia that sent temperatures plunging more than 12 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit).
The winds, which started on Friday, are set to continue over the weekend, packing gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph), the official Xinhua news agency said. They brought late snowfalls in Inner Mongolia and hailstones in southern China.
Beijing issued its second-highest gale alert this weekend, for the first time in a decade, warning 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel as winds could potentially break April records dating from 1951.
By 11.30 a.m., 838 flights had been cancelled at the capital’s two major airports, the Flight Master tracking app showed, while its historic sights and parks were shut, with some old trees trimmed in preparation for the cold blast.
The winds forced the postponement of a half-marathon set for Sunday featuring humanoid robots competing with humans in a bid to showcase China’s technological advances.
Sandstorms raging over a stretch from Inner Mongolia to the Yangtze River region crippled road travel in eight provinces, Xinhua and state broadcaster CCTV said.
Strong winds bringing sand and dust from Mongolia are routine in spring, but climate change has made weather events more extreme.

Title: Iran, US to start talks in Oman under shadow of regional conflict
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 04:04:56 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States will hold high-level talks in Oman on Saturday aimed at jump-starting negotiations over Tehran’s fast-advancing nuclear programme, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening military action if there is no deal.
Iran is approaching the talks warily, sceptical that they could lead to a deal and suspicious of Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not halt its nuclear programme.
While each side has talked up the chances of some progress, they remain far apart on a dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades and have not agreed on whether the talks will be face-to-face, as Trump demands, or indirect, as Iran wants.
Signs of movement could help cool tensions in a region aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, missile fire between Iran and Israel, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the overthrow of the government in Syria.
However, failure would aggravate fears of a wider conflagration across a region that exports much of the world’s oil. Tehran has cautioned neighbouring countries that have U.S. bases that they would face “severe consequences” if they were involved in any U.S. military attack on Iran.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the Islamic Republic’s complex power structure has the final say on key state matters, has given Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi “full authority” for the talks, an Iranian official told Reuters.
Araqchi is leading the Iranian delegation, while the talks will be handled on the U.S. side by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
“The duration of the talks, that will only be about the nuclear issue, will depend on the U.S. side’s seriousness and goodwill,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Iran has ruled out negotiating its defence capabilities such as its missile programme.
DECADES-LONG DISPUTE
Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is intended for purely civilian purposes but Western countries believe it wants to build an atomic bomb.
They say Iran’s enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel source, has gone far beyond the requirements of a civilian programme and has produced stocks at a level of fissile purity close to those required in warheads.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers in 2018 during his first term, reimposing crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran’s nuclear programme has leaped forward, including by enriching uranium to 60%, a technical step from the levels needed for a bomb.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday he hoped that the talks would lead to peace, adding that “We’ve been very clear what Iran is never going to have a nuclear weapon, and I think that’s what led to this meeting.”
Tehran responded the following day, saying it was giving the United States a “genuine chance” despite what it called Washington’s “prevailing confrontational hoopla”.
Washington’s ally Israel, which regards Iran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has long threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails to curb its nuclear ambitions.
Tehran’s influence throughout the Middle East has been severely curbed, with its regional allies – known as the “Axis of Resistance” – either dismantled or badly hurt since the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza and the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria in December.
The Axis includes not only Hamas but also Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and various Shi’ite armed groups in Iraq and Syria.

Title: Webb telescope documents alien planet’s death plunge into a star
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 03:57:18 +0000
Content: In May 2020, astronomers for the first time observed a planet getting swallowed by its host star. Based on the data at the time, they believed the planet met its doom as the star puffed up late in its lifespan, becoming what is called a red giant.
New observations by the James Webb Space Telescope – sort of a postmortem examination – indicate that the planet’s demise happened differently than initially thought. Instead of the star coming to the planet, it appears the planet came to the star, with disastrous consequences – a death plunge after an erosion of this alien world’s orbit over time, researchers said.
The end was quite dramatic, as evidenced by the aftermath documented by Webb. The orbiting telescope, which was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022, observed hot gas likely forming a ring around the star following the event and an expanding cloud of cooler dust enveloping the scene.
“We do know that there is a good amount of material from the star that gets expelled as the planet goes through its death plunge. The after-the-fact evidence is this dusty leftover material that was ejected from the host star,” said astronomer Ryan Lau of the U.S. National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, lead author of the study published in the Astrophysical Journal.
The star is located in our Milky Way galaxy about 12,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Aquila. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The star is slightly redder and less luminous than our sun and about 70% of its mass.
The planet is believed to have been from a class called “hot Jupiters” – gas giants at high temperatures owing to a tight orbit around their host star.
“We believe it probably had to be a giant planet, at least a few times the mass of Jupiter, to cause as dramatic of a disturbance to the star as what we are seeing,” said study co-author Morgan MacLeod, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Jupiter is our solar system’s largest planet.
The researchers believe that the planet’s orbit had gradually deteriorated due to its gravitational interaction with the star, and hypothesized about what happened next.
“Then it starts grazing through the atmosphere of the star. At that point, the headwind of smashing through the stellar atmosphere takes over and the planet falls increasingly rapidly into the star,” MacLeod said.
“The planet both falls inward and gets stripped of its gaseous outer layers as it plows deeper into the star. Along the way, that smashing heats up and expels stellar gas, which gives rise to the light we see and the gas, dust and molecules that now surround the star,” MacLeod said.
But they cannot be certain of the actual fatal events.
“In this case, we saw how the plunge of the planet affected the star, but we don’t truly know for certain what happened to the planet. In astronomy there are lots of things way too big and way too ‘out there’ to do experiments on. We can’t go to the lab and smash a star and planet together – that would be diabolical. But we can try to reconstruct what happened in computer models,” MacLeod said.
None of our solar system’s planets are close enough to the sun for their orbits to decay, as happened here. That does not mean that the sun will not eventually swallow any of them.
About five billion years from now, the sun is expected to expand outward in its red giant phase and could well engulf the innermost planets Mercury and Venus, and maybe even Earth. During this phase, a star blows off its outer layers, leaving just a core behind – a stellar remnant called a white dwarf.
Webb’s new observations are giving clues about the planetary endgame.
“Our observations hint that maybe planets are more likely to meet their final fates by slowly spiraling in towards their host star instead of the star turning into a red giant to swallow them up. Our solar system seems to be relatively stable though, so we only have to worry about the sun becoming a red giant and swallowing us up,” Lau said.

Title: India-Italy partnership continues to grow and evolve: EAM Jaishankar
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:33:51 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday held “productive discussions” with visiting Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, and Italy’s Minister of University and Research, Anna Maria Bernini, in New Delhi. The talks focused on reviewing and enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC), maritime and security affairs, research, technology, education, and culture.
“Also exchanged views on contemporary global developments, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, and West Asia. Our partnership continues to develop and evolve, guided by the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025-29 agreed by our leadership,” Jaishankar posted on X after the meeting.
This high-level engagement marked an important step forward in implementing the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025–2029, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in November 2024 during the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The Action Plan outlines a shared vision for strengthening the strategic partnership between India and Italy, with a focus on achieving tangible outcomes that will benefit both nations.
“They have directed us to work with our respective industries, as well as with scientific establishments and higher education institutions, to facilitate business collaborations, co-production, innovation, and the exchange of knowledge and talent between our two countries,” said Jaishankar while addressing the India-Italy Business, Science and Technology Forum earlier in the day.
He emphasised that India has been working closely with like-minded partners in recent years to build resilient and trusted partnerships that serve not only economic but also strategic interests.
“For us, Italy ranks high on that list. In many sectors, there is a natural complementarity that we need to leverage. Whether it is energy, transport, food processing, or light engineering, Italy has the technologies and best practices that make collaboration fruitful,” he noted.
Jaishankar also highlighted India’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific and its outreach towards the west.
“Given both geography and strategic engagement, it makes perfect sense to link what Italy is doing in the Mediterranean with what India is undertaking in the Arabian Sea. This alignment offers mutual benefit,” he said.
Referring to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, Jaishankar described it as a landmark initiative launched during India’s G20 Presidency. The corridor, which Italy refers to as the “Cotton Road,” is expected to establish a new global axis for economic activities, energy flow, and communications, with both countries playing key roles.

Title: Dust storm hits Delhi; trees uprooted, weather disruptions reported across North India
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:09:09 +0000
Content: A dust storm swept through several parts of Delhi on Friday evening, uprooting trees and forcing residents to shut windows as strong winds carried dust into homes. The sudden weather change caused disruptions in traffic as fallen trees and branches obstructed roads, while flight operations in northern India were also impacted.
This marks the second consecutive day Delhi has experienced a dust storm.
Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an Orange Alert for thunderstorms, lightning, and hailstorms in four districts of Himachal Pradesh, while Yellow Alerts were issued for four other districts.
According to weather reports, districts including Chamba, Kangra, Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Mandi, Shimla, and Hamirpur witnessed thunderstorms and lightning accompanied by light to moderate rainfall in the past 24 hours. Gohar in Mandi recorded the highest rainfall at 19 mm, followed by Pandokhar in the same district with 14 mm. Other regions received light showers. Hailstorm activity was reported in Banjar (Kullu), Sundernagar (Mandi), and parts of Shimla.
Just days ago, areas such as Sundernagar, Bhuntar, and Dharamshala were reeling under heatwave conditions. However, the recent rainfall has brought much-needed relief, with temperatures dropping by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius, bringing them closer to seasonal norms.
As of Friday, thunderstorm and lightning activity was recorded in Chamba, Kangra, Una, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Solan, and Shimla. Several areas also received light morning rain.
IMD officials expect the weather activity to persist throughout the day, with a high likelihood of hailstorms in Kullu, Mandi, Kangra, and Chamba districts. Thunderstorms and lightning are also expected in these regions.
“Thunderstorms, lightning, and hailstorms are likely in parts of Himachal Pradesh. An Orange Alert has been issued for districts expected to see more intense activity, while Yellow Alerts are in place for regions with moderate weather events. People are advised to remain indoors during severe weather,” said IMD scientist Sandeep Kumar Sharma.

Title: Italy eyes deeper investment ties with India, boost in bilateral trade
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:00:19 +0000
Content: Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, on Friday expressed strong interest in expanding economic cooperation with India. Speaking at the “Italy-India Business, Science and Technology Forum,” Tajani said Italy is keen to invest more in India, increase exports, and encourage greater Indian investments in Italy.
He described India as a vital partner for ensuring stability in the Indo-Pacific region—a key factor in strengthening global trade. “India is an economy with enormous potential, and we are committed to deepening our collaboration,” Tajani said.
Highlighting the robust bilateral relationship, he added, “Italy and India are natural economic partners. Our bilateral trade has surpassed $14 billion, and we want to take this further. This includes expanding our trade, increasing Italian investments in India, and welcoming more Indian investments in Italy.”
He noted that areas such as innovation, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, space technology, and defence present significant opportunities for joint ventures and partnerships between the two nations.
India’s Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, also present at the forum, echoed Tajani’s views. He emphasised that the bilateral trade relationship holds untapped potential and can grow further through seamless cooperation, facilitation of investments, and elimination of barriers to doing business.
Goyal noted that India’s economy is on a trajectory to expand from $4 trillion to $30–35 trillion by 2047. “Our vision of Viksit Bharat makes India a compelling case for deeper engagement with the European Union, particularly with Italy,” he said.
He also pointed to new areas for cooperation, including fashion, luxury goods, food processing, pharmaceuticals, tourism, green technology, advanced manufacturing, and automobiles.
Amidst global uncertainties, Goyal said, the Italy-India partnership offers reassurance and promise. He described the forum as a timely platform to advance the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025–29, launched by Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Giorgia Meloni in November 2024. “It is an ambitious, forward-looking roadmap focused on trade, investment, and innovation,” he said.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar added that the combination of India’s growth trajectory and the technological capabilities of Italian industry creates a strong foundation for collaboration. “Make in India today offers a powerful platform for this partnership to flourish,” he said.

Title: India’s forex reserves surge to $676.3 billion
Publication Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:15:52 +0000
Content: India’s foreign exchange reserves rose sharply by $10.8 billion to reach $676.3 billion in the week ended April 4, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s latest data released on Friday. This marks the fifth straight week of gains in the country’s forex reserves.
A major contributor to this increase was the rise in foreign currency assets, which grew by $9 billion to $574.08 billion. Gold reserves also saw a notable rise of $1.5 billion, bringing the total to $79.36 billion. Additionally, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) climbed by $186 million to $18.36 billion.
In the previous week ending March 28, reserves had already touched a five-month high of $665.4 billion after a $6.6 billion surge.
The recent uptrend comes after a period of decline that was attributed to revaluation losses and the Reserve Bank of India’s interventions in the forex market to reduce rupee volatility. However, the past five weeks have reversed that trend, indicating a stronger external position.
India’s forex reserves had earlier reached an all-time high of $704.89 billion in September 2024.
A healthy forex reserve position not only reflects robust economic fundamentals but also strengthens the rupee against the US dollar. It gives the RBI greater flexibility to intervene in the foreign exchange markets—especially during periods of volatility—by selling dollars to support the domestic currency.
In contrast, a shrinking reserve limits the central bank’s ability to stabilise the rupee in times of stress.
Meanwhile, India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a three-year low of $14.05 billion in February, down from $22.99 billion in January. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the improvement came as exports remained steady while imports declined—signaling resilience in the external sector despite ongoing global economic uncertainties triggered by geopolitical tensions.

Title: Israeli forces have completed encirclement of Gaza’s Rafah, military says
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:51:13 +0000
Content: Israeli forces have completed the encirclement of Gaza’s Rafah, the military said on Saturday, part of an announced plan to seize more areas of the enclave, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
The military has issued repeated evacuation warnings to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across Rafah since it resumed operations in Gaza on March 18, forcing them into a diminishing space limited by the sea.
Israel said on April 2 that troops had begun seizing an area it called the Morag Axis, a reference to a former Israeli settlement once located between the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have since fled Rafah, a 60 square km area that borders Egypt to the south.
“Over the past 24 hours, the 36th Division’s troops completed the establishment of the Morag route, separating Rafah and Khan Younis,” the military said on Saturday.
The Israeli offensive in Gaza was launched after Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
More than 50,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the offensive, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. Most of the population has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
Israel restarted the offensive in March after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January. The campaign will continue, it says, until the remaining 59 hostages are freed and Hamas is stamped out of Gaza.
Hamas says it will free hostages only as part of a deal that will end the war and has rejected demands to lay down its arms. A Hamas delegation was expected in Cairo over the weekend to discuss new truce proposals, according to a source in the group.

Title: Don’t restrict Chhatrapati Shivaji to Maha, every Indian should be taught about him: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:43:41 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj should not be restricted to Maharashtra and every Indian should be taught about the founder of the Maratha empire, who is an ideal of service to the motherland and good governance.
On the death anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Union Minister Shah said: “The story of Shivaji should be taught to every Indian. It should be taught to every child. Do not limit Shivaji Maharaj to Maharashtra. The country and the world are taking inspiration from him.”
He further stated, “The pride of one’s religion, the aspiration of Swarajya and making one’s language immortal are three thoughts that are not connected to the borders of the country, but to the self-respect of human life. When the invaders took power over us, they instilled the mentality of slavery. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj presented these three basic characters of self-respect to the whole world.”
Union Minister Shah said: “Rajmata Jijau instilled good values ​​in the mind of young Shivaji. She also inspired him to restore swaraj, swadharma and language. She gave Shivaji the idea of uniting and liberating the entire country as a child. Jijau Maa Saheb also inspired Shivaji Maharaj to establish Hindavi Swarajya. That is why I am saluting Maa Saheb. It is the responsibility of all of us that every child in India should read Shivaji Charitra and learn from it.”
“I came after many years. I cannot express the feelings in my heart while saluting the throne. The one who created a desire to die for Swadharma, Swarajya. I am standing here and cannot describe this in words,” said the union minister.
“From Attock to Cuttack and Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and other places, the entire country saw the dream of Swarajya becoming a reality,” he said while remembering the great leader.
“A 12-year-old boy took an oath to hoist the saffron flag from Sindhu to Kanyakumari. I have read the biographies of many heroes, but with indomitable willpower, great strategy and uniting all the people of society together to make this strategy successful, they built an undefeated Army. They had nothing in common with the past, heritage, yet they destroyed the Mughal Empire. They went to Cuttack. They went to Bengal. They went to Karnataka in the south. Then people thought that the country would now be independent. The country was saved, the language was saved. Today, after independence, we stand tall in the world,” said the union minister.
“The consciousness created by Shivaji Maharaj became the carrier of ‘Hindavi Swabhiman’ (self-respect). Today, the resolve for Hindvi Swaraj has become so strong that the country can take the resolve that when India completes 100 years of independence, it will be the first in the world,” he remarked.

Title: Soccer-Salman wants AFC to consider awarding 2031 and 2035 Asian Cups at same time
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:05:22 +0000
Content: Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa suggested that the votes for hosting the 2031 and 2035 Asian Cups be held together after confirming a record seven nations had expressed interest in hosting the 2031 finals.
Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and a joint bid from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan informed the regional body of a desire to host the tournament before last month’s deadline.
“I’m delighted to report that the bidding process for the AFC Asian Cup 2031 has received a record level of interest with seven bidders signalling their intent,” Sheikh Salman told the AFC’s annual congress in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
“This remarkable response underscores the bright future of Asian football, and I express my sincere gratitude to all the member associations who have submitted their interest.”
India has never hosted the tournament, which started in Hong Kong in 1956, while South Korea, one of the continent’s strongest on-field performers, last organised the competition in 1960.
None of the Central Asian nations, who gained AFC membership in 1994 following the break up of the Soviet Union, have hosted the finals.
A date has yet to be set to decide the winning bid, and Sheikh Salman wants the confederation to consider also awarding the rights for the 2035 event at the same time.
“I have requested that the AFC administration explore the possibility of presenting both the bids for 2031 and 2035 editions for the approval at the same congress when the time comes,” he said. “This will provide the host member association a longer runway to ensure that we continue to elevate our standards.”
The 24-team Asian Cup is held every four years, with the next edition to be played in Saudi Arabia in 2027.
Qatar hosted the most recent tournament in early 2024, six months later than originally scheduled, due to China’s withdrawal as organisers.

Title: Why does Trump want to make US daylight saving time permanent?
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 09:10:29 +0000
Content: Daylight saving time, a practice affecting almost 400 million people across North America, is once again in the spotlight as debates over its necessity continue. This twice-a-year ritual of adjusting clocks forward in spring and back in autumn has been ingrained in American, Canadian and Cuban life for more than a century. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Congress to make daylight saving time permanent.
WHAT DID TRUMP SAY ABOUT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
Trump’s call to Congress came a day after lawmakers held the first hearing in more than three years on a long-running debate on whether to make daylight saving time permanent or remain on standard time year round.
“The House and Senate should push hard for more daylight at the end of the day,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!”
In 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would make daylight saving time permanent. It stalled in the House of Representatives because lawmakers could not agree on whether to keep standard time or permanent daylight saving time.
Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, could revive the bill or introduce a new one.
WHEN DO THE CLOCKS CHANGE?
Any changes that Trump and the Republicans may enact probably would not take effect immediately.
Daylight saving time in the United States and some other countries is due to end on November 2 at 2 a.m. local time, meaning people will gain an hour of sleep. Mornings will be brighter but it will get darker earlier in the evening. Daylight saving time is scheduled to resume on March 8, 2026. The saying “spring forward, fall back” serves as a helpful reminder for adjusting clocks.
Daylight saving time in the United States always starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
In the UK and other European countries, daylight sav ing time, also known as summer time, begins on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. This year it will end on October 26 and resume on March 29, 2026.
Some countries like Mexico have eliminated or largely eliminated daylight saving time.
WHEN IS THE SHORTEST DAY OF THE YEAR IN 2025?
The shortest day of 2025 will be on December 21, which marks the winter solstice. Daylight hours vary significantly across latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Areas near the North Pole will be plunged into complete darkness while southern regions will still get more than 10 hours of sunshine.
WHY WAS DAYLIGHT SAVING CREATED IN THE US AND HOW DID IT START?
The modern idea of changing the clocks with the seasons can be traced back to at least the late 19th century, when New Zealand entomologist George Hudson proposed it to conserve energy and extend summer daylight hours, something that would have benefited his hobby of collecting insects after work. The idea was slow to gain traction until World War One, when European states sought any strategies to conserve fuel. Germany was the first country to adopt daylight saving time in 1916. The United States followed in 1918.
The practice went through many variations before the United States standardized it in 1966 in a law called the Uniform Time Act, which allows states to opt out of it but not to stay on daylight saving time permanently.
WHY IS DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CONTROVERSIAL?
A common myth is that the United States adopted daylight saving time to benefit farmers, but in reality many farmers are opposed to the practice for being disruptive to their schedules.
The original motivation to conserve fuel is also under debate, as studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the shift, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
Opponents point to other studies that have found adverse health effects linked to daylight saving time, such as a spike in fatal traffic accidents, heart attacks, strokes and sleep deprivation in the days after clocks are moved forward an hour every March.
A March 2023 YouGov poll found that 62% of Americans want to end the practice of changing clocks, though only 50% prefer to keep permanent daylight saving time.
DO ALL US STATES OBSERVE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
No. Hawaii and Arizona, with the exception of its Navajo Nation region, do not observe daylight saving time. The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also observe permanent standard time.
While daylight saving time is widespread across the United States, 18 states have passed legislation to permanently use daylight saving time if Congress were to allow it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Title: European Commission plans emergency measures to combat bird flu in Poland
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:49:19 +0000
Content: The European Commission plans to adopt emergency measures next week to stop the spread of bird flu in two regions of Poland, a spokesperson said on Friday.
There have been 73 confirmed outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Poland in the last two months, with 53 of those in the Masovian and Greater Poland regions.
“Given the large scale of the outbreaks (in those two regions)… it is necessary to adopt additional emergency measures to be applied in those high risk areas, strengthening the prevention and control measures,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
“It is foreseen that the measures will be adopted by the Commission next week. These measures also seek, in taking these prevention steps, to protect the Polish poultry industry more widely.”
The spokesperson did not elaborate on what the emergency measures would involve, but said they had been discussed with national and regional authorities, which had agreed to them.
In an emailed response to Reuters questions, the Polish agriculture ministry said the extraordinary measures would “primarily concern the introduction of a ban on new farms located in the area subject to restrictions until the HPAI epidemic is brought under control”.
“The Polish… authorities are conducting an intensive dialogue with the EC in order to limit the territorial restrictions and obtain derogations for the movement of other products originating from poultry and the activities of poultry hatcheries,” the ministry added.
Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported on Thursday that the European Commission wanted to ban the export of poultry from Poland due to bird flu.
However, Polish Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Siekierski was quoted by state news agency PAP on Friday as saying it was “too early” to talk about such a possibility.

Title: India showcases BioE3 Policy and biorefinery initiatives at Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 in Seoul
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:23:28 +0000
Content: In a significant move to reaffirm its commitment to clean energy innovation, India highlighted its BioE3 Policy and Integrated Biorefinery Mission at the Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 held in Seoul, South Korea from April 9 to 11. The gathering brought together global leaders in clean energy to accelerate collaborative innovation and sustainable solutions.
The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), under the Ministry of Science & Technology, co-leads the Mission Integrated Biorefinery in partnership with the Netherlands, as part of the Mission Innovation (MI) 2.0 framework. The term “Mission Innovation” was originally coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during COP21, alongside former French President François Hollande, underlining India’s pivotal role in advancing global clean energy efforts.
At the Seoul gathering, the Indian delegation, including senior representatives from DBT, engaged in discussions with international stakeholders on advancing biorefinery approaches for sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. A key highlight was the presentation of India’s BioE3 (Biotechnology for Environment, Energy, and Economy) Policy, which was lauded for its role in addressing climate challenges and fostering a low-carbon manufacturing ecosystem.
The BioE3 Policy emphasizes sustainable, low-carbon production through biotechnology, aiming to create an innovation-driven manufacturing landscape. Delegates shared insights on India’s initiatives in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Bioenergy (CCUB) integration for biomanufacturing, furthering dialogue on green technology development.
Focused roundtable discussions and sessions also explored Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) opportunities in biomass-based biomanufacturing. The Indian delegation participated in strategic visits to clean energy facilities, including sessions at Hanyang University and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, organized in coordination with the Indian Embassy in Seoul.
Participants unanimously recognized the potential of bioinnovations to contribute meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts.

Title: Om Birla fulfills promise, attends wedding of martyr’s daughter with ‘Mayra’ ceremony
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:31:55 +0000
Content: In a heartwarming and emotional moment, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla visited the home of Pulwama martyr Hemraj Meena to attend the wedding of the martyr’s daughter, fulfilling a promise he made six years ago. Birla arrived with ‘Mayra’—a traditional wedding custom in Rajasthan where the maternal uncle (mama) brings gifts and blessings to his sister’s home for her daughter’s wedding.
The home of Veerangana Madhubala, widow of martyr Hemraj, was filled with joy and celebration for the first time since her husband’s martyrdom in the 2019 Pulwama attack. The presence of Om Birla as a ‘brother’ figure to Madhubala added a deep emotional layer to the occasion. Birla had promised to stand by the family as a brother during their difficult times and today, he honored that bond by participating in the Mayra ceremony.
Birla had met the family after the martyrdom of CRPF jawan Hemraj and vowed to support them through every phase of life. Since then, Madhubala has tied rakhi and performed brotherly rituals for Birla on Raksha Bandhan and Bhai Dooj each year. His presence at the wedding of her daughter was seen as a reaffirmation of that brotherly relationship.
During the ceremony, Om Birla draped a traditional chunari over Madhubala, symbolizing his support and blessings. In return, she performed the traditional ’tilak’ and ‘aarti’ rituals, marking the sacred bond of brother and sister. Rajasthan Energy Minister and Sangod MLA Heeralal Nagar also accompanied Birla and participated in the rituals.
The event was filled with emotional moments, especially when tributes were paid to martyr Hemraj Meena. Speaker Birla, Madhubala, and the entire family remembered the braveheart with tearful eyes and heavy hearts. Birla also offered floral tributes at the statue of the martyr, emphasizing the nation’s gratitude and respect for the ultimate sacrifice.

Title: Cold winds sweep Beijing, closing key sites, disrupting travel
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:27:41 +0000
Content: China’s capital hunkered down on Saturday as rare typhoon-like gales swept northern regions, forcing the closure of historic sites and disrupting travel while bringing late snowfalls and hailstone showers in some areas.
Windows shook and cars were rocked by gusts of wind driven by a cold vortex from neighbouring Mongolia that sent temperatures plunging more than 12 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit).
The winds, which started on Friday, are set to continue over the weekend, packing gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph), the official Xinhua news agency said. They brought late snowfalls in Inner Mongolia and hailstones in southern China.
Beijing issued its second-highest gale alert this weekend, for the first time in a decade, warning 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel as winds could potentially break April records dating from 1951.
By 11.30 a.m., 838 flights had been cancelled at the capital’s two major airports, the Flight Master tracking app showed, while its historic sights and parks were shut, with some old trees trimmed in preparation for the cold blast.
The winds forced the postponement of a half-marathon set for Sunday featuring humanoid robots competing with humans in a bid to showcase China’s technological advances.
Sandstorms raging over a stretch from Inner Mongolia to the Yangtze River region crippled road travel in eight provinces, Xinhua and state broadcaster CCTV said.
Strong winds bringing sand and dust from Mongolia are routine in spring, but climate change has made weather events more extreme.

Title: Iran, US to start talks in Oman under shadow of regional conflict
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 04:04:56 +0000
Content: Iran and the United States will hold high-level talks in Oman on Saturday aimed at jump-starting negotiations over Tehran’s fast-advancing nuclear programme, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening military action if there is no deal.
Iran is approaching the talks warily, sceptical that they could lead to a deal and suspicious of Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not halt its nuclear programme.
While each side has talked up the chances of some progress, they remain far apart on a dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades and have not agreed on whether the talks will be face-to-face, as Trump demands, or indirect, as Iran wants.
Signs of movement could help cool tensions in a region aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, missile fire between Iran and Israel, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the overthrow of the government in Syria.
However, failure would aggravate fears of a wider conflagration across a region that exports much of the world’s oil. Tehran has cautioned neighbouring countries that have U.S. bases that they would face “severe consequences” if they were involved in any U.S. military attack on Iran.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the Islamic Republic’s complex power structure has the final say on key state matters, has given Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi “full authority” for the talks, an Iranian official told Reuters.
Araqchi is leading the Iranian delegation, while the talks will be handled on the U.S. side by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
“The duration of the talks, that will only be about the nuclear issue, will depend on the U.S. side’s seriousness and goodwill,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Iran has ruled out negotiating its defence capabilities such as its missile programme.
DECADES-LONG DISPUTE
Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is intended for purely civilian purposes but Western countries believe it wants to build an atomic bomb.
They say Iran’s enrichment of uranium, a nuclear fuel source, has gone far beyond the requirements of a civilian programme and has produced stocks at a level of fissile purity close to those required in warheads.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers in 2018 during his first term, reimposing crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Since then, Iran’s nuclear programme has leaped forward, including by enriching uranium to 60%, a technical step from the levels needed for a bomb.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday he hoped that the talks would lead to peace, adding that “We’ve been very clear what Iran is never going to have a nuclear weapon, and I think that’s what led to this meeting.”
Tehran responded the following day, saying it was giving the United States a “genuine chance” despite what it called Washington’s “prevailing confrontational hoopla”.
Washington’s ally Israel, which regards Iran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has long threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails to curb its nuclear ambitions.
Tehran’s influence throughout the Middle East has been severely curbed, with its regional allies – known as the “Axis of Resistance” – either dismantled or badly hurt since the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza and the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria in December.
The Axis includes not only Hamas but also Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and various Shi’ite armed groups in Iraq and Syria.

Title: Global Justice, Love & Peace Summit opens in Dubai with historic assembly of Nobel Laureates
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 14:08:55 +0000
Content: The Global Justice, Love & Peace Summit opened today at Expo City Dubai, marking what organizers describe as the world’s largest peace conference. Twelve Nobel Peace Prize laureates shared a single stage, joined by global leaders, policymakers, activists, and cultural figures in a show of unity aimed at fostering dialogue and cooperation.
The two-day event, themed “One Planet, One Voice: Global Justice, Love and Peace,” began with a series of high-level panel discussions and keynote speeches addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing the world today. Former President of Poland and Nobel laureate Lech Wałęsa called for a new world order rooted in shared human values. “We stand at a critical juncture where dialogue must prevail over division,” he said. “Our discussions here lay the groundwork for a more just international framework.”
Participants included royalty, heads of state, chief justices, business leaders, religious figures, and peace advocates from across continents. Dr. Huzaifa Khorakiwala, Chairman of the World Peacekeepers Movement and chief organizer of the summit, noted the scale of participation as evidence of growing global momentum for peace. “The energy in the room today reflects a genuine desire for transformative change,” he said. “We are witnessing the power of collective wisdom as these diverse voices converge around our shared humanity.”
Among the key sessions on the first day was “Building Blocks of Peace & Justice,” which focused on mutual respect as a foundation for a just and harmonious world. Moderated byParalympian Dr. Deepa Malik, the panel included Habil Khorakiwala of India’s Wockhardt Group, Ekaterina Zagladina of Russia’s World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates Secretariat, philanthropist Kawaljeet Singh Chabra, and artist-humanitarian Sacha Jafri.
In a subsequent session titled “Leading with Love,” speakers explored whether love could be a guiding principle for governance and justice. South African actress and humanitarian Hlubi Mboya-Arnold moderated the discussion featuring Mishal Hamed Kanoo, Chairman of the Kanoo Group; Nadir Godrej, Chairman of Godrej Industries; and Dr. Rahul Vishwanath Karad of MIT World Peace University.
Environmental stewardship was the focus of the afternoon’s final session, “Beloved Mother Earth, Our Home,” moderated by former Mauritian President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. The panel emphasized the connection between ecological sustainability and lasting peace. Panelists included Judge Mohamed Abd-Salam of Egypt, Dr. Sara Al Madani of the UAE, Buddhist leader Dr. Thich Nhat Tu of Vietnam, and General Bikram Singh, former Chief of the Indian Army.
The summit continues on Sunday with the highly anticipated Nobel Peace Laureates Session, during which all 12 laureates will present frameworks for non-violence, truth, and universal justice. The event will conclude with the unveiling of the “Peace Charter: Love Letter to Humanity,” a document intended to provide guiding principles for global equity, dignity, and sustainability.

Title: Argentina seals $20 billion IMF deal, tears down currency controls
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:57:57 +0000
Content: Argentina sealed a $20 billion, 48-month Extended Fund Facility deal with the International Monetary Fund on Friday and, in a major policy move ahead of the deal, dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso.
The IMF will disburse $12 billion by next Tuesday, while another $2 billion will become available by June.
The deal is expected to help Argentina “catalyze additional official multilateral and bilateral support, and a timely re-access to international capital markets,” the IMF said.
“Key pillars of the program include maintaining a strong fiscal anchor, transitioning towards a more robust monetary and FX regime, with greater exchange rate flexibility,” it added in a statement.
Earlier, the South American nation’s central bank announced it would undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso ARS= freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
Argentina will eliminate major parts of the so-called “cepo” capital controls that have restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.
Companies, from this year, will also be able to repatriate profits out of the country, a key demand from businesses that could unlock more investment.
“As of Monday, we will be able to put an end to the foreign exchange restrictions which were imposed in 2019 and which limit the normal functioning of the economy,” Economy Ministry Luis Caputo said at a press conference.
Libertarian President Javier Milei addressed the nation in a televised speech on Friday night and stated that Argentina was “in a better position than ever to withstand external turbulences.”
However, an IMF staff report on the $20 billion deal warned that “downside risks remain elevated,” as program implementation could be challenged by rising global trade tensions and, domestically, by the volatility added by the upcoming electoral cycle and fragile social conditions.
‘THIS IS A DEVALUATION’
The new exchange rate system could allow the peso to weaken almost a third if the currency were to hit the weaker edge of the band, although the central bank is likely to have some tools to intervene. The band will expand 1% each month, the bank said.
The policy move came ahead of the final IMF nod for what is the 23rd program in a long and mottled history between the grains-producing nation and the Washington-based lender.
Funds from the IMF deal will be used to recapitalize Argentina’s central bank and the government expects they will help usher in a healthier currency, reduce inflation and allow for tax cuts, Caputo said.
Other multi-year disbursements were also announced, including $12 billion from the World Bank and $10 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank.
Argentina needs the financial firepower to bolster depleted foreign currency reserves that are in the red on a net basis and have been falling in recent weeks, amid sticky inflation and a country risk index that has started to rise again.
The funds are also key to unlocking the currency controls, which will likely prompt a period of local market volatility already stirred up by the international tariff war between the United States and its trade partners.
“This is a devaluation, which rather goes against what the government would have intended to calmly get to elections,” said economist Ricardo Delgado, referring to midterm legislative elections later in the year.
“It’s a bit surprising that at this time of global volatility, the controls are being lifted,” he added.

Title: Israeli forces have completed encirclement of Gaza’s Rafah, military says
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:51:13 +0000
Content: Israeli forces have completed the encirclement of Gaza’s Rafah, the military said on Saturday, part of an announced plan to seize more areas of the enclave, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.
The military has issued repeated evacuation warnings to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across Rafah since it resumed operations in Gaza on March 18, forcing them into a diminishing space limited by the sea.
Israel said on April 2 that troops had begun seizing an area it called the Morag Axis, a reference to a former Israeli settlement once located between the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have since fled Rafah, a 60 square km area that borders Egypt to the south.
“Over the past 24 hours, the 36th Division’s troops completed the establishment of the Morag route, separating Rafah and Khan Younis,” the military said on Saturday.
The Israeli offensive in Gaza was launched after Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
More than 50,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the offensive, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. Most of the population has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
Israel restarted the offensive in March after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January. The campaign will continue, it says, until the remaining 59 hostages are freed and Hamas is stamped out of Gaza.
Hamas says it will free hostages only as part of a deal that will end the war and has rejected demands to lay down its arms. A Hamas delegation was expected in Cairo over the weekend to discuss new truce proposals, according to a source in the group.

Title: Don’t restrict Chhatrapati Shivaji to Maha, every Indian should be taught about him: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:43:41 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj should not be restricted to Maharashtra and every Indian should be taught about the founder of the Maratha empire, who is an ideal of service to the motherland and good governance.
On the death anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Union Minister Shah said: “The story of Shivaji should be taught to every Indian. It should be taught to every child. Do not limit Shivaji Maharaj to Maharashtra. The country and the world are taking inspiration from him.”
He further stated, “The pride of one’s religion, the aspiration of Swarajya and making one’s language immortal are three thoughts that are not connected to the borders of the country, but to the self-respect of human life. When the invaders took power over us, they instilled the mentality of slavery. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj presented these three basic characters of self-respect to the whole world.”
Union Minister Shah said: “Rajmata Jijau instilled good values ​​in the mind of young Shivaji. She also inspired him to restore swaraj, swadharma and language. She gave Shivaji the idea of uniting and liberating the entire country as a child. Jijau Maa Saheb also inspired Shivaji Maharaj to establish Hindavi Swarajya. That is why I am saluting Maa Saheb. It is the responsibility of all of us that every child in India should read Shivaji Charitra and learn from it.”
“I came after many years. I cannot express the feelings in my heart while saluting the throne. The one who created a desire to die for Swadharma, Swarajya. I am standing here and cannot describe this in words,” said the union minister.
“From Attock to Cuttack and Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and other places, the entire country saw the dream of Swarajya becoming a reality,” he said while remembering the great leader.
“A 12-year-old boy took an oath to hoist the saffron flag from Sindhu to Kanyakumari. I have read the biographies of many heroes, but with indomitable willpower, great strategy and uniting all the people of society together to make this strategy successful, they built an undefeated Army. They had nothing in common with the past, heritage, yet they destroyed the Mughal Empire. They went to Cuttack. They went to Bengal. They went to Karnataka in the south. Then people thought that the country would now be independent. The country was saved, the language was saved. Today, after independence, we stand tall in the world,” said the union minister.
“The consciousness created by Shivaji Maharaj became the carrier of ‘Hindavi Swabhiman’ (self-respect). Today, the resolve for Hindvi Swaraj has become so strong that the country can take the resolve that when India completes 100 years of independence, it will be the first in the world,” he remarked.

Title: Soccer-Salman wants AFC to consider awarding 2031 and 2035 Asian Cups at same time
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:05:22 +0000
Content: Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa suggested that the votes for hosting the 2031 and 2035 Asian Cups be held together after confirming a record seven nations had expressed interest in hosting the 2031 finals.
Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and a joint bid from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan informed the regional body of a desire to host the tournament before last month’s deadline.
“I’m delighted to report that the bidding process for the AFC Asian Cup 2031 has received a record level of interest with seven bidders signalling their intent,” Sheikh Salman told the AFC’s annual congress in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
“This remarkable response underscores the bright future of Asian football, and I express my sincere gratitude to all the member associations who have submitted their interest.”
India has never hosted the tournament, which started in Hong Kong in 1956, while South Korea, one of the continent’s strongest on-field performers, last organised the competition in 1960.
None of the Central Asian nations, who gained AFC membership in 1994 following the break up of the Soviet Union, have hosted the finals.
A date has yet to be set to decide the winning bid, and Sheikh Salman wants the confederation to consider also awarding the rights for the 2035 event at the same time.
“I have requested that the AFC administration explore the possibility of presenting both the bids for 2031 and 2035 editions for the approval at the same congress when the time comes,” he said. “This will provide the host member association a longer runway to ensure that we continue to elevate our standards.”
The 24-team Asian Cup is held every four years, with the next edition to be played in Saudi Arabia in 2027.
Qatar hosted the most recent tournament in early 2024, six months later than originally scheduled, due to China’s withdrawal as organisers.

Title: Why does Trump want to make US daylight saving time permanent?
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 09:10:29 +0000
Content: Daylight saving time, a practice affecting almost 400 million people across North America, is once again in the spotlight as debates over its necessity continue. This twice-a-year ritual of adjusting clocks forward in spring and back in autumn has been ingrained in American, Canadian and Cuban life for more than a century. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Congress to make daylight saving time permanent.
WHAT DID TRUMP SAY ABOUT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
Trump’s call to Congress came a day after lawmakers held the first hearing in more than three years on a long-running debate on whether to make daylight saving time permanent or remain on standard time year round.
“The House and Senate should push hard for more daylight at the end of the day,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!”
In 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would make daylight saving time permanent. It stalled in the House of Representatives because lawmakers could not agree on whether to keep standard time or permanent daylight saving time.
Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, could revive the bill or introduce a new one.
WHEN DO THE CLOCKS CHANGE?
Any changes that Trump and the Republicans may enact probably would not take effect immediately.
Daylight saving time in the United States and some other countries is due to end on November 2 at 2 a.m. local time, meaning people will gain an hour of sleep. Mornings will be brighter but it will get darker earlier in the evening. Daylight saving time is scheduled to resume on March 8, 2026. The saying “spring forward, fall back” serves as a helpful reminder for adjusting clocks.
Daylight saving time in the United States always starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.
In the UK and other European countries, daylight sav ing time, also known as summer time, begins on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. This year it will end on October 26 and resume on March 29, 2026.
Some countries like Mexico have eliminated or largely eliminated daylight saving time.
WHEN IS THE SHORTEST DAY OF THE YEAR IN 2025?
The shortest day of 2025 will be on December 21, which marks the winter solstice. Daylight hours vary significantly across latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Areas near the North Pole will be plunged into complete darkness while southern regions will still get more than 10 hours of sunshine.
WHY WAS DAYLIGHT SAVING CREATED IN THE US AND HOW DID IT START?
The modern idea of changing the clocks with the seasons can be traced back to at least the late 19th century, when New Zealand entomologist George Hudson proposed it to conserve energy and extend summer daylight hours, something that would have benefited his hobby of collecting insects after work. The idea was slow to gain traction until World War One, when European states sought any strategies to conserve fuel. Germany was the first country to adopt daylight saving time in 1916. The United States followed in 1918.
The practice went through many variations before the United States standardized it in 1966 in a law called the Uniform Time Act, which allows states to opt out of it but not to stay on daylight saving time permanently.
WHY IS DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CONTROVERSIAL?
A common myth is that the United States adopted daylight saving time to benefit farmers, but in reality many farmers are opposed to the practice for being disruptive to their schedules.
The original motivation to conserve fuel is also under debate, as studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the shift, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
Opponents point to other studies that have found adverse health effects linked to daylight saving time, such as a spike in fatal traffic accidents, heart attacks, strokes and sleep deprivation in the days after clocks are moved forward an hour every March.
A March 2023 YouGov poll found that 62% of Americans want to end the practice of changing clocks, though only 50% prefer to keep permanent daylight saving time.
DO ALL US STATES OBSERVE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME?
No. Hawaii and Arizona, with the exception of its Navajo Nation region, do not observe daylight saving time. The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also observe permanent standard time.
While daylight saving time is widespread across the United States, 18 states have passed legislation to permanently use daylight saving time if Congress were to allow it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Title: European Commission plans emergency measures to combat bird flu in Poland
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:49:19 +0000
Content: The European Commission plans to adopt emergency measures next week to stop the spread of bird flu in two regions of Poland, a spokesperson said on Friday.
There have been 73 confirmed outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Poland in the last two months, with 53 of those in the Masovian and Greater Poland regions.
“Given the large scale of the outbreaks (in those two regions)… it is necessary to adopt additional emergency measures to be applied in those high risk areas, strengthening the prevention and control measures,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
“It is foreseen that the measures will be adopted by the Commission next week. These measures also seek, in taking these prevention steps, to protect the Polish poultry industry more widely.”
The spokesperson did not elaborate on what the emergency measures would involve, but said they had been discussed with national and regional authorities, which had agreed to them.
In an emailed response to Reuters questions, the Polish agriculture ministry said the extraordinary measures would “primarily concern the introduction of a ban on new farms located in the area subject to restrictions until the HPAI epidemic is brought under control”.
“The Polish… authorities are conducting an intensive dialogue with the EC in order to limit the territorial restrictions and obtain derogations for the movement of other products originating from poultry and the activities of poultry hatcheries,” the ministry added.
Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported on Thursday that the European Commission wanted to ban the export of poultry from Poland due to bird flu.
However, Polish Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Siekierski was quoted by state news agency PAP on Friday as saying it was “too early” to talk about such a possibility.

Title: India showcases BioE3 Policy and biorefinery initiatives at Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 in Seoul
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:23:28 +0000
Content: In a significant move to reaffirm its commitment to clean energy innovation, India highlighted its BioE3 Policy and Integrated Biorefinery Mission at the Mission Innovation Annual Gathering 2025 held in Seoul, South Korea from April 9 to 11. The gathering brought together global leaders in clean energy to accelerate collaborative innovation and sustainable solutions.
The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), under the Ministry of Science & Technology, co-leads the Mission Integrated Biorefinery in partnership with the Netherlands, as part of the Mission Innovation (MI) 2.0 framework. The term “Mission Innovation” was originally coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during COP21, alongside former French President François Hollande, underlining India’s pivotal role in advancing global clean energy efforts.
At the Seoul gathering, the Indian delegation, including senior representatives from DBT, engaged in discussions with international stakeholders on advancing biorefinery approaches for sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. A key highlight was the presentation of India’s BioE3 (Biotechnology for Environment, Energy, and Economy) Policy, which was lauded for its role in addressing climate challenges and fostering a low-carbon manufacturing ecosystem.
The BioE3 Policy emphasizes sustainable, low-carbon production through biotechnology, aiming to create an innovation-driven manufacturing landscape. Delegates shared insights on India’s initiatives in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Bioenergy (CCUB) integration for biomanufacturing, furthering dialogue on green technology development.
Focused roundtable discussions and sessions also explored Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) opportunities in biomass-based biomanufacturing. The Indian delegation participated in strategic visits to clean energy facilities, including sessions at Hanyang University and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, organized in coordination with the Indian Embassy in Seoul.
Participants unanimously recognized the potential of bioinnovations to contribute meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts.

Title: Om Birla fulfills promise, attends wedding of martyr’s daughter with ‘Mayra’ ceremony
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:31:55 +0000
Content: In a heartwarming and emotional moment, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla visited the home of Pulwama martyr Hemraj Meena to attend the wedding of the martyr’s daughter, fulfilling a promise he made six years ago. Birla arrived with ‘Mayra’—a traditional wedding custom in Rajasthan where the maternal uncle (mama) brings gifts and blessings to his sister’s home for her daughter’s wedding.
The home of Veerangana Madhubala, widow of martyr Hemraj, was filled with joy and celebration for the first time since her husband’s martyrdom in the 2019 Pulwama attack. The presence of Om Birla as a ‘brother’ figure to Madhubala added a deep emotional layer to the occasion. Birla had promised to stand by the family as a brother during their difficult times and today, he honored that bond by participating in the Mayra ceremony.
Birla had met the family after the martyrdom of CRPF jawan Hemraj and vowed to support them through every phase of life. Since then, Madhubala has tied rakhi and performed brotherly rituals for Birla on Raksha Bandhan and Bhai Dooj each year. His presence at the wedding of her daughter was seen as a reaffirmation of that brotherly relationship.
During the ceremony, Om Birla draped a traditional chunari over Madhubala, symbolizing his support and blessings. In return, she performed the traditional ’tilak’ and ‘aarti’ rituals, marking the sacred bond of brother and sister. Rajasthan Energy Minister and Sangod MLA Heeralal Nagar also accompanied Birla and participated in the rituals.
The event was filled with emotional moments, especially when tributes were paid to martyr Hemraj Meena. Speaker Birla, Madhubala, and the entire family remembered the braveheart with tearful eyes and heavy hearts. Birla also offered floral tributes at the statue of the martyr, emphasizing the nation’s gratitude and respect for the ultimate sacrifice.

Title: Cold winds sweep Beijing, closing key sites, disrupting travel
Publication Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 05:27:41 +0000
Content: China’s capital hunkered down on Saturday as rare typhoon-like gales swept northern regions, forcing the closure of historic sites and disrupting travel while bringing late snowfalls and hailstone showers in some areas.
Windows shook and cars were rocked by gusts of wind driven by a cold vortex from neighbouring Mongolia that sent temperatures plunging more than 12 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit).
The winds, which started on Friday, are set to continue over the weekend, packing gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph), the official Xinhua news agency said. They brought late snowfalls in Inner Mongolia and hailstones in southern China.
Beijing issued its second-highest gale alert this weekend, for the first time in a decade, warning 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel as winds could potentially break April records dating from 1951.
By 11.30 a.m., 838 flights had been cancelled at the capital’s two major airports, the Flight Master tracking app showed, while its historic sights and parks were shut, with some old trees trimmed in preparation for the cold blast.
The winds forced the postponement of a half-marathon set for Sunday featuring humanoid robots competing with humans in a bid to showcase China’s technological advances.
Sandstorms raging over a stretch from Inner Mongolia to the Yangtze River region crippled road travel in eight provinces, Xinhua and state broadcaster CCTV said.
Strong winds bringing sand and dust from Mongolia are routine in spring, but climate change has made weather events more extreme.
