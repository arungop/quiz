Title: Rain likely in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR; cold wave to follow from Dec 9: IMD
Publication Date: Sun, 08 Dec 2024 12:40:41 +0000
Content: A western disturbance over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas is expected to bring light to isolated rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR over the next two days, starting Sunday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).  
 
In its latest forecast on Sunday, the IMD also predicted a cold wave across most of Northern India beginning December 9.  
 
Speaking to ANI about the weather conditions in North India and Delhi-NCR, IMD scientist Naresh Kumar stated that temperatures in Delhi-NCR will drop after December 9.  
“A western disturbance persists over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas. Light to moderate rain is expected in the Himalayas today and tomorrow. Light rain is also expected in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi,” Kumar said.  
 
“Temperatures may rise slightly in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR on December 8 and 9. However, after December 9, temperatures will decrease, and cold wave conditions may develop. The cold wave will initially affect Rajasthan, followed by Punjab and Haryana,” he added.  
 
According to an IMD release, cold wave conditions are anticipated in West Rajasthan from December 9 to December 14, while Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, and West Uttar Pradesh are likely to experience cold wave conditions starting December 11. The IMD defines cold wave conditions as a significant drop in temperature compared to the normal climatological values for a given location.  
 
Meanwhile, Delhi residents sought refuge in night shelters set up by the Delhi government amid the inclement weather on Saturday night. Shelters have been established at various locations in the national capital, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin Flyover.  
 
Delhi’s air quality also worsened, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) falling to the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday. The AQI was recorded at 302 at 4 pm.  
 
Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court permitted the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to relax GRAP Stage IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR, downgrading them to GRAP Stage II due to improved air quality. However, GRAP Stages II and I will continue to remain in effect across the region.

Title: RBI hikes interest rates on NRI foreign currency deposits
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:22:03 +0000
Content: The RBI on Friday increased the interest rate ceilings on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank deposits or FCNR (B) deposits which will enable NRIs to earn more on their savings.
The move is aimed at attracting more foreign capital at a time when the Indian rupee has come under pressure as foreign investors have been pulling money out of the Indian stock markets resulting in hot money outflows.
FCNR(B) deposits are accounts where Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can hold their earnings in foreign currencies like USD or GBP, protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations.
“In order to attract more capital inflows, RBI has decided to increase the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) deposits. Accordingly, with effect from today (December 6, 2024), banks are permitted to raise fresh FCNR(B) deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity at rates not exceeding ARR plus 400 bps and deposits with maturity between 3 to 5 years at rates not exceeding ARR plus 500 bps. This relaxation will be available till March 31, 2025,” an RBI statement said.
Until now, interest rates on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank (FCNR(B)) deposits were subject to ceilings of Overnight Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) for the respective currency/swap, plus 250 basis points for deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity and overnight ARR plus 350 basis points for deposits of 3 years and above and up to 5 years maturity, according to an RBI statement.
Banks have now been allowed to offer higher interest across the tenors.
The RBI has also decided to move ahead with the introduction of the Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR), a benchmark based on the secured money markets.
Financial Benchmarks India Ltd (FBIL) is being requested to take the proposal forward.
The proposal is being taken up in line with the recommendation of the RBI’s Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark.
The Reserve Bank had set up the Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark headed by Ramanathan Subramanian to review the rupee interest rate benchmarks in the country, especially the usage of Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), and to examine the need for transition to new benchmarks. The Committee recommended several important measures to further develop the interest rate derivative market and improve the credibility of interest rate benchmarks. The Report of the Committee was published on the RBI’s website inviting comments from members of the public. The Reserve Bank has examined the recommendations of the Committee as well as the feedback received.
“The other recommendations of the Committee are under consideration,” the RBI statement said.

Title: Turkey, Iran and Russia to meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss Syria, Turkish source says
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:05:17 +0000
Content: The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Russia will meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss a lightning rebel advance in Syria, a Turkish diplomatic source said on Friday.
Syrian rebels have made their biggest battlefield gains since the civil war began 13 years ago, striking a devastating blow to President Bashar al-Assad.
After years of being locked behind frozen frontlines, the rebels captured the main northern city of Aleppo last week before pushing as far south as the centre of Hama, taking the strategic central city for the first time.
Turkey, Russia and Iran have regularly held talks on Syria’s future in a trilateral format as part of what is known as the Astana peace process. While NATO member Turkey backs the political and armed opposition, Russia and Iran support Assad.
The source said the three ministers were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Saturday within the framework of the Astana process, but did not provide further information.
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking alongside Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi after their talks in Ankara, said that a new effort would be made to revive the Astana process.
Since the start of the renewed conflict, Ankara has called on Assad to engage with the Syrian people for a political solution. It has denied any involvement in the rebels’ operation and said it did not want to see a new migrant wave heading toward its borders.

Title: FII selling slows in November 2024 as Indian markets stabilize after October fall: report
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 09:43:17 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows from Indian markets saw a significant reduction in November 2024, following a steep market correction in October. The Nifty 50 index had experienced a sharp 6 percent decline in October, closing 8 percent lower than its all-time highs. According to a report by JM Financials, this slowdown in FII selling indicates a stabilization in Indian markets.
November proved to be a calmer month for trading, with the benchmark index largely remaining flat. FII activity reflected this stabilization, as the intense selling pressure of October subsided significantly.
FII outflows dropped to Rs 182 billion (USD 2.2 billion) in November, a stark decline from Rs 919 billion (USD 10.9 billion) in October. The month was marked by a significant shift in investor sentiment, with a “tale of two halves.” During the first half of November, FIIs remained net sellers, with outflows of Rs 195 billion (USD 2.3 billion), but by the second half, they turned net buyers, bringing in Rs 13 billion (USD 159 million).
This shift was reinforced in the last seven days of the month, with FIIs recording net inflows of Rs 52.6 billion (USD 619 million).
Sector-wise, FII flows exhibited notable variations. The Oil and Gas sector saw the largest outflows for the second consecutive month, at USD 1.6 billion, followed by the Auto sector with USD 884 million in outflows. Telecom (USD 601 million) and FMCG (USD 167 million) also faced significant selling activity.
In contrast, sectors like Information Technology (IT), Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), and Realty attracted considerable inflows. IT led with inflows of USD 653 million, followed by BFSI at USD 296 million and Realty at USD 244 million. These inflows highlight investor interest in sectors perceived to offer resilience or growth potential.
FII shareholding in Indian equities inched up slightly to 16.1 percent in November 2024, from 16 percent in October, which marked the lowest level in 12 years. However, this figure remains lower year-on-year compared to 16.8 percent in November 2023. FII Equity Assets under Custody (AUC) also showed an improvement, rising to Rs 71.9 trillion at the end of November from Rs 71.1 trillion in October, signaling renewed investor confidence in the Indian market.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis sworn in as Maharashtra Chief Minister
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 13:15:23 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in a grand ceremony held at Azad Maidan, Mumbai. Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath of office to Fadnavis, marking the beginning of his historic new term.
The event was attended by a host of prominent leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Chief Ministers from several states, such as Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Bhupendra Patel (Gujarat), and Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand), also witnessed the occasion.
Adding a touch of glamour to the ceremony, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, and Madhuri Dixit were present to celebrate the political milestone.
Fadnavis, born on July 22, 1970, in Nagpur, comes from a middle-class family. He holds degrees in law, business management, and project management, which have contributed to his astute political acumen. His political journey began in 1992 when he was elected as a councillor in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, a position he held for two consecutive terms before advancing to serve as an MLA for five terms.
From 2014 to 2019, Fadnavis served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, becoming the second-youngest to hold the position after Sharad Pawar. During his tenure, he oversaw major projects, including the Samruddhi Expressway, the Police Digitisation Project, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Scheme, which bolstered the state’s infrastructure and welfare initiatives.
Fadnavis briefly held the Chief Minister’s position during the political turmoil in 2019 when the Shiv Sena broke its alliance with the BJP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government with the Congress and NCP.
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Elections, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a resounding victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while its allies, the Shiv Sena and NCP, secured 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
The MVA alliance suffered a significant defeat, with Congress managing only 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20, and the Sharad Pawar faction of the NCP winning just 10 seats.

Title: EAM Jaishankar reiterates India’s support for two-state solution, explains abstention from UN resolutions on Gaza conflict
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 12:41:22 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, emphasizing the importance of addressing terrorism and hostage-taking in global discourse.
Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Jaishankar defended India’s decision to abstain from certain United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions on the Gaza conflict, stating that these resolutions failed to capture the full scope of the situation.
Jaishankar clarified India’s stance in response to TMC MP Saket Gokhale’s inquiry, asserting, “We support the two-state solution and have been public and unambiguous about it. There should be no confusion regarding our position.”
When asked about the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders, Jaishankar noted that India is not an ICC member. “India decided not to join the ICC after thorough deliberation. Therefore, its decisions are not binding on us, and we have not taken a formal position on this matter,” he said.
The minister also highlighted India’s longstanding humanitarian support for Palestine. He detailed contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), adding a significant increase in annual aid from $1 million to $5 million under the current government. Additionally, he mentioned the provision of over 165 metric tons of medicines and other supplies to Palestine and Lebanon in recent years.
Regarding Israel’s ban on UNRWA, Jaishankar confirmed India’s unwavering commitment to its contributions, saying, “We continue to stand by our decision and have released the latest tranche of support to UNRWA.”
Explaining India’s abstention from some UNGA resolutions, Jaishankar emphasized that these lacked balance and failed to address critical aspects such as the October 7 Hamas attack, terrorism, and hostage-taking. “As a country that has suffered from terrorism, India cannot support resolutions that underplay such acts. Resolutions must be well-drafted, balanced, and reflect the entirety of the situation,” he said.
Jaishankar reiterated India’s condemnation of terrorism and hostage-taking while advocating for adherence to humanitarian law and minimizing civilian casualties. He stressed India’s call for a ceasefire and an end to violence in the region, adding that India’s position remains consistent and principled.
The Gaza conflict escalated after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting a large-scale Israeli counter-offensive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first global leaders to condemn Hamas’ actions, while also urging for a ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages. India continues to advocate for the two-state solution as the pathway to resolving the long-standing conflict.

Title: The fight for joy Bangla: How India helped Bangladesh achieve independence
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 10:22:10 +0000
Content: Pakistan, created in 1947 after the partition of British India, was a nation seemingly destined for further division. Many analysts considered it a geographical absurdity, a loose amalgamation of two separate territories 1,000 miles apart. Beyond sharing a Muslim majority, West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) had little in common.
One of the most significant differences between the two regions was language, which became a major source of identity problems and fuelled Bengali nationalism among the people of East Pakistan.
While people in West Pakistan spoke Urdu, the main language in East Pakistan was Bengali. In December 1947, students at the University of Dhaka protested, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of Pakistan’s official languages. This marked the beginning of the language war between East and West Pakistan. Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, responded by visiting Dhaka in March 1948 to deliver a stern message: Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. Moreover, leaders who spoke Bengali in the East Pakistan assembly were warned they could be tried for treason. Ultimately, West Pakistan imposed Urdu as the sole national language across both regions.
In response, the Bhasha Andolan (Language Movement) began in East Pakistan in 1952. This movement witnessed the deaths of many activists, politicians, and civilians due to atrocities committed by the West Pakistan-led regional regime. A key outcome of the language movement was the establishment of the Awami League in 1955, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In 1956, Pakistan was established as an Islamic Republic with a new constitution. The country that year accepted Urdu and Bengali as official languages. In 1958, a military coup led by General Muhammad Ayub Khan abrogated that constitution.
The other big difference between the West and East Pakistan was the culture being followed by its people. Speaking a different language than West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan followed a single ethnicity, Bengali, with a rich past. On the other hand, West Pakistan was a societal mix of people from different origins, including Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Pashtun people from its border areas, the North-West Frontier Province. Culturally, the people in East Pakistan had a stronger sense of belongingness than those in West Pakistan.
Despite these big differences, there could have been a united Pakistan based on religious similarity if both territories were treated equally by the country’s political leadership. However, the united Pakistan failed miserably here. The two territories, separated by a thousand miles, with different languages spoken and cultures followed, were ruled by a unilateral political leadership from West Pakistan.
The top political lineage under Jinnah that united Pakistan followed was largely from West Pakistan only. Also, its military wing leadership, the army, the air force, and the navy were based in West Pakistan only.
These disparities manifested in the repercussions felt by East Pakistan from 1947 until its liberation in 1971 as Bangladesh. The West Pakistani leadership treated East Pakistan as a colony, extracting benefits while denying it the rights and resources it deserved.
EAST PAKISTAN WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WEST PAKISTAN
According to the 1951 Pakistan Census, East Pakistan had a population of 42 million, exceeding West Pakistan’s 33.7 million. Geographically, East Pakistan was a riverine territory with ample rainfall, making it more prosperous. Its fertile and productive lands stood in contrast to West Pakistan, which, aside from Punjab, was largely dry with barren areas.
Moreover, a study titled “The Struggle in Bangladesh,” published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, indicates that in the initial years, East Pakistan’s GDP surpassed that of West Pakistan. Educationally, East Pakistan also had an advantage.

Initially, in 1949–50, East Pakistan’s GDP was 13,130 million rupees, more than West Pakistan’s 11,830 million rupees. In education, East Pakistan had 29,633 primary schools in 1947, compared to just 8,413 in West Pakistan. Similarly, East Pakistan had 50 colleges, while West Pakistan had 40.
WEST PAKISTAN’S COLONY
Despite East Pakistan’s higher GDP, better educational levels, and stable cultural heritage, data analysis reveals that West Pakistan monopolized industrialization and other benefits by installing a lame-duck government in East Pakistan.
East Pakistan was the primary source of jute, united Pakistan’s key export commodity. Logistically, industrial units for cotton textiles should have been developed there, but the country’s leadership chose to establish them in West Pakistan. Economic institutions and infrastructure developments, such as seaports, railways, and roads essential for promoting industrial growth further, were largely concentrated in West Pakistan only.
Conversely, East Pakistan experienced limited development, primarily aimed at supporting industries located in West Pakistan, according to the study. Furthermore, most industries in East Pakistan were developed by industrialists based in West Pakistan. Just 11% of industries were owned by Bengalis, making East Pakistan a labour hub for West Pakistan.
The deteriorating situation of East Pakistan over the next two decades reflects this exploitation. While East Pakistan was once more prosperous than West Pakistan, by 1970, the situation had reversed entirely.

Data from the study reveal that by 1968–69, West Pakistan’s GDP exceeded East Pakistan’s by 34%, and its per capita income was 62% higher. In united Pakistan’s first and second Five-Year Plans, 68% of the allocations went to West Pakistan, slightly reduced to 64% in the third plan. Pakistan’s economy largely depended on foreign assistance, of which 70% to 80% benefited West Pakistan. Although East Pakistan contributed up to 70% of Pakistan’s export earnings, 75% of imports were directed to West Pakistan.
CALL FOR SELF-DETERMINATION
These factors, language suppression, cultural differences, economic exploitation, mass arrests, killings, disappearances, and colonial treatment, left East Pakistanis facing an uncertain future after two decades of hostility.
In the 1954 regional elections, a coalition known as the United Front defeated the Muslim League, which had been based in West Pakistan and had ruled East Pakistan until then. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League presented his Six-Point Charter to the then-military ruler of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, demanding autonomy and greater control over East Pakistan’s economic affairs. These Six Points became central to Bengali nationalism and eventually transformed into a liberation movement following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.
1970 PAKISTAN ELECTION: A TURNING POINT – EAST PAKISTAN’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
Pakistan conducted its first general election on December 7, 1970, which is regarded as the most transparent election in the country’s history, according to Geo News, a major Pakistani news platform. The main contenders were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), based in West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League, based in East Pakistan. The Awami League achieved a landslide victory, winning 170 seats, while the PPP secured only 81.
Despite the Awami League’s clear mandate to govern all of Pakistan, the country’s military ruler, General Yahya Khan, and the PPP’s Bhutto opposed this outcome. They dismissed the election results and imposed martial law, denying the Awami League its rightful leadership.
This action led to widespread protests and riots in East Pakistan. In response, Sheikh Mujib initiated a civil disobedience movement. On March 7, 1971, the Awami League mobilized 50,000 Bengalis to start a peaceful protest in Dhaka. However, on March 25, 1971, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and airlifted to West Pakistan with the launch of Operation Searchlight.
OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT
Following Sheikh Mujib’s declaration of independence for East Pakistan, West Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on Bengalis. Operation Searchlight, initiated by West Pakistan on March 25, 1971, stands as one of the most horrific state-run military operations in history. According to various investigative estimates, including the Russian newspaper Pravda, approximately 3 million East Pakistanis were murdered by Pakistani troops and supporting militias.
In the 1970 general election, West Pakistan-based parties failed to win any seats in East Pakistan, underscoring the widespread support for the Awami League and its pro-independence stance among civilians, police, and security forces in East Pakistan. Consequently, West Pakistan’s troops and supporting radical militias targeted these Bengali-speaking populations across the region.
Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops across Dhaka and throughout East Bengal, supported by air and naval power, the main targets were Awami League politicians, military personnel, East Bengal police, and Bengali-speaking civilians.
An analytical report published in the Dhaka Tribune indicates that one of Operation Searchlight’s objectives was to disarm and arrest Bengali soldiers and policemen serving in East Pakistan. Another aim was to attack Hindu-majority areas of Dhaka. On the night of March 25, 1971, casualty figures in Dhaka alone reached approximately 35,000.
During the nine months of the operation, hundreds of thousands of Bengali women were subjected to rape. According to a report in the Smithsonian, around 400,000 women underwent late-term abortions, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
REFUGEES IN INDIA
The brutal crackdown compelled millions of Bangladeshis to flee to India. By May 1971, India was hosting 1.5 million refugees, a number that swelled to around 10 million by December 1971, making it the largest refugee crisis in the modern world. Internally, the military operation displaced approximately 30 million people within Bangladesh.
This massive influx placed a significant burden on India. Nevertheless, the country stepped forward to assist, despite lacking domestic laws to manage refugees and not being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. India established 825 refugee camps across seven states, with 19 central camps capable of accommodating up to 50,000 refugees each.
ECONOMIC BURDEN
The economic burden was significant. India had to reassess its Fourth Five-Year Plan. The 1971–72 Budget stated, “The country’s resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained by developments across the border, the influx of nearly ten million refugees and the outbreak of hostilities in December 1971.” 1 Despite these challenges, the economy responded effectively, as noted in the budget document.  
A World Bank assessment, based on 9 million refugees, estimated the direct cost to India at approximately US$700 million from April 1, 1971, to March 31, 1972, which equates to around US$5.5 billion today. India managed this expenditure largely through internal resources. According to a CIA document from March 1972, released in 2010, the Indian government spent about 4% of its planned central government expenditure for FY1971 on refugee care.
INDIA’S STAND
India supported Sheikh Mujib’s call for independence but initially refrained from participating in the war. Instead, it provided moral and material support to the independence movement. On April 17, 1971, a provisional government of Bangladesh was formed and relocated to Calcutta as the “Bangladesh Government in Exile.”
Meanwhile, the freedom fighters of East Pakistan formed the Mukti Bahini, an armed resistance movement against the West Pakistani military and supporting militias. Comprising members of the Bengali military, paramilitary forces, police, and civilians, these fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare.
India’s support bolstered their efforts. The geographical separation of 1,000 miles of Indian territory between West and East Pakistan meant that Pakistan could not easily reinforce its military presence in East Pakistan with additional air and naval power.
West Pakistan had previously exhibited hostility towards India, notably in the conflicts of 1947 and the 1965 war, which it lost. Its actions in East Pakistan heightened diplomatic tensions and prompted a military buildup in India.
The tipping point occurred on December 3, 1971, when Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on Indian airfields. This act of aggression compelled India to formally enter the war, engaging its Army, Navy, and Air Force in a coordinated response to both the humanitarian crisis and threats to its national sovereignty. Before this, India had adopted a restrained approach, engaging in diplomatic efforts and appealing to West Pakistani leaders to create safe corridors for refugees to return. These appeals were ignored.
THE QUICK END
India’s entry into the 1971 war was driven by the humanitarian crisis and direct threats to its national security. By launching joint military operations with the Mukti Bahini, effective coordination and intelligence sharing were achieved, significantly disrupting Pakistani military efforts. Through a series of strategic offensives, the joint forces rapidly overran West Pakistan’s military presence throughout Dhaka and East Pakistan.
On December 16, 1971, Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi of Pakistan unconditionally surrendered to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India, along with 93,000 troops, marking one of the largest surrenders since World War II. The war officially ended with India’s unilateral ceasefire on December 17.
WHY INDIA’S ENGAGEMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR A JOY BANGLA MOVEMENT
The success of the “Joy Bangla” movement on December 16, 1971, could only be possible with India’s commitment to the cause. With the onset of Operation Searchlight, India opened its borders to refugees, providing massive relief operations while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. Military intervention by India was the last resort.
The military intervention ultimately helped realize the goals of the “Joy Bangla” movement.
Twenty-three years of suppression, from 1947 to 1970, with West Pakistan ruling East Pakistan through military involvement, left the eastern territory with a strong desire for independence, an aspiration difficult to achieve in an economy controlled by West Pakistani industrialists and a polity dominated by a West Pakistan-based military ruler allied with exploitative politicians.
The increasing number of refugees in India proved the fact that there was no internal security structure and local and regional administration available for them to take over the West Pakistan-led apparatus.
Over ten million refugees fled to India in ten months, while thirty million were internally displaced. The refugee headcount included Bengali military wing officials, soldiers, and police personnel. According to the Bangladesh High Commission in London, thousands of families of officials, soldiers, and activists from East Pakistan were interned in West Pakistan. Killings and rapes became daily events of horror to be observed. India’s daily refugee count surged from 17,000 to 60,000, with numbers continuing to rise.
The freedom fighters of East Pakistan had the courage and will to fight for independence, but they lacked the strength of a coordinated war strategy and the full complement of military resources—army, air force, navy, arms, and ammunition—to defeat West Pakistan’s full-fledged military. They had to fight a country’s army that had exposure to past war experiences, something they didn’t have, as East Pakistan was not the war theatre of the 1965 India-Pakistan war. India’s decision to join the war after Pakistan’s attack on Indian territory proved to be the turning point, helping Bangladesh achieve a goal that once seemed unachievable.
Had the Mukti Bahini not received external support, Operation Searchlight could have seriously affected the East Pakistan freedom movement and its hopes to break the colonial shackles of West Pakistan.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis set to be sworn in today as Maharashtra CM, Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar Deputy CMs
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 04:45:20 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis will take oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde along with NCP’s Ajit Pawar will take the oath as Deputy Chief Ministers in the new cabinet, sources said.
The oath-taking ceremony will take place at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan and will see the participation of several NDA Chief Ministers and leaders. Ending the long-drawn suspense over who would get the top job, Fadnavis, Shinde, and Pawar met Governor CP Radhakrishnan to stake their claim to form the MahaYuti government.
After meeting the Governor, Fadnavis said, “The swearing-in ceremony of the new government will be held tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I met Eknath Shinde and requested him to join us in this government, as it is the wish of MahaYuti workers…We will fulfill the promises made to the people of Maharashtra.”
It will be Fadnavis’ third term in the top post after being unanimously elected as the Leader of the Maharashtra BJP Legislative Party on Wednesday. The decision came after days of speculation and political manoeuvring as Eknath Shinde wanted to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. However, the BJP, refused to budge and later, Shinde said he would back PM Modi’s pick.
Meanwhile, Eknath Shinde on Wednesday expressed his satisfaction with the two-and a-half years of the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, ahead of the swearing-in of Fadnavis as Chief Minister.
“I am very happy with the completion of two-and-a-half years. The work done by our government–the MahaYuti government–by the three of us and our team in the last 2.5 years is remarkable. It will be written in golden letters in history. We are proud to have taken such significant decisions,” said Shinde.
Shinde was accompanied by Fadnavis and NCP chief Ajit Pawar at a press conference. Addressing the media, Pawar emphasised their commitment to effective governance. “We will leave no stone unturned in running the government. Party activities will be managed by BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and NCP’s Sunil Tatkare,” he said.
There was also some light-hearted banter during the press conference. Asked whether he and Ajit Pawar would take oath on December 5 as Fadnavis’ deputies, Shinde said, “Wait till evening…” Pawar, in response to Shinde’s reply, said, “Sham tak unka samaj aayega (We will know about Shinde by evening), I will take it (oath), I will not wait.”
Shinde then said, “Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking (oath) both in the morning and evening.” This elicted laughter from all those present at the press conference. In the year 2019, Pawar had taken oath as the Deputy Chief Minister with Fadnavis as the Chief Minister in an early morning ceremony at Raj Bhavan.
The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election witnessed a resounding victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide win with 235 seats out of 288. The results marked a significant milestone for the BJP, which emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats. The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party also recorded notable gains, securing 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
While, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a major setback with Congress winning just 16 seats. Its alliance partner, Shiv Sena (UBT), won 20 seats, while the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) secured only 10 seats.

Title: RBI raises UPI lite wallet limit to Rs 5,000
Publication Date: Wed, 04 Dec 2024 17:08:49 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the wallet limit for UPI Lite from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000. The new guidelines, announced on Wednesday, also raised the upper transaction limit under the offline framework from ₹500 to ₹1,000 per transaction.
According to the RBI’s circular, the revised limits are effective immediately, enabling users to make higher-value transactions conveniently while maintaining the simplicity and security of UPI Lite. “The enhanced limits for UPI Lite shall be ₹1,000 per transaction, with ₹5,000 being the total limit at any point in time,” the circular said.
Previously, the offline framework permitted a maximum of ₹500 per transaction and a total limit of ₹2,000 for payment instruments. The updated framework is expected to streamline digital payments for day-to-day purchases and provide a more robust and inclusive digital payment experience for consumers.
The RBI clarified that the changes have been implemented under the authority of Section 18, read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. This initiative aligns with the central bank’s ongoing efforts to promote digital transactions while ensuring ease of use and enhanced security for consumers.
Earlier, in October 2024, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had announced an increase in transaction limits for UPI services during the monetary policy briefing, emphasizing the growing importance of digital payment platforms in India’s economy.
The updated limits come at a time when Unified Payments Interface (UPI) continues to set milestones in the digital payment space. In October 2024, UPI achieved a record-breaking 16.58 billion financial transactions in a single month.
Since its launch in 2016 by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI has revolutionized the country’s payment system, integrating multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application for seamless fund transfers, peer-to-peer transactions, and merchant payments.

Title: “We should fight unitedly against anti-India forces”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:29:34 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Monday urged Congress and its members to put aside political differences and unite in the fight against “anti-India forces,” specifically addressing concerns about George Soros’ links to political entities in India. Rijiju emphasized that certain national issues should not be viewed through a political lens but rather with the collective interest of the nation in mind.
“We should not see certain issues with political lenses. The recent revelations about George Soros and his links are not about Congress or Rahul Gandhi. We must take them seriously as they relate to anti-India forces,” Rijiju said while speaking to the media in New Delhi.
He further appealed to the Congress leadership and workers, urging them to raise their voices if any of their members are found to have links with such forces. “If even Congress leaders have connections with anti-India forces, they should speak out and we must fight unitedly,” he added.
Rijiju also reacted to the growing concerns over Soros’ involvement in Indian political matters, calling the charges “serious.” He stressed that all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation, should prioritize the nation’s interests. “Whether a member of parliament or a common man, everyone should work for the country’s betterment. We should be united in combating anti-India forces,” Rijiju said.
On the ongoing debates within the opposition INDIA alliance, Rijiju remarked that some members have questioned Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, but he refrained from interfering in the internal matters of the Congress party or the alliance.
This comes as Congress is planning another day of protests outside Parliament, calling for a discussion on the Adani issue. Meanwhile, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, during his statement on December 7, praised Mamata Banerjee’s leadership within the INDIA alliance, acknowledging her as a potential national leader.

Title: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrives in Moscow for high-level talks and INS Tushil commissioning ceremony
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:28:00 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Moscow on Sunday for an official visit aimed at strengthening defence cooperation between India and Russia.
During his stay, Singh will participate in the commissioning ceremony of the stealth-guided missile frigate INS Tushil into the Indian Navy. He will also attend the 21st meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC).
Singh was welcomed late Sunday night by Indian Ambassador to Russia Venkatesh Kumar and Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin.
During the visit, Singh will pay homage at Moscow’s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, honoring Soviet soldiers who lost their lives in World War II. He is also set to engage with members of the Indian community in Russia, fostering bilateral cultural ties.
A major highlight of the visit is Singh’s scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Additionally, he will co-chair the IRIGC-M&MTC meeting alongside Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, furthering India-Russia cooperation in military and technical domains.
Sharing the visit details on X, the Embassy of India in Russia wrote, “Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh was received by Ambassador @vkumar1969 and Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Alexander Fomin in Moscow.”
Singh’s participation in the commissioning of INS Tushil—a multi-role stealth-guided missile frigate—underscores the growing maritime collaboration between India and Russia.
In a post prior to his departure, Singh expressed enthusiasm for the visit, saying, “Tomorrow, 08th December, I shall be reaching Moscow in Russia to attend the 21st meeting of India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation. Also, I shall be attending the commissioning ceremony of Indian Navy’s latest multi-role stealth-guided missile frigate ‘INS Tushil.’ Looking forward to it.”
The name Tushil translates to “protector shield,” and its crest symbolizes the ‘Abhedya Kavacham’ (Impenetrable Shield). Alongside its motto—Nirbhay, Abhedya aur Balsheel (Fearless, Indomitable, Resolute)—the frigate reflects the Indian Navy’s dedication to safeguarding the nation’s maritime frontiers.
The ship features an indigenous content of 26%, a significant enhancement over earlier models, with the number of Indian-made systems doubling to 33. Collaborators include BrahMos Aerospace, Bharat Electronics Limited, Keltron, Nova Integrated Systems (Tata), Elcome Marine, and Johnson Controls India, among others.
Upon commissioning, INS Tushil will join the Western Fleet, the “Sword Arm” of the Indian Navy, under the Western Naval Command, ranking among the most technologically advanced frigates in the world.

Title: Women’s Junior Asia Cup: India start campaign with 13-1 win over Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:27:11 +0000
Content: Indian junior women’s hockey team got off to a rollicking start at Women’s Asia Cup on Sunday, comfortably defeating Bangladesh 13-1 in their Pool A match in the opening game of the event.
Mumtaz Khan (27′, 32′, 53′, 58′) top-scored for the team with four goals, while Deepika (7′, 20′, 55′) and Kanika Siwach (12′, 51′, 51′) completed hat-tricks in India’s high-scoring encounter. Manisha (10′), Beauty Dung Dung (33′), and Sakshi Rana (43′) also put their names on the scoresheet. For Bangladesh, Orpita Pal (12′) was the lone goal-scorer, according to a Hockey India press release.
Drag-flick specialist Deepika opened the scoresheet for India in the 7th minute through a finely-converted penalty corner (PC). They doubled their lead in the 10th minute with another PC, this time a clever variation that saw Manisha register her name on the scoresheet. In the 12th minute, India took a commanding 3-0 lead when Kanika Siwach scored a splendid field goal.
However, an infringement by India in the same minute allowed Bangladesh a PC. Orpita Pal capitalized on the opportunity with a well-converted effort. Despite this, the Indian side maintained their tactical structure, continuing to attack and create scoring opportunities. Deepika struck again in the 20th minute with a fine field goal, while Mumtaz Khan extended the lead to 5-1 in the 27th minute, giving India a significant advantage at the halftime break.
The second half saw an even more dominant India. Mumtaz struck again in the 32nd minute, and Beauty Dung Dung followed up with a fine field goal in the 33rd, taking India’s lead to 7-1. Sakshi Rana scored in the 43rd minute, leaving the Bangladesh defense in tatters.
While the final quarter was only a formality for India, the defending champions continued their aggressive approach. Kanika Siwach and Mumtaz Khan completed their hat-tricks in the fourth quarter. Siwach scored twice in the 51st minute, while Mumtaz added another in the 53rd minute, taking India’s tally to 11-1. Deepika joined the party in the 55th minute, completing her hat-trick with a quick field goal. The relentless Indian onslaught concluded with Mumtaz scoring her fourth goal in the 58th minute, sealing the final scoreline at 13-1.
India will next face Malaysia on December 9th at 20:30 IST (8:30 PM).

Title: Nifty, Sensex open flat as markets pause after last week’s rally
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:19:46 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened flat on Monday, with early trade witnessing heavy selling in the FMCG sector.
The Nifty 50 declined 43.90 points, or 0.18 percent, to open at 24,633.90, while the BSE Sensex dropped 106.54 points, or 0.13 percent, to 81,602.58.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, said that Indian markets have recovered over 50 percent of their post-September fall.
“We expect markets to consolidate before resuming their uptrend,” he said, adding that “seasonality and capital flows favor a market advance.”
Bagga highlighted global events, particularly the US CPI report, as key indicators for the week, along with an anticipated 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on December 18.
A mixed trend was observed across sectoral indices. Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial, Nifty Metal, and Nifty Realty saw gains, while Nifty IT slipped marginally. Of the Nifty 50 stocks, 22 registered gains while 28 declined at the time of reporting.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said: “The Nifty’s drop on Friday traced a small-sized bar contained within Thursday’s long-range, creating a so-called “inside day”. This represents volatility compression but since volatility is cyclical, one should expect a trending move soon. At current prices, the Nifty is facing resistance from the 50- and 100-day moving averages and an Ichimoku hurdle, so the 24800 – 24900 area is formidable. Support lies at 24,445 and 24,360″
Among top gainers were L&T, Bajaj Finance, SBI Life, HDFC Bank, and Shriram Finance. Major laggards included Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer, and Britannia.
Foreign investors made a strong comeback last week, with Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) injecting over Rs 24,400 crore into Indian equities between December 2 and 6. The largest single-day inflow was recorded on Friday, when FPIs invested Rs 9,489 crore.
Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services, said, “Nifty 50’s outperformance last week, rising by 546 points, signals a bullish trend. The series of bullish candles shows growing buyer interest, likely pushing prices higher.”
In broader Asian markets, South Korea’s KOSPI index fell amid political uncertainty, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.33 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Taiwan’s Weighted Index posted modest gains of 0.27 percent and 0.10 percent, respectively.

Title: South Korea says Yoon still controls military as leadership crisis deepens
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:11:38 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is still commander in chief and there is no disruption to the U.S. alliance, the defence ministry said on Monday after it was revealed Yoon was under criminal investigation for declaring martial law last week.
Yoon’s grip on power has come into question with dissent growing among senior military officers against the president, and his own party saying it would establish a task force to handle his eventual resignation.
While Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, his party’s decision to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister has plunged the key U.S. ally into a constitutional crisis.
Yoon has refused calls, including some from within his own ruling party, to resign, but his future looked more uncertain over the weekend when Yonhap news agency reported he was under criminal investigation for alleged treason.
Police were also considering banning him from leaving the country, Yonhap and other media reported on Monday.
Prosecutors on Sunday arrested ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in the declaration of martial law, Yonhap reported.
Yoon gave the military sweeping emergency powers on Dec. 3 to root out what he called “anti-state forces” and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree.
Amid the backlash, multiple military officials, including the acting defence minister, have said they would not follow any new order to impose martial law again.
The main opposition Democratic Party has called for Yoon to be stripped of authority to control the military. The DP has also demanded the arrest of Yoon and any military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.
Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) had established a task force to deal with, among other matters, “political stabilisation after martial law and (Yoon’s) orderly early resignation”, a spokesperson said on Monday.
On Sunday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said the president would be excluded from foreign and other state affairs, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would manage government affairs until Yoon eventually stepped aside.
That proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition, which says it is unconstitutional. It says Yoon must be impeached or resign and face legal prosecution, and plans to table another impeachment bill on Saturday.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung warned on Monday that the political crisis threatened to do irreversible harm to Asia’s fourth-largest economy, major global supplier of memory chips.
South Korea’s finance ministry and regulators said they would make all-out efforts to stabilise financial markets by deploying contingency plans and boosting liquidity by end-December.
MILITARY BACKLASH
In the latest sign of dissent within military ranks, the commander of South Korea’s special forces said he was ordered to send his troops into parliament last week to stop a vote to reject martial law.
Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, the commanding officer of the 707th Special Missions Group, told reporters he took responsibility for his troops’ actions but he was acting under orders from then defence minister Kim Yong-hyun.
“We were all victims who were used by the former defence minister,” the colonel told reporters outside the defence ministry in Seoul.
He said he had not told the military about his plan to speak to the media out of fear he might be stopped.
Yoon’s decision to declare emergency rule and grant the military sweeping powers stirred protests on the streets and raised alarm among Seoul’s allies.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin scrapped plans to travel to South Korea and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his South Korean counterpart, saying he expected the democratic process to prevail.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
The turmoil in Seoul comes at an important geopolitical moment in the region, with North Korea allegedly sending troops to help Russia’s war against Ukraine amid growing military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.

Title: 2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 04:55:59 +0000
Content: This year will be the world’s warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
The data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after U.N. climate talks yielded a $300-billion deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the U.S. and the Philippines.
Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
“We’re still in near-record-high territory for global temperatures, and that’s likely to stay at least for the next few months,” Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas told Reuters.
Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
Scientists are also monitoring whether the La Nina weather pattern – which involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures – could form in 2025.
That could briefly cool global temperatures, though it would not halt the long-term underlying trend of warming caused by emissions. The world is currently in neutral conditions, after El Nino – La Nina’s hotter counterpart – ended earlier this year.
“While 2025 might be slightly cooler than 2024, if a La Nina event develops, this does not mean temperatures will be ‘safe’ or ‘normal’,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London.
“We will still experience high temperatures, resulting in dangerous heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones.”
C3S’ records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.

During the visit, the Indian Foreign secretary is expected to pay a courtesy call on Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Md Touhid Hossain. 
Earlier on Sunday, while addressing a seminar in Dhaka, Foreign Affair Adviser of Bangladesh Md Touhid Hossain said that Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri is set to arrive in Dhaka on Monday for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC) between Bangladesh and India, where bilateral trade issues and other matters of mutual concern are expected to be discussed. He expressed optimism that Dhaka and New Delhi could move forward pragmatically and realistically to restore ties to a “completely normal” state.

Title: Russian exporters won’t stop supplying wheat to Syria unilaterally
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 13:40:53 +0000
Content: Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally stop supplying wheat to Syria amid political turmoil there, Eduard Zernin, head of the Russian Grain Producers and Exporters Union, said on Monday
Russia is a major supplier of wheat to Syria, where rebels seized capital Damascus, ending the rule of Bashar al-Assad and ousting him as president. Assad fled to Moscow after a lightning rebel offensive.
“Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally terminate their obligations under concluded contracts,” Zernin said.
Zernin estimated Syria’s imports at about 2 million metric tons of wheat per year. A disruption of Russian wheat supplies could risk hunger in the country of over 23 million people.
“Syria is not a key consumer for us, but it is a decent market with a capacity of about 2 million tons of wheat per year,” he said.
IKAR consultancy’s Dmitry’s Rylko estimated wheat exports to Syria at 300,000 tons so far this season with the country ranking 24th among Russian wheat buyers.
Zernin said that Russian exporters would work with the Syrian side to resolve wheat supply payments and outstanding debt issues. Russia has previously issued loans to Syria to enable it to pay for wheat imports.

Title: Ayushman Vay Vandana Card enrollment reaches 25 lakh within two months
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Enrollment for the Ayushman Vay Vandana Card has reached 25 lakh within just two months of its launch, the health ministry said on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the scheme on October 29 this year, as part of the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) to include senior citizens aged 70 years and above.
According to the ministry, treatments worth more than Rs 40 crore have been availed by over 22,000 senior citizens across the country since its launch. These treatments have covered various conditions, including coronary angioplasty, hip fractures, cataract surgeries, gall bladder removals, prostate resection, stroke recovery, hemodialysis, and other illnesses.
The Ayushman Vay Vandana Card offers Rs 5 lakh in free health coverage to all senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of their socio-economic status. This expansion of the AB PM-JAY scheme ensures that senior citizens not only have access to healthcare but also an additional top-up cover for those already enrolled in the scheme.
Eligible seniors, who belong to families already covered by AB PM-JAY, can receive up to Rs 5 lakh per year in additional health benefits. Those already under other government health schemes, such as Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), or Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), can either choose their existing scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY.
The Ayushman Vay Vandana Card provides coverage for around 2000 medical procedures, covering all pre-existing diseases from the first day, with no waiting period.

Title: BJP’s Rahul Narwekar elected unopposed as Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:04:05 +0000
Content: BJP legislator Rahul Narwekar was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Monday, marking his second consecutive term.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis congratulated Narwekar on his re-election and expressed gratitude to the Opposition for their support.
Narwekar, who represents the Colaba constituency, was first elected to the state Assembly as a BJP candidate in the 2019 elections. He was appointed Speaker in July 2022 after Eknath Shinde became Chief Minister, following the collapse of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government.
Fadnavis highlighted that only four Speakers before Narwekar have held the post for a second consecutive term.
He praised Narwekar’s decisions during his previous tenure, particularly those related to the Shiv Sena and NCP split, noting that these judgments would serve as precedents in the future.
Fadnavis also emphasized the importance of the Speaker’s role in ensuring fairness, particularly for first-time elected members, and expressed confidence in Narwekar’s ability to deliver justice to all.

Content: The Indian stock market closed red on Monday, with key indices showing little movement. The Sensex fell by 177.12 points, settling at 81,531.99, while the Nifty dropped 52.05 points to close at 24,625.75.
Among Nifty firms, 19 advanced, 30 declined, and one remained unchanged. Wipro, L&T, SBI Life, Tata Steel, and BPCL were among the top gainers, while Tata Consumer Products, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Motors, Nestle, and Asian Paints saw the largest declines.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market’s range-bound movement to a mix of domestic and global factors. He added that after last week’s rally, domestic market sentiment was affected by rising oil prices amid tensions in the Middle East.
Additionally, investors were cautious ahead of key economic data, including India’s and the US’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures and the European Central Bank’s policy decision this week. There was some buying interest in capital goods and metal stocks, partly in anticipation of China’s stimulus following an unexpected drop in inflation.
Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, provided a technical outlook, suggesting the market remains bullish but may see range-bound activity due to overbought conditions. He recommended a strategy of buying on dips and selling on rallies.

Title: Centre’s PLI scheme to boost millet-based products: All you need to know
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 11:31:42 +0000
Content: The Government of India has introduced the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-Based Products (PLISMBP) to support the use of millets in food products and encourage value addition. This initiative, launched for the period 2022-2027, comes with an allocation of ₹800 crore and aims to boost millet production and processing by removing the threshold investment requirement, making it accessible to a wider range of participants.
Under the scheme, companies are eligible for incentives if they achieve a minimum year-on-year sales growth of 10% over the base year. It focuses on sales of branded Ready-to-Eat and Ready-to-Cook products in consumer packs, provided these products contain at least 15% millet by weight or volume.
Initially, 30 beneficiaries were enrolled under the scheme. Following the withdrawal of one participant, 29 beneficiaries remain. According to the guidelines, the products must be prepared using domestically sourced agricultural materials, excluding additives, flavors, and oils. This requirement has helped strengthen local agricultural procurement, benefiting farmers.
The scheme has a five-year duration. For the first performance year (FY 2022-2023), 19 participants filed claims in FY 2023-2024, with ₹3.917 crore disbursed to eligible applicants.
The government has taken steps to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme. These include launching a user-friendly portal, establishing support groups for issue resolution, and issuing regular clarifications on guidelines. Weekly meetings with applicants, along with technical support, are being conducted to track progress and address challenges effectively.

Title: India’s surging FDI inflows surpass $1,000 billion milestone in last 4 years
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:07:41 +0000
Content: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into India from April 2000 to September 2024 have soared to the $1,033.40 billion mark, reflecting the increasing investment opportunities in the country’s fast-growing economy, according to figures compiled by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
The main sectors of the economy benefiting from FDI include automobiles, computer software, IT hardware, telecom, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and services. The data also show that FDI inflows in the sunrise non-conventional energy sector have recorded a significant jump.
FDI inflows lead to higher investments, job creation, and the introduction of state-of-the-art technology, which raises productivity levels and spurs economic growth.
A senior official stated that the government has facilitated ease of doing business and implemented various incentives, such as the PLI scheme, which have helped accelerate FDI inflows into the country.
The surge in FDI has continued into the current financial year, with a robust 45 percent jump to $29.79 billion in April-September, compared to $20.5 billion during the same period in 2023-24, according to DPIIT data.
FDI in services has increased to $5.69 billion during the first half of the current financial year, compared to $3.85 billion in the same period last year.
A state-wise analysis of the figures shows that Maharashtra received the highest inflow, with $13.55 billion during April-September 2024-25. It was followed by Karnataka ($3.54 billion), Telangana ($1.54 billion), and Gujarat (about $4 billion).
FDI inflows for the July-September quarter jumped by 43 percent to $13.6 billion during the current financial year, compared to $9.52 billion in the same quarter of 2023-24.
In the preceding April-June quarter, the country recorded a 47.8 percent increase to $16.17 billion.

Title: “India has achieved success through Reform, Perform and Transform mantra”: Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 08:07:00 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated and addressed the Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit in Jaipur on Monday, marking the beginning of a three-day event (December 9-11) aimed at attracting investment and promoting the state’s growth.
In his address, PM Modi outlined India’s remarkable economic progress, attributing the nation’s rise to the guiding principles of “Reform, Perform, and Transform”. He emphasized that this approach had helped India become the world’s fifth-largest economy, doubling its economy and exports over the last decade.
“Today, the world looks at India’s development in all sectors. We have become the fifth-largest economy, and our economy and exports have doubled. Every investor in the world is now excited about India. The development we have seen is a direct result of the Reform, Perform, and Transform mantra,” the Prime Minister said.
PM Modi highlighted how this success is reflected in India’s growth in key areas, including digital data, democracy, delivery, and demography. He pointed out that India, in this “tech and data-driven century,” has demonstrated the power of its democratic framework and its ability to leverage technology to drive inclusive growth.
“This is a tech and data-driven century. India is showcasing the real power of democracy, demography, and data to the world. The democratization of digital technology has benefited all sectors and sections of society. India’s UPI, DBT schemes, and other platforms are testament to the strength of our digital infrastructure. We will soon witness the positive effects of this progress in Rajasthan,” PM Modi added.
Further reinforcing his vision, the Prime Minister spoke about the BJP government’s focus on both development and heritage, citing the state’s progress through the mantra “Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi”. He criticized the post-independence governments for neglecting both these aspects, especially in Rajasthan, and said that the BJP’s responsive government was addressing both with equal focus.
“The priorities of the governments after independence were neither development nor heritage. Rajasthan suffered as a result. But today, our government is working with the mantra of ‘Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi.’ Rajasthan is rising, reliable, and receptive to change. The people of the state have formed the BJP’s responsive and reformist government with a huge majority,” PM Modi said.
The Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit 2024, which runs until December 11, has attracted global investors, industry leaders, and policymakers. The event serves as a platform to showcase the state’s achievements in development, innovation, and industrial growth.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma attributed the state’s growing appeal to global investors to its updated policy framework. He added that the recent launch of nine new policies on December 4, aimed at enhancing the state’s business ecosystem and improving the ease of doing business.

Title: The fight for joy Bangla: How India helped Bangladesh achieve independence
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:46:44 +0000
Content: Pakistan, created in 1947 after the partition of British India, was a nation seemingly destined for further division. Many analysts considered it a geographical absurdity, a loose amalgamation of two separate territories 1,000 miles apart. Beyond sharing a Muslim majority, West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) had little in common.
One of the most significant differences between the two regions was language, which became a major source of identity problems and fuelled Bengali nationalism among the people of East Pakistan.
While people in West Pakistan spoke Urdu, the main language in East Pakistan was Bengali. In December 1947, students at the University of Dhaka protested, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of Pakistan’s official languages. This marked the beginning of the language war between East and West Pakistan. Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, responded by visiting Dhaka in March 1948 to deliver a stern message: Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. Moreover, leaders who spoke Bengali in the East Pakistan assembly were warned they could be tried for treason. Ultimately, West Pakistan imposed Urdu as the sole national language across both regions.
In response, the Bhasha Andolan (Language Movement) began in East Pakistan in 1952. This movement witnessed the deaths of many activists, politicians, and civilians due to atrocities committed by the West Pakistan-led regional regime. A key outcome of the language movement was the establishment of the Awami League in 1955, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In 1956, Pakistan was established as an Islamic Republic with a new constitution. The country that year accepted Urdu and Bengali as official languages. In 1958, a military coup led by General Muhammad Ayub Khan abrogated that constitution.
The other big difference between the West and East Pakistan was the culture being followed by its people. Speaking a different language than West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan followed a single ethnicity, Bengali, with a rich past. On the other hand, West Pakistan was a societal mix of people from different origins, including Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Pashtun people from its border areas, the North-West Frontier Province. Culturally, the people in East Pakistan had a stronger sense of belongingness than those in West Pakistan.
Despite these big differences, there could have been a united Pakistan based on religious similarity if both territories were treated equally by the country’s political leadership. However, the united Pakistan failed miserably here. The two territories, separated by a thousand miles, with different languages spoken and cultures followed, were ruled by a unilateral political leadership from West Pakistan.
The top political lineage under Jinnah that united Pakistan followed was largely from West Pakistan only. Also, its military wing leadership, the army, the air force, and the navy were based in West Pakistan only.
These disparities manifested in the repercussions felt by East Pakistan from 1947 until its liberation in 1971 as Bangladesh. The West Pakistani leadership treated East Pakistan as a colony, extracting benefits while denying it the rights and resources it deserved.
EAST PAKISTAN WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WEST PAKISTAN
According to the 1951 Pakistan Census, East Pakistan had a population of 42 million, exceeding West Pakistan’s 33.7 million. Geographically, East Pakistan was a riverine territory with ample rainfall, making it more prosperous. Its fertile and productive lands stood in contrast to West Pakistan, which, aside from Punjab, was largely dry with barren areas.
Moreover, a study titled “The Struggle in Bangladesh,” published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, indicates that in the initial years, East Pakistan’s GDP surpassed that of West Pakistan. Educationally, East Pakistan also had an advantage.

Initially, in 1949–50, East Pakistan’s GDP was 13,130 million rupees, more than West Pakistan’s 11,830 million rupees. In education, East Pakistan had 29,633 primary schools in 1947, compared to just 8,413 in West Pakistan. Similarly, East Pakistan had 50 colleges, while West Pakistan had 40.
WEST PAKISTAN’S COLONY
Despite East Pakistan’s higher GDP, better educational levels, and stable cultural heritage, data analysis reveals that West Pakistan monopolized industrialization and other benefits by installing a lame-duck government in East Pakistan.
East Pakistan was the primary source of jute, united Pakistan’s key export commodity. Logistically, industrial units for cotton textiles should have been developed there, but the country’s leadership chose to establish them in West Pakistan. Economic institutions and infrastructure developments, such as seaports, railways, and roads essential for promoting industrial growth further, were largely concentrated in West Pakistan only.
Conversely, East Pakistan experienced limited development, primarily aimed at supporting industries located in West Pakistan, according to the study. Furthermore, most industries in East Pakistan were developed by industrialists based in West Pakistan. Just 11% of industries were owned by Bengalis, making East Pakistan a labour hub for West Pakistan.
The deteriorating situation of East Pakistan over the next two decades reflects this exploitation. While East Pakistan was once more prosperous than West Pakistan, by 1970, the situation had reversed entirely.

Data from the study reveal that by 1968–69, West Pakistan’s GDP exceeded East Pakistan’s by 34%, and its per capita income was 62% higher. In united Pakistan’s first and second Five-Year Plans, 68% of the allocations went to West Pakistan, slightly reduced to 64% in the third plan. Pakistan’s economy largely depended on foreign assistance, of which 70% to 80% benefited West Pakistan. Although East Pakistan contributed up to 70% of Pakistan’s export earnings, 75% of imports were directed to West Pakistan.
CALL FOR SELF-DETERMINATION
These factors, language suppression, cultural differences, economic exploitation, mass arrests, killings, disappearances, and colonial treatment, left East Pakistanis facing an uncertain future after two decades of hostility.
In the 1954 regional elections, a coalition known as the United Front defeated the Muslim League, which had been based in West Pakistan and had ruled East Pakistan until then. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League presented his Six-Point Charter to the then-military ruler of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, demanding autonomy and greater control over East Pakistan’s economic affairs. These Six Points became central to Bengali nationalism and eventually transformed into a liberation movement following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.
1970 PAKISTAN ELECTION: A TURNING POINT – EAST PAKISTAN’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
Pakistan conducted its first general election on December 7, 1970, which is regarded as the most transparent election in the country’s history, according to Geo News, a major Pakistani news platform. The main contenders were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), based in West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League, based in East Pakistan. The Awami League achieved a landslide victory, winning 170 seats, while the PPP secured only 81.
Despite the Awami League’s clear mandate to govern all of Pakistan, the country’s military ruler, General Yahya Khan, and the PPP’s Bhutto opposed this outcome. They dismissed the election results and imposed martial law, denying the Awami League its rightful leadership.
This action led to widespread protests and riots in East Pakistan. In response, Sheikh Mujib initiated a civil disobedience movement. On March 7, 1971, the Awami League mobilized 50,000 Bengalis to start a peaceful protest in Dhaka. However, on March 25, 1971, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and airlifted to West Pakistan with the launch of Operation Searchlight.
OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT
Following Sheikh Mujib’s declaration of independence for East Pakistan, West Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on Bengalis. Operation Searchlight, initiated by West Pakistan on March 25, 1971, stands as one of the most horrific state-run military operations in history. According to various investigative estimates, including the Russian newspaper Pravda, approximately 3 million East Pakistanis were murdered by Pakistani troops and supporting militias.
In the 1970 general election, West Pakistan-based parties failed to win any seats in East Pakistan, underscoring the widespread support for the Awami League and its pro-independence stance among civilians, police, and security forces in East Pakistan. Consequently, West Pakistan’s troops and supporting radical militias targeted these Bengali-speaking populations across the region.
Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops across Dhaka and throughout East Bengal, supported by air and naval power, the main targets were Awami League politicians, military personnel, East Bengal police, and Bengali-speaking civilians.
An analytical report published in the Dhaka Tribune indicates that one of Operation Searchlight’s objectives was to disarm and arrest Bengali soldiers and policemen serving in East Pakistan. Another aim was to attack Hindu-majority areas of Dhaka. On the night of March 25, 1971, casualty figures in Dhaka alone reached approximately 35,000.
During the nine months of the operation, hundreds of thousands of Bengali women were subjected to rape. According to a report in the Smithsonian, around 400,000 women underwent late-term abortions, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
REFUGEES IN INDIA
The brutal crackdown compelled millions of Bangladeshis to flee to India. By May 1971, India was hosting 1.5 million refugees, a number that swelled to around 10 million by December 1971, making it the largest refugee crisis in the modern world. Internally, the military operation displaced approximately 30 million people within Bangladesh.
This massive influx placed a significant burden on India. Nevertheless, the country stepped forward to assist, despite lacking domestic laws to manage refugees and not being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. India established 825 refugee camps across seven states, with 19 central camps capable of accommodating up to 50,000 refugees each.
ECONOMIC BURDEN
The economic burden was significant. India had to reassess its Fourth Five-Year Plan. The 1971–72 Budget stated, “The country’s resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained by developments across the border, the influx of nearly ten million refugees and the outbreak of hostilities in December 1971.” 1 Despite these challenges, the economy responded effectively, as noted in the budget document.  
A World Bank assessment, based on 9 million refugees, estimated the direct cost to India at approximately US$700 million from April 1, 1971, to March 31, 1972, which equates to around US$5.5 billion today. India managed this expenditure largely through internal resources. According to a CIA document from March 1972, released in 2010, the Indian government spent about 4% of its planned central government expenditure for FY1971 on refugee care.
INDIA’S STAND
India supported Sheikh Mujib’s call for independence but initially refrained from participating in the war. Instead, it provided moral and material support to the independence movement. On April 17, 1971, a provisional government of Bangladesh was formed and relocated to Calcutta as the “Bangladesh Government in Exile.”
Meanwhile, the freedom fighters of East Pakistan formed the Mukti Bahini, an armed resistance movement against the West Pakistani military and supporting militias. Comprising members of the Bengali military, paramilitary forces, police, and civilians, these fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare.
India’s support bolstered their efforts. The geographical separation of 1,000 miles of Indian territory between West and East Pakistan meant that Pakistan could not easily reinforce its military presence in East Pakistan with additional air and naval power.
West Pakistan had previously exhibited hostility towards India, notably in the conflicts of 1947 and the 1965 war, which it lost. Its actions in East Pakistan heightened diplomatic tensions and prompted a military buildup in India.
The tipping point occurred on December 3, 1971, when Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on Indian airfields. This act of aggression compelled India to formally enter the war, engaging its Army, Navy, and Air Force in a coordinated response to both the humanitarian crisis and threats to its national sovereignty. Before this, India had adopted a restrained approach, engaging in diplomatic efforts and appealing to West Pakistani leaders to create safe corridors for refugees to return. These appeals were ignored.
THE QUICK END
India’s entry into the 1971 war was driven by the humanitarian crisis and direct threats to its national security. By launching joint military operations with the Mukti Bahini, effective coordination and intelligence sharing were achieved, significantly disrupting Pakistani military efforts. Through a series of strategic offensives, the joint forces rapidly overran West Pakistan’s military presence throughout Dhaka and East Pakistan.
On December 16, 1971, Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi of Pakistan unconditionally surrendered to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India, along with 93,000 troops, marking one of the largest surrenders since World War II. The war officially ended with India’s unilateral ceasefire on December 17.
WHY INDIA’S ENGAGEMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR A JOY BANGLA MOVEMENT
The success of the “Joy Bangla” movement on December 16, 1971, could only be possible with India’s commitment to the cause. With the onset of Operation Searchlight, India opened its borders to refugees, providing massive relief operations while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. Military intervention by India was the last resort.
The military intervention ultimately helped realize the goals of the “Joy Bangla” movement.
Twenty-three years of suppression, from 1947 to 1970, with West Pakistan ruling East Pakistan through military involvement, left the eastern territory with a strong desire for independence, an aspiration difficult to achieve in an economy controlled by West Pakistani industrialists and a polity dominated by a West Pakistan-based military ruler allied with exploitative politicians.
The increasing number of refugees in India proved the fact that there was no internal security structure and local and regional administration available for them to take over the West Pakistan-led apparatus.
Over ten million refugees fled to India in ten months, while thirty million were internally displaced. The refugee headcount included Bengali military wing officials, soldiers, and police personnel. According to the Bangladesh High Commission in London, thousands of families of officials, soldiers, and activists from East Pakistan were interned in West Pakistan. Killings and rapes became daily events of horror to be observed. India’s daily refugee count surged from 17,000 to 60,000, with numbers continuing to rise.
The freedom fighters of East Pakistan had the courage and will to fight for independence, but they lacked the strength of a coordinated war strategy and the full complement of military resources—army, air force, navy, arms, and ammunition—to defeat West Pakistan’s full-fledged military. They had to fight a country’s army that had exposure to past war experiences, something they didn’t have, as East Pakistan was not the war theatre of the 1965 India-Pakistan war. India’s decision to join the war after Pakistan’s attack on Indian territory proved to be the turning point, helping Bangladesh achieve a goal that once seemed unachievable.
Had the Mukti Bahini not received external support, Operation Searchlight could have seriously affected the East Pakistan freedom movement and its hopes to break the colonial shackles of West Pakistan.

Title: Rebels capture Damascus, topple Assad regime after 54 years; President flees to Russia
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:38:21 +0000
Content: On 27 November, the Syrian rebels launched a lighting offensive on President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. By the 29th, they had captured the city of Aleppo. And Hama a week later. On 8 December, Assad fled and Damascus fell, ending the 54-year rule of Assad and his late father Hafez al-Assad.
The Islamist rebels led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had never had it so good since a civil war erupted in Syria in the year 2011. Until the last week of November, the war in Syria had been mostly dormant for years. The front lines had remained frozen since 2020 but the sudden advance by the rebels has re-ignited fears of renewed sectarian clashes. President Assad and his supporters are followers of an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam called the Alawites. They are in a minority in a Sunni-dominated Syria.
So who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani?
His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa. He was born in the late 1970s or early 1980s. His grandfather was displaced from the Golan Heights when the Israeli Army entered the area. Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move that has not been recognised by the international community. In a 2021 interview to U.S. T.V. channel P.B.S., al-Golani said that his nom de guerre was a reference to his family origins in Syria’s Golan Heights.
As the commander of Al-Qaeda’s franchise in the Syrian civil war, al-Golani was a shadowy figure who kept out of the public eye, even when his group became the most powerful faction fighting President Assad. Today, he is Syria’s most recognisable insurgent, having gradually stepped into the limelight since severing ties to Al-Qaeda in 2016, rebranding his group, and emerging as the de facto ruler of rebel-held north-western Syria.
Joshua Landis from the University of Oklahoma in the U.S. says that al-Golani has been smarter than Assad. “He’s retooled, he’s refashioned, made new allies, and come out with his charm offensive towards minorities.” Aron Lund from the Swedish Defence Research Agency has a slightly nuanced taken on al-Golani. He says that it is P.R. but the fact that al-Golani and the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are engaging in this effort at all, shows they are no longer as rigid as they once were; Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State would have never done that.
Before founding the Al-Nusra Front, al-Golani had fought for Al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he spent five years in a U.S. prison. He returned to Syria once the uprising began. The U.S. designated al-Golani as a terrorist in 2013. As the Islamic State was collapsing, al-Golani cemented the grip of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, establishing a civil administration called the Syrian Salvation Government. In 2016, he announced that his group had cut ties with the Al-Qaeda. The following year, Al-Nusra was dissolved and replaced by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The U.S. and its allies have since designated the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist group. The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years but it faces a challenge convincing Western Governments it has fully renounced hardline jihad.
The rebels led by al-Golani timed their offensive to perfection. They launched their offensive on Aleppo to co-incide with a ceasefire coming into force between Israel and Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. But is there more to the timing of the offensive? Absolutely. For one, Syria’s main backer Russia is pre-occupied in Ukraine. Two, Iran’s influence in the region has diminished. And three, Hezbollah, which had fought alongside Assad’s men against the rebels, has weakened and its leader Hassan Nasrallah dead. So, the regional power balance has been shaken by more than a year of conflict pitting Israel against Iran and the militant groups it supports.
The Iran-backed Hezbollah, in particular, has suffered major blows during more than two months of war with Israel in Lebanon. Hezbollah, which has agreed to a ceasefire with Israel, helped Assad recover Aleppo in 2016.
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan tells C.N.N. that it was no surprise that rebels would try to take advantage of a new situation, what with the Syrian Government’s main backers — Iran, Russia and Hezbollah — distracted and weakened by regional conflicts and the Ukraine war.
That’s not all. Israel has dramatically escalated its airstrikes against Iranian forces stationed on the ground in Syria. The U.N. says that Israel has carried out more than 100 strikes on Syrian territory, killing more than 100 people. The increasing Israeli strikes have put Iranian forces in Syria on the defensive, allowing rebels to exploit a moment where various proxy forces backing Assad are more engaged elsewhere.
Surely, such an offensive would have taken some amount of time and planning. Reuters news agency cites the head of Syria’s main opposition abroad as saying that the rebels began preparations to seize Aleppo a year ago but the operation was delayed by the Gaza war. Turkiye’s Military, which is allied with some of the insurgents and has bases across its southern border in Syria, had heard of the armed groups’ plans but made clear it would play no direct role. However, Turkiye stands to benefit from Assad’s ouster. For one, Syrian refugees would leave Turkiye for Syria. Turkiye has a long border with Syria and has become home to about three million Syrian refugees since 2011. Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was long a supporter of the Syrian opposition after the civil war erupted in 2011.
Before the fall of Damascus to rebels led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syria was divided into several zones of influence with the warring parties backed by different foreign powers.
-The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ruled Syria’s north-west.
-The Kurdish fighters occupied the country’s north and east – east of the Euphrates river.
-Turkiye’s Military and factions loyal to it controlled two sections of the border in the north.
-The U.S. controlled the al-Tanf air base and its surrounding deconfliction zone bordering Iraq and Jordan. A deconfliction zone, as the name suggests, is an area that has been earmarked to avoid a potential clash or accident involving two or more militaries in a particular combat area.
-And the Syrian Government controlled 70 per cent of the country.
The U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters belonging to the Syrian Democratic Forces control lands east of the Euphrates river. The S.D.F. controls large parts of the Raqqa and Deir Ezzor provinces – virtually a quarter of Syrian territory. Formed in 2015, the S.D.F. is the de facto army of the ethnic Kurds but it also has Christian and Muslim fighters in its ranks. The S.D.F. is considered to be the second most powerful military force after the Syrian Army.
Pro-Turkish forces control two sections of the border from Jarabulus to Afrin in Aleppo province as well as a 1 hundred and 20-kilometre stretch of border territory from Ras al-Ain in Hasakeh province to Tal Abyad in Raqqa. The Kurds are present in Turkiye, Syria and Iraq. Turkiye sees the Kurds along its border with Syria as a threat. It sees the S.D.F. as a separatist group. Since 2016, Turkiye has carried out successive ground operations to expel Kurdish forces from parts of Syria’s northern border. Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought to establish a safe zone 30 kilometres deep along the frontier.
Then there are the U.S.-led coalition forces, which entered Syria in 2014 to fight the Islamic State. In 2016, the U.S. set up a remote base in Al-Tanf region, bordering Jordan and Iraq.
Tartus and Latakia were the strongholds of Assad’s Alawite sect. Russia, which joined Syria in its fight against the rebels in 2015, has a Naval facility in Tartus and uses the Hmeimim airbase near Latakia.

Title: Upcoming Noida International Airport will boost connectivity: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:11:33 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the upcoming Noida International Airport will improve connectivity for the National Capital Region (NCR) and Uttar Pradesh.
“The upcoming Noida International Airport will boost connectivity and ‘Ease of Living’ for the NCR and Uttar Pradesh. Our Government has been taking many steps to ensure top-quality infrastructure for the people and leverage the power of connectivity to further prosperity,” PM Modi said in a post on X.
On Monday, the Noida International Airport in Greater Noida witnessed a historic moment as its first-ever flight landed, amid the ongoing trials, and was accorded a ceremonial water cannon salute.
The trial flight, which came from Delhi and landed at 1.30 p.m., was carrying Airport Authority of India (AAI) officials, and technical experts. It was a crucial step in testing the airport’s readiness.
The team onboard gathered comprehensive technical data during the take-off, flight, and landing phases to ensure operational safety and efficiency.
During the trial, the aircraft performed a 15-minute flight before landing on the 3,900-metre runway at Jewar. After a brief 5-minute stop, the plane took off again. The collected data will be sent to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for further analysis.
Trials will continue till December 15.
The first commercial flight from the airport is expected to take off in April 2025.
Approximately 85 per cent of the airport’s construction work has been completed. Advanced systems like CAT-1 and CAT-3 Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), which enhance aircraft visibility during foggy conditions, have already been installed and tested in October.
The work of the 3.9 km runway is fully complete. The terminal Building is nearing completion with roof finishing and equipment installation works going on. A 38-metre-high Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower is fully operational.
Operated by Zurich International Airport AG, the Noida International Airport will have a 40-year management contract. Once operational in April, it will handle 65 flights per day, including 62 domestic, 2 international, and a cargo flight, serving 12 million passengers annually. Upon completion, the airport will become the fourth largest in Asia.

Title: Manipur government lifts mobile internet ban in nine districts
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:50:11 +0000
Content: The Manipur government on Monday lifted the suspension of mobile internet services in nine districts of the state. The decision followed a review of the prevailing law and order situation, according to an official notification from the State Home Department.
The districts where the internet ban has been revoked are Imphal West, Imphal East, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Kakching, Kangpokpi, Churachandpur, Jiribam, and Pherzawl. Commissioner (Home) N. Ashok Kumar, in the issued order, urged internet users to avoid any activities that could lead to further suspension of services.
The ban had been in place for over three weeks, with authorities citing security concerns in the wake of ongoing tensions in the state.
On December 8, the Manipur Police conducted search operations in sensitive areas across hill and valley districts. They facilitated the safe movement of 373 vehicles carrying essential supplies along National Highway-2. Additionally, 107 checkpoints were set up across the state to monitor activities and ensure security.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of India sought a detailed report from the Manipur government on incidents of property damage and encroachments. The report, to be submitted in a sealed cover, will provide details of affected properties, current occupants, and actions taken against trespassers.
The court also directed the state government to address the release of funds for temporary and permanent housing as recommended by the Justice Gita Mittal Committee. The next hearing on violence-related issues in Manipur is scheduled for January 20, 2025.

Title: Assad’s fall brings ‘the moment’ to rid Syria of chemical weapons
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 15:59:18 +0000
Content: The downfall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, found to have used chemical weapons against his own people on multiple occasions during the civil war, creates an opportunity to rid the country of banned munitions, diplomatic sources said on Monday.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was following the situation in Syria with “special attention” to chemical weapons-related sites and had reminded Syria, through its embassy, of its continued obligation to declare and destroy all banned chemical weapons.
A team at OPCW has spent more than a decade trying to clarify what types of chemical weapons Syria still possesses, but has made little progress due to obstruction by Assad’s government, it said.
“To date, this work has continued, and the Syrian declaration of its chemical weapons programme still cannot be considered as accurate and complete,” the OPCW statement said.
A diplomatic source said Assad’s government had been “playing cat and mouse with us for years” and that “we are convinced that they still had an ongoing programme.”
“It costs millions and millions of dollars without making any progress,” said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. “So it really is a great opportunity now to get rid of (chemical weapons) for good. This is the moment.”
Security guarantees will need to be arranged before any deployment by OPCW inspectors. That would require contacting new power brokers in Syria, possibly rebel forces in the alliance that toppled Assad, such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate labelled a terrorist group by some governments.
Past missions have not been free of risk. Members of a United Nations-OPCW mission to Syria were hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while trying to reach the site of a chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita in May 2014.
Assad’s government and its Russian allies always denied using chemical weapons against opponents in the civil war, which erupted in March 2011.
Three investigations – a joint U.N.-OPCW mechanism, the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification team, and a U.N. war crimes investigation – concluded that Syrian government forces used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks during the civil war that killed or injured thousands.
A French court issued an arrest warrant for Assad which was upheld on appeal over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians.
EVIDENCE
Syria’s undeclared chemical weapons pose “a proliferation risk,” U.S. Ambassador to the OPCW, Nicole Shampaine, said in a statement on Monday. “We hope that developments in Syria in the last several days will lead to …Syrian compliance with its international obligations.”
A special session of the OPCW’s executive council was scheduled for Thursday.
Syria declared 1,300 tons of banned chemical weapons after joining the OPCW in 2013. The weapons were destroyed, but weapons inspectors have since found evidence of an ongoing programme that violated the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention overseen by the OPCW.
The OPCW has conducted 28 rounds of consultations with Assad’s government, but a list of unexplained inconsistencies has only grown.
A recent assessment said 19 outstanding issues included “potentially undeclared full-scale development and production of chemical weapons at two declared chemical weapons-related facilities,” OPCW chief Fernando Arias said in November.
Among thousands of victims of suspected chemical weapons attack were more than 1,000 killed in a sarin gas attack on Aug. 21, 2013 in the Damascus suburb Ghouta, and around 100 killed in an April 4, 2017 gas attack on Khan Sheikhoun in northern Syria. The systematic use of chlorine barrel bombs has killed and injured hundreds more, the OPCW has found.

Title: India’s digital transformation: strengthening infrastructure and governance
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 15:53:36 +0000
Content: India has emerged as a global leader in digital adoption, with significant advancements in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and digital governance. These developments have strengthened the country’s digital economy, enhancing the accessibility, scalability, and security of services for both government operations and private sector growth.
Expanding digital infrastructure
A critical pillar of India’s digital transformation is its expanding data centre ecosystem. These facilities support the growing demand for cloud services, data storage, and AI/ML applications. India’s data centre industry, with an IT load capacity of approximately 1,000 MW, is on a growth trajectory. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) operates multiple National Data Centres (NDCs) in cities like Delhi, Pune, Bhubaneswar, and Hyderabad, offering cloud services, disaster recovery, and hosting solutions for government functions. A new NDC in Guwahati, Assam, is under development to address regional challenges and promote socio-economic growth.
Advancing cloud services and e-governance
The NIC’s MeghRaj initiative, launched in 2022, has significantly enhanced India’s cloud infrastructure, serving over 300 government departments and enabling efficient e-Governance services. MeghRaj supports applications such as digital payments and identity verification, while the GI Cloud project empowers state and Union Territory (UT) departments to adopt cloud solutions, driving further progress in digital public infrastructure.
Strengthening digital public infrastructure
India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has revolutionized service delivery. Aadhaar, the world’s largest digital identity system, has issued over 138 crore unique IDs. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed financial transactions, processing over 24,100 crore transactions by June 2024. Platforms like DigiLocker, DIKSHA, and the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) further reinforce the country’s digital transformation, enabling seamless access to critical services.
Revolutionising health and education
India’s digital advances extend into healthcare and education. Initiatives like eSanjeevani (telemedicine), e-Hospital (hospital management), and e-Courts have improved healthcare and justice delivery. DigiLocker has simplified digital document verification for over 37 crore users. In education, the DIKSHA platform, supporting 556 crore learning sessions, stands as the largest global education initiative.
Improving rural connectivity
The Common Services Centres (CSCs) initiative has brought digital services to rural areas, with over 5.84 lakh operational CSCs as of October 2024. These centres offer access to government schemes, education, and telemedicine, bridging the urban-rural divide in digital accessibility.
Citizen-centric platforms
User-friendly platforms like UMANG and MeriPehchaan have streamlined access to government services. UMANG integrates services across various sectors and has a user base of over 7.12 crore. Similarly, MeriPehchaan enables single authentication for accessing government services. Initiatives such as e-Sign, API Setu, and MyGov promote seamless service delivery and citizen engagement.
Streamlining government operations
The government is making strides toward paperless governance. DigiLocker, with over 37 crore users, has transformed document issuance and verification. Tools like CollabFiles and GovDrive support secure document management for government officials, while the Gov Intranet Platform enhances workflow and communication, improving efficiency.

Title: Russian exporters won’t stop supplying wheat to Syria unilaterally
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 13:40:53 +0000
Content: Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally stop supplying wheat to Syria amid political turmoil there, Eduard Zernin, head of the Russian Grain Producers and Exporters Union, said on Monday
Russia is a major supplier of wheat to Syria, where rebels seized capital Damascus, ending the rule of Bashar al-Assad and ousting him as president. Assad fled to Moscow after a lightning rebel offensive.
“Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally terminate their obligations under concluded contracts,” Zernin said.
Zernin estimated Syria’s imports at about 2 million metric tons of wheat per year. A disruption of Russian wheat supplies could risk hunger in the country of over 23 million people.
“Syria is not a key consumer for us, but it is a decent market with a capacity of about 2 million tons of wheat per year,” he said.
IKAR consultancy’s Dmitry’s Rylko estimated wheat exports to Syria at 300,000 tons so far this season with the country ranking 24th among Russian wheat buyers.
Zernin said that Russian exporters would work with the Syrian side to resolve wheat supply payments and outstanding debt issues. Russia has previously issued loans to Syria to enable it to pay for wheat imports.

Title: Govt spends over Rs. 147 crore to skill 1.42 lakh persons with disabilities
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 13:33:13 +0000
Content: The union government has made significant strides in empowering persons with disabilities (PwDs) through skill development and other welfare measures. Under the National Action Plan for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (NAP-SDP), launched in March 2015, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities has trained 1.42 lakh PwDs at a cost of ₹147.78 crore.
Out of these, 28,000 individuals have secured employment or ventured into self-employment. The scheme, implemented via government and non-government organizations, aims to equip PwDs with vocational skills to enable economic independence.
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, which came into effect on April 19, 2017, serves as a cornerstone for PwD rights. The Act expanded the list of recognized disabilities from 7 to 21 and mandates 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions for individuals with benchmark disabilities (40% or more).
Additional measures include the Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) scheme, which distributes mobility aids, accessible smartphones, and other devices. The Deendayal Divyangjan Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) supports various rehabilitation projects and has benefitted 96,000 individuals over the past three years.
The government also provides scholarships for PwDs across education levels, including pre-matric, post-matric, postgraduate, and overseas programs. Over 1.15 lakh PwDs have received these scholarships in the past three years.

The Special PMLA Court in Mumbai has approved the “monetisation of properties” amounting to Rs 2,565.90 crore, attached or seized by ED in the PNB fraud case involving fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi.
In line with the court order, the process of handing over these assets has begun. Properties worth over Rs 125 crore, including flats in Mumbai and two factories/godowns at SEEPZ Mumbai, have already been handed over to the Liquidator of M/s Gitanjali Gems Ltd., with further restitution underway.
The ED’s investigation revealed that Mehul Choksi, in collusion with associates and PNB officials, fraudulently obtained Letters of Undertaking and Foreign Letters of Credit between 2014 and 2017. This resulted in a loss of Rs 6,097.63 crore to PNB. Choksi also defaulted on loans taken from ICICI Bank.
To date, the ED has conducted searches at over 136 locations across India, seizing valuables and jewellery worth Rs 597.75 crore belonging to the Gitanjali Group.
Apart from this, immovable and movable assets worth Rs 1,968.15 crore, including properties in India and abroad, vehicles, bank accounts, factories, shares, and jewellery, were attached. In total, assets valued at Rs 2,565.90 crore have been attached or seized, and three prosecution complaints have been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The ED and the victim banks jointly moved the special court to expedite asset monetisation. The court order dated September 10, 2024, directed ED to assist the banks and liquidators of Gitanjali Group companies in valuing and auctioning the attached or seized properties. Proceeds from these auctions will be deposited as fixed deposits in PNB and ICICI Bank.
As part of this process, six properties, including flats in Kheni Tower, Santacruz East, Mumbai, valued at Rs 27 crore, and two SEEPZ properties (Plot No. 61 and Plot No. 16), valued at Rs 98.03 crore, have been restored and handed over to the liquidator. The transfer of remaining assets is underway as per court directives.

Title: Sri Lanka President Dissanayake to visit India in his first foreign trip
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 11:53:57 +0000
Content: Sri Lankan President Anura Dissanayake is set to embark on his first international trip since assuming office, with a visit to India scheduled from December 15 to 17.
The Sri Lankan government confirmed that during his visit, Dissanayake will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Droupadi Murmu. He will be accompanied by key officials, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath and Deputy Minister of Finance Anil Jayantha Fernando.
The visit follows an invitation extended by External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar during his trip to Colombo earlier this year, shortly after the National People’s Power (NPP) party came to power.
During his one-day visit to Colombo on October 4, EAM Jaishankar met President Dissanayake and reaffirmed India’s strong commitment to advancing bilateral cooperation under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and SAGAR outlook.
The discussions covered various initiatives, including energy production and transmission, fuel and LNG supply, solar electrification of religious places, connectivity, digital public infrastructure, health, and dairy development. These efforts aim to foster economic sustainability and create new revenue streams for Sri Lanka.
President Dissanayake acknowledged India’s critical economic support in realizing his vision of a prosperous Sri Lanka and meeting the aspirations of its people. He highlighted the potential of exporting renewable energy to India, which could reduce production costs and create additional resources. He also recognized the growing contribution of Indian tourists to Sri Lanka’s economy.
President Dissanayake’s upcoming visit is expected to strengthen bilateral ties, with key discussions likely focusing on economic cooperation, regional stability, and reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka.

Title: ​​Sensex, Nifty end flat ahead of key inflation data
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 11:35:27 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices closed flat on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of the release of key CPI inflation data from both the US and India.
The Sensex inched up 1.59 points to 81,510.05, while the Nifty dipped 8.95 points to close at 24,610.05.
Out of the Nifty’s 50 constituents, 23 stocks advanced, while 27 declined. Leading the gains were Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Technologies, Wipro, and Infosys, while Bharti Airtel, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, and HDFC Life were the top laggards.
VLA Ambala, co-founder of Stock Market Today, attributed the market’s muted performance to investor caution.
“During Tuesday’s session, the Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range as investors remained cautious ahead of the upcoming US and India CPI data. However, the market turned negative at the end of the day, driven by energy and telecom stocks. In contrast, the IT index was the highlight of the day by hitting a record high of 45,377.75. This movement was supported by more favorable global market conditions and the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar,” Ambala said.
The rupee fell to a new low of 84.8575 against the US dollar, amid speculation of future rate cuts following the announcement of Sanjay Malhotra as the next Reserve Bank of India governor.

Content: The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), launched in 2016 to provide ‘pucca’ houses with basic amenities for rural households, has been extended by five years. The government aims to construct an additional two crore houses under the scheme by FY 2028-29, building on the initial target of 2.95 crore houses set for FY 2016-17 to 2023-24.
Minister of State for Rural Development, Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, shared these details in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
To identify eligible households, a nationwide survey is being conducted using the Awaas+ 2024 Mobile App, launched on September 17. The app facilitates both self-surveys and assisted surveys by pre-registered surveyors. Orientation workshops have trained over two lakh surveyors and field staff across 26 states and 8 Union Territories to ensure the effective implementation of the scheme.
The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to achieving “housing for all” in rural areas, addressing housing inadequacies, and improving the quality of life in villages.

Title: Israeli troops near Damascus, say Syrian security, after Israeli airstrikes hit Syrian bases
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:38:57 +0000
Content: An Israeli military incursion into Syria has reached about 25 km (16 miles) southwest of Damascus, Syrian security sources said on Tuesday, after Israel seized a buffer zone in southern Syria and launched air strikes on Syrian army and air bases overnight.
Israel’s military operation into Syria comes two days after the lightning overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad by a rebel alliance left Syrians, regional countries and world powers nervous about what comes next.
A Syrian security source said Israeli troops reached Qatana, which is 10 km (six miles) into Syrian territory east of a demilitarised zone separating Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria.
Israel has said it will not become involved in conflict in Syria and that its seizure of the buffer zone was a defensive move.
Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have condemned the incursion. Saudi Arabia said the move would “ruin Syria’s chances of restoring security”.
Regional security sources and officers within the now fallen Syrian army said heavy Israeli airstrikes continued against military installations and airbases across Syria overnight, destroying dozens of helicopters and jets, as well as Republican Guard assets in and around Damascus.
The rough tally of 200 raids had left nothing of the Syrian army’s assets, they said.
Israel said its airstrikes would carry on for days but told the U.N. Security Council that it was not intervening in Syria’s conflict. It said it had taken “limited and temporary measures” solely to protect its security.
The United Nations Security Council met behind closed doors late on Monday, and diplomats said they were still in shock at how quickly Assad’s overthrow unfolded over 12 days, after a 13-year civil war that was locked in stalemate for years.
“Everyone was taken by surprise, everyone, including the members of the council. So we have to wait and see and watch … and evaluate how the situation will develop,” Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after the body met.
Russia played a major role in supporting Assad’s government and helping it fight the rebels. The Syrian leader fled Damascus for Moscow on Sunday, ending more than 50 years of brutal rule by his family.
With the mood in Damascus still celebratory, Assad’s prime minister, Mohammed Jalali, on Monday agreed to hand power to the rebel-led Salvation Government, an administration based in rebel-held territory in northwest Syria.

Title: Philippines to continue resupply missions in S.China Sea, won’t escalate situation
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 09:31:26 +0000
Content: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Tuesday that the country will not send its navy to support Filipino fishers in a contested shoal in the South China Sea despite a recent incident with Chinese vessels.
“We will never be part of an escalation in the West Philippine Sea,” Marcos told reporters, adding that the country will continue supporting fishermen.
The Philippines will not deploy its own navy warships in the area to prevent provocation and escalation, Marcos said. The Philippines refers to the portion of the South China Sea that it claims as the West Philippine Sea.
China will continue to safeguard its sovereignty, rights and interests, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.
“The recent maritime incidents between China and the Philippines are entirely caused by the Philippines’ persistent infringement and provocation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
Chinese coastguard vessels on Dec. 4 fired a water cannon and side-swiped a Manila fisheries bureau boat transporting supplies to Filipino fishermen operating in the Scarborough Shoal, a prime fishing patch, according to Philippine officials.
Philippine coastguard vessels also faced “blocking, shadowing, and dangerous manoeuvres” from a Chinese navy vessel.
China’s coastguard said last week that Philippine ships “dangerously approached” Beijing’s territorial waters around the Scarborough Shoal.
The Philippines filed a diplomatic protest against China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, angering neighbouring countries that dispute boundaries they say cut into their exclusive economic zones.

Title: Mamata Banerjee should lead INDIA bloc: RJD’s Lalu Yadav
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 08:44:34 +0000
Content: Former Bihar Chief Minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Tuesday backed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for the leadership of the INDIA Bloc.
Speaking to ANI in Patna, Lalu Yadav said, “Congress’s objection means nothing. We will support Mamata… Mamata Banerjee should be given the leadership (of the INDIA Bloc)… We will form the government again in 2025.”
His statement drew mixed reactions from across the political spectrum.
In Delhi, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi emphasized the need for unity in decision-making, saying, “There is no official statement from our party yet. I cannot say anything about it. Every party has their opinion. When the meeting takes place, whatever is decided unanimously will be acceptable to our party…”
TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee backed Lalu’s proposal. Criticizing the Congress leadership, he said, “We had earlier stated that Congress should understand that the INDIA bloc has failed under its leadership. It would be better if Mamata Didi is brought in as the leader of the INDIA Bloc. Out of all the leaders, Mamata Didi’s name is at the top when it comes to political fighting.”
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dismissed Lalu Yadav’s statement, questioning the unity within the INDIA Bloc. BJP MP Arun Govil said, “The members of the bloc can only answer this in a better way.” Similarly, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “They (leaders of the INDIA Bloc) don’t consider anyone their leader; they consider themselves as the leader.”
Congress, a significant player in the INDIA Bloc, has yet to issue an official response to Lalu Yadav’s suggestion.

Title: India’s retail inflation likely to ease: report
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 07:47:38 +0000
Content: India’s retail inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is expected to ease to 5.5 percent in November due to a decline in food prices, according to a Morgan Stanley report.
“We expect CPI inflation to edge downwards to 5.5 percent in November from 6.2 percent in October, aided by a moderation in food prices, even as core inflation ticks up and fuel prices continue to decline. On a sequential basis, we anticipate the index to decline due to contracting food prices and a deceleration in core CPI,” the report said.
The core CPI includes goods and services but excludes food and fuel, the prices of which are considered more volatile.
CPI inflation reached 6.21 percent in October as higher prices of food items, such as vegetables, spiked during the month. This was the first time that inflation breached the RBI’s upper limit of 6 percent in recent months.
Retail inflation increased from 5.49 percent recorded in September as vegetable prices surged by as much as 42.18 percent in October. The late withdrawal of the monsoon this year resulted in damage to crops and reduced supply in the market.
Despite the surge in inflation in October, outgoing RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das stressed last week that “India’s growth story remains intact.”
He highlighted that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.” However, Das warned of “significant risks in the outlook that cannot be underestimated.”
On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 percent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth. However, it kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, with an eye on inflation.
The CRR cut will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and help bring down market interest rates.

The Special PMLA Court in Mumbai has approved the “monetisation of properties” amounting to Rs 2,565.90 crore, attached or seized by ED in the PNB fraud case involving fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi.

The ED’s investigation revealed that Mehul Choksi, in collusion with associates and PNB officials, fraudulently obtained Letters of Undertaking and Foreign Letters of Credit between 2014 and 2017. This resulted in a loss of Rs 6,097.63 crore to PNB. Choksi also defaulted on loans taken from ICICI Bank.
To date, the ED has conducted searches at over 136 locations across India, seizing valuables and jewellery worth Rs 597.75 crore belonging to the Gitanjali Group.

Proceeds from these auctions will be deposited as fixed deposits in PNB and ICICI Bank.

The Sri Lankan government confirmed that during his visit, Dissanayake will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Droupadi Murmu. He will be accompanied by key officials, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath and Deputy Minister of Finance Anil Jayantha Fernando.
The visit follows an invitation extended by External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar during his trip to Colombo earlier this year, shortly after the National People’s Power (NPP) party came to power.
During his one-day visit to Colombo on October 4, EAM Jaishankar met President Dissanayake and reaffirmed India’s strong commitment to advancing bilateral cooperation under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and SAGAR outlook.
The discussions covered various initiatives, including energy production and transmission, fuel and LNG supply, solar electrification of religious places, connectivity, digital public infrastructure, health, and dairy development. These efforts aim to foster economic sustainability and create new revenue streams for Sri Lanka.
President Dissanayake acknowledged India’s critical economic support in realizing his vision of a prosperous Sri Lanka and meeting the aspirations of its people. He highlighted the potential of exporting renewable energy to India, which could reduce production costs and create additional resources. He also recognized the growing contribution of Indian tourists to Sri Lanka’s economy.
President Dissanayake’s upcoming visit is expected to strengthen bilateral ties, with key discussions likely focusing on economic cooperation, regional stability, and reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka.

Title: ​​Sensex, Nifty end flat ahead of key inflation data
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 11:35:27 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices closed flat on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of the release of key CPI inflation data from both the US and India.
The Sensex inched up 1.59 points to 81,510.05, while the Nifty dipped 8.95 points to close at 24,610.05.
Out of the Nifty’s 50 constituents, 23 stocks advanced, while 27 declined. Leading the gains were Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Technologies, Wipro, and Infosys, while Bharti Airtel, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, and HDFC Life were the top laggards.
VLA Ambala, co-founder of Stock Market Today, attributed the market’s muted performance to investor caution.
“During Tuesday’s session, the Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range as investors remained cautious ahead of the upcoming US and India CPI data. However, the market turned negative at the end of the day, driven by energy and telecom stocks. In contrast, the IT index was the highlight of the day by hitting a record high of 45,377.75. This movement was supported by more favorable global market conditions and the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar,” Ambala said.
The rupee fell to a new low of 84.8575 against the US dollar, amid speculation of future rate cuts following the announcement of Sanjay Malhotra as the next Reserve Bank of India governor.

Title: Govt extends PMAY-G, targets two crore additional rural houses by 2029
Publication Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 11:29:59 +0000
Content: The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), launched in 2016 to provide ‘pucca’ houses with basic amenities for rural households, has been extended by five years. The government aims to construct an additional two crore houses under the scheme by FY 2028-29, building on the initial target of 2.95 crore houses set for FY 2016-17 to 2023-24.
Minister of State for Rural Development, Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, shared these details in a written reply to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
To identify eligible households, a nationwide survey is being conducted using the Awaas+ 2024 Mobile App, launched on September 17. The app facilitates both self-surveys and assisted surveys by pre-registered surveyors. Orientation workshops have trained over two lakh surveyors and field staff across 26 states and 8 Union Territories to ensure the effective implementation of the scheme.
The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to achieving “housing for all” in rural areas, addressing housing inadequacies, and improving the quality of life in villages.

Title: Indian EV industry to attract $40 billion investments, boosting real estate growth: report
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 07:30:18 +0000
Content: The Indian electric vehicle (EV) and ancillary sectors are poised to attract nearly $40 billion in investments over the next five to six years, creating significant opportunities for the real estate market, according to a report by Colliers India.
The report, titled “EVs in India: Renewed Vigour in Electric Mobility,” highlights that nearly two-thirds of these investments are expected to be concentrated in the lithium-ion battery segment. Despite slower-than-expected EV adoption, the industry has seen a threefold surge in investment commitments over the past three years, reflecting renewed optimism about India’s electric mobility prospects.
The anticipated investments are set to drive substantial real estate demand, particularly for the development of EV and original equipment (OE) manufacturing units, including lithium-ion battery facilities. Colliers estimates that the increasing adoption of EVs will also generate demand for over 45 million square feet of real estate by 2030, primarily to support the establishment of EV charging infrastructure.
With an EV penetration rate of 8% in India, sales are projected to reach approximately two million units in 2024. However, the report cautions that the ambitious target of having 80 million EVs on Indian roads by 2030 may face challenges due to the current pace of adoption. Achieving this goal will require a sixfold increase in average annual EV sales from 2025 to 2030, coupled with strategic measures to transform the EV ecosystem.
Badal Yagnik, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers India, emphasized the need for affordability and large-scale manufacturing to accelerate adoption. “Demand and supply incentives will remain pivotal, but reducing production costs, enhancing affordability, and scaling up high-capacity manufacturing units—especially for lithium-ion batteries—are essential to meeting EV targets,” Yagnik said.
The report further underlines the transformative impact of domestic EV production on real estate. By 2030, nearly 13,000 acres of land could be acquired and developed for EV-related projects, with over 80% of this demand coming from lithium-ion battery manufacturers. The industrial and warehousing sector is expected to benefit the most, with a surge in demand for built-to-suit facilities catering to both global and domestic EV manufacturers.
Additionally, the rise of technology-driven warehouses and automated systems is anticipated to streamline operations across the EV value chain, further integrating the industry and supporting its growth.

Title: India to build Bharat Antariksha Station by 2035, to land an Indian on Moon by 2040: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 07:18:34 +0000
Content: India is set to achieve groundbreaking milestones in space exploration with plans to establish its own space station, Bharat Antariksha Station, by 2035 and to land an Indian astronaut on the Moon by 2040. Union Minister of State for Science & Technology and Space, Jitendra Singh, shared the ambitious roadmap on Wednesday during a press conference in Delhi.
Singh highlighted the government’s vision for self-reliance and global leadership in science and technology. He stated that India would join an elite group of nations by setting up its own space station within the next decade and a half. Additionally, by 2040, the country aims to send an Indian astronaut to the Moon, further cementing its place in the global space race.
Providing updates on the Gaganyaan mission, India’s first human spaceflight program, Singh revealed that the first Indian astronaut is expected to travel to space by late 2024 or early 2026. Alongside this milestone, the country is also making strides in deep-sea exploration. Under the Deep Sea Mission, India plans to send a human to depths of up to 6,000 meters, a significant leap in marine exploration.
The minister highlighted India’s advancements in satellite launches, saying that the country has successfully launched 432 foreign satellites from Sriharikota, with almost 90 percent of these accomplished in the past decade. This remarkable track record reflects India’s expanding expertise and solidifies its reputation as a trusted partner in the global satellite launch industry.
Singh also outlined the government’s focus on biotechnology, highlighting the Biotechnology E3 policy aimed at integrating biotechnology with economic growth, employment generation, and environmental sustainability. He emphasized the bio-economy’s role in driving the next industrial revolution, positioning it as a successor to the IT revolution.

Title: Death toll from Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia rises to six, officials say
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 06:37:59 +0000
Content: The death toll from a Russian missile strike that destroyed a clinic in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday has risen to six, while four more people remain under the rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said on Wednesday.
An additional 22 people were injured, governor Ivan Fedorov said on his Telegram messaging channel.
“All emergency services of the city are working at the scene,” he said.
Ukraine’s State Emergency Service of Ukraine said its rescuers were able to pull out two women overnight from underneath the ruins of the building.
Photos posted on the emergency’s Telegram messaging channel showed rescuers and machinery working in piles of rubble from a collapsed building at night.
Russia regularly carries out airstrikes on Zaporizhzhia and the surrounding region. Last Friday, an attack on the city killed 10 people and wounded more than 20.
Both sides deny targeting civilians in their attacks, saying the aim of the strikes is to undermine infrastructure key to each other’s war efforts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Ukraine’s allies on Tuesday to provide 10-12 more Patriot air defence systems that he said would fully protect the country’s skies.
Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has consistently asked its allies to supply more advanced air-defence systems.

Title: India’s fight against left-wing extremism sees remarkable progress
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 06:20:49 +0000
Content: The Government of India’s determined efforts to combat left-wing extremism (LWE) have yielded remarkable results, reflecting a consistent decline in violence and a shrinking geographical footprint of Maoist influence. The Ministry of Home Affairs recently detailed these achievements in a statement to the Lok Sabha, attributing the progress to the resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan to Address LWE, launched in 2015.
Over the years, India has witnessed a dramatic reduction in LWE-related violence. The incidents of Maoist attacks, which peaked in 2010 with over 2,200 violent events, have declined by an astounding 73% by 2023. The resultant deaths of civilians and security forces have dropped even more sharply, falling by 86% from 1,005 in 2010 to just 138 in 2023. The ongoing year, 2024, has shown further improvement, with a 25% reduction in violence recorded up to mid-November compared to the same period in the previous year.
The geographical spread of LWE has also contracted significantly. From affecting 126 districts across 10 states in 2013, Maoist activities are now limited to just 38 districts across nine states as of April 2024. Key states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha continue to bear the brunt of the insurgency, with districts such as Bastar, Sukma, and Gadchiroli remaining hotspots. However, the overall reduction highlights the effectiveness of the government’s multi-faceted approach to addressing this challenge.
Central to this progress is the government’s comprehensive strategy, combining security measures with developmental initiatives to address the root causes of extremism. On the security front, the government has provided extensive support to LWE-affected states, deploying Central Armed Police Forces, funding the modernization of state police forces, and constructing fortified police stations in vulnerable areas.
Between 2019 and 2024, a total of ₹4,350.78 crore was allocated under schemes such as the Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) and Security Related Expenditure (SRE) to bolster the capacity of state forces. Additionally, ₹560.22 crore was provided to central agencies for helicopters and critical infrastructure within security camps in LWE-prone regions.
Developmental initiatives have played a critical role in the government’s approach, focusing on improving connectivity, enhancing financial inclusion, and empowering local communities. Over 14,469 kilometers of roads have been constructed in LWE-affected areas, providing much-needed connectivity to remote regions.
Telecommunication infrastructure has also been improved, with 6,567 mobile towers commissioned, enabling better communication and access to services. To promote financial inclusion, 5,731 post offices, 1,007 bank branches, and 937 ATMs have been set up in the 30 most affected districts, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy.
Efforts to uplift and empower the youth have been prioritized. Forty-six Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and 49 Skill Development Centers are now operational in these areas, equipping young people with vocational skills and better livelihood opportunities. Furthermore, 178 Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) have been established to provide quality education to tribal children, ensuring they are not drawn into extremist ideologies.
The government’s community engagement initiatives have also been instrumental in winning the trust of local populations. Under the Civic Action Programme, Central Armed Police Forces such as the CRPF and BSF have conducted welfare activities to bridge the gap between security personnel and the local people, steering the youth away from Maoist influence. Tribal Youth Exchange Programs organized by the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan have further strengthened the integration of tribal communities into the mainstream.
While the gains have been substantial, challenges remain. Districts like Bastar in Chhattisgarh and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra continue to see sporadic Maoist activities, requiring sustained efforts to ensure lasting peace. The government has reiterated its commitment to addressing these challenges through a holistic approach that combines strong security measures with inclusive development.

Title: Human trafficking rises sharply after dropping during pandemic, UN says
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 05:43:00 +0000
Content: Human trafficking has risen sharply due to conflicts, climate-induced disasters and global crises, according to a United Nations report published on Wednesday.
In 2022, the latest year for which data is widely available, the number of known victims worldwide rose to 25% above 2019’s pre-pandemic levels, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Report on Trafficking in Persons said. A sharp fall in 2020 had largely disappeared by the following year.
“Criminals are increasingly trafficking people into forced labour, including to coerce them into running sophisticated online scams and cyberfraud, while women and girls face the risk of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,” the report said, adding that organised crime was mainly responsible.
Children accounted for 38% of detected victims, compared to 35% for figures for 2020 which formed the basis of the previous report.
The latest report showed adult women remain the largest group of victims, representing 39% of cases, followed by men at 23%, girls at 22% and boys at 16%.
The total number of victims in 2022 was 69,627.
The most common reason by far for women and girls being trafficked was sexual exploitation at 60% or more, followed by forced labour. For men, it was forced labour and for boys, it was forced labour and “other purposes” in roughly equal measure.
Those other purposes include forced criminality and forced begging. The report said the growing number of boys identified as victims of trafficking could be linked to rising numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving in Europe and North America.
The region of origin that accounted for the largest number of victims was sub-Saharan Africa with 26%, though there are many different trafficking routes.
While improved detection could account for the growing numbers, the report said it was likely a combination of that and more trafficking in general.
The biggest increases in cases detected were in sub-Saharan Africa, North America and the ‘western and southern Europe’ region, according to the report, with migration influxes being a significant factor in the latter two.

Title: Sensex, Nifty muted as investors await US consumer inflation data
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 05:32:00 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened flat on Wednesday, entering a consolidation phase as investors awaited key US consumer inflation data.
The Nifty edged up by 10.45 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,620.50, while the Sensex gained 58.34 points, or 0.07 percent, to 81,568.39.
Market experts highlighted the significance of the US Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) report, which is expected to influence global markets. However, the consolidation in Indian markets is expected to continue, with the possibility of a rally toward the end of the year.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said, “With US markets at their 57th all-time high, there’s limited room for the US CPI to come in higher than 0.3 percent without causing some disruption. Indian markets are likely to remain sideways today as institutional investors await the USI CPI release this evening. We expect consolidation followed by a pre-Budget rally, which could drive Indian markets higher by year-end.”
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial, and Nifty IT saw selling pressure, while Nifty Auto, Nifty FMCG, Nifty Media, and Nifty Metal posted gains.
In the Nifty 50, 29 stocks gained, while 21 declined at the time of this report. Ultratech Cement, Grasim, Tata Consumers, and BPCL were among the top gainers, while Dr. Reddy’s, HCL Tech, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank were the major laggards in the opening session.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said: “The Nifty ended down a third day, but the late-session rebound has traced a candlestick with a long lower shadow, showing demand near 24500. Note that this level represents a so-called “polarity” zone which was formerly resistance. The immediate upside hurdle is the flat-lining 100DMA near 24700, while a critical support zone lies between 24360 and 24445.”
In broader Asian markets, indices also showed a lack of momentum. The Nikkei 225 slipped 0.27 percent, the Hang Seng was flat, and the Taiwan Weighted index declined 0.41 percent. Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI continued its recovery.

Content: Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, said on Tuesday that optimizing fuel and road expenses could lower India’s logistics cost to nine percent within two years.
Addressing the Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit 2024 in Jaipur, Gadkari emphasized that such measures would bolster Rajasthan’s export competitiveness. “By reducing logistics costs from 16 percent to 9 percent, Rajasthan can bridge the 7 percent gap, making the state a strong player in the export market”.
He underlined the necessity of focusing on four critical sectors—water, power, transport, and communication—to achieve India’s vision of becoming self-reliant and the third-largest global economy. “These infrastructures are the foundation for economic growth. They attract capital investment, boost industry and trade, generate employment, and improve per capita income, ultimately reducing poverty. For India to emerge as a global leader, our states must become economically robust and capable,” Gadkari added.
The minister also advocated for the adoption of ethanol as an alternative fuel, highlighting its benefits for farmers. “Encourage the use of ethanol over petrol. Farmers in Rajasthan can produce ethanol from crops like maize, sorghum, millet, or even spoiled grains. Vehicles running on ethanol will enhance farmers’ prosperity and contribute to the local economy,” he said.

Businesses and individuals need continuity and stability rather than day-to-day changes.”
 
Malhotra highlighted the necessity of remaining agile in a rapidly changing world, given the complexities posed by geopolitical tensions, climate change, and economic uncertainties. “We cannot be stuck to continuity alone. While maintaining stability, we must remain alert and agile,” he said.
 
“We do maintain Continuity and stability. We cannot be stuck to it and we have to be alert and agile,” he added.
 
Reiterating the RBI’s commitment to financial inclusion, Malhotra noted the progress achieved so far but acknowledged the need for further collaboration with stakeholders. “There is still more to be done,” he said. 
 
“We will work with regulators, governments, and other stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of financial inclusion reach everyone.”
 
RBI Governor Malhotra pointed to India’s success with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and its growing global recognition. “How we can further use technology to reduce costs and make financial inclusion more accessible and pervasive and innovation will be a key (priority).”
 
“Innovation will be key, but we must be conscious of the risks it may entail,” he said. “We will put in place requisite safeguards and guardrails to ensure that innovation thrives without unintended consequences.”
 
Malhotra stressed the importance of consultation in policymaking, emphasizing that expertise is not confined to any single institution. “Consultation will remain a key pillar of our policymaking process,” he said, pledging to continue the RBI’s practice of engaging with stakeholders to uphold public trust and ensure decisions align with the public interest.
 
Succeeding Shaktikanta Das, who led the RBI since December 2018 and played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic, Malhotra brings a wealth of experience in economic and financial matters to his new role. As the head of the RBI, he is expected to focus on maintaining inflation targets, fostering economic growth, and ensuring the resilience of India’s financial sector amid global challenges.

Title: bauma CONEXPO INDIA 2024 kicks off with a grand opening
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:44:34 +0000
Content: India’s premier construction, mining, and infrastructure trade fair, bauma CONEXPO INDIA 2024, opened with grandeur at the India Expo Centre, Greater Noida. The event brought together top industry leaders, policymakers, and global delegates, setting a dynamic tone for India’s infrastructure growth story.
Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, inaugurated the event by lighting the ceremonial lamp and unveiling the exhibition catalogue. In his keynote address, Gadkari outlined his vision for India’s infrastructure development, emphasizing sustainable technologies and innovative practices.
Among the dignitaries present were Narender Kumar Kardam, Director of the Border Roads Organisation; Manoj Bapna, Joint DG Works of the Military Engineering Service; Dimitrov Krishnan, Chairman of bauma CONEXPO INDIA 2024 and Managing Director of Volvo CE India Pvt. Ltd.; Bhupinder Singh, CEO of Messe Muenchen India; K. Vishwanathan, All India President of the Builders Association of India; Vinayak Pai, President of the Construction Federation of India and MD & CEO of TATA Projects Ltd.; and Arvind Garg, Immediate Past Chairman of bauma CONEXPO INDIA and Senior Executive Vice President & Head of the Construction & Mining Machinery Business at Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
Nitin Gadkari, during his speech, underscored India’s position as the world’s third-largest construction equipment market, producing 1.35 lakh units annually. He said that this figure is projected to grow to 2.5 lakh units by 2030. With current exports valued at ₹6,700 crore and estimated investments of ₹32,000 crore, the industry’s future looks promising.
Gadkari urged industry leaders to prioritize investments in research and development (R&D) for advanced technologies and innovative designs. He also advocated for the adoption of alternative fuels like biodiesel, ethanol, LNG, hydrogen, and methanol to reduce carbon emissions and enhance sustainability.
He highlighted the growing global recognition of India’s high-quality, cost-effective machinery, with many international companies opting for equipment made in India, even in advanced markets like the US. He stressed the importance of exploring export opportunities through innovative and economical solutions.
“Our highway development projects are transforming India’s transportation network. Projects like the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway, Delhi-Dehradun Expressway, and Kashmir-Kanyakumari Highway—with multiple tunnels, expressways, and bypasses—are reducing travel time and enhancing logistics efficiency. By 2025, we aim to lower India’s logistics cost from 14-16% to 9%, making the country globally competitive,” he added.
The Minister called on industry players to invest heavily in R&D to ensure long-term success and global competitiveness. He outlined four guiding principles for businesses: proven technology, economic viability, availability of raw materials, and marketability of finished products.
“Once again, I congratulate everyone on this exceptional industry platform. I look forward to seeing this sector grow by 60% or more in the coming years. Let’s work together to build a stronger, cleaner, and globally competitive India,” he added.

Title: COP16 in Riyadh: turning the tide on Desertification
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:38:47 +0000
Content: As the 16th session of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (COP16) nears its conclusion in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the atmosphere is charged with urgency. Delegates are racing to finalize agreements that could redefine humanity’s approach to one of its most pressing environmental challenges: desertification and land degradation. With the conference wrapping up on December 13, the stakes have never been higher.
A sobering new report reveals that over 75% of the Earth’s land has become permanently drier in recent decades. Incredibly, drylands have expanded by 4.3 million square kilometers, nearly one-third larger than India. This data highlights a global transformation of fundamental ecological systems, with devastating long-term implications.
COP16, marking the 30th anniversary of the UNCCD, has seen several groundbreaking initiatives. The newly launched Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership has already secured $2.15 billion in commitments, signaling a pivotal shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, long-term resilience building. Key contributors include the Islamic Development Bank and the OPEC Fund for International Development, alongside a commitment of $150 million from Saudi Arabia.
India has emerged as a key player at COP16. Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav delivered a powerful address at the Ministerial Dialogue on Migration, linking land degradation to forced displacement. India’s “whole of ecosystem” strategy integrates traditional knowledge with cutting-edge technology, focusing on restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Notable programs include the Amrit Sarovars initiative for water body rejuvenation and the distribution of Soil Health Cards to farmers, all backed by AI, satellite technology, and GIS tools for soil and water management.
A key development at the conference was the release of the World Drought Atlas, created with the European Commission Joint Research Centre. This resource offers 21 case studies and practical solutions for managing droughts. Additionally, the prototype for the International Drought Resilience Observatory was introduced, which will launch in 2026. This AI-powered platform will provide real-time data to help countries prepare for drought conditions.
The financial costs of droughts are staggering. A report titled “Economics of Drought” revealed that droughts currently cost the global economy $307 billion annually, a figure that could rise significantly by 2050, when three-quarters of the world’s population will be affected. The good news, however, is that every dollar invested in nature-based solutions could generate up to $27 in benefits.
Experts at COP16 have also expressed concern over the state of Earth’s ecosystems. The publication Stepping Back from the Precipice notes that six out of nine critical ecological thresholds have been breached, emphasizing the urgency of action. To restore over one billion hectares of land, experts estimate that $2.6 trillion will be needed by 2030. Africa alone requires $191 billion annually to restore 600 million hectares.
A key focus of COP16 is the negotiation of a global drought resilience regime, a framework that could set binding commitments for international cooperation on drought resilience. This would mark a significant step in addressing future environmental challenges.
As COP16 wraps up, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed’s statement serves as a reminder of the stakes: “By 2050, three in four people will be affected by drought worldwide. But you are in Riyadh to turn the tide.” The outcome of this conference has the potential to shape global efforts to preserve land and secure a sustainable future.

Title: Bangladesh: Mitali Express returns to India after five months
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 13:37:54 +0000
Content: The Mitali Express, the inter-country train connecting Dhaka and New Jalpaiguri in India, has returned to India after being suspended for nearly five months.
The train rakes re-entered India through the Chilahati-Haldibari border in Cooch Behar District of West Bengal on Wednesday morning amid heightened security measures, according to Bangladesh Railway sources.
The Mitali Express, designated as train number 13132/31, originally left New Jalpaiguri for Dhaka on July 17 but had been unable to return due to the political unrest in Bangladesh. The disruption was caused by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement in Bangladesh.
According to the Dhaka Tribune newspaper, the train entered India’s Haldibari station from Chilahati in Nilphamari, Bangladesh, with assistance from a Bangladesh Railway engine. Once in Haldibari, the coaches were handed over to Indian authorities, and the engine returned to Chilahati.
The Mitali Express is a vital passenger link between the two nations, particularly it connects Dhaka with Northern West Bengal and Sikkim, launched on June 1, 2022.
Apart from the Mitali Express, there are two other passenger trains between India and Bangladesh: the Maitree Express, which connects Dhaka with Kolkata and the Bandhan Express connecting Khulna with Kolkata.
Given the deteriorating law and order situation in Bangladesh, the Indian Railway has suspended all three Inter-country passenger trains for an indefinite period. The rakes of the Maitree Express and Bandhan Express are in India.

Title: Bangladesh: No relief to Chinmoy Krishna Das, court rejects 3 petitions
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:44:55 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge’s Court has rejected three petitions filed by Supreme Court lawyer Advocate Rabindra Ghosh on behalf of Chinmoy Krishna Brahmachari.  The spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagaran Jote, Chinmoy Krishna Das, was arrested on sedition charges on November 25, from Dhaka Airport.
 
The petitions sought an expedited hearing date for Chinmoy’s bail plea, the submission of case documents, and other related reliefs. However, the court dismissed them, citing the absence of a power of attorney (vakalatnama) from any member of the Chattogram Bar Association, according to Assistant Public Prosecutor (PP) Advocate Md. Raihanul Wazed Chowdhury, according to the media reports.
 
However, advocate Rabindra Ghose said that there is an option of impunity for senior lawyers. “There is a High Court direction to allow senior lawyers to hear cases in absence of filing lawyers. The court could have accepted the petitions as I am a senior Supreme Court lawyer aging 75,” the Business Standard (TBS), a leading local newspaper quotes Advocate Ghose.
 
“The lawyer defending Chinmoy has been framed in a case. Another lawyer’s chamber has been vandalized. Out of fear they are not in a position to appear in the court”, Rabindar Ghose alleged.
 
He also alleged that a group of lawyers harassed him and assaulted outside the court. “I have been bullied and attacked by about 40 people wearing black coats. I doubt they are not lawyers, they are rather outsiders who harassed me for defending Chinmoy in the court”,  TBS quotes Advocate Ghose.
 
The hearing, which began at 11:00am, witnessed a tense moment when Rabindra Ghosh referred to a deceased Chattogram Bar lawyer as merely “deceased” instead of “martyr.” This triggered protests from other lawyers present in the courtroom, causing a brief commotion, reports TBS.
 
India has expressed hope that the trial will be ‘fair and transparent’ as the arrested Hindus have legal rights which should be respected. New Delhi has repeatedly appealed to officials of the interim government in Dhaka to ensure the safety of Hindus and all minorities.
 
External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last month, “The interim government must fulfill its responsibility to protect all minorities. We are concerned about the increasing incidents of extremist rhetoric, violence and incitement. These developments cannot be dismissed as mere media exaggeration. We once again call on Bangladesh to take all steps to protect minorities.”
 
During his visit to Dhaka on Monday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had conveyed to Dhaka the concerns related to the security and welfare of minorities during his meetings with Bangladesh’s interim government’s Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Advisor Touhid Hossain.

Title: National Maritime Heritage Complex a monumental tribute to India’s maritime history: Union Minister Sonowal
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:11:14 +0000
Content: The development of the National Maritime Heritage Complex at Gujarat’s Lothal is set to serve as a monumental tribute to India’s ancient maritime history, bringing to life the technological advancements, trade routes, and cultural exchanges that our ancestors pioneered, Union Minister for Ports and Shipping, Sarbananda Sonowal, said on Wednesday.

Speaking at the India Maritime Heritage Conclave held in the national capital, the Union Minister said the development of NMHC aligns perfectly with the Prime Minister’s vision of a new India, where the country is not only reclaiming its past but also preparing for a future where it can be a dominant force in the maritime sector.

“Lothal, one of the important Harappan cities, was a thriving maritime hub over 5,000 years ago. 
The National Maritime Heritage Complex will serve as a monumental tribute to India’s ancient maritime history, bringing to life the technological advancements, trade routes, and cultural exchanges that our ancestors pioneered,” he added.

The Union Cabinet in October approved the development of the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, Gujarat. 
The project will be completed in two phases. The Cabinet also accorded in-principle approval for Phase 1B and Phase 2, as per the master plan, by raising funds through voluntary resources/contributions and executing them after the funds are raised.
The construction of the Lighthouse Museum under Phase 1B will be funded by the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL).

As per the Prime Minister’s vision to showcase India’s 4,500-year-old maritime heritage, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways (MoPSW) is setting up a world-class National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal.

Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar was also present at the conclave today. Speaking on the occasion, he said the museum was India’s commitment to owning its sea legacy.
“Our maritime heritage is inextricably woven into the fabric of India’s ancient civilization. Southern dynasties like the Cholas revolutionized maritime commerce. The National Maritime Heritage Complex in Lothal exemplifies the very commitment to owning our sea legacy. It is gratifying to note that this is one of several initiatives taken by the government in the past decade in this direction. The maritime sector facilitates an extraordinary 95% of India’s trade volume. India is strategically developing its blue economy,” he said.
The objective of this conclave is to delve into India’s past maritime heritage through insightful sessions, discussions, and compelling narratives that highlight the lives of coastal communities, trade routes, and pivotal maritime events that have played a vital role in shaping its cultural and economic trajectory.

Spread across two days at Yashobhoomi, New Delhi, the conclave features a series of sessions exploring diverse themes, from ancient trade networks to contemporary maritime advancements.

Title: Blinken to testify in Congress on Afghanistan weeks before his term ends
Publication Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2024 11:49:40 +0000
Content: Secretary of State Antony Blinken will testify to a Republican-led House of Representatives committee on Wednesday on the August 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, ending a long dispute with the panel weeks before the end of his term.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee and the State Department have have been wrangling over Blinken’s appearance for months. Panel Republicans voted in September – weeks before the presidential election – to recommend the top U.S. diplomat be held in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena.
The U.S.’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war became intensely politicized during the 2024 president campaign pitting President-elect Donald Trump against Vice President Kamala Harris.
Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, has decried the withdrawal from Afghanistan and vowed to go after those responsible for it. During his campaign, he said he would ask for the resignation of every senior official “who touched the Afghanistan calamity.”
Democrats have insisted some blame for the messy end of the war – less than seven months into Joe Biden’s presidency – should be laid at the feet of Trump, who began the withdrawal process by signing a deal with Afghanistan’s militant Islamist Taliban in 2020.
The State Department had contended the Foreign Affairs panel was provided with large amounts of information, with Blinken testifying before Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times and the department providing nearly 20,000 pages of records, multiple high-level briefings and transcribed interviews.
The committee’s chairman, Representative Michael McCaul, released a report on Sept. 8 on a Republican investigation of the Afghanistan withdrawal, blasting Biden’s administration for failures surrounding the evacuation.
“While I wish he had not delayed this crucial appearance until the end of his tenure as head of the State Department, I look forward to hearing his testimony and asking poignant questions to help House Republicans and the next administration ensure nothing like this ever happens again,” McCaul said in a statement.

Title: Mark Mobius Praises India’s 6-7% Growth, Cites Strong Infrastructure as Key Driver
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 07:28:37 +0000
Content: India’s ability to manage inflation without compromising growth will be pivotal in attracting sustained foreign investments, renowned investor Mark Mobius said on Thursday. He added that from a macroeconomic perspective, a 6-7 percent growth rate in India is a good rate given the global average.
Addressing an investor webinar organized by PL Capital-Prabhudas Lilladher, the veteran investor said the Indian economy grew a strong 5.4 percent in Q2 FY25, despite having a size of $4 trillion.
“From a macroeconomic perspective, a 6-7 percent growth rate in India is a good rate given the global average. ‘Make in India’ and the impetus the government provides to manufacture locally is a big positive and the biggest advantage of local manufacturing in India is that they have a big market for local/self-consumption,” said Mobius, Chairman of Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund.
He further stated that the Indian government has done phenomenal work by creating solid infrastructure to support growth.
“Despite political challenges, PM Modi’s administration remains focused on reducing inefficiencies, modernizing infrastructure, and enhancing governance. The central challenge lies in balancing populist measures with long-term structural reforms,” Mobius stated.
He highlighted key areas where India stands to gain both domestically and globally, identifying sectoral shifts and emerging opportunities, like defence manufacturing, semiconductors, infrastructure and urbanization, tourism and travel growth, energy and commodities and digital public infrastructure.
On US president-elect Donald Trump’s statements on trade tariffs, Mobius said that the former president could use tariffs as a bargaining chip to negotiate open trade deals.
“Emerging Markets like India stand to benefit as there is a limit to which investors would want to put their money in the US market. Plus, the opportunities in emerging markets are also thriving,” he added.
Mobius articulated a cautiously optimistic outlook for global and Indian economic trends, driven by both cyclical and structural factors. The tapering off of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reduced Middle East turmoil are expected to bolster global growth, he noted.

Title: Saudi Arabia’s world cup win sparks criticism over human rights record, FIFA faces backlash
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 07:25:31 +0000
Content: Rights organisations strongly criticised FIFA on Wednesday after world soccer’s ruling body officially awarded the 2034 men’s World Cup to Saudi Arabia.
Hosting the global showpiece tournament is the pinnacle of Saudi Arabia’s massive push into sports and entertainment over recent years as it seeks to improve its international image.
“FIFA’s reckless decision… will put many lives at risk,” Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Labour Rights and Sport, said in a statement issued by 21 bodies.
They included Saudi diaspora human rights organisations, migrant workers’ groups from Nepal and Kenya, international trade unions, fans’ representatives and global human rights organisations.
“FIFA knows workers will be exploited and even die without fundamental reforms in Saudi Arabia, and yet has chosen to press ahead regardless,” the statement added.
Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in sport, revamping its domestic soccer league by signing global superstars such as Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Brazil’s Neymar.
The kingdom’s Public Investment fund (PIF) acquired English Premier League club Newcastle United and founded the LIV Golf tour, challenging the US-based PGA Tour’s dominance.
Saudi Arabia this year hosted the season-ending tennis WTA Finals for the first time.
It has also invested in sports such as boxing as it continues its metamorphosis into a tourism hub as part of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s vision 2030 economic transformation program.
FIFA gave the bid a high technical score, a move Amnesty called an “astonishing whitewash” of the country’s human rights record.
Saudi Arabia has banned labour unions, does not have a minimum wage for migrant workers, and enforces the “kafala” system of foreign labourer sponsorship.
Kafala binds migrant workers to one employer and prevents them from leaving the kingdom without the employer’s approval. Rights groups say it leaves workers vulnerable to exploitation.
Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
The Saudi government communications office, the country’s football association and FIFA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The head of the Saudi World Cup bid unit told Reuters last week that the kingdom had launched several initiatives to safeguard workers’ rights as part of vision 2030.
“Now employees have the freedom of choice to move from one employer to the other,” Hammad Albalawi said.
“A month and a half ago, the government announced a new insurance policy, meaning that if any company goes into bankruptcy, the government can step in and ensure workers are paid their dues.”
There were 13.4 million expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia in 2022, the last time a census was conducted, accounting for 42% of the population.
Extreme heat
The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said one stadium under construction for the tournament had been linked to alleged exploitative labour of 10-hour shifts in extreme heat.
“FIFA, its sponsors, and multinational companies… have a legal and ethical responsibility to respect human rights,” said Phil Bloomer, BHRRC Executive Director.
FIFA came under similar criticism from rights groups for awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
An Amnesty report in 2021 said practices such as withholding salaries and charging workers to change jobs were rife in the 2022 World Cup host nation.
Qatari authorities said the criticism was unfair and misinformed, pointing to labour law reforms enacted since 2018 and accusing critics of racism and double standards.
Asked on Wednesday what lessons the Saudi bid team had learned from Qatar, the kingdom’s sports minister Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal told Reuters that tournament had given them “a good insight on what needs to be done properly”.
“I think controversy will happen in anything you do and we’ve learned a lot from their experience,” he said.
FIFA also confirmed on Wednesday that the 2030 World Cup would be held in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

Title: Jal Jeevan Mission empowering women in rural areas: PM Modi
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 07:03:08 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday highlighted the Jal Jeevan Mission’s role in empowering women, particularly in rural areas.
Launched in August 2019, the mission aims to provide functional tap water connections to every rural household in India.
PM Modi pointed out that women, who previously had to travel long distances to fetch clean water, can now access it right at their doorstep. This shift, he said, allows women to focus more on skill development and self-reliance.
In a post on X, PM Modi said: “A good perspective on how Jal Jeevan Mission is furthering women empowerment, especially in our rural areas. With clean water at their doorstep, women can now focus on skill development and self-reliance.”
Since its inception, the mission has made significant strides. From just 3.23 crore (17 percent) rural households with tap water connections in 2019, an additional 11.96 crore new connections have been provided by October 2024.
Currently, more than 15.35 crore, or 79.31 percent, households have access to tap water, according to government data.
The mission has achieved 100 percent tap water coverage in 11 states and union territories: Goa, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu & Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Haryana, Puducherry, Telangana, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram.
A recent report by the State Bank of India highlighted the broader impact of the initiative.
Rural households across India have seen an 8.3 percentage point reduction in the need to fetch water from outside their premises. This has led to a 7.4 percentage point rise in women’s participation in agriculture and other productive activities.
The report also noted significant progress in states like Bihar and Assam, where female workforce participation has surged by over 28 percentage points.

The minister reiterated India’s commitment to sustainable development but stressed the importance of acknowledging Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) principles. He noted that India’s rapid economic growth, projected at 7-8% annually, positions the country to become the world’s third-largest economy in the coming years, with GDP expected to reach $35 trillion by 2047.
The European side acknowledged the untapped economic potential between the two regions, highlighting the mutual benefits of integrating their economies and enhancing supply chain resilience. Discussions also included updates on the India-EU Trade and Technology Council, a unique mechanism that India shares only with the United States.
The EU remains India’s largest trading partner for goods, with bilateral trade in goods reaching $137.41 billion in 2023-24. Additionally, services trade between India and the EU was estimated at $51.45 billion in 2023.

Title: India’s $2.2 trillion infrastructure drive to fuel $7 trillion economy by 2030, boosting private investment
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 06:53:50 +0000
Content: An estimated $2.2 trillion investment in infrastructure development is crucial for India to expand its GDP to $7 trillion by 2030, according to a report released on Thursday.
To achieve this ambitious economic size, India’s economy must grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% between 2024 and 2030, as highlighted in the report by Knight Frank India.
The report estimates that the investment opportunity for private sector participation in India’s infrastructure development ranges from $103.2 billion to $324 billion.
“India stands at the cusp of a transformative era in infrastructure development. By harnessing the power of private investment, we can accelerate our journey towards achieving ambitious economic growth targets,” said Rajeev Vijay, Executive Director-Government and Infrastructure Advisory, Knight Frank India.
The central government aims to reduce its gross fiscal deficit to below 4.5% by 2025. Increasing private sector involvement in infrastructure development is expected to play a pivotal role in meeting these fiscal deficit targets.
Currently, infrastructure investment is distributed among the central government (51.2%), state governments (44.1%), and private sector (4.7%). If this composition persists, the gross fiscal deficit in 2030 is projected to be 4.7%, exceeding the government’s fiscal deficit threshold.
In this scenario, private sector participation in infrastructure development is valued at $103.2 billion until 2030. However, the private sector’s current contribution remains minimal and must grow to bridge this gap.
An increase in private investment share to 14.7% could unlock a potential $324 billion investment opportunity, averaging $54 billion annually until 2030. This increased participation would enable the government to maintain healthier fiscal balances.
Enhanced private sector involvement in infrastructure development would also allow the government to redirect resources toward critical areas such as public healthcare, human capital development, and debt management, thereby fostering sustainable long-term growth.
On a sectoral basis, renewable energy, data centers, roads and highways, warehousing, and logistics present significant potential to attract private investments. Additionally, with rapid urbanization and evolving demographics, sectors like urban mass transit, airports, and power distribution offer substantial investment opportunities.
“For India to achieve its ambitious economic growth targets, massive infrastructure investments are necessary,” the report concluded.

Title: Soccer – Juventus stun Manchester city with 2-0 win, deal blow to Champions League hopes
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 06:08:36 +0000
Content: Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie scored to lead Juventus to a 2-0 Champions League win over Manchester City on Wednesday, a major blow to the English champions’ hopes of clinching a top-eight spot in the group stage of Europe’s elite competition.
City, who lifted the 2023 Champions League trophy, continued a poor run of form which has brought only one victory in their last 10 games across all competitions.
“(Confidence) is a big part of it, obviously it’s a mental issue as well. You can see that. You can see that sometimes one action we miss the ball or lose a duel and you can see that we drop immediately,” City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan told Amazon Prime.
“It has such a big effect on us right now. At the crucial moment right now we are doing the wrong things.”
Vlahovic scored by the narrowest of margins in the 53rd minute when Kenan Yildiz swung the ball in and City keeper Ederson fumbled the Serb’s header from close range and the ball sneaked just across the line, according to the goalline technology.
“The whole team played an excellent match, we prepared well and did everything what we had to do,” Vlahovic told Amazon.
“The result is amazing and can give us a great boost for the rest of the season.”
City picked up the tempo in a desperate attempt to equalise and sent numbers forward, but Juve capitalised to double their lead against the run of play when McKennie hooked Timothy Weah’s cross in with a sumptuous volley in the 75th minute.
Pep Guardiola’s team squandered several chances, one of the best falling to Erling Haaland late in first half.
Kevin De Bruyne sent a beautiful through ball to the Norwegian who got in behind the defence before trying to chip goalkeeper Michele di Gregorio who threw up his arm to block the shot.
Gundogan unleashed a blistering strike from long range that Di Gregorio stretched to just push wide.
“We have done it really, really well, we didn’t lose many balls that happened in the past, and we arrived in the positions,” Guardiola said.
“But the Italian teams that defend so deep and so compact it is not easy, they are masters of these kinds of situations.”
With two games remaining in the group phase, Juventus are 14th in the table while City plummeted to 22nd, three places out of automatic elimination from the competition.
Since the start of November, City have conceded more goals (21) across all competitions than any other team in Europe’s big five leagues, the worst spell in Guardiola’s otherwise sparkling managerial career.
City, who host Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, continue their Champions League campaign at Paris St Germain on 22nd Jan.
Juventus travel to Brugge on 21st Jan.

Title: PM Modi wishes Sharad Pawar a healthy and prosperous 84th birthday
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 05:37:03 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday extended birthday wishes to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on his 84th birthday, praying for his long and healthy life.
“Birthday wishes to Rajya Sabha MP and senior leader Sharad Pawar Ji. I pray for his long and healthy life,” PM Modi posted on X.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, also wished Sharad Pawar on his birthday.
“Happy Birthday to NCP President and Former Union Minister Sharad Pawar. Wish you good health and long life,” Kharge wrote on X.
Meanwhile, posters extending birthday greetings to NCP chief Sharad Pawar were put up outside his residence in Delhi.
Sharad Pawar, affectionately known as “Saheb,” was born on December 12, 1940, in Baramati, Pune. Coming from a family rooted in the region, Pawar began his political journey at a young age. At just 24, he was elected as the president of the State Youth Congress, and five years later, he joined the State Cabinet.
Over his illustrious career, Pawar served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra for a total of seven years during his 32 years in active politics. An advocate of economic liberalism, Pawar believes that large-scale investments leading to rapid economic development and employment generation are the key drivers of a nation’s global power and influence.
In recent years, however, the NCP has witnessed internal rifts. In July of last year, NCP leader Ajit Pawar led a split within the party, aligning with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and taking the oath as Maharashtra’s Deputy Chief Minister.
The Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024 saw a decisive victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide win with 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats, while the Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led faction of the NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
In February, the Election Commission of India (ECI) recognised the Ajit Pawar faction as the official NCP and allotted it the party’s ‘clock’ symbol. The Supreme Court later allowed the faction to use the symbol for the Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections, subject to the outcome of a legal challenge by Sharad Pawar’s faction. The court also directed the Ajit Pawar group not to use Sharad Pawar’s name or image in campaign materials.
The Sharad Pawar faction was instructed to contest elections under the name “Nationalist Congress Party-Sharad Chandra Pawar” and use the “man-blowing turha” symbol. The apex court’s order remains in effect until further notice.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open flat as markets await CPI data
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 05:06:20 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened flat on Thursday, ahead of the release of crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data. The Nifty 50 slipped by 37.35 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,604.45, while the Sensex dipped 49 points, or 0.06 percent, to 81,476.76.
Market experts predict volatility due to the expiry of futures and options (F&O) contracts later today.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said: “The markets are consolidating within a tight range. Expect some volatility due to the F&O expiry. With the Fed rate cut almost certain, the next major catalyst for Indian markets will be today’s inflation data, which is expected to show a month-on-month decline in the CPI. Our outlook remains one of consolidation, followed by a year-end rise.”
Bagga noted that U.S. consumer prices, released on Tuesday, came in line with estimates, increasing the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week to over 98 percent.
In the Nifty 50, 23 stocks advanced while 27 declined. Top gainers included Tech Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, TCS, and Wipro, while Apollo Hospital, SBI Life, BPCL, Trent, and Titan were among the biggest losers.
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank, Nifty IT, Nifty Metal, Nifty Pharma, and Nifty Healthcare recorded gains, while others retreated.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said: “Indecision on the Nifty continues to prevail as resistance at 24700 has held strong. The market has formed a short-term “pennant” with the highs falling and the lows rising, which means the potential for an upside breakout that targets the 24800 – 25000 hurdle zone remains high. Support at 24500 should hold for this view to pan out.”
On Wednesday, foreign investors sold equities worth Rs 1,012 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 2,000 crore.
In broader Asian markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.28 percent, Taiwan’s Weighted Index rose 0.93 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.68 percent, and South Korea’s market advanced 0.35 percent.
Brent crude was trading at USD 73.66 at time of filing this report, with a slight uptick.

Title: FBI Director Chris Wray to step down as Donald Trump plans to install Kash Patel
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:57:51 +0000
Content: FBI Director Chris Wray to step down as Donald Trump plans to install Kash Patel
FBI Director Chris Wray will step down from his post early next year, he said on Wednesday, after Republican President-elect Donald Trump signalled his intent to fire the veteran official and replace him with firebrand Kash Patel.
His resignation makes him the second straight FBI director driven out by Trump, who during his first term in office fired Wray’s predecessor James Comey, after souring on him over the FBI’s investigations into alleged contacts between Trump‘s 2016 campaign and Russia.
Wray will leave before the end of the 10-year term that Trump himself appointed him to in 2017.
“In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,” Wray told FBI employees in a town hall meeting.
Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Trump‘s Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents he had retained after leaving office.
That sparked one of two federal prosecutions Trump faced while out of power, neither of which went to trial. Trump denied wrongdoing and described all the cases against him as politically motivated.
Federal prosecutors ended their efforts after his election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.
Trump‘s Republican allies joined him in alleging that the FBI had become politicized, though there is no evidence that Democratic President Joe Biden interfered with its investigative processes.
On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump called Wray’s resignation “a great day for America.”
“It will end the weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don’t know what happened to him,” Trump wrote.
As he has built out his roster of Cabinet officials over the past few weeks, Trump has assembled a team ready to carry out two of his biggest priorities: retribution against his political adversaries and a wholesale reshaping of the U.S. government.
Patel, who would need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, has never worked at the FBI and only spent three years at the Justice Department earlier in his career in the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.
If confirmed, he has pledged to shut down the FBI’s headquarters building in Washington and drastically redefine the bureau’s role with intelligence-gathering.
In a statement to Reuters, Patel said, “I will be ready to serve the American people on day one.”
Trump allies welcomed the news
“Reform is badly needed at FBI,” Republican Senator Charles Grassley wrote on X, adding the American people deserve transparency and accountability.
Wray denied bias
Throughout his term, Wray said that he strove to impartially carry out the FBI’s duties. During a 2023 hearing before a house of representative’s panel he rebuffed the idea that he was pursuing a Democratic partisan agenda, noting that he had been a lifelong Republican.
“The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me, given my own personal background,” Wray said.
FBI directors are appointed for 10-year terms, a measure meant to avoid the appearance of partisanship after political turnover in the White House every four years.
Wray’s term was not due to expire until 2027
Senate Democrats on Wednesday thanked Wray for his service, with some raising concern for the bureau’s future without him.
“The FBI is critical to our nation’s security and our families’ safety,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said. “It will soon embark on a perilous new era with serious questions about its future.”
The FBI Agents Association in a statement said the bureau’s mission “does not waver when there are changes in a presidential administration.”
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland also praised Wray, noting in a statement that the FBI director is charged with protecting the bureau’s independence from “inappropriate influence” in its criminal investigations.
“That independence is central to preserving the rule of law,” said Garland.
Fisa warrants, Jan. 6 probes
The FBI has faced increasing criticism by Trump‘s supporters for its various roles in investigating Trump over the years.
Some of the concerns pre-dated Wray’s tenure, including several damning reports by the Justice Department’s inspector general which faulted the bureau for making errors in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during its early investigation into Trump‘s 2016 campaign known as “Crossfire Hurricane.”
During his tenure, Wray has overseen reforms of the FBI’s processes for securing FISA warrants.
The FBI during Wray’s time has also played a major role in helping to investigate and arrest many Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.
More than 1,500 people were criminally charged in the attack.
Trump has pledged to grant clemency to some of the Jan. 6 defendants, though he has not provided details.
Throughout his time as FBI director, Wray has been known for his hawkish views on China, and has frequently warned that China represents the biggest national and economic security threat facing the United States.
Wray started his career at the Justice Department in 1997 as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta.
He was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003 to lead the department’s criminal division, where he oversaw a variety of investigations including post-9/11 efforts to combat terrorism and the Enron Task Force.
Wray also practiced law for about 17 years with the law firm King & Spalding, and he clerked for former Judge J. Michael Luttig in the U.S. court of appeals for the fourth circuit after earning his law degree from Yale Law School.

Title: Bangladesh:Chittagong Court accepted petition to expedite Chinmoy Das’s bail hearing
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 13:08:29 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Court has accepted the petition filed by a senior Lawyer Rabindra Ghosh to expedite Chinmoy Krishna Das’s bail application. The court has accepted the petition on a condition to have a lawyer from Chattogram to stand with Ghosh during the hearing. Rabindra Ghosh subsequently recruited local lawyer Sumit Acharya to stand with him, reports The Daily Star newspaper.
Yesterday, the court dismissed an anticipatory bail petition for Chinmoy Krishna Das after Rabindra Ghosh placed the application, citing the absence of a power of attorney (vakalatnama) from any member of the Chattogram Bar Association.
According to the Daily Star, Rabindra Ghosh today told reporters, “The court today has accepted that it will hear my case. I have come here to assist Chinmoy’s lawyers. They are scared to come due to security reasons. We are hopeful that something good will happen. The environment at the court today is much better than yesterday.”
“Yesterday, the court did not hear me because I did not have the Vakalatnama and because of other lawyers. I have brought the Vakalatnama from Chinmoy from the prison and submitted it. The court has accepted the matter of advancing the date of the bail hearing, he will hear me, and has told me to take a local lawyer with me”, the Daily Star quotes Rabindra Ghosh.
“I have local lawyer Sumit Acharya with me,” he said accompanied by multiple police teams providing security to him.

Title: PSB reforms: financial inclusion, credit growth and employee welfare
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 13:07:26 +0000
Content: The central government has implemented a series of reforms over the past decade aimed at improving the performance of Public Sector Banks (PSBs). These measures have addressed challenges such as non-performing assets (NPAs), financial inclusion, and credit growth.  
In 2015, the Reserve Bank of India introduced the Asset Quality Review (AQR) to identify and address stressed accounts. This led to the transparent recognition of NPAs, with the gross NPA ratio peaking at 14.58% in March 2018 before declining to 3.12% in September 2024. The government adopted a strategy focused on recognition, resolution, recapitalization, and reform to manage these challenges effectively.  
The financial performance of PSBs has shown improvement. The banks reported a combined net profit of ₹1.41 lakh crore in FY 2023-24, an increase from ₹1.05 lakh crore in the previous fiscal year. In the first half of FY 2024-25, the net profit stood at ₹0.86 lakh crore. Over the last three years, these banks have distributed ₹61,964 crore in dividends. The capital adequacy ratio rose to 15.43% in September 2024 from 11.45% in March 2015, allowing banks to access market capital without government assistance.
The number of bank branches increased from 1,17,990 in March 2014 to 1,60,501 in September 2024, with a focus on rural and semi-urban areas. Financial inclusion efforts resulted in the opening of 54 crore Jan Dhan accounts and the disbursement of more than 52 crore collateral-free loans under government schemes. Advances to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) grew at a compound annual rate of 15% over the past three years, reaching ₹28.04 lakh crore in March 2024.  
In agriculture and small business sectors, the Kisan Credit Card scheme provided short-term crop loans, with 7.71 crore active accounts and an outstanding amount of ₹9.88 lakh crore as of September 2024. Credit to MSMEs continued to expand under government initiatives, showing an annual growth of 17.2% in FY 2023-24.
The government also implemented policies to support bank employees. Automation of transfer processes and provisions for women employees were introduced, along with welfare measures that increased salaries and allowances under the 12th Bipartite Settlement. Pension benefits were revised, and the Staff Welfare Fund ceiling was raised from ₹540 crore to ₹845 crore annually.

Title: SC restrains courts from passing orders in religious structures suits amid challenge to Places of Worship Act
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:23:20 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a directive preventing all courts across India from passing interim or final orders, including survey orders, in pending cases concerning existing religious structures.
The decision comes as the apex court hears pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.  
A bench comprising Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justices PV Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan also barred the registration of new suits on related claims during the pendency of the case. “While suits may be filed, no suits would be registered, and proceedings undertaken till further orders of this court. In the pending suits, courts would not pass any effective interim or final orders, including orders of survey,” the bench stated.  
Currently, 18 cases involving 10 mosques or shrines are under litigation across the country.  
The Places of Worship Act prohibits altering the religious character of places of worship as they stood on August 15, 1947, and bars legal claims to reclaim such sites.
However, several petitioners, including members of the Kashi Royal Family, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, and religious leaders, have argued that the Act violates the rights of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs.  
The petitioners contend that the Act infringes upon constitutional rights under Articles 25, 26, and 29, which guarantee religious freedom, management of religious institutions, and protection of cultural heritage.
The pleas assert that the Act unjustly excludes Lord Krishna’s birthplace while preserving the exemption for Lord Rama’s birthplace, creating discriminatory provisions.  
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act are under scrutiny for allegedly breaching the principles of secularism and the rule of law enshrined in the Constitution.
Section 3 bars conversion of religious sites, while Section 4 prohibits legal proceedings to alter the religious character of such sites.  
The petitioners also claim that the Act deprives religious communities of their right to reclaim properties misappropriated during historical invasions and unfairly limits legal recourse.  
In response, organizations such as Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, and mosque management committees have filed applications supporting the Act. They argue that overturning the law would lead to a flood of litigation targeting mosques nationwide, disrupting communal harmony.  
The court granted the Central Government four weeks to file an affidavit in response to the petitions. Critics of the Act claim the retrospective cutoff date of August 15, 1947, is arbitrary and irrational, effectively abating proceedings regarding encroachments by historical invaders.

Title: Russia supports Orban’s POW swap proposal but Ukraine refused, Kremlin says
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:06:16 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had fully supported a prisoner of war exchange between Moscow and Kyiv proposed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, but that Ukraine appeared to have turned down the idea.
Orban made the proposals during a call with Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
“Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, during yesterday’s telephone conversation with President Putin, made a proposal on the eve of Christmas to carry out a major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, as well as to announce a Christmas ceasefire,” Peskov said.
The same day, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) sent a proposal on the prisoner exchange to the Hungarian embassy, Peskov said. Judging by Ukraine’s public reaction, Peskov said that Kyiv had “rejected all of Orban’s proposals”.
“We assume that consultations on the establishment of peace will continue. The Russian side fully supports Orban’s efforts aimed at finding a peaceful settlement and resolving humanitarian issues related to the prisoner exchange.
“Russia has never refused peace talks and has repeatedly stated its readiness to resume them on the basis of the Istanbul Agreements of 2022,” Peskov said.
Orban’s chief of staff had previously said that Orban had proposed the Christmas ceasefire and the prisoner of war swap to Putin in a phone call on Wednesday,
“One (the ceasefire proposal) was regarded as worthy of consideration … in the other issue, in the POW swap, (Putin) was supportive,” Gergely Gulyas said.
He said Hungary wanted a ceasefire to last forever, “but now this was about the Christmas days”.

Title: India votes in favour of UNGA resolution for ‘immediate, unconditional, permanent’ Gaza ceasefire
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:00:41 +0000
Content: India has joined 157 other nations in supporting a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution demanding an “immediate, unconditional, and permanent” ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza Strip.
The UNGA overwhelmingly approved two resolutions on Wednesday, one calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the other backing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which Israel has sought to ban.
The first resolution, demanding an immediate ceasefire, was passed with 158 votes in favour, nine, including the United States, Israel, Argentina, Czechia, Hungary, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, and Tonga, against, and 13 abstentions.
The second resolution, supporting the mandate of UNRWA, received 159 votes in favour, nine against, and 11 abstentions.
The resolutions follow two days of debate at the 193-member General Assembly, where speeches overwhelmingly highlighted the need to end the 14-month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas. Delegates also called for unhindered humanitarian access in Gaza to address the growing crisis.
Although General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, they carry significant weight as a reflection of global opinion. This vote came after the United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on November 20 that had also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
The US veto stemmed from the absence of a clause linking the ceasefire to the release of hostages taken during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which triggered the conflict.
The second resolution expressed support for UNRWA, established in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees. It criticised a new Israeli law, adopted on October 28, banning the agency’s activities in Palestinian territories — a measure set to take effect in 90 days.
Israel has accused some UNRWA employees of having ties to Hamas militants, citing over 100 individuals allegedly involved in the October 7 attack, which left approximately 1,200 people dead and saw around 250 others abducted as hostages.
India has consistently condemned the October 7 attacks, calling them acts of terror, and has emphasised the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
At the same time, India has repeatedly stressed the need for a ceasefire, continued humanitarian aid, adherence to international humanitarian law, and a commitment to restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy.
New Delhi has also voiced concerns about the escalating violence in West Asia, repeatedly urging all parties to exercise restraint and pursue peaceful resolution through dialogue.

Title: IIP growth rises to 3.5 per cent in October from 3.1 pc in September
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 11:53:02 +0000
Content: India’s industrial production grew by 3.5% in October 2024, slightly up from 3.1% in September, according to the Quick Estimates released by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation on Thursday. The data reflect a gradual recovery in the industrial sector, driven largely by the manufacturing industry.
Sectoral analysis showed mixed results, with mining growing by 0.9%, manufacturing by 4.1%, and electricity production by 2.0% in October. The manufacturing sector showed resilience, with 18 of 23 industry groups at the 2-digit NIC level recording positive growth compared to the same period last year. The overall Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for October 2024 stood at 149.9, up from 144.9 in October 2023.
Key manufacturing sub-sectors played a crucial role in the recovery.

Title: IEA expects comfortably supplied oil market in 2025 despite demand hike
Publication Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2024 11:49:21 +0000
Content: The world oil market will be comfortably supplied in 2025, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday, even after producer group OPEC+ extended oil supply cuts and a slightly higher than expected demand forecast.
The outlook from the IEA, which advises industrialised countries, points to continued headwinds for OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia. OPEC+ is seeking to begin reviving output in 2025 after years of cuts.
Oil demand growth has been weaker than expected this year in large part because of China. After driving rises in oil consumption for years, economic challenges and a shift towards electric vehicles are tempering oil growth prospects in the world’s second-largest consumer.
Still, the IEA increased its 2025 global oil demand growth forecast to 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) from 990,000 bpd last month, “largely in Asian countries due to the impact of China’s recent stimulus measures,” it said in its monthly oil market report.
China is seeking to boost the economy and will adopt an “appropriately loose” monetary policy next year, the first easing of its stance in some 14 years, the Politburo was quoted as saying on Monday.
At the same time, the IEA expects non-OPEC+ nations to boost supply by about 1.5 million bpd next year, driven by the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina – more than the rate of demand growth.
“The relatively subdued pace of global oil demand growth is set to continue in 2025, accelerating only modestly,” the IEA said, saying also that the market was “looking comfortably supplied.
Oil prices pared an earlier gain after the report was released, with Brent crude trading below $73 a barrel.
2025 SURPLUS
To support the market, OPEC+ last week pushed back the start of oil output rises by three months until April and extended the full unwinding of cuts by a year until the end of 2026 due to weak demand and booming production outside the group.
The IEA said, even excluding the return to higher output quotas, its current outlook points to a 950,000 bpd supply overhang next year – almost 1% of world supply. This would rise to 1.4 million bpd if OPEC goes ahead with its plan to start unwinding cuts from the end of next March, it said.
Next year’s surplus, as forecast by the IEA, could make it harder for OPEC+ to bring back production. The hike was earlier due to start in October 2024, but OPEC+ has delayed it amid falling prices.
Forecasts on the strength of demand growth in 2024 vary, partly due to differences over demand from China and the pace of the world’s switch to cleaner fuels.
The IEA’s view is at the lower end of industry estimates and in the report, it trimmed its forecast of 2024 world demand growth to 840,000 bpd, down 80,000 bpd from last month.
OPEC, which is at the top end, on Wednesday cut its demand growth forecasts for this year and next, but still expects more rapid growth than the IEA of 1.61 million bpd and 1.45 million bpd respectively.

“The Financial Intelligence Unit-India’s strong vigil on financial transactions with respect to money laundering, terrorism, and proliferation financing has ensured the detection of undisclosed income worth nearly Rs. 11,000 crore,” the ministry posted on the X social media platform.
The FIU-IND is the central, national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions to enforcement agencies and foreign FIUs.
The agency is also responsible for coordinating and strengthening the efforts of national and international intelligence, investigation, and enforcement agencies in pursuing global efforts against money laundering and financing of terrorism.
FIU-IND is an independent body reporting directly to the Economic Intelligence Council (EIC) headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Last month, the FIUs of India and Qatar held a two-day meeting to strengthen the relations between the two organisations and their commitment to assist each other in fighting the menace of money laundering and financing of terrorism.
Both sides also discussed various areas such as the IT systems used by the respective jurisdiction, the public-private partnership initiative of FIU-IND (FPAC), the private-private partnership for the Alliance of Reporting Entities in India for AML/CFT (ARIFAC), strategic analysis, and various tools used by the two FIUs, as well as FIU-IND’s experience in the area of virtual digital asset service providers.
