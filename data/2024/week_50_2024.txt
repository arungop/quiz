Title: Rain likely in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR; cold wave to follow from Dec 9: IMD
Publication Date: Sun, 08 Dec 2024 12:40:41 +0000
Content: A western disturbance over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas is expected to bring light to isolated rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR over the next two days, starting Sunday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).  
 
In its latest forecast on Sunday, the IMD also predicted a cold wave across most of Northern India beginning December 9.  
 
Speaking to ANI about the weather conditions in North India and Delhi-NCR, IMD scientist Naresh Kumar stated that temperatures in Delhi-NCR will drop after December 9.  
“A western disturbance persists over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas. Light to moderate rain is expected in the Himalayas today and tomorrow. Light rain is also expected in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi,” Kumar said.  
 
“Temperatures may rise slightly in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR on December 8 and 9. However, after December 9, temperatures will decrease, and cold wave conditions may develop. The cold wave will initially affect Rajasthan, followed by Punjab and Haryana,” he added.  
 
According to an IMD release, cold wave conditions are anticipated in West Rajasthan from December 9 to December 14, while Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, and West Uttar Pradesh are likely to experience cold wave conditions starting December 11. The IMD defines cold wave conditions as a significant drop in temperature compared to the normal climatological values for a given location.  
 
Meanwhile, Delhi residents sought refuge in night shelters set up by the Delhi government amid the inclement weather on Saturday night. Shelters have been established at various locations in the national capital, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin Flyover.  
 
Delhi’s air quality also worsened, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) falling to the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday. The AQI was recorded at 302 at 4 pm.  
 
Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court permitted the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to relax GRAP Stage IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR, downgrading them to GRAP Stage II due to improved air quality. However, GRAP Stages II and I will continue to remain in effect across the region.

Title: RBI hikes interest rates on NRI foreign currency deposits
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:22:03 +0000
Content: The RBI on Friday increased the interest rate ceilings on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank deposits or FCNR (B) deposits which will enable NRIs to earn more on their savings.
The move is aimed at attracting more foreign capital at a time when the Indian rupee has come under pressure as foreign investors have been pulling money out of the Indian stock markets resulting in hot money outflows.
FCNR(B) deposits are accounts where Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can hold their earnings in foreign currencies like USD or GBP, protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations.
“In order to attract more capital inflows, RBI has decided to increase the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) deposits. Accordingly, with effect from today (December 6, 2024), banks are permitted to raise fresh FCNR(B) deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity at rates not exceeding ARR plus 400 bps and deposits with maturity between 3 to 5 years at rates not exceeding ARR plus 500 bps. This relaxation will be available till March 31, 2025,” an RBI statement said.
Until now, interest rates on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank (FCNR(B)) deposits were subject to ceilings of Overnight Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) for the respective currency/swap, plus 250 basis points for deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity and overnight ARR plus 350 basis points for deposits of 3 years and above and up to 5 years maturity, according to an RBI statement.
Banks have now been allowed to offer higher interest across the tenors.
The RBI has also decided to move ahead with the introduction of the Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR), a benchmark based on the secured money markets.
Financial Benchmarks India Ltd (FBIL) is being requested to take the proposal forward.
The proposal is being taken up in line with the recommendation of the RBI’s Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark.
The Reserve Bank had set up the Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark headed by Ramanathan Subramanian to review the rupee interest rate benchmarks in the country, especially the usage of Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), and to examine the need for transition to new benchmarks. The Committee recommended several important measures to further develop the interest rate derivative market and improve the credibility of interest rate benchmarks. The Report of the Committee was published on the RBI’s website inviting comments from members of the public. The Reserve Bank has examined the recommendations of the Committee as well as the feedback received.
“The other recommendations of the Committee are under consideration,” the RBI statement said.

Title: Turkey, Iran and Russia to meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss Syria, Turkish source says
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:05:17 +0000
Content: The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Russia will meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss a lightning rebel advance in Syria, a Turkish diplomatic source said on Friday.
Syrian rebels have made their biggest battlefield gains since the civil war began 13 years ago, striking a devastating blow to President Bashar al-Assad.
After years of being locked behind frozen frontlines, the rebels captured the main northern city of Aleppo last week before pushing as far south as the centre of Hama, taking the strategic central city for the first time.
Turkey, Russia and Iran have regularly held talks on Syria’s future in a trilateral format as part of what is known as the Astana peace process. While NATO member Turkey backs the political and armed opposition, Russia and Iran support Assad.
The source said the three ministers were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Saturday within the framework of the Astana process, but did not provide further information.
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking alongside Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi after their talks in Ankara, said that a new effort would be made to revive the Astana process.
Since the start of the renewed conflict, Ankara has called on Assad to engage with the Syrian people for a political solution. It has denied any involvement in the rebels’ operation and said it did not want to see a new migrant wave heading toward its borders.

Title: FII selling slows in November 2024 as Indian markets stabilize after October fall: report
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 09:43:17 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows from Indian markets saw a significant reduction in November 2024, following a steep market correction in October. The Nifty 50 index had experienced a sharp 6 percent decline in October, closing 8 percent lower than its all-time highs. According to a report by JM Financials, this slowdown in FII selling indicates a stabilization in Indian markets.
November proved to be a calmer month for trading, with the benchmark index largely remaining flat. FII activity reflected this stabilization, as the intense selling pressure of October subsided significantly.
FII outflows dropped to Rs 182 billion (USD 2.2 billion) in November, a stark decline from Rs 919 billion (USD 10.9 billion) in October. The month was marked by a significant shift in investor sentiment, with a “tale of two halves.” During the first half of November, FIIs remained net sellers, with outflows of Rs 195 billion (USD 2.3 billion), but by the second half, they turned net buyers, bringing in Rs 13 billion (USD 159 million).
This shift was reinforced in the last seven days of the month, with FIIs recording net inflows of Rs 52.6 billion (USD 619 million).
Sector-wise, FII flows exhibited notable variations. The Oil and Gas sector saw the largest outflows for the second consecutive month, at USD 1.6 billion, followed by the Auto sector with USD 884 million in outflows. Telecom (USD 601 million) and FMCG (USD 167 million) also faced significant selling activity.
In contrast, sectors like Information Technology (IT), Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), and Realty attracted considerable inflows. IT led with inflows of USD 653 million, followed by BFSI at USD 296 million and Realty at USD 244 million. These inflows highlight investor interest in sectors perceived to offer resilience or growth potential.
FII shareholding in Indian equities inched up slightly to 16.1 percent in November 2024, from 16 percent in October, which marked the lowest level in 12 years. However, this figure remains lower year-on-year compared to 16.8 percent in November 2023. FII Equity Assets under Custody (AUC) also showed an improvement, rising to Rs 71.9 trillion at the end of November from Rs 71.1 trillion in October, signaling renewed investor confidence in the Indian market.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis sworn in as Maharashtra Chief Minister
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 13:15:23 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in a grand ceremony held at Azad Maidan, Mumbai. Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath of office to Fadnavis, marking the beginning of his historic new term.
The event was attended by a host of prominent leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Chief Ministers from several states, such as Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Bhupendra Patel (Gujarat), and Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand), also witnessed the occasion.
Adding a touch of glamour to the ceremony, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, and Madhuri Dixit were present to celebrate the political milestone.
Fadnavis, born on July 22, 1970, in Nagpur, comes from a middle-class family. He holds degrees in law, business management, and project management, which have contributed to his astute political acumen. His political journey began in 1992 when he was elected as a councillor in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, a position he held for two consecutive terms before advancing to serve as an MLA for five terms.
From 2014 to 2019, Fadnavis served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, becoming the second-youngest to hold the position after Sharad Pawar. During his tenure, he oversaw major projects, including the Samruddhi Expressway, the Police Digitisation Project, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Scheme, which bolstered the state’s infrastructure and welfare initiatives.
Fadnavis briefly held the Chief Minister’s position during the political turmoil in 2019 when the Shiv Sena broke its alliance with the BJP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government with the Congress and NCP.
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Elections, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a resounding victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while its allies, the Shiv Sena and NCP, secured 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
The MVA alliance suffered a significant defeat, with Congress managing only 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20, and the Sharad Pawar faction of the NCP winning just 10 seats.

Title: EAM Jaishankar reiterates India’s support for two-state solution, explains abstention from UN resolutions on Gaza conflict
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 12:41:22 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, emphasizing the importance of addressing terrorism and hostage-taking in global discourse.
Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Jaishankar defended India’s decision to abstain from certain United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions on the Gaza conflict, stating that these resolutions failed to capture the full scope of the situation.
Jaishankar clarified India’s stance in response to TMC MP Saket Gokhale’s inquiry, asserting, “We support the two-state solution and have been public and unambiguous about it. There should be no confusion regarding our position.”
When asked about the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders, Jaishankar noted that India is not an ICC member. “India decided not to join the ICC after thorough deliberation. Therefore, its decisions are not binding on us, and we have not taken a formal position on this matter,” he said.
The minister also highlighted India’s longstanding humanitarian support for Palestine. He detailed contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), adding a significant increase in annual aid from $1 million to $5 million under the current government. Additionally, he mentioned the provision of over 165 metric tons of medicines and other supplies to Palestine and Lebanon in recent years.
Regarding Israel’s ban on UNRWA, Jaishankar confirmed India’s unwavering commitment to its contributions, saying, “We continue to stand by our decision and have released the latest tranche of support to UNRWA.”
Explaining India’s abstention from some UNGA resolutions, Jaishankar emphasized that these lacked balance and failed to address critical aspects such as the October 7 Hamas attack, terrorism, and hostage-taking. “As a country that has suffered from terrorism, India cannot support resolutions that underplay such acts. Resolutions must be well-drafted, balanced, and reflect the entirety of the situation,” he said.
Jaishankar reiterated India’s condemnation of terrorism and hostage-taking while advocating for adherence to humanitarian law and minimizing civilian casualties. He stressed India’s call for a ceasefire and an end to violence in the region, adding that India’s position remains consistent and principled.
The Gaza conflict escalated after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting a large-scale Israeli counter-offensive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first global leaders to condemn Hamas’ actions, while also urging for a ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages. India continues to advocate for the two-state solution as the pathway to resolving the long-standing conflict.

Title: The fight for joy Bangla: How India helped Bangladesh achieve independence
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 10:22:10 +0000
Content: Pakistan, created in 1947 after the partition of British India, was a nation seemingly destined for further division. Many analysts considered it a geographical absurdity, a loose amalgamation of two separate territories 1,000 miles apart. Beyond sharing a Muslim majority, West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) had little in common.
One of the most significant differences between the two regions was language, which became a major source of identity problems and fuelled Bengali nationalism among the people of East Pakistan.
While people in West Pakistan spoke Urdu, the main language in East Pakistan was Bengali. In December 1947, students at the University of Dhaka protested, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of Pakistan’s official languages. This marked the beginning of the language war between East and West Pakistan. Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, responded by visiting Dhaka in March 1948 to deliver a stern message: Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. Moreover, leaders who spoke Bengali in the East Pakistan assembly were warned they could be tried for treason. Ultimately, West Pakistan imposed Urdu as the sole national language across both regions.
In response, the Bhasha Andolan (Language Movement) began in East Pakistan in 1952. This movement witnessed the deaths of many activists, politicians, and civilians due to atrocities committed by the West Pakistan-led regional regime. A key outcome of the language movement was the establishment of the Awami League in 1955, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In 1956, Pakistan was established as an Islamic Republic with a new constitution. The country that year accepted Urdu and Bengali as official languages. In 1958, a military coup led by General Muhammad Ayub Khan abrogated that constitution.
The other big difference between the West and East Pakistan was the culture being followed by its people. Speaking a different language than West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan followed a single ethnicity, Bengali, with a rich past. On the other hand, West Pakistan was a societal mix of people from different origins, including Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Pashtun people from its border areas, the North-West Frontier Province. Culturally, the people in East Pakistan had a stronger sense of belongingness than those in West Pakistan.
Despite these big differences, there could have been a united Pakistan based on religious similarity if both territories were treated equally by the country’s political leadership. However, the united Pakistan failed miserably here. The two territories, separated by a thousand miles, with different languages spoken and cultures followed, were ruled by a unilateral political leadership from West Pakistan.
The top political lineage under Jinnah that united Pakistan followed was largely from West Pakistan only. Also, its military wing leadership, the army, the air force, and the navy were based in West Pakistan only.
These disparities manifested in the repercussions felt by East Pakistan from 1947 until its liberation in 1971 as Bangladesh. The West Pakistani leadership treated East Pakistan as a colony, extracting benefits while denying it the rights and resources it deserved.
EAST PAKISTAN WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WEST PAKISTAN
According to the 1951 Pakistan Census, East Pakistan had a population of 42 million, exceeding West Pakistan’s 33.7 million. Geographically, East Pakistan was a riverine territory with ample rainfall, making it more prosperous. Its fertile and productive lands stood in contrast to West Pakistan, which, aside from Punjab, was largely dry with barren areas.
Moreover, a study titled “The Struggle in Bangladesh,” published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, indicates that in the initial years, East Pakistan’s GDP surpassed that of West Pakistan. Educationally, East Pakistan also had an advantage.

Initially, in 1949–50, East Pakistan’s GDP was 13,130 million rupees, more than West Pakistan’s 11,830 million rupees. In education, East Pakistan had 29,633 primary schools in 1947, compared to just 8,413 in West Pakistan. Similarly, East Pakistan had 50 colleges, while West Pakistan had 40.
WEST PAKISTAN’S COLONY
Despite East Pakistan’s higher GDP, better educational levels, and stable cultural heritage, data analysis reveals that West Pakistan monopolized industrialization and other benefits by installing a lame-duck government in East Pakistan.
East Pakistan was the primary source of jute, united Pakistan’s key export commodity. Logistically, industrial units for cotton textiles should have been developed there, but the country’s leadership chose to establish them in West Pakistan. Economic institutions and infrastructure developments, such as seaports, railways, and roads essential for promoting industrial growth further, were largely concentrated in West Pakistan only.
Conversely, East Pakistan experienced limited development, primarily aimed at supporting industries located in West Pakistan, according to the study. Furthermore, most industries in East Pakistan were developed by industrialists based in West Pakistan. Just 11% of industries were owned by Bengalis, making East Pakistan a labour hub for West Pakistan.
The deteriorating situation of East Pakistan over the next two decades reflects this exploitation. While East Pakistan was once more prosperous than West Pakistan, by 1970, the situation had reversed entirely.

Data from the study reveal that by 1968–69, West Pakistan’s GDP exceeded East Pakistan’s by 34%, and its per capita income was 62% higher. In united Pakistan’s first and second Five-Year Plans, 68% of the allocations went to West Pakistan, slightly reduced to 64% in the third plan. Pakistan’s economy largely depended on foreign assistance, of which 70% to 80% benefited West Pakistan. Although East Pakistan contributed up to 70% of Pakistan’s export earnings, 75% of imports were directed to West Pakistan.
CALL FOR SELF-DETERMINATION
These factors, language suppression, cultural differences, economic exploitation, mass arrests, killings, disappearances, and colonial treatment, left East Pakistanis facing an uncertain future after two decades of hostility.
In the 1954 regional elections, a coalition known as the United Front defeated the Muslim League, which had been based in West Pakistan and had ruled East Pakistan until then. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League presented his Six-Point Charter to the then-military ruler of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, demanding autonomy and greater control over East Pakistan’s economic affairs. These Six Points became central to Bengali nationalism and eventually transformed into a liberation movement following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.
1970 PAKISTAN ELECTION: A TURNING POINT – EAST PAKISTAN’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
Pakistan conducted its first general election on December 7, 1970, which is regarded as the most transparent election in the country’s history, according to Geo News, a major Pakistani news platform. The main contenders were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), based in West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League, based in East Pakistan. The Awami League achieved a landslide victory, winning 170 seats, while the PPP secured only 81.
Despite the Awami League’s clear mandate to govern all of Pakistan, the country’s military ruler, General Yahya Khan, and the PPP’s Bhutto opposed this outcome. They dismissed the election results and imposed martial law, denying the Awami League its rightful leadership.
This action led to widespread protests and riots in East Pakistan. In response, Sheikh Mujib initiated a civil disobedience movement. On March 7, 1971, the Awami League mobilized 50,000 Bengalis to start a peaceful protest in Dhaka. However, on March 25, 1971, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and airlifted to West Pakistan with the launch of Operation Searchlight.
OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT
Following Sheikh Mujib’s declaration of independence for East Pakistan, West Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on Bengalis. Operation Searchlight, initiated by West Pakistan on March 25, 1971, stands as one of the most horrific state-run military operations in history. According to various investigative estimates, including the Russian newspaper Pravda, approximately 3 million East Pakistanis were murdered by Pakistani troops and supporting militias.
In the 1970 general election, West Pakistan-based parties failed to win any seats in East Pakistan, underscoring the widespread support for the Awami League and its pro-independence stance among civilians, police, and security forces in East Pakistan. Consequently, West Pakistan’s troops and supporting radical militias targeted these Bengali-speaking populations across the region.
Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops across Dhaka and throughout East Bengal, supported by air and naval power, the main targets were Awami League politicians, military personnel, East Bengal police, and Bengali-speaking civilians.
An analytical report published in the Dhaka Tribune indicates that one of Operation Searchlight’s objectives was to disarm and arrest Bengali soldiers and policemen serving in East Pakistan. Another aim was to attack Hindu-majority areas of Dhaka. On the night of March 25, 1971, casualty figures in Dhaka alone reached approximately 35,000.
During the nine months of the operation, hundreds of thousands of Bengali women were subjected to rape. According to a report in the Smithsonian, around 400,000 women underwent late-term abortions, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
REFUGEES IN INDIA
The brutal crackdown compelled millions of Bangladeshis to flee to India. By May 1971, India was hosting 1.5 million refugees, a number that swelled to around 10 million by December 1971, making it the largest refugee crisis in the modern world. Internally, the military operation displaced approximately 30 million people within Bangladesh.
This massive influx placed a significant burden on India. Nevertheless, the country stepped forward to assist, despite lacking domestic laws to manage refugees and not being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. India established 825 refugee camps across seven states, with 19 central camps capable of accommodating up to 50,000 refugees each.
ECONOMIC BURDEN
The economic burden was significant. India had to reassess its Fourth Five-Year Plan. The 1971–72 Budget stated, “The country’s resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained by developments across the border, the influx of nearly ten million refugees and the outbreak of hostilities in December 1971.” 1 Despite these challenges, the economy responded effectively, as noted in the budget document.  
A World Bank assessment, based on 9 million refugees, estimated the direct cost to India at approximately US$700 million from April 1, 1971, to March 31, 1972, which equates to around US$5.5 billion today. India managed this expenditure largely through internal resources. According to a CIA document from March 1972, released in 2010, the Indian government spent about 4% of its planned central government expenditure for FY1971 on refugee care.
INDIA’S STAND
India supported Sheikh Mujib’s call for independence but initially refrained from participating in the war. Instead, it provided moral and material support to the independence movement. On April 17, 1971, a provisional government of Bangladesh was formed and relocated to Calcutta as the “Bangladesh Government in Exile.”
Meanwhile, the freedom fighters of East Pakistan formed the Mukti Bahini, an armed resistance movement against the West Pakistani military and supporting militias. Comprising members of the Bengali military, paramilitary forces, police, and civilians, these fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare.
India’s support bolstered their efforts. The geographical separation of 1,000 miles of Indian territory between West and East Pakistan meant that Pakistan could not easily reinforce its military presence in East Pakistan with additional air and naval power.
West Pakistan had previously exhibited hostility towards India, notably in the conflicts of 1947 and the 1965 war, which it lost. Its actions in East Pakistan heightened diplomatic tensions and prompted a military buildup in India.
The tipping point occurred on December 3, 1971, when Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on Indian airfields. This act of aggression compelled India to formally enter the war, engaging its Army, Navy, and Air Force in a coordinated response to both the humanitarian crisis and threats to its national sovereignty. Before this, India had adopted a restrained approach, engaging in diplomatic efforts and appealing to West Pakistani leaders to create safe corridors for refugees to return. These appeals were ignored.
THE QUICK END
India’s entry into the 1971 war was driven by the humanitarian crisis and direct threats to its national security. By launching joint military operations with the Mukti Bahini, effective coordination and intelligence sharing were achieved, significantly disrupting Pakistani military efforts. Through a series of strategic offensives, the joint forces rapidly overran West Pakistan’s military presence throughout Dhaka and East Pakistan.
On December 16, 1971, Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi of Pakistan unconditionally surrendered to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India, along with 93,000 troops, marking one of the largest surrenders since World War II. The war officially ended with India’s unilateral ceasefire on December 17.
WHY INDIA’S ENGAGEMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR A JOY BANGLA MOVEMENT
The success of the “Joy Bangla” movement on December 16, 1971, could only be possible with India’s commitment to the cause. With the onset of Operation Searchlight, India opened its borders to refugees, providing massive relief operations while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. Military intervention by India was the last resort.
The military intervention ultimately helped realize the goals of the “Joy Bangla” movement.
Twenty-three years of suppression, from 1947 to 1970, with West Pakistan ruling East Pakistan through military involvement, left the eastern territory with a strong desire for independence, an aspiration difficult to achieve in an economy controlled by West Pakistani industrialists and a polity dominated by a West Pakistan-based military ruler allied with exploitative politicians.
The increasing number of refugees in India proved the fact that there was no internal security structure and local and regional administration available for them to take over the West Pakistan-led apparatus.
Over ten million refugees fled to India in ten months, while thirty million were internally displaced. The refugee headcount included Bengali military wing officials, soldiers, and police personnel. According to the Bangladesh High Commission in London, thousands of families of officials, soldiers, and activists from East Pakistan were interned in West Pakistan. Killings and rapes became daily events of horror to be observed. India’s daily refugee count surged from 17,000 to 60,000, with numbers continuing to rise.
The freedom fighters of East Pakistan had the courage and will to fight for independence, but they lacked the strength of a coordinated war strategy and the full complement of military resources—army, air force, navy, arms, and ammunition—to defeat West Pakistan’s full-fledged military. They had to fight a country’s army that had exposure to past war experiences, something they didn’t have, as East Pakistan was not the war theatre of the 1965 India-Pakistan war. India’s decision to join the war after Pakistan’s attack on Indian territory proved to be the turning point, helping Bangladesh achieve a goal that once seemed unachievable.
Had the Mukti Bahini not received external support, Operation Searchlight could have seriously affected the East Pakistan freedom movement and its hopes to break the colonial shackles of West Pakistan.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis set to be sworn in today as Maharashtra CM, Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar Deputy CMs
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 04:45:20 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis will take oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde along with NCP’s Ajit Pawar will take the oath as Deputy Chief Ministers in the new cabinet, sources said.
The oath-taking ceremony will take place at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan and will see the participation of several NDA Chief Ministers and leaders. Ending the long-drawn suspense over who would get the top job, Fadnavis, Shinde, and Pawar met Governor CP Radhakrishnan to stake their claim to form the MahaYuti government.
After meeting the Governor, Fadnavis said, “The swearing-in ceremony of the new government will be held tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I met Eknath Shinde and requested him to join us in this government, as it is the wish of MahaYuti workers…We will fulfill the promises made to the people of Maharashtra.”
It will be Fadnavis’ third term in the top post after being unanimously elected as the Leader of the Maharashtra BJP Legislative Party on Wednesday. The decision came after days of speculation and political manoeuvring as Eknath Shinde wanted to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. However, the BJP, refused to budge and later, Shinde said he would back PM Modi’s pick.
Meanwhile, Eknath Shinde on Wednesday expressed his satisfaction with the two-and a-half years of the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, ahead of the swearing-in of Fadnavis as Chief Minister.
“I am very happy with the completion of two-and-a-half years. The work done by our government–the MahaYuti government–by the three of us and our team in the last 2.5 years is remarkable. It will be written in golden letters in history. We are proud to have taken such significant decisions,” said Shinde.
Shinde was accompanied by Fadnavis and NCP chief Ajit Pawar at a press conference. Addressing the media, Pawar emphasised their commitment to effective governance. “We will leave no stone unturned in running the government. Party activities will be managed by BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and NCP’s Sunil Tatkare,” he said.
There was also some light-hearted banter during the press conference. Asked whether he and Ajit Pawar would take oath on December 5 as Fadnavis’ deputies, Shinde said, “Wait till evening…” Pawar, in response to Shinde’s reply, said, “Sham tak unka samaj aayega (We will know about Shinde by evening), I will take it (oath), I will not wait.”
Shinde then said, “Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking (oath) both in the morning and evening.” This elicted laughter from all those present at the press conference. In the year 2019, Pawar had taken oath as the Deputy Chief Minister with Fadnavis as the Chief Minister in an early morning ceremony at Raj Bhavan.
The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election witnessed a resounding victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide win with 235 seats out of 288. The results marked a significant milestone for the BJP, which emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats. The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party also recorded notable gains, securing 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
While, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a major setback with Congress winning just 16 seats. Its alliance partner, Shiv Sena (UBT), won 20 seats, while the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) secured only 10 seats.

Title: RBI raises UPI lite wallet limit to Rs 5,000
Publication Date: Wed, 04 Dec 2024 17:08:49 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the wallet limit for UPI Lite from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000. The new guidelines, announced on Wednesday, also raised the upper transaction limit under the offline framework from ₹500 to ₹1,000 per transaction.
According to the RBI’s circular, the revised limits are effective immediately, enabling users to make higher-value transactions conveniently while maintaining the simplicity and security of UPI Lite. “The enhanced limits for UPI Lite shall be ₹1,000 per transaction, with ₹5,000 being the total limit at any point in time,” the circular said.
Previously, the offline framework permitted a maximum of ₹500 per transaction and a total limit of ₹2,000 for payment instruments. The updated framework is expected to streamline digital payments for day-to-day purchases and provide a more robust and inclusive digital payment experience for consumers.
The RBI clarified that the changes have been implemented under the authority of Section 18, read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. This initiative aligns with the central bank’s ongoing efforts to promote digital transactions while ensuring ease of use and enhanced security for consumers.
Earlier, in October 2024, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had announced an increase in transaction limits for UPI services during the monetary policy briefing, emphasizing the growing importance of digital payment platforms in India’s economy.
The updated limits come at a time when Unified Payments Interface (UPI) continues to set milestones in the digital payment space. In October 2024, UPI achieved a record-breaking 16.58 billion financial transactions in a single month.
Since its launch in 2016 by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI has revolutionized the country’s payment system, integrating multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application for seamless fund transfers, peer-to-peer transactions, and merchant payments.

Title: “We should fight unitedly against anti-India forces”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:29:34 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Monday urged Congress and its members to put aside political differences and unite in the fight against “anti-India forces,” specifically addressing concerns about George Soros’ links to political entities in India. Rijiju emphasized that certain national issues should not be viewed through a political lens but rather with the collective interest of the nation in mind.
“We should not see certain issues with political lenses. The recent revelations about George Soros and his links are not about Congress or Rahul Gandhi. We must take them seriously as they relate to anti-India forces,” Rijiju said while speaking to the media in New Delhi.
He further appealed to the Congress leadership and workers, urging them to raise their voices if any of their members are found to have links with such forces. “If even Congress leaders have connections with anti-India forces, they should speak out and we must fight unitedly,” he added.
Rijiju also reacted to the growing concerns over Soros’ involvement in Indian political matters, calling the charges “serious.” He stressed that all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation, should prioritize the nation’s interests. “Whether a member of parliament or a common man, everyone should work for the country’s betterment. We should be united in combating anti-India forces,” Rijiju said.
On the ongoing debates within the opposition INDIA alliance, Rijiju remarked that some members have questioned Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, but he refrained from interfering in the internal matters of the Congress party or the alliance.
This comes as Congress is planning another day of protests outside Parliament, calling for a discussion on the Adani issue. Meanwhile, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, during his statement on December 7, praised Mamata Banerjee’s leadership within the INDIA alliance, acknowledging her as a potential national leader.

Title: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrives in Moscow for high-level talks and INS Tushil commissioning ceremony
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:28:00 +0000
Content: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Moscow on Sunday for an official visit aimed at strengthening defence cooperation between India and Russia.
During his stay, Singh will participate in the commissioning ceremony of the stealth-guided missile frigate INS Tushil into the Indian Navy. He will also attend the 21st meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC).
Singh was welcomed late Sunday night by Indian Ambassador to Russia Venkatesh Kumar and Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin.
During the visit, Singh will pay homage at Moscow’s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, honoring Soviet soldiers who lost their lives in World War II. He is also set to engage with members of the Indian community in Russia, fostering bilateral cultural ties.
A major highlight of the visit is Singh’s scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Additionally, he will co-chair the IRIGC-M&MTC meeting alongside Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, furthering India-Russia cooperation in military and technical domains.
Sharing the visit details on X, the Embassy of India in Russia wrote, “Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh was received by Ambassador @vkumar1969 and Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Alexander Fomin in Moscow.”
Singh’s participation in the commissioning of INS Tushil—a multi-role stealth-guided missile frigate—underscores the growing maritime collaboration between India and Russia.
In a post prior to his departure, Singh expressed enthusiasm for the visit, saying, “Tomorrow, 08th December, I shall be reaching Moscow in Russia to attend the 21st meeting of India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation. Also, I shall be attending the commissioning ceremony of Indian Navy’s latest multi-role stealth-guided missile frigate ‘INS Tushil.’ Looking forward to it.”
The name Tushil translates to “protector shield,” and its crest symbolizes the ‘Abhedya Kavacham’ (Impenetrable Shield). Alongside its motto—Nirbhay, Abhedya aur Balsheel (Fearless, Indomitable, Resolute)—the frigate reflects the Indian Navy’s dedication to safeguarding the nation’s maritime frontiers.
The ship features an indigenous content of 26%, a significant enhancement over earlier models, with the number of Indian-made systems doubling to 33. Collaborators include BrahMos Aerospace, Bharat Electronics Limited, Keltron, Nova Integrated Systems (Tata), Elcome Marine, and Johnson Controls India, among others.
Upon commissioning, INS Tushil will join the Western Fleet, the “Sword Arm” of the Indian Navy, under the Western Naval Command, ranking among the most technologically advanced frigates in the world.

Title: Women’s Junior Asia Cup: India start campaign with 13-1 win over Bangladesh
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:27:11 +0000
Content: Indian junior women’s hockey team got off to a rollicking start at Women’s Asia Cup on Sunday, comfortably defeating Bangladesh 13-1 in their Pool A match in the opening game of the event.
Mumtaz Khan (27′, 32′, 53′, 58′) top-scored for the team with four goals, while Deepika (7′, 20′, 55′) and Kanika Siwach (12′, 51′, 51′) completed hat-tricks in India’s high-scoring encounter. Manisha (10′), Beauty Dung Dung (33′), and Sakshi Rana (43′) also put their names on the scoresheet. For Bangladesh, Orpita Pal (12′) was the lone goal-scorer, according to a Hockey India press release.
Drag-flick specialist Deepika opened the scoresheet for India in the 7th minute through a finely-converted penalty corner (PC). They doubled their lead in the 10th minute with another PC, this time a clever variation that saw Manisha register her name on the scoresheet. In the 12th minute, India took a commanding 3-0 lead when Kanika Siwach scored a splendid field goal.
However, an infringement by India in the same minute allowed Bangladesh a PC. Orpita Pal capitalized on the opportunity with a well-converted effort. Despite this, the Indian side maintained their tactical structure, continuing to attack and create scoring opportunities. Deepika struck again in the 20th minute with a fine field goal, while Mumtaz Khan extended the lead to 5-1 in the 27th minute, giving India a significant advantage at the halftime break.
The second half saw an even more dominant India. Mumtaz struck again in the 32nd minute, and Beauty Dung Dung followed up with a fine field goal in the 33rd, taking India’s lead to 7-1. Sakshi Rana scored in the 43rd minute, leaving the Bangladesh defense in tatters.
While the final quarter was only a formality for India, the defending champions continued their aggressive approach. Kanika Siwach and Mumtaz Khan completed their hat-tricks in the fourth quarter. Siwach scored twice in the 51st minute, while Mumtaz added another in the 53rd minute, taking India’s tally to 11-1. Deepika joined the party in the 55th minute, completing her hat-trick with a quick field goal. The relentless Indian onslaught concluded with Mumtaz scoring her fourth goal in the 58th minute, sealing the final scoreline at 13-1.
India will next face Malaysia on December 9th at 20:30 IST (8:30 PM).

Title: Nifty, Sensex open flat as markets pause after last week’s rally
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:19:46 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened flat on Monday, with early trade witnessing heavy selling in the FMCG sector.
The Nifty 50 declined 43.90 points, or 0.18 percent, to open at 24,633.90, while the BSE Sensex dropped 106.54 points, or 0.13 percent, to 81,602.58.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, said that Indian markets have recovered over 50 percent of their post-September fall.
“We expect markets to consolidate before resuming their uptrend,” he said, adding that “seasonality and capital flows favor a market advance.”
Bagga highlighted global events, particularly the US CPI report, as key indicators for the week, along with an anticipated 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on December 18.
A mixed trend was observed across sectoral indices. Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial, Nifty Metal, and Nifty Realty saw gains, while Nifty IT slipped marginally. Of the Nifty 50 stocks, 22 registered gains while 28 declined at the time of reporting.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said: “The Nifty’s drop on Friday traced a small-sized bar contained within Thursday’s long-range, creating a so-called “inside day”. This represents volatility compression but since volatility is cyclical, one should expect a trending move soon. At current prices, the Nifty is facing resistance from the 50- and 100-day moving averages and an Ichimoku hurdle, so the 24800 – 24900 area is formidable. Support lies at 24,445 and 24,360″
Among top gainers were L&T, Bajaj Finance, SBI Life, HDFC Bank, and Shriram Finance. Major laggards included Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer, and Britannia.
Foreign investors made a strong comeback last week, with Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) injecting over Rs 24,400 crore into Indian equities between December 2 and 6. The largest single-day inflow was recorded on Friday, when FPIs invested Rs 9,489 crore.
Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services, said, “Nifty 50’s outperformance last week, rising by 546 points, signals a bullish trend. The series of bullish candles shows growing buyer interest, likely pushing prices higher.”
In broader Asian markets, South Korea’s KOSPI index fell amid political uncertainty, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.33 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Taiwan’s Weighted Index posted modest gains of 0.27 percent and 0.10 percent, respectively.

Title: South Korea says Yoon still controls military as leadership crisis deepens
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 05:11:38 +0000
Content: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is still commander in chief and there is no disruption to the U.S. alliance, the defence ministry said on Monday after it was revealed Yoon was under criminal investigation for declaring martial law last week.
Yoon’s grip on power has come into question with dissent growing among senior military officers against the president, and his own party saying it would establish a task force to handle his eventual resignation.
While Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, his party’s decision to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister has plunged the key U.S. ally into a constitutional crisis.
Yoon has refused calls, including some from within his own ruling party, to resign, but his future looked more uncertain over the weekend when Yonhap news agency reported he was under criminal investigation for alleged treason.
Police were also considering banning him from leaving the country, Yonhap and other media reported on Monday.
Prosecutors on Sunday arrested ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in the declaration of martial law, Yonhap reported.
Yoon gave the military sweeping emergency powers on Dec. 3 to root out what he called “anti-state forces” and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree.
Amid the backlash, multiple military officials, including the acting defence minister, have said they would not follow any new order to impose martial law again.
The main opposition Democratic Party has called for Yoon to be stripped of authority to control the military. The DP has also demanded the arrest of Yoon and any military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.
Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) had established a task force to deal with, among other matters, “political stabilisation after martial law and (Yoon’s) orderly early resignation”, a spokesperson said on Monday.
On Sunday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said the president would be excluded from foreign and other state affairs, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would manage government affairs until Yoon eventually stepped aside.
That proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition, which says it is unconstitutional. It says Yoon must be impeached or resign and face legal prosecution, and plans to table another impeachment bill on Saturday.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung warned on Monday that the political crisis threatened to do irreversible harm to Asia’s fourth-largest economy, major global supplier of memory chips.
South Korea’s finance ministry and regulators said they would make all-out efforts to stabilise financial markets by deploying contingency plans and boosting liquidity by end-December.
MILITARY BACKLASH
In the latest sign of dissent within military ranks, the commander of South Korea’s special forces said he was ordered to send his troops into parliament last week to stop a vote to reject martial law.
Colonel Kim Hyun-tae, the commanding officer of the 707th Special Missions Group, told reporters he took responsibility for his troops’ actions but he was acting under orders from then defence minister Kim Yong-hyun.
“We were all victims who were used by the former defence minister,” the colonel told reporters outside the defence ministry in Seoul.
He said he had not told the military about his plan to speak to the media out of fear he might be stopped.
Yoon’s decision to declare emergency rule and grant the military sweeping powers stirred protests on the streets and raised alarm among Seoul’s allies.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin scrapped plans to travel to South Korea and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his South Korean counterpart, saying he expected the democratic process to prevail.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
The turmoil in Seoul comes at an important geopolitical moment in the region, with North Korea allegedly sending troops to help Russia’s war against Ukraine amid growing military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.

Title: 2024 will be the hottest year on record, EU scientists say
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 04:55:59 +0000
Content: This year will be the world’s warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
The data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after U.N. climate talks yielded a $300-billion deal to tackle climate change, a package poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the U.S. and the Philippines.
Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
“We’re still in near-record-high territory for global temperatures, and that’s likely to stay at least for the next few months,” Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas told Reuters.
Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
Scientists are also monitoring whether the La Nina weather pattern – which involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures – could form in 2025.
That could briefly cool global temperatures, though it would not halt the long-term underlying trend of warming caused by emissions. The world is currently in neutral conditions, after El Nino – La Nina’s hotter counterpart – ended earlier this year.
“While 2025 might be slightly cooler than 2024, if a La Nina event develops, this does not mean temperatures will be ‘safe’ or ‘normal’,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London.
“We will still experience high temperatures, resulting in dangerous heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones.”
C3S’ records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.

During the visit, the Indian Foreign secretary is expected to pay a courtesy call on Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Advisor Md Touhid Hossain. 
Earlier on Sunday, while addressing a seminar in Dhaka, Foreign Affair Adviser of Bangladesh Md Touhid Hossain said that Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri is set to arrive in Dhaka on Monday for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC) between Bangladesh and India, where bilateral trade issues and other matters of mutual concern are expected to be discussed. He expressed optimism that Dhaka and New Delhi could move forward pragmatically and realistically to restore ties to a “completely normal” state.

Title: Russian exporters won’t stop supplying wheat to Syria unilaterally
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 13:40:53 +0000
Content: Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally stop supplying wheat to Syria amid political turmoil there, Eduard Zernin, head of the Russian Grain Producers and Exporters Union, said on Monday
Russia is a major supplier of wheat to Syria, where rebels seized capital Damascus, ending the rule of Bashar al-Assad and ousting him as president. Assad fled to Moscow after a lightning rebel offensive.
“Russian grain exporters do not plan to unilaterally terminate their obligations under concluded contracts,” Zernin said.
Zernin estimated Syria’s imports at about 2 million metric tons of wheat per year. A disruption of Russian wheat supplies could risk hunger in the country of over 23 million people.
“Syria is not a key consumer for us, but it is a decent market with a capacity of about 2 million tons of wheat per year,” he said.
IKAR consultancy’s Dmitry’s Rylko estimated wheat exports to Syria at 300,000 tons so far this season with the country ranking 24th among Russian wheat buyers.
Zernin said that Russian exporters would work with the Syrian side to resolve wheat supply payments and outstanding debt issues. Russia has previously issued loans to Syria to enable it to pay for wheat imports.

Title: Ayushman Vay Vandana Card enrollment reaches 25 lakh within two months
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:16:20 +0000
Content: Enrollment for the Ayushman Vay Vandana Card has reached 25 lakh within just two months of its launch, the health ministry said on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the scheme on October 29 this year, as part of the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) to include senior citizens aged 70 years and above.
According to the ministry, treatments worth more than Rs 40 crore have been availed by over 22,000 senior citizens across the country since its launch. These treatments have covered various conditions, including coronary angioplasty, hip fractures, cataract surgeries, gall bladder removals, prostate resection, stroke recovery, hemodialysis, and other illnesses.
The Ayushman Vay Vandana Card offers Rs 5 lakh in free health coverage to all senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of their socio-economic status. This expansion of the AB PM-JAY scheme ensures that senior citizens not only have access to healthcare but also an additional top-up cover for those already enrolled in the scheme.
Eligible seniors, who belong to families already covered by AB PM-JAY, can receive up to Rs 5 lakh per year in additional health benefits. Those already under other government health schemes, such as Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), or Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), can either choose their existing scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY.
The Ayushman Vay Vandana Card provides coverage for around 2000 medical procedures, covering all pre-existing diseases from the first day, with no waiting period.

Title: BJP’s Rahul Narwekar elected unopposed as Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 12:04:05 +0000
Content: BJP legislator Rahul Narwekar was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Monday, marking his second consecutive term.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis congratulated Narwekar on his re-election and expressed gratitude to the Opposition for their support.
Narwekar, who represents the Colaba constituency, was first elected to the state Assembly as a BJP candidate in the 2019 elections. He was appointed Speaker in July 2022 after Eknath Shinde became Chief Minister, following the collapse of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government.
Fadnavis highlighted that only four Speakers before Narwekar have held the post for a second consecutive term.
He praised Narwekar’s decisions during his previous tenure, particularly those related to the Shiv Sena and NCP split, noting that these judgments would serve as precedents in the future.
Fadnavis also emphasized the importance of the Speaker’s role in ensuring fairness, particularly for first-time elected members, and expressed confidence in Narwekar’s ability to deliver justice to all.

Content: The Indian stock market closed red on Monday, with key indices showing little movement. The Sensex fell by 177.12 points, settling at 81,531.99, while the Nifty dropped 52.05 points to close at 24,625.75.
Among Nifty firms, 19 advanced, 30 declined, and one remained unchanged. Wipro, L&T, SBI Life, Tata Steel, and BPCL were among the top gainers, while Tata Consumer Products, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Motors, Nestle, and Asian Paints saw the largest declines.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market’s range-bound movement to a mix of domestic and global factors. He added that after last week’s rally, domestic market sentiment was affected by rising oil prices amid tensions in the Middle East.
Additionally, investors were cautious ahead of key economic data, including India’s and the US’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures and the European Central Bank’s policy decision this week. There was some buying interest in capital goods and metal stocks, partly in anticipation of China’s stimulus following an unexpected drop in inflation.
Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, provided a technical outlook, suggesting the market remains bullish but may see range-bound activity due to overbought conditions. He recommended a strategy of buying on dips and selling on rallies.

Title: Centre’s PLI scheme to boost millet-based products: All you need to know
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 11:31:42 +0000
Content: The Government of India has introduced the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-Based Products (PLISMBP) to support the use of millets in food products and encourage value addition. This initiative, launched for the period 2022-2027, comes with an allocation of ₹800 crore and aims to boost millet production and processing by removing the threshold investment requirement, making it accessible to a wider range of participants.
Under the scheme, companies are eligible for incentives if they achieve a minimum year-on-year sales growth of 10% over the base year. It focuses on sales of branded Ready-to-Eat and Ready-to-Cook products in consumer packs, provided these products contain at least 15% millet by weight or volume.
Initially, 30 beneficiaries were enrolled under the scheme. Following the withdrawal of one participant, 29 beneficiaries remain. According to the guidelines, the products must be prepared using domestically sourced agricultural materials, excluding additives, flavors, and oils. This requirement has helped strengthen local agricultural procurement, benefiting farmers.
The scheme has a five-year duration. For the first performance year (FY 2022-2023), 19 participants filed claims in FY 2023-2024, with ₹3.917 crore disbursed to eligible applicants.
The government has taken steps to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme. These include launching a user-friendly portal, establishing support groups for issue resolution, and issuing regular clarifications on guidelines. Weekly meetings with applicants, along with technical support, are being conducted to track progress and address challenges effectively.

Title: India’s surging FDI inflows surpass $1,000 billion milestone in last 4 years
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 09:07:41 +0000
Content: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into India from April 2000 to September 2024 have soared to the $1,033.40 billion mark, reflecting the increasing investment opportunities in the country’s fast-growing economy, according to figures compiled by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
The main sectors of the economy benefiting from FDI include automobiles, computer software, IT hardware, telecom, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and services. The data also show that FDI inflows in the sunrise non-conventional energy sector have recorded a significant jump.
FDI inflows lead to higher investments, job creation, and the introduction of state-of-the-art technology, which raises productivity levels and spurs economic growth.
A senior official stated that the government has facilitated ease of doing business and implemented various incentives, such as the PLI scheme, which have helped accelerate FDI inflows into the country.
The surge in FDI has continued into the current financial year, with a robust 45 percent jump to $29.79 billion in April-September, compared to $20.5 billion during the same period in 2023-24, according to DPIIT data.
FDI in services has increased to $5.69 billion during the first half of the current financial year, compared to $3.85 billion in the same period last year.
A state-wise analysis of the figures shows that Maharashtra received the highest inflow, with $13.55 billion during April-September 2024-25. It was followed by Karnataka ($3.54 billion), Telangana ($1.54 billion), and Gujarat (about $4 billion).
FDI inflows for the July-September quarter jumped by 43 percent to $13.6 billion during the current financial year, compared to $9.52 billion in the same quarter of 2023-24.
In the preceding April-June quarter, the country recorded a 47.8 percent increase to $16.17 billion.

Title: “India has achieved success through Reform, Perform and Transform mantra”: Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 08:07:00 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated and addressed the Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit in Jaipur on Monday, marking the beginning of a three-day event (December 9-11) aimed at attracting investment and promoting the state’s growth.
In his address, PM Modi outlined India’s remarkable economic progress, attributing the nation’s rise to the guiding principles of “Reform, Perform, and Transform”. He emphasized that this approach had helped India become the world’s fifth-largest economy, doubling its economy and exports over the last decade.
“Today, the world looks at India’s development in all sectors. We have become the fifth-largest economy, and our economy and exports have doubled. Every investor in the world is now excited about India. The development we have seen is a direct result of the Reform, Perform, and Transform mantra,” the Prime Minister said.
PM Modi highlighted how this success is reflected in India’s growth in key areas, including digital data, democracy, delivery, and demography. He pointed out that India, in this “tech and data-driven century,” has demonstrated the power of its democratic framework and its ability to leverage technology to drive inclusive growth.
“This is a tech and data-driven century. India is showcasing the real power of democracy, demography, and data to the world. The democratization of digital technology has benefited all sectors and sections of society. India’s UPI, DBT schemes, and other platforms are testament to the strength of our digital infrastructure. We will soon witness the positive effects of this progress in Rajasthan,” PM Modi added.
Further reinforcing his vision, the Prime Minister spoke about the BJP government’s focus on both development and heritage, citing the state’s progress through the mantra “Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi”. He criticized the post-independence governments for neglecting both these aspects, especially in Rajasthan, and said that the BJP’s responsive government was addressing both with equal focus.
“The priorities of the governments after independence were neither development nor heritage. Rajasthan suffered as a result. But today, our government is working with the mantra of ‘Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi.’ Rajasthan is rising, reliable, and receptive to change. The people of the state have formed the BJP’s responsive and reformist government with a huge majority,” PM Modi said.
The Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit 2024, which runs until December 11, has attracted global investors, industry leaders, and policymakers. The event serves as a platform to showcase the state’s achievements in development, innovation, and industrial growth.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma attributed the state’s growing appeal to global investors to its updated policy framework. He added that the recent launch of nine new policies on December 4, aimed at enhancing the state’s business ecosystem and improving the ease of doing business.

Title: The fight for joy Bangla: How India helped Bangladesh achieve independence
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:46:44 +0000
Content: Pakistan, created in 1947 after the partition of British India, was a nation seemingly destined for further division. Many analysts considered it a geographical absurdity, a loose amalgamation of two separate territories 1,000 miles apart. Beyond sharing a Muslim majority, West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) had little in common.
One of the most significant differences between the two regions was language, which became a major source of identity problems and fuelled Bengali nationalism among the people of East Pakistan.
While people in West Pakistan spoke Urdu, the main language in East Pakistan was Bengali. In December 1947, students at the University of Dhaka protested, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of Pakistan’s official languages. This marked the beginning of the language war between East and West Pakistan. Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, responded by visiting Dhaka in March 1948 to deliver a stern message: Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. Moreover, leaders who spoke Bengali in the East Pakistan assembly were warned they could be tried for treason. Ultimately, West Pakistan imposed Urdu as the sole national language across both regions.
In response, the Bhasha Andolan (Language Movement) began in East Pakistan in 1952. This movement witnessed the deaths of many activists, politicians, and civilians due to atrocities committed by the West Pakistan-led regional regime. A key outcome of the language movement was the establishment of the Awami League in 1955, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In 1956, Pakistan was established as an Islamic Republic with a new constitution. The country that year accepted Urdu and Bengali as official languages. In 1958, a military coup led by General Muhammad Ayub Khan abrogated that constitution.
The other big difference between the West and East Pakistan was the culture being followed by its people. Speaking a different language than West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan followed a single ethnicity, Bengali, with a rich past. On the other hand, West Pakistan was a societal mix of people from different origins, including Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Pashtun people from its border areas, the North-West Frontier Province. Culturally, the people in East Pakistan had a stronger sense of belongingness than those in West Pakistan.
Despite these big differences, there could have been a united Pakistan based on religious similarity if both territories were treated equally by the country’s political leadership. However, the united Pakistan failed miserably here. The two territories, separated by a thousand miles, with different languages spoken and cultures followed, were ruled by a unilateral political leadership from West Pakistan.
The top political lineage under Jinnah that united Pakistan followed was largely from West Pakistan only. Also, its military wing leadership, the army, the air force, and the navy were based in West Pakistan only.
These disparities manifested in the repercussions felt by East Pakistan from 1947 until its liberation in 1971 as Bangladesh. The West Pakistani leadership treated East Pakistan as a colony, extracting benefits while denying it the rights and resources it deserved.
EAST PAKISTAN WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WEST PAKISTAN
According to the 1951 Pakistan Census, East Pakistan had a population of 42 million, exceeding West Pakistan’s 33.7 million. Geographically, East Pakistan was a riverine territory with ample rainfall, making it more prosperous. Its fertile and productive lands stood in contrast to West Pakistan, which, aside from Punjab, was largely dry with barren areas.
Moreover, a study titled “The Struggle in Bangladesh,” published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, indicates that in the initial years, East Pakistan’s GDP surpassed that of West Pakistan. Educationally, East Pakistan also had an advantage.

Initially, in 1949–50, East Pakistan’s GDP was 13,130 million rupees, more than West Pakistan’s 11,830 million rupees. In education, East Pakistan had 29,633 primary schools in 1947, compared to just 8,413 in West Pakistan. Similarly, East Pakistan had 50 colleges, while West Pakistan had 40.
WEST PAKISTAN’S COLONY
Despite East Pakistan’s higher GDP, better educational levels, and stable cultural heritage, data analysis reveals that West Pakistan monopolized industrialization and other benefits by installing a lame-duck government in East Pakistan.
East Pakistan was the primary source of jute, united Pakistan’s key export commodity. Logistically, industrial units for cotton textiles should have been developed there, but the country’s leadership chose to establish them in West Pakistan. Economic institutions and infrastructure developments, such as seaports, railways, and roads essential for promoting industrial growth further, were largely concentrated in West Pakistan only.
Conversely, East Pakistan experienced limited development, primarily aimed at supporting industries located in West Pakistan, according to the study. Furthermore, most industries in East Pakistan were developed by industrialists based in West Pakistan. Just 11% of industries were owned by Bengalis, making East Pakistan a labour hub for West Pakistan.
The deteriorating situation of East Pakistan over the next two decades reflects this exploitation. While East Pakistan was once more prosperous than West Pakistan, by 1970, the situation had reversed entirely.

Data from the study reveal that by 1968–69, West Pakistan’s GDP exceeded East Pakistan’s by 34%, and its per capita income was 62% higher. In united Pakistan’s first and second Five-Year Plans, 68% of the allocations went to West Pakistan, slightly reduced to 64% in the third plan. Pakistan’s economy largely depended on foreign assistance, of which 70% to 80% benefited West Pakistan. Although East Pakistan contributed up to 70% of Pakistan’s export earnings, 75% of imports were directed to West Pakistan.
CALL FOR SELF-DETERMINATION
These factors, language suppression, cultural differences, economic exploitation, mass arrests, killings, disappearances, and colonial treatment, left East Pakistanis facing an uncertain future after two decades of hostility.
In the 1954 regional elections, a coalition known as the United Front defeated the Muslim League, which had been based in West Pakistan and had ruled East Pakistan until then. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League presented his Six-Point Charter to the then-military ruler of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, demanding autonomy and greater control over East Pakistan’s economic affairs. These Six Points became central to Bengali nationalism and eventually transformed into a liberation movement following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.
1970 PAKISTAN ELECTION: A TURNING POINT – EAST PAKISTAN’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
Pakistan conducted its first general election on December 7, 1970, which is regarded as the most transparent election in the country’s history, according to Geo News, a major Pakistani news platform. The main contenders were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), based in West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League, based in East Pakistan. The Awami League achieved a landslide victory, winning 170 seats, while the PPP secured only 81.
Despite the Awami League’s clear mandate to govern all of Pakistan, the country’s military ruler, General Yahya Khan, and the PPP’s Bhutto opposed this outcome. They dismissed the election results and imposed martial law, denying the Awami League its rightful leadership.
This action led to widespread protests and riots in East Pakistan. In response, Sheikh Mujib initiated a civil disobedience movement. On March 7, 1971, the Awami League mobilized 50,000 Bengalis to start a peaceful protest in Dhaka. However, on March 25, 1971, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and airlifted to West Pakistan with the launch of Operation Searchlight.
OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT
Following Sheikh Mujib’s declaration of independence for East Pakistan, West Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on Bengalis. Operation Searchlight, initiated by West Pakistan on March 25, 1971, stands as one of the most horrific state-run military operations in history. According to various investigative estimates, including the Russian newspaper Pravda, approximately 3 million East Pakistanis were murdered by Pakistani troops and supporting militias.
In the 1970 general election, West Pakistan-based parties failed to win any seats in East Pakistan, underscoring the widespread support for the Awami League and its pro-independence stance among civilians, police, and security forces in East Pakistan. Consequently, West Pakistan’s troops and supporting radical militias targeted these Bengali-speaking populations across the region.
Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops across Dhaka and throughout East Bengal, supported by air and naval power, the main targets were Awami League politicians, military personnel, East Bengal police, and Bengali-speaking civilians.
An analytical report published in the Dhaka Tribune indicates that one of Operation Searchlight’s objectives was to disarm and arrest Bengali soldiers and policemen serving in East Pakistan. Another aim was to attack Hindu-majority areas of Dhaka. On the night of March 25, 1971, casualty figures in Dhaka alone reached approximately 35,000.
During the nine months of the operation, hundreds of thousands of Bengali women were subjected to rape. According to a report in the Smithsonian, around 400,000 women underwent late-term abortions, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
REFUGEES IN INDIA
The brutal crackdown compelled millions of Bangladeshis to flee to India. By May 1971, India was hosting 1.5 million refugees, a number that swelled to around 10 million by December 1971, making it the largest refugee crisis in the modern world. Internally, the military operation displaced approximately 30 million people within Bangladesh.
This massive influx placed a significant burden on India. Nevertheless, the country stepped forward to assist, despite lacking domestic laws to manage refugees and not being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. India established 825 refugee camps across seven states, with 19 central camps capable of accommodating up to 50,000 refugees each.
ECONOMIC BURDEN
The economic burden was significant. India had to reassess its Fourth Five-Year Plan. The 1971–72 Budget stated, “The country’s resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained by developments across the border, the influx of nearly ten million refugees and the outbreak of hostilities in December 1971.” 1 Despite these challenges, the economy responded effectively, as noted in the budget document.  
A World Bank assessment, based on 9 million refugees, estimated the direct cost to India at approximately US$700 million from April 1, 1971, to March 31, 1972, which equates to around US$5.5 billion today. India managed this expenditure largely through internal resources. According to a CIA document from March 1972, released in 2010, the Indian government spent about 4% of its planned central government expenditure for FY1971 on refugee care.
INDIA’S STAND
India supported Sheikh Mujib’s call for independence but initially refrained from participating in the war. Instead, it provided moral and material support to the independence movement. On April 17, 1971, a provisional government of Bangladesh was formed and relocated to Calcutta as the “Bangladesh Government in Exile.”
Meanwhile, the freedom fighters of East Pakistan formed the Mukti Bahini, an armed resistance movement against the West Pakistani military and supporting militias. Comprising members of the Bengali military, paramilitary forces, police, and civilians, these fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare.
India’s support bolstered their efforts. The geographical separation of 1,000 miles of Indian territory between West and East Pakistan meant that Pakistan could not easily reinforce its military presence in East Pakistan with additional air and naval power.
West Pakistan had previously exhibited hostility towards India, notably in the conflicts of 1947 and the 1965 war, which it lost. Its actions in East Pakistan heightened diplomatic tensions and prompted a military buildup in India.
The tipping point occurred on December 3, 1971, when Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on Indian airfields. This act of aggression compelled India to formally enter the war, engaging its Army, Navy, and Air Force in a coordinated response to both the humanitarian crisis and threats to its national sovereignty. Before this, India had adopted a restrained approach, engaging in diplomatic efforts and appealing to West Pakistani leaders to create safe corridors for refugees to return. These appeals were ignored.
THE QUICK END
India’s entry into the 1971 war was driven by the humanitarian crisis and direct threats to its national security. By launching joint military operations with the Mukti Bahini, effective coordination and intelligence sharing were achieved, significantly disrupting Pakistani military efforts. Through a series of strategic offensives, the joint forces rapidly overran West Pakistan’s military presence throughout Dhaka and East Pakistan.
On December 16, 1971, Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi of Pakistan unconditionally surrendered to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India, along with 93,000 troops, marking one of the largest surrenders since World War II. The war officially ended with India’s unilateral ceasefire on December 17.
WHY INDIA’S ENGAGEMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR A JOY BANGLA MOVEMENT
The success of the “Joy Bangla” movement on December 16, 1971, could only be possible with India’s commitment to the cause. With the onset of Operation Searchlight, India opened its borders to refugees, providing massive relief operations while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. Military intervention by India was the last resort.
The military intervention ultimately helped realize the goals of the “Joy Bangla” movement.
Twenty-three years of suppression, from 1947 to 1970, with West Pakistan ruling East Pakistan through military involvement, left the eastern territory with a strong desire for independence, an aspiration difficult to achieve in an economy controlled by West Pakistani industrialists and a polity dominated by a West Pakistan-based military ruler allied with exploitative politicians.
The increasing number of refugees in India proved the fact that there was no internal security structure and local and regional administration available for them to take over the West Pakistan-led apparatus.
Over ten million refugees fled to India in ten months, while thirty million were internally displaced. The refugee headcount included Bengali military wing officials, soldiers, and police personnel. According to the Bangladesh High Commission in London, thousands of families of officials, soldiers, and activists from East Pakistan were interned in West Pakistan. Killings and rapes became daily events of horror to be observed. India’s daily refugee count surged from 17,000 to 60,000, with numbers continuing to rise.
The freedom fighters of East Pakistan had the courage and will to fight for independence, but they lacked the strength of a coordinated war strategy and the full complement of military resources—army, air force, navy, arms, and ammunition—to defeat West Pakistan’s full-fledged military. They had to fight a country’s army that had exposure to past war experiences, something they didn’t have, as East Pakistan was not the war theatre of the 1965 India-Pakistan war. India’s decision to join the war after Pakistan’s attack on Indian territory proved to be the turning point, helping Bangladesh achieve a goal that once seemed unachievable.
Had the Mukti Bahini not received external support, Operation Searchlight could have seriously affected the East Pakistan freedom movement and its hopes to break the colonial shackles of West Pakistan.

Title: Rebels capture Damascus, topple Assad regime after 54 years; President flees to Russia
Publication Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:38:21 +0000
Content: On 27 November, the Syrian rebels launched a lighting offensive on President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. By the 29th, they had captured the city of Aleppo. And Hama a week later. On 8 December, Assad fled and Damascus fell, ending the 54-year rule of Assad and his late father Hafez al-Assad.
The Islamist rebels led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had never had it so good since a civil war erupted in Syria in the year 2011. Until the last week of November, the war in Syria had been mostly dormant for years. The front lines had remained frozen since 2020 but the sudden advance by the rebels has re-ignited fears of renewed sectarian clashes. President Assad and his supporters are followers of an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam called the Alawites. They are in a minority in a Sunni-dominated Syria.
So who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani?
His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa. He was born in the late 1970s or early 1980s. His grandfather was displaced from the Golan Heights when the Israeli Army entered the area. Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move that has not been recognised by the international community. In a 2021 interview to U.S. T.V. channel P.B.S., al-Golani said that his nom de guerre was a reference to his family origins in Syria’s Golan Heights.
As the commander of Al-Qaeda’s franchise in the Syrian civil war, al-Golani was a shadowy figure who kept out of the public eye, even when his group became the most powerful faction fighting President Assad. Today, he is Syria’s most recognisable insurgent, having gradually stepped into the limelight since severing ties to Al-Qaeda in 2016, rebranding his group, and emerging as the de facto ruler of rebel-held north-western Syria.
Joshua Landis from the University of Oklahoma in the U.S. says that al-Golani has been smarter than Assad. “He’s retooled, he’s refashioned, made new allies, and come out with his charm offensive towards minorities.” Aron Lund from the Swedish Defence Research Agency has a slightly nuanced taken on al-Golani. He says that it is P.R. but the fact that al-Golani and the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are engaging in this effort at all, shows they are no longer as rigid as they once were; Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State would have never done that.
Before founding the Al-Nusra Front, al-Golani had fought for Al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he spent five years in a U.S. prison. He returned to Syria once the uprising began. The U.S. designated al-Golani as a terrorist in 2013. As the Islamic State was collapsing, al-Golani cemented the grip of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, establishing a civil administration called the Syrian Salvation Government. In 2016, he announced that his group had cut ties with the Al-Qaeda. The following year, Al-Nusra was dissolved and replaced by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The U.S. and its allies have since designated the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist group. The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years but it faces a challenge convincing Western Governments it has fully renounced hardline jihad.
The rebels led by al-Golani timed their offensive to perfection. They launched their offensive on Aleppo to co-incide with a ceasefire coming into force between Israel and Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. But is there more to the timing of the offensive? Absolutely. For one, Syria’s main backer Russia is pre-occupied in Ukraine. Two, Iran’s influence in the region has diminished. And three, Hezbollah, which had fought alongside Assad’s men against the rebels, has weakened and its leader Hassan Nasrallah dead. So, the regional power balance has been shaken by more than a year of conflict pitting Israel against Iran and the militant groups it supports.
The Iran-backed Hezbollah, in particular, has suffered major blows during more than two months of war with Israel in Lebanon. Hezbollah, which has agreed to a ceasefire with Israel, helped Assad recover Aleppo in 2016.
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan tells C.N.N. that it was no surprise that rebels would try to take advantage of a new situation, what with the Syrian Government’s main backers — Iran, Russia and Hezbollah — distracted and weakened by regional conflicts and the Ukraine war.
That’s not all. Israel has dramatically escalated its airstrikes against Iranian forces stationed on the ground in Syria. The U.N. says that Israel has carried out more than 100 strikes on Syrian territory, killing more than 100 people. The increasing Israeli strikes have put Iranian forces in Syria on the defensive, allowing rebels to exploit a moment where various proxy forces backing Assad are more engaged elsewhere.
Surely, such an offensive would have taken some amount of time and planning. Reuters news agency cites the head of Syria’s main opposition abroad as saying that the rebels began preparations to seize Aleppo a year ago but the operation was delayed by the Gaza war. Turkiye’s Military, which is allied with some of the insurgents and has bases across its southern border in Syria, had heard of the armed groups’ plans but made clear it would play no direct role. However, Turkiye stands to benefit from Assad’s ouster. For one, Syrian refugees would leave Turkiye for Syria. Turkiye has a long border with Syria and has become home to about three million Syrian refugees since 2011. Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was long a supporter of the Syrian opposition after the civil war erupted in 2011.
Before the fall of Damascus to rebels led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syria was divided into several zones of influence with the warring parties backed by different foreign powers.
-The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ruled Syria’s north-west.
-The Kurdish fighters occupied the country’s north and east – east of the Euphrates river.
-Turkiye’s Military and factions loyal to it controlled two sections of the border in the north.
-The U.S. controlled the al-Tanf air base and its surrounding deconfliction zone bordering Iraq and Jordan. A deconfliction zone, as the name suggests, is an area that has been earmarked to avoid a potential clash or accident involving two or more militaries in a particular combat area.
-And the Syrian Government controlled 70 per cent of the country.
The U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters belonging to the Syrian Democratic Forces control lands east of the Euphrates river. The S.D.F. controls large parts of the Raqqa and Deir Ezzor provinces – virtually a quarter of Syrian territory. Formed in 2015, the S.D.F. is the de facto army of the ethnic Kurds but it also has Christian and Muslim fighters in its ranks. The S.D.F. is considered to be the second most powerful military force after the Syrian Army.
Pro-Turkish forces control two sections of the border from Jarabulus to Afrin in Aleppo province as well as a 1 hundred and 20-kilometre stretch of border territory from Ras al-Ain in Hasakeh province to Tal Abyad in Raqqa. The Kurds are present in Turkiye, Syria and Iraq. Turkiye sees the Kurds along its border with Syria as a threat. It sees the S.D.F. as a separatist group. Since 2016, Turkiye has carried out successive ground operations to expel Kurdish forces from parts of Syria’s northern border. Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought to establish a safe zone 30 kilometres deep along the frontier.
Then there are the U.S.-led coalition forces, which entered Syria in 2014 to fight the Islamic State. In 2016, the U.S. set up a remote base in Al-Tanf region, bordering Jordan and Iraq.
Tartus and Latakia were the strongholds of Assad’s Alawite sect. Russia, which joined Syria in its fight against the rebels in 2015, has a Naval facility in Tartus and uses the Hmeimim airbase near Latakia.
