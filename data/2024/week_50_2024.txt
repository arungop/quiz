Title: Rain likely in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR; cold wave to follow from Dec 9: IMD
Publication Date: Sun, 08 Dec 2024 12:40:41 +0000
Content: A western disturbance over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas is expected to bring light to isolated rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR over the next two days, starting Sunday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).  
 
In its latest forecast on Sunday, the IMD also predicted a cold wave across most of Northern India beginning December 9.  
 
Speaking to ANI about the weather conditions in North India and Delhi-NCR, IMD scientist Naresh Kumar stated that temperatures in Delhi-NCR will drop after December 9.  
“A western disturbance persists over central Pakistan and its surrounding areas. Light to moderate rain is expected in the Himalayas today and tomorrow. Light rain is also expected in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi,” Kumar said.  
 
“Temperatures may rise slightly in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR on December 8 and 9. However, after December 9, temperatures will decrease, and cold wave conditions may develop. The cold wave will initially affect Rajasthan, followed by Punjab and Haryana,” he added.  
 
According to an IMD release, cold wave conditions are anticipated in West Rajasthan from December 9 to December 14, while Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, and West Uttar Pradesh are likely to experience cold wave conditions starting December 11. The IMD defines cold wave conditions as a significant drop in temperature compared to the normal climatological values for a given location.  
 
Meanwhile, Delhi residents sought refuge in night shelters set up by the Delhi government amid the inclement weather on Saturday night. Shelters have been established at various locations in the national capital, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin Flyover.  
 
Delhi’s air quality also worsened, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) falling to the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday. The AQI was recorded at 302 at 4 pm.  
 
Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court permitted the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to relax GRAP Stage IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR, downgrading them to GRAP Stage II due to improved air quality. However, GRAP Stages II and I will continue to remain in effect across the region.

Title: RBI hikes interest rates on NRI foreign currency deposits
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:22:03 +0000
Content: The RBI on Friday increased the interest rate ceilings on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank deposits or FCNR (B) deposits which will enable NRIs to earn more on their savings.
The move is aimed at attracting more foreign capital at a time when the Indian rupee has come under pressure as foreign investors have been pulling money out of the Indian stock markets resulting in hot money outflows.
FCNR(B) deposits are accounts where Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can hold their earnings in foreign currencies like USD or GBP, protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations.
“In order to attract more capital inflows, RBI has decided to increase the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) deposits. Accordingly, with effect from today (December 6, 2024), banks are permitted to raise fresh FCNR(B) deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity at rates not exceeding ARR plus 400 bps and deposits with maturity between 3 to 5 years at rates not exceeding ARR plus 500 bps. This relaxation will be available till March 31, 2025,” an RBI statement said.
Until now, interest rates on Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank (FCNR(B)) deposits were subject to ceilings of Overnight Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) for the respective currency/swap, plus 250 basis points for deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years maturity and overnight ARR plus 350 basis points for deposits of 3 years and above and up to 5 years maturity, according to an RBI statement.
Banks have now been allowed to offer higher interest across the tenors.
The RBI has also decided to move ahead with the introduction of the Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR), a benchmark based on the secured money markets.
Financial Benchmarks India Ltd (FBIL) is being requested to take the proposal forward.
The proposal is being taken up in line with the recommendation of the RBI’s Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark.
The Reserve Bank had set up the Committee on the MIBOR Benchmark headed by Ramanathan Subramanian to review the rupee interest rate benchmarks in the country, especially the usage of Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), and to examine the need for transition to new benchmarks. The Committee recommended several important measures to further develop the interest rate derivative market and improve the credibility of interest rate benchmarks. The Report of the Committee was published on the RBI’s website inviting comments from members of the public. The Reserve Bank has examined the recommendations of the Committee as well as the feedback received.
“The other recommendations of the Committee are under consideration,” the RBI statement said.

Title: Turkey, Iran and Russia to meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss Syria, Turkish source says
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 10:05:17 +0000
Content: The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Russia will meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss a lightning rebel advance in Syria, a Turkish diplomatic source said on Friday.
Syrian rebels have made their biggest battlefield gains since the civil war began 13 years ago, striking a devastating blow to President Bashar al-Assad.
After years of being locked behind frozen frontlines, the rebels captured the main northern city of Aleppo last week before pushing as far south as the centre of Hama, taking the strategic central city for the first time.
Turkey, Russia and Iran have regularly held talks on Syria’s future in a trilateral format as part of what is known as the Astana peace process. While NATO member Turkey backs the political and armed opposition, Russia and Iran support Assad.
The source said the three ministers were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Saturday within the framework of the Astana process, but did not provide further information.
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking alongside Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi after their talks in Ankara, said that a new effort would be made to revive the Astana process.
Since the start of the renewed conflict, Ankara has called on Assad to engage with the Syrian people for a political solution. It has denied any involvement in the rebels’ operation and said it did not want to see a new migrant wave heading toward its borders.

Title: FII selling slows in November 2024 as Indian markets stabilize after October fall: report
Publication Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 09:43:17 +0000
Content: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows from Indian markets saw a significant reduction in November 2024, following a steep market correction in October. The Nifty 50 index had experienced a sharp 6 percent decline in October, closing 8 percent lower than its all-time highs. According to a report by JM Financials, this slowdown in FII selling indicates a stabilization in Indian markets.
November proved to be a calmer month for trading, with the benchmark index largely remaining flat. FII activity reflected this stabilization, as the intense selling pressure of October subsided significantly.
FII outflows dropped to Rs 182 billion (USD 2.2 billion) in November, a stark decline from Rs 919 billion (USD 10.9 billion) in October. The month was marked by a significant shift in investor sentiment, with a “tale of two halves.” During the first half of November, FIIs remained net sellers, with outflows of Rs 195 billion (USD 2.3 billion), but by the second half, they turned net buyers, bringing in Rs 13 billion (USD 159 million).
This shift was reinforced in the last seven days of the month, with FIIs recording net inflows of Rs 52.6 billion (USD 619 million).
Sector-wise, FII flows exhibited notable variations. The Oil and Gas sector saw the largest outflows for the second consecutive month, at USD 1.6 billion, followed by the Auto sector with USD 884 million in outflows. Telecom (USD 601 million) and FMCG (USD 167 million) also faced significant selling activity.
In contrast, sectors like Information Technology (IT), Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), and Realty attracted considerable inflows. IT led with inflows of USD 653 million, followed by BFSI at USD 296 million and Realty at USD 244 million. These inflows highlight investor interest in sectors perceived to offer resilience or growth potential.
FII shareholding in Indian equities inched up slightly to 16.1 percent in November 2024, from 16 percent in October, which marked the lowest level in 12 years. However, this figure remains lower year-on-year compared to 16.8 percent in November 2023. FII Equity Assets under Custody (AUC) also showed an improvement, rising to Rs 71.9 trillion at the end of November from Rs 71.1 trillion in October, signaling renewed investor confidence in the Indian market.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis sworn in as Maharashtra Chief Minister
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 13:15:23 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in a grand ceremony held at Azad Maidan, Mumbai. Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath of office to Fadnavis, marking the beginning of his historic new term.
The event was attended by a host of prominent leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Chief Ministers from several states, such as Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Bhupendra Patel (Gujarat), and Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand), also witnessed the occasion.
Adding a touch of glamour to the ceremony, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, and Madhuri Dixit were present to celebrate the political milestone.
Fadnavis, born on July 22, 1970, in Nagpur, comes from a middle-class family. He holds degrees in law, business management, and project management, which have contributed to his astute political acumen. His political journey began in 1992 when he was elected as a councillor in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, a position he held for two consecutive terms before advancing to serve as an MLA for five terms.
From 2014 to 2019, Fadnavis served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, becoming the second-youngest to hold the position after Sharad Pawar. During his tenure, he oversaw major projects, including the Samruddhi Expressway, the Police Digitisation Project, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Scheme, which bolstered the state’s infrastructure and welfare initiatives.
Fadnavis briefly held the Chief Minister’s position during the political turmoil in 2019 when the Shiv Sena broke its alliance with the BJP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government with the Congress and NCP.
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Elections, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a resounding victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while its allies, the Shiv Sena and NCP, secured 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
The MVA alliance suffered a significant defeat, with Congress managing only 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20, and the Sharad Pawar faction of the NCP winning just 10 seats.

Title: EAM Jaishankar reiterates India’s support for two-state solution, explains abstention from UN resolutions on Gaza conflict
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 12:41:22 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, emphasizing the importance of addressing terrorism and hostage-taking in global discourse.
Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Jaishankar defended India’s decision to abstain from certain United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions on the Gaza conflict, stating that these resolutions failed to capture the full scope of the situation.
Jaishankar clarified India’s stance in response to TMC MP Saket Gokhale’s inquiry, asserting, “We support the two-state solution and have been public and unambiguous about it. There should be no confusion regarding our position.”
When asked about the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders, Jaishankar noted that India is not an ICC member. “India decided not to join the ICC after thorough deliberation. Therefore, its decisions are not binding on us, and we have not taken a formal position on this matter,” he said.
The minister also highlighted India’s longstanding humanitarian support for Palestine. He detailed contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), adding a significant increase in annual aid from $1 million to $5 million under the current government. Additionally, he mentioned the provision of over 165 metric tons of medicines and other supplies to Palestine and Lebanon in recent years.
Regarding Israel’s ban on UNRWA, Jaishankar confirmed India’s unwavering commitment to its contributions, saying, “We continue to stand by our decision and have released the latest tranche of support to UNRWA.”
Explaining India’s abstention from some UNGA resolutions, Jaishankar emphasized that these lacked balance and failed to address critical aspects such as the October 7 Hamas attack, terrorism, and hostage-taking. “As a country that has suffered from terrorism, India cannot support resolutions that underplay such acts. Resolutions must be well-drafted, balanced, and reflect the entirety of the situation,” he said.
Jaishankar reiterated India’s condemnation of terrorism and hostage-taking while advocating for adherence to humanitarian law and minimizing civilian casualties. He stressed India’s call for a ceasefire and an end to violence in the region, adding that India’s position remains consistent and principled.
The Gaza conflict escalated after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting a large-scale Israeli counter-offensive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first global leaders to condemn Hamas’ actions, while also urging for a ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages. India continues to advocate for the two-state solution as the pathway to resolving the long-standing conflict.

Title: The fight for joy Bangla: How India helped Bangladesh achieve independence
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 10:22:10 +0000
Content: Pakistan, created in 1947 after the partition of British India, was a nation seemingly destined for further division. Many analysts considered it a geographical absurdity, a loose amalgamation of two separate territories 1,000 miles apart. Beyond sharing a Muslim majority, West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) had little in common.
One of the most significant differences between the two regions was language, which became a major source of identity problems and fuelled Bengali nationalism among the people of East Pakistan.
While people in West Pakistan spoke Urdu, the main language in East Pakistan was Bengali. In December 1947, students at the University of Dhaka protested, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of Pakistan’s official languages. This marked the beginning of the language war between East and West Pakistan. Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, responded by visiting Dhaka in March 1948 to deliver a stern message: Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. Moreover, leaders who spoke Bengali in the East Pakistan assembly were warned they could be tried for treason. Ultimately, West Pakistan imposed Urdu as the sole national language across both regions.
In response, the Bhasha Andolan (Language Movement) began in East Pakistan in 1952. This movement witnessed the deaths of many activists, politicians, and civilians due to atrocities committed by the West Pakistan-led regional regime. A key outcome of the language movement was the establishment of the Awami League in 1955, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
In 1956, Pakistan was established as an Islamic Republic with a new constitution. The country that year accepted Urdu and Bengali as official languages. In 1958, a military coup led by General Muhammad Ayub Khan abrogated that constitution.
The other big difference between the West and East Pakistan was the culture being followed by its people. Speaking a different language than West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan followed a single ethnicity, Bengali, with a rich past. On the other hand, West Pakistan was a societal mix of people from different origins, including Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Pashtun people from its border areas, the North-West Frontier Province. Culturally, the people in East Pakistan had a stronger sense of belongingness than those in West Pakistan.
Despite these big differences, there could have been a united Pakistan based on religious similarity if both territories were treated equally by the country’s political leadership. However, the united Pakistan failed miserably here. The two territories, separated by a thousand miles, with different languages spoken and cultures followed, were ruled by a unilateral political leadership from West Pakistan.
The top political lineage under Jinnah that united Pakistan followed was largely from West Pakistan only. Also, its military wing leadership, the army, the air force, and the navy were based in West Pakistan only.
These disparities manifested in the repercussions felt by East Pakistan from 1947 until its liberation in 1971 as Bangladesh. The West Pakistani leadership treated East Pakistan as a colony, extracting benefits while denying it the rights and resources it deserved.
EAST PAKISTAN WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WEST PAKISTAN
According to the 1951 Pakistan Census, East Pakistan had a population of 42 million, exceeding West Pakistan’s 33.7 million. Geographically, East Pakistan was a riverine territory with ample rainfall, making it more prosperous. Its fertile and productive lands stood in contrast to West Pakistan, which, aside from Punjab, was largely dry with barren areas.
Moreover, a study titled “The Struggle in Bangladesh,” published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, indicates that in the initial years, East Pakistan’s GDP surpassed that of West Pakistan. Educationally, East Pakistan also had an advantage.

Initially, in 1949–50, East Pakistan’s GDP was 13,130 million rupees, more than West Pakistan’s 11,830 million rupees. In education, East Pakistan had 29,633 primary schools in 1947, compared to just 8,413 in West Pakistan. Similarly, East Pakistan had 50 colleges, while West Pakistan had 40.
WEST PAKISTAN’S COLONY
Despite East Pakistan’s higher GDP, better educational levels, and stable cultural heritage, data analysis reveals that West Pakistan monopolized industrialization and other benefits by installing a lame-duck government in East Pakistan.
East Pakistan was the primary source of jute, united Pakistan’s key export commodity. Logistically, industrial units for cotton textiles should have been developed there, but the country’s leadership chose to establish them in West Pakistan. Economic institutions and infrastructure developments, such as seaports, railways, and roads essential for promoting industrial growth further, were largely concentrated in West Pakistan only.
Conversely, East Pakistan experienced limited development, primarily aimed at supporting industries located in West Pakistan, according to the study. Furthermore, most industries in East Pakistan were developed by industrialists based in West Pakistan. Just 11% of industries were owned by Bengalis, making East Pakistan a labour hub for West Pakistan.
The deteriorating situation of East Pakistan over the next two decades reflects this exploitation. While East Pakistan was once more prosperous than West Pakistan, by 1970, the situation had reversed entirely.

Data from the study reveal that by 1968–69, West Pakistan’s GDP exceeded East Pakistan’s by 34%, and its per capita income was 62% higher. In united Pakistan’s first and second Five-Year Plans, 68% of the allocations went to West Pakistan, slightly reduced to 64% in the third plan. Pakistan’s economy largely depended on foreign assistance, of which 70% to 80% benefited West Pakistan. Although East Pakistan contributed up to 70% of Pakistan’s export earnings, 75% of imports were directed to West Pakistan.
CALL FOR SELF-DETERMINATION
These factors, language suppression, cultural differences, economic exploitation, mass arrests, killings, disappearances, and colonial treatment, left East Pakistanis facing an uncertain future after two decades of hostility.
In the 1954 regional elections, a coalition known as the United Front defeated the Muslim League, which had been based in West Pakistan and had ruled East Pakistan until then. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League presented his Six-Point Charter to the then-military ruler of Pakistan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, demanding autonomy and greater control over East Pakistan’s economic affairs. These Six Points became central to Bengali nationalism and eventually transformed into a liberation movement following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.
1970 PAKISTAN ELECTION: A TURNING POINT – EAST PAKISTAN’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
Pakistan conducted its first general election on December 7, 1970, which is regarded as the most transparent election in the country’s history, according to Geo News, a major Pakistani news platform. The main contenders were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), based in West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League, based in East Pakistan. The Awami League achieved a landslide victory, winning 170 seats, while the PPP secured only 81.
Despite the Awami League’s clear mandate to govern all of Pakistan, the country’s military ruler, General Yahya Khan, and the PPP’s Bhutto opposed this outcome. They dismissed the election results and imposed martial law, denying the Awami League its rightful leadership.
This action led to widespread protests and riots in East Pakistan. In response, Sheikh Mujib initiated a civil disobedience movement. On March 7, 1971, the Awami League mobilized 50,000 Bengalis to start a peaceful protest in Dhaka. However, on March 25, 1971, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and airlifted to West Pakistan with the launch of Operation Searchlight.
OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT
Following Sheikh Mujib’s declaration of independence for East Pakistan, West Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on Bengalis. Operation Searchlight, initiated by West Pakistan on March 25, 1971, stands as one of the most horrific state-run military operations in history. According to various investigative estimates, including the Russian newspaper Pravda, approximately 3 million East Pakistanis were murdered by Pakistani troops and supporting militias.
In the 1970 general election, West Pakistan-based parties failed to win any seats in East Pakistan, underscoring the widespread support for the Awami League and its pro-independence stance among civilians, police, and security forces in East Pakistan. Consequently, West Pakistan’s troops and supporting radical militias targeted these Bengali-speaking populations across the region.
Deploying hundreds of thousands of troops across Dhaka and throughout East Bengal, supported by air and naval power, the main targets were Awami League politicians, military personnel, East Bengal police, and Bengali-speaking civilians.
An analytical report published in the Dhaka Tribune indicates that one of Operation Searchlight’s objectives was to disarm and arrest Bengali soldiers and policemen serving in East Pakistan. Another aim was to attack Hindu-majority areas of Dhaka. On the night of March 25, 1971, casualty figures in Dhaka alone reached approximately 35,000.
During the nine months of the operation, hundreds of thousands of Bengali women were subjected to rape. According to a report in the Smithsonian, around 400,000 women underwent late-term abortions, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.
REFUGEES IN INDIA
The brutal crackdown compelled millions of Bangladeshis to flee to India. By May 1971, India was hosting 1.5 million refugees, a number that swelled to around 10 million by December 1971, making it the largest refugee crisis in the modern world. Internally, the military operation displaced approximately 30 million people within Bangladesh.
This massive influx placed a significant burden on India. Nevertheless, the country stepped forward to assist, despite lacking domestic laws to manage refugees and not being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. India established 825 refugee camps across seven states, with 19 central camps capable of accommodating up to 50,000 refugees each.
ECONOMIC BURDEN
The economic burden was significant. India had to reassess its Fourth Five-Year Plan. The 1971–72 Budget stated, “The country’s resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained by developments across the border, the influx of nearly ten million refugees and the outbreak of hostilities in December 1971.” 1 Despite these challenges, the economy responded effectively, as noted in the budget document.  
A World Bank assessment, based on 9 million refugees, estimated the direct cost to India at approximately US$700 million from April 1, 1971, to March 31, 1972, which equates to around US$5.5 billion today. India managed this expenditure largely through internal resources. According to a CIA document from March 1972, released in 2010, the Indian government spent about 4% of its planned central government expenditure for FY1971 on refugee care.
INDIA’S STAND
India supported Sheikh Mujib’s call for independence but initially refrained from participating in the war. Instead, it provided moral and material support to the independence movement. On April 17, 1971, a provisional government of Bangladesh was formed and relocated to Calcutta as the “Bangladesh Government in Exile.”
Meanwhile, the freedom fighters of East Pakistan formed the Mukti Bahini, an armed resistance movement against the West Pakistani military and supporting militias. Comprising members of the Bengali military, paramilitary forces, police, and civilians, these fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare.
India’s support bolstered their efforts. The geographical separation of 1,000 miles of Indian territory between West and East Pakistan meant that Pakistan could not easily reinforce its military presence in East Pakistan with additional air and naval power.
West Pakistan had previously exhibited hostility towards India, notably in the conflicts of 1947 and the 1965 war, which it lost. Its actions in East Pakistan heightened diplomatic tensions and prompted a military buildup in India.
The tipping point occurred on December 3, 1971, when Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on Indian airfields. This act of aggression compelled India to formally enter the war, engaging its Army, Navy, and Air Force in a coordinated response to both the humanitarian crisis and threats to its national sovereignty. Before this, India had adopted a restrained approach, engaging in diplomatic efforts and appealing to West Pakistani leaders to create safe corridors for refugees to return. These appeals were ignored.
THE QUICK END
India’s entry into the 1971 war was driven by the humanitarian crisis and direct threats to its national security. By launching joint military operations with the Mukti Bahini, effective coordination and intelligence sharing were achieved, significantly disrupting Pakistani military efforts. Through a series of strategic offensives, the joint forces rapidly overran West Pakistan’s military presence throughout Dhaka and East Pakistan.
On December 16, 1971, Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi of Pakistan unconditionally surrendered to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India, along with 93,000 troops, marking one of the largest surrenders since World War II. The war officially ended with India’s unilateral ceasefire on December 17.
WHY INDIA’S ENGAGEMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR A JOY BANGLA MOVEMENT
The success of the “Joy Bangla” movement on December 16, 1971, could only be possible with India’s commitment to the cause. With the onset of Operation Searchlight, India opened its borders to refugees, providing massive relief operations while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. Military intervention by India was the last resort.
The military intervention ultimately helped realize the goals of the “Joy Bangla” movement.
Twenty-three years of suppression, from 1947 to 1970, with West Pakistan ruling East Pakistan through military involvement, left the eastern territory with a strong desire for independence, an aspiration difficult to achieve in an economy controlled by West Pakistani industrialists and a polity dominated by a West Pakistan-based military ruler allied with exploitative politicians.
The increasing number of refugees in India proved the fact that there was no internal security structure and local and regional administration available for them to take over the West Pakistan-led apparatus.
Over ten million refugees fled to India in ten months, while thirty million were internally displaced. The refugee headcount included Bengali military wing officials, soldiers, and police personnel. According to the Bangladesh High Commission in London, thousands of families of officials, soldiers, and activists from East Pakistan were interned in West Pakistan. Killings and rapes became daily events of horror to be observed. India’s daily refugee count surged from 17,000 to 60,000, with numbers continuing to rise.
The freedom fighters of East Pakistan had the courage and will to fight for independence, but they lacked the strength of a coordinated war strategy and the full complement of military resources—army, air force, navy, arms, and ammunition—to defeat West Pakistan’s full-fledged military. They had to fight a country’s army that had exposure to past war experiences, something they didn’t have, as East Pakistan was not the war theatre of the 1965 India-Pakistan war. India’s decision to join the war after Pakistan’s attack on Indian territory proved to be the turning point, helping Bangladesh achieve a goal that once seemed unachievable.
Had the Mukti Bahini not received external support, Operation Searchlight could have seriously affected the East Pakistan freedom movement and its hopes to break the colonial shackles of West Pakistan.

Title: Devendra Fadnavis set to be sworn in today as Maharashtra CM, Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar Deputy CMs
Publication Date: Thu, 05 Dec 2024 04:45:20 +0000
Content: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis will take oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on Thursday in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde along with NCP’s Ajit Pawar will take the oath as Deputy Chief Ministers in the new cabinet, sources said.
The oath-taking ceremony will take place at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan and will see the participation of several NDA Chief Ministers and leaders. Ending the long-drawn suspense over who would get the top job, Fadnavis, Shinde, and Pawar met Governor CP Radhakrishnan to stake their claim to form the MahaYuti government.
After meeting the Governor, Fadnavis said, “The swearing-in ceremony of the new government will be held tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I met Eknath Shinde and requested him to join us in this government, as it is the wish of MahaYuti workers…We will fulfill the promises made to the people of Maharashtra.”
It will be Fadnavis’ third term in the top post after being unanimously elected as the Leader of the Maharashtra BJP Legislative Party on Wednesday. The decision came after days of speculation and political manoeuvring as Eknath Shinde wanted to become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. However, the BJP, refused to budge and later, Shinde said he would back PM Modi’s pick.
Meanwhile, Eknath Shinde on Wednesday expressed his satisfaction with the two-and a-half years of the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, ahead of the swearing-in of Fadnavis as Chief Minister.
“I am very happy with the completion of two-and-a-half years. The work done by our government–the MahaYuti government–by the three of us and our team in the last 2.5 years is remarkable. It will be written in golden letters in history. We are proud to have taken such significant decisions,” said Shinde.
Shinde was accompanied by Fadnavis and NCP chief Ajit Pawar at a press conference. Addressing the media, Pawar emphasised their commitment to effective governance. “We will leave no stone unturned in running the government. Party activities will be managed by BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and NCP’s Sunil Tatkare,” he said.
There was also some light-hearted banter during the press conference. Asked whether he and Ajit Pawar would take oath on December 5 as Fadnavis’ deputies, Shinde said, “Wait till evening…” Pawar, in response to Shinde’s reply, said, “Sham tak unka samaj aayega (We will know about Shinde by evening), I will take it (oath), I will not wait.”
Shinde then said, “Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking (oath) both in the morning and evening.” This elicted laughter from all those present at the press conference. In the year 2019, Pawar had taken oath as the Deputy Chief Minister with Fadnavis as the Chief Minister in an early morning ceremony at Raj Bhavan.
The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election witnessed a resounding victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide win with 235 seats out of 288. The results marked a significant milestone for the BJP, which emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats. The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party also recorded notable gains, securing 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
While, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a major setback with Congress winning just 16 seats. Its alliance partner, Shiv Sena (UBT), won 20 seats, while the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) secured only 10 seats.

Title: RBI raises UPI lite wallet limit to Rs 5,000
Publication Date: Wed, 04 Dec 2024 17:08:49 +0000
Content: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the wallet limit for UPI Lite from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000. The new guidelines, announced on Wednesday, also raised the upper transaction limit under the offline framework from ₹500 to ₹1,000 per transaction.
According to the RBI’s circular, the revised limits are effective immediately, enabling users to make higher-value transactions conveniently while maintaining the simplicity and security of UPI Lite. “The enhanced limits for UPI Lite shall be ₹1,000 per transaction, with ₹5,000 being the total limit at any point in time,” the circular said.
Previously, the offline framework permitted a maximum of ₹500 per transaction and a total limit of ₹2,000 for payment instruments. The updated framework is expected to streamline digital payments for day-to-day purchases and provide a more robust and inclusive digital payment experience for consumers.
The RBI clarified that the changes have been implemented under the authority of Section 18, read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. This initiative aligns with the central bank’s ongoing efforts to promote digital transactions while ensuring ease of use and enhanced security for consumers.
Earlier, in October 2024, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had announced an increase in transaction limits for UPI services during the monetary policy briefing, emphasizing the growing importance of digital payment platforms in India’s economy.
The updated limits come at a time when Unified Payments Interface (UPI) continues to set milestones in the digital payment space. In October 2024, UPI achieved a record-breaking 16.58 billion financial transactions in a single month.
Since its launch in 2016 by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI has revolutionized the country’s payment system, integrating multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application for seamless fund transfers, peer-to-peer transactions, and merchant payments.
