Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 on Monday (November 25) at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital. The event will be attended by representatives from over 100 countries.
This marks the first time in the 130-year history of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) that both the ICA Global Cooperative Conference and the ICA General Assembly are being organized in India, which is the premier body for the global cooperative movement.
The Global Conference, hosted by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in collaboration with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives AMUL and KRIBHCO, will take place from November 25-30.
The theme of the conference, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” aligns with the Indian government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The event will feature discussions, panel sessions, and workshops focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities faced by cooperatives worldwide, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These discussions will touch on areas such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth.
Prime Minister Modi will also launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, which will focus on the theme “Cooperatives Build a Better World.” This initiative will highlight the transformative role cooperatives play in promoting social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development.
The UN SDGs recognize cooperatives as crucial drivers of sustainable development, especially in reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and alleviating poverty. The year 2025 will showcase the power of cooperative enterprises in addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges.
As part of the event, the Prime Minister will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s commitment to the cooperative movement. The stamp features a lotus, symbolizing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, all reflective of the cooperative values of sustainability and community development.
The five petals of the lotus represent the five elements of nature (Panchatatva), highlighting cooperatives’ dedication to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The design also incorporates sectors like agriculture, dairy, fisheries, consumer cooperatives, and housing, with a drone symbolizing the role of modern technology in agriculture.
Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica, and around 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries will also participate in the event.

Soren confirmed the date of the oath-taking ceremony while addressing the media on Sunday, stating, “On 28 November, the oath ceremony of the new government will take place.”
Earlier, Soren tendered his resignation as Chief Minister to Governor Santosh Gangwar and staked a claim to form the next government at the Raj Bhawan. “Today, we have started the procedure to form the INDIA alliance government and, as part of this process, we have staked our claim to form the government in front of the Governor. I also tendered my resignation… Congress and the RJD in-charge were also present here,” Soren said.
Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay added that Soren had been elected as the leader of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. “All party workers and leaders extended their support, and Hemant Soren was chosen as the leader of the Jharkhand Assembly House… the tentative date for the oath-taking is 28th,” Sahay stated.
The JMM, under Soren’s leadership, led the INDIA alliance to a decisive victory in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, securing 56 seats. Of these, JMM won 34 seats, while its allies Congress, RJD, and CPI-ML secured 16, 4, and 2 seats respectively.
In contrast, the BJP-led NDA alliance garnered only 24 seats, with the BJP securing 21 seats and its allies—the AJSU Party, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), and JD-U—winning one seat each.

Title: Gujarat’s heritage sites attract over 21 lakh tourists in 2023-24
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:48:02 +0000
Content: Gujarat, renowned for its cultural and historical legacy, has become a prime destination for tourists, both domestic and international, with its heritage sites leading the way.
According to the Gujarat Tourism Department, more than 21 lakh tourists visited the state’s major heritage sites in the year 2023-24. To further enhance these sites, the Gujarat government has invested over Rs 428 crore in development projects aimed at improving tourism facilities across the state.
In celebration of World Heritage Week, which is observed globally from November 19 to November 25, UNESCO highlights the significance of preserving cultural and historical heritage. In India, the Archaeological Survey of India partners with various institutions to organize events at historical sites, emphasizing the theme for 2024, “Discover and Experiencing Diversity.”
Under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat has focused on making its heritage sites more attractive and accessible to tourists. Notable investments include Rs 255 crore for tourism-friendly facilities at Vadnagar and Dholavira.
Vadnagar, the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has seen remarkable growth in visitor numbers. The state government has spent Rs 70 crore over three years to modernize the site’s infrastructure. As a result, the number of visitors to Vadnagar has surged nearly threefold, from 2.4 lakh in 2022-23 to approximately 7 lakh in 2023-24.
Similarly, Dholavira, a UNESCO World Heritage Site representing the Indus Valley Civilization, has been the recipient of substantial development funding. The Gujarat government has earmarked Rs 185 crore for tourism projects at Dholavira, with Phase 1 investments of Rs 76 crore already underway. Visitor numbers at Dholavira have more than doubled, from 1.41 lakh in 2022-23 to over 2.32 lakh in 2023-24.
The state’s renowned heritage sites, including the Sun Temple at Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav, have also seen increased popularity. To improve the tourism infrastructure at these locations, the government has invested Rs 20 crore, Rs 18 crore, and Rs 5 crore, respectively. These sites experienced a rise in tourist footfall, with Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav seeing increases in visitors from 3.78 lakh, 3.52 lakh, and 3.72 lakh in 2022-23 to 3.81 lakh, 3.83 lakh, and 3.86 lakh in 2023-24.
In addition to developing tourism infrastructure, Gujarat is focusing on the restoration of historical forts. Notable projects include the Rs 74 crore restoration of Uparkot Fort, Rs 21 crore for the restoration of Rajmahal in Amreli, and Rs 25 crore allocated for Lakhpat Fort.
On World Tourism Day 2024, the Government of India recognized Hafeshwar village in Gujarat as the Best Tourism Village in the heritage category. To further enhance the village’s tourism appeal, the Gujarat government plans to invest Rs 10 crore in additional tourism facilities.

Title: “Govt ready to discuss any topic, only request is House should run well”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:40:44 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, emphasized that the government is “ready to discuss any topic” in the upcoming winter session of Parliament, but stressed the importance of a peaceful and productive session.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday after the all-party meeting in Delhi, Rijiju said that numerous topics had been raised for discussion as the winter session is set to commence tomorrow. “A total of 42 leaders from 30 political parties were present in the meeting. There are many topics, and everyone has asked for discussions on various issues. However, we want a meaningful discussion in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The government is ready to discuss any topic, but our only request is that the House should function smoothly without disruptions. We need everyone’s cooperation for the smooth running of the session,” Rijiju said.
The minister also highlighted that there will be no parliamentary session on November 26 in observance of Constitution Day. “The session will begin tomorrow, but there will be no proceedings on November 26 as we celebrate Constitution Day. The 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution will be marked at the Constitution House with members of both Houses. President Droupadi Murmu will address the gathering, and we will release significant documents related to the Constitution,” Rijiju added.
Rijiju explained that since 2015, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Constitution Day has been celebrated annually to honor the document’s importance. “Many people are unaware of the processes involved in the creation of the Constitution. The book we are releasing is not just a book; it contains important photographs and descriptions. We must make an effort to spread awareness of the Constitution’s significance to the public,” he said.
Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, speaking after the meeting, urged for a discussion on the Adani Group’s indictment by the US Justice Department in a bribery case. “Congress has requested that the matter be discussed first in Parliament. The US court has taken cognizance of the fact that the Adani Group is not only controlling the industry but also influencing the government, with a bribe of Rs 2,300 crore involved. This is a serious issue and should be addressed promptly,” Tiwari said.
Tiwari also expressed concern over the ongoing situation in Manipur, criticizing the government’s handling of the state. “We raised the issue of Manipur and the fact that the Chief Minister (Biren Singh) has not been removed, and the Prime Minister has not visited the state. This neglect has contributed to the violence, including rapes and murders, in the region,” he said.
Additionally, Tiwari called for a statement from Prime Minister Modi in Parliament to clarify the situation regarding disengagement on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “There have been talks of disengagement on the LAC, and it is crucial that the government provide clarity on this issue in Parliament. Other pressing matters such as unemployment and pollution should also be discussed, as these issues are deeply affecting the country,” Tiwari added.
The all-party meeting was attended by floor leaders from various political parties, including Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari, K. Suresh, and JD(U) MP Upendra Kushwaha, among others. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 25 and continue until December 20.

Title: IPL 2025 Auction: Shreyas Iyer sold to PBKS for record-breaking bid of Rs 26.75 cr
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:17:37 +0000
Content: Former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain and IPL 2024-winning leader Shreyas Iyer was sold to Punjab Kings (PBKS) for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore, the highest-ever bid in the history of the IPL, during the IPL 2024 Auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah on Sunday.
With a base price of Rs 2 crore, KKR wasted no time in making the first bid for their former leader. However, Punjab Kings quickly joined the fray, pushing the price up to Rs 2.20 crore.
As the price surged to Rs 5 crore, it became a two-horse race between KKR and PBKS. The tension mounted as KKR pushed their bid to Rs 7.25 crore, but in a dramatic twist, Delhi Capitals (DC) entered the bidding with a Rs 7.50 crore offer. DC raised the stakes to Rs 10 crore, but the bid climbed steadily as PBKS and DC traded blows, reaching Rs 13.50 crore, then Rs 16 crore, and eventually Rs 20 crore.
At Rs 22 crore, PBKS seemed determined, but DC countered with Rs 22.50 crore. PBKS responded by pushing the bid to Rs 24.75 crore, only for DC to raise it to Rs 25 crore, making Iyer officially the most expensive player in the league’s history.
However, PBKS retaliated with Rs 26.25 crore, and after some final back-and-forth, they secured Iyer for Rs 26.75 crore, making him a marquee player for the team.
Punjab Kings entered the auction with the highest purse of Rs 110.5 crore, having retained just two players—Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh—before the event.
Earlier, Punjab Kings acquired India pacer Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore using their Right to Match (RTM) card. Kagiso Rabada was next on the list, with Gujarat Titans securing him for Rs 10.75 crore. GT entered the auction with a purse of Rs 69 crore, after retaining Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan.

Title: Stocks in India likely to react to assembly poll results and fund flows for fresh cues
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:57:14 +0000
Content: Domestic stock markets are poised to react on Monday to the outcomes of recent state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, alongside key domestic macroeconomic data and trends in foreign institutional investor (FII) fund flows, according to market analysts.
The bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting scheduled for early December is also expected to influence investor sentiment, as analysts anticipate a 25-basis-point rate cut amid concerns over slowing economic growth and moderating inflation.
The last trading session brought much-needed relief to investors after weeks of corrections. Despite a largely negative sentiment throughout the week due to persistent FII selling, Friday witnessed a sharp recovery driven by bargain hunting in index heavyweights, helping the Nifty and Sensex end near their highs. Both indices gained nearly 2 percent, closing at 23,907.20 and 79,117.10, respectively.
“Markets will initially react to the outcomes of the Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections. Additionally, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and infrastructure output will garner significant attention. Participants are keeping a close watch on FII fund flows, given the ongoing selling spree,” said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.
Manish Goel, Founder and MD of Equentis, noted that the upcoming MPC meeting from December 4-6 is generating significant interest. “Investors are cautiously optimistic about a 25-bps rate cut, which could help address concerns over slowing growth and inflation. However, the week ahead is likely to witness heightened volatility as markets navigate political uncertainties, economic data releases, and corporate developments,” he said.
Despite the recovery, market momentum remains uncertain. Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said, “The sharp rebound in the market this week is encouraging, but it remains to be seen how long this momentum can be sustained. Factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing Middle East tensions, and the results of critical state elections could all have an impact in the coming week.”
Sectors such as real estate, auto, and FMCG led the rebound, while IT and banking were instrumental in capping losses and supporting the recovery. Broader indices also posted gains between 0.9 and 1.8 percent.
However, FIIs continued their selling spree, marking the third consecutive week of outflows in November. According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE), foreign investors sold equities worth ₹11,412 crore this week, taking the total net selling in November to ₹41,872 crore. Persistent outflows have added to market volatility and weighed on investor sentiment.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided critical support to the markets, purchasing equities worth ₹11,035 crore this week. Their total net buying for November stands at ₹37,559 crore, cushioning the impact of FII outflows.
Despite global and domestic challenges, analysts remain optimistic about India’s long-term growth potential. “India’s structural growth story remains intact despite short-term market fluctuations,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research.

Title: 19 agritech soonicorns, 40 minicorns embracing emerging tech for business growth: RBI paper
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:46:04 +0000
Content: The Indian agritech sector shows immense potential to bridge the technological gap in agriculture, with 19 agritech soonicorns and 40 minicorns leveraging emerging technologies like AI and innovative business models, according to a new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) paper.
While only one unicorn has been identified in India’s agritech landscape, the total number of soonicorns (startups on the verge of becoming unicorns) and minicorns (early-stage startups) is estimated at 19 and 40, respectively, stated the paper titled “Agri-Tech Startups and Innovations in Indian Agriculture” by D. Suganthi, Jobin Sebastian, and Monika Sethi.
A survey of agritech startups highlighted their reliance on government funding support, research and development, and state-backed digital infrastructure for growth.
India’s agritech ecosystem has witnessed a surge in investor interest, with investments increasing from $370 million in 2019 to $1.25 billion in 2021. However, investor interest moderated after 2021, in line with global trends.
Globally, funding for agritech companies peaked at $10.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 but sharply declined to $5.2 billion in 2023.
“In terms of funding share, the US leads with 43.2 per cent, followed by China (14.4 per cent), Canada (12 per cent), and India (8.5 per cent). This indicates that the Indian agritech ecosystem has garnered a significant share of global funding,” the paper noted.
The central government is promoting agripreneurship and innovation by reducing regulatory barriers, developing innovation-driven infrastructure, and fostering active collaboration among entrepreneurs.
“It plays a significant role in building a robust ecosystem for nurturing innovation and facilitating agritech mainstreaming by developing an agri-stack,” the paper emphasized.
Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, remote sensing, biotechnology, drones, robotics, and automation are being adopted by several agritech startups.
Government initiatives such as Digital India, Make in India, startup funds, and accelerator and incubator programs have been instrumental in accelerating the growth of agritech startups, particularly during the pandemic.
However, the paper cautioned that despite the progress made, agritech startups in India face significant challenges in scaling up their operations. The sustainability of these startups depends on the adoption of modern technologies by farmers.
“Key challenges hindering growth include insufficient funding, fragmented landholdings, and the longer time required to achieve revenue generation,” it added.

Title: Scientists decode brain activity to help treat anxiety and depression
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:32:00 +0000
Content: A team of scientists has uncovered new regions of the brain that support social interactions and are in constant communication with the ancient amygdala region—a discovery that could help treat psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression.
In a study conducted by Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine in the US, and published in the journal Science Advances, scientists sought to better understand how humans evolved to become highly skilled at interpreting what’s happening in other people’s minds.
“We spend a lot of time wondering, ‘What is that person feeling, thinking? Did I say something to upset them?’” said senior author Rodrigo Braga.
The brain regions that enable these abilities are part of the human brain’s more recently evolved areas, suggesting that this skill is a relatively new development in evolutionary terms.
“In essence, you’re putting yourself in someone else’s mind and making inferences about what that person is thinking when you cannot really know,” Braga explained.
The study found that the advanced parts of the human brain supporting social interactions—known as the social cognitive network—are connected to and in constant communication with the ancient amygdala.
Often referred to as the “lizard brain,” the amygdala is typically associated with detecting threats and processing fear.
“The amygdala is responsible for social behaviours like parenting, mating, aggression, and navigating social-dominance hierarchies,” Braga said. While earlier studies have observed co-activation of the amygdala and the social cognitive network, Braga noted that “our study is novel because it shows the communication is always happening.”
Within the amygdala, a specific region called the medial nucleus plays a critical role in social behaviours.
This study is the first to show that the medial nucleus of the amygdala is directly connected to newly evolved regions of the social cognitive network, which are involved in thinking about other people.
This connection allows the social cognitive network to access the amygdala’s role in processing emotionally significant content, the researchers explained.
Both anxiety and depression are linked to hyperactivity in the amygdala, which can lead to excessive emotional responses and impaired emotional regulation.
The study’s findings suggest that less-invasive treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), could potentially use this new knowledge of brain connections to improve treatment outcomes, the authors noted.
