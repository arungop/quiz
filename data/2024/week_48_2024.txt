Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 on Monday (November 25) at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital. The event will be attended by representatives from over 100 countries.
This marks the first time in the 130-year history of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) that both the ICA Global Cooperative Conference and the ICA General Assembly are being organized in India, which is the premier body for the global cooperative movement.
The Global Conference, hosted by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in collaboration with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives AMUL and KRIBHCO, will take place from November 25-30.
The theme of the conference, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” aligns with the Indian government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The event will feature discussions, panel sessions, and workshops focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities faced by cooperatives worldwide, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These discussions will touch on areas such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth.
Prime Minister Modi will also launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, which will focus on the theme “Cooperatives Build a Better World.” This initiative will highlight the transformative role cooperatives play in promoting social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development.
The UN SDGs recognize cooperatives as crucial drivers of sustainable development, especially in reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and alleviating poverty. The year 2025 will showcase the power of cooperative enterprises in addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges.
As part of the event, the Prime Minister will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s commitment to the cooperative movement. The stamp features a lotus, symbolizing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, all reflective of the cooperative values of sustainability and community development.
The five petals of the lotus represent the five elements of nature (Panchatatva), highlighting cooperatives’ dedication to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The design also incorporates sectors like agriculture, dairy, fisheries, consumer cooperatives, and housing, with a drone symbolizing the role of modern technology in agriculture.
Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica, and around 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries will also participate in the event.

Soren confirmed the date of the oath-taking ceremony while addressing the media on Sunday, stating, “On 28 November, the oath ceremony of the new government will take place.”
Earlier, Soren tendered his resignation as Chief Minister to Governor Santosh Gangwar and staked a claim to form the next government at the Raj Bhawan. “Today, we have started the procedure to form the INDIA alliance government and, as part of this process, we have staked our claim to form the government in front of the Governor. I also tendered my resignation… Congress and the RJD in-charge were also present here,” Soren said.
Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay added that Soren had been elected as the leader of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. “All party workers and leaders extended their support, and Hemant Soren was chosen as the leader of the Jharkhand Assembly House… the tentative date for the oath-taking is 28th,” Sahay stated.
The JMM, under Soren’s leadership, led the INDIA alliance to a decisive victory in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, securing 56 seats. Of these, JMM won 34 seats, while its allies Congress, RJD, and CPI-ML secured 16, 4, and 2 seats respectively.
In contrast, the BJP-led NDA alliance garnered only 24 seats, with the BJP securing 21 seats and its allies—the AJSU Party, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), and JD-U—winning one seat each.
In addition, Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha, a smaller party, secured a seat with Jairam Kumar Mahato winning in the Dumri constituency.
The JMM-led alliance retained power in Jharkhand following the assembly elections, which were held in two phases on November 13 and November 20.

Title: Gujarat’s heritage sites attract over 21 lakh tourists in 2023-24
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:48:02 +0000
Content: Gujarat, renowned for its cultural and historical legacy, has become a prime destination for tourists, both domestic and international, with its heritage sites leading the way.
According to the Gujarat Tourism Department, more than 21 lakh tourists visited the state’s major heritage sites in the year 2023-24. To further enhance these sites, the Gujarat government has invested over Rs 428 crore in development projects aimed at improving tourism facilities across the state.
In celebration of World Heritage Week, which is observed globally from November 19 to November 25, UNESCO highlights the significance of preserving cultural and historical heritage. In India, the Archaeological Survey of India partners with various institutions to organize events at historical sites, emphasizing the theme for 2024, “Discover and Experiencing Diversity.”
Under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat has focused on making its heritage sites more attractive and accessible to tourists. Notable investments include Rs 255 crore for tourism-friendly facilities at Vadnagar and Dholavira.
Vadnagar, the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has seen remarkable growth in visitor numbers. The state government has spent Rs 70 crore over three years to modernize the site’s infrastructure. As a result, the number of visitors to Vadnagar has surged nearly threefold, from 2.4 lakh in 2022-23 to approximately 7 lakh in 2023-24.
Similarly, Dholavira, a UNESCO World Heritage Site representing the Indus Valley Civilization, has been the recipient of substantial development funding. The Gujarat government has earmarked Rs 185 crore for tourism projects at Dholavira, with Phase 1 investments of Rs 76 crore already underway. Visitor numbers at Dholavira have more than doubled, from 1.41 lakh in 2022-23 to over 2.32 lakh in 2023-24.
The state’s renowned heritage sites, including the Sun Temple at Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav, have also seen increased popularity. To improve the tourism infrastructure at these locations, the government has invested Rs 20 crore, Rs 18 crore, and Rs 5 crore, respectively. These sites experienced a rise in tourist footfall, with Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav seeing increases in visitors from 3.78 lakh, 3.52 lakh, and 3.72 lakh in 2022-23 to 3.81 lakh, 3.83 lakh, and 3.86 lakh in 2023-24.
In addition to developing tourism infrastructure, Gujarat is focusing on the restoration of historical forts. Notable projects include the Rs 74 crore restoration of Uparkot Fort, Rs 21 crore for the restoration of Rajmahal in Amreli, and Rs 25 crore allocated for Lakhpat Fort.
On World Tourism Day 2024, the Government of India recognized Hafeshwar village in Gujarat as the Best Tourism Village in the heritage category. To further enhance the village’s tourism appeal, the Gujarat government plans to invest Rs 10 crore in additional tourism facilities.

Title: “Govt ready to discuss any topic, only request is House should run well”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:40:44 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, emphasized that the government is “ready to discuss any topic” in the upcoming winter session of Parliament, but stressed the importance of a peaceful and productive session.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday after the all-party meeting in Delhi, Rijiju said that numerous topics had been raised for discussion as the winter session is set to commence tomorrow. “A total of 42 leaders from 30 political parties were present in the meeting. There are many topics, and everyone has asked for discussions on various issues. However, we want a meaningful discussion in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The government is ready to discuss any topic, but our only request is that the House should function smoothly without disruptions. We need everyone’s cooperation for the smooth running of the session,” Rijiju said.
The minister also highlighted that there will be no parliamentary session on November 26 in observance of Constitution Day. “The session will begin tomorrow, but there will be no proceedings on November 26 as we celebrate Constitution Day. The 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution will be marked at the Constitution House with members of both Houses. President Droupadi Murmu will address the gathering, and we will release significant documents related to the Constitution,” Rijiju added.
Rijiju explained that since 2015, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Constitution Day has been celebrated annually to honor the document’s importance. “Many people are unaware of the processes involved in the creation of the Constitution. The book we are releasing is not just a book; it contains important photographs and descriptions. We must make an effort to spread awareness of the Constitution’s significance to the public,” he said.
Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, speaking after the meeting, urged for a discussion on the Adani Group’s indictment by the US Justice Department in a bribery case. “Congress has requested that the matter be discussed first in Parliament. The US court has taken cognizance of the fact that the Adani Group is not only controlling the industry but also influencing the government, with a bribe of Rs 2,300 crore involved. This is a serious issue and should be addressed promptly,” Tiwari said.
Tiwari also expressed concern over the ongoing situation in Manipur, criticizing the government’s handling of the state. “We raised the issue of Manipur and the fact that the Chief Minister (Biren Singh) has not been removed, and the Prime Minister has not visited the state. This neglect has contributed to the violence, including rapes and murders, in the region,” he said.
Additionally, Tiwari called for a statement from Prime Minister Modi in Parliament to clarify the situation regarding disengagement on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “There have been talks of disengagement on the LAC, and it is crucial that the government provide clarity on this issue in Parliament. Other pressing matters such as unemployment and pollution should also be discussed, as these issues are deeply affecting the country,” Tiwari added.
The all-party meeting was attended by floor leaders from various political parties, including Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari, K. Suresh, and JD(U) MP Upendra Kushwaha, among others. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 25 and continue until December 20.

Title: IPL 2025 Auction: Shreyas Iyer sold to PBKS for record-breaking bid of Rs 26.75 cr
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:17:37 +0000
Content: Former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain and IPL 2024-winning leader Shreyas Iyer was sold to Punjab Kings (PBKS) for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore, the highest-ever bid in the history of the IPL, during the IPL 2024 Auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah on Sunday.
With a base price of Rs 2 crore, KKR wasted no time in making the first bid for their former leader. However, Punjab Kings quickly joined the fray, pushing the price up to Rs 2.20 crore.
As the price surged to Rs 5 crore, it became a two-horse race between KKR and PBKS. The tension mounted as KKR pushed their bid to Rs 7.25 crore, but in a dramatic twist, Delhi Capitals (DC) entered the bidding with a Rs 7.50 crore offer. DC raised the stakes to Rs 10 crore, but the bid climbed steadily as PBKS and DC traded blows, reaching Rs 13.50 crore, then Rs 16 crore, and eventually Rs 20 crore.
At Rs 22 crore, PBKS seemed determined, but DC countered with Rs 22.50 crore. PBKS responded by pushing the bid to Rs 24.75 crore, only for DC to raise it to Rs 25 crore, making Iyer officially the most expensive player in the league’s history.
However, PBKS retaliated with Rs 26.25 crore, and after some final back-and-forth, they secured Iyer for Rs 26.75 crore, making him a marquee player for the team.
Punjab Kings entered the auction with the highest purse of Rs 110.5 crore, having retained just two players—Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh—before the event.
Earlier, Punjab Kings acquired India pacer Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore using their Right to Match (RTM) card. Kagiso Rabada was next on the list, with Gujarat Titans securing him for Rs 10.75 crore. GT entered the auction with a purse of Rs 69 crore, after retaining Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan.

Title: Stocks in India likely to react to assembly poll results and fund flows for fresh cues
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:57:14 +0000
Content: Domestic stock markets are poised to react on Monday to the outcomes of recent state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, alongside key domestic macroeconomic data and trends in foreign institutional investor (FII) fund flows, according to market analysts.
The bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting scheduled for early December is also expected to influence investor sentiment, as analysts anticipate a 25-basis-point rate cut amid concerns over slowing economic growth and moderating inflation.
The last trading session brought much-needed relief to investors after weeks of corrections. Despite a largely negative sentiment throughout the week due to persistent FII selling, Friday witnessed a sharp recovery driven by bargain hunting in index heavyweights, helping the Nifty and Sensex end near their highs. Both indices gained nearly 2 percent, closing at 23,907.20 and 79,117.10, respectively.
“Markets will initially react to the outcomes of the Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections. Additionally, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and infrastructure output will garner significant attention. Participants are keeping a close watch on FII fund flows, given the ongoing selling spree,” said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.
Manish Goel, Founder and MD of Equentis, noted that the upcoming MPC meeting from December 4-6 is generating significant interest. “Investors are cautiously optimistic about a 25-bps rate cut, which could help address concerns over slowing growth and inflation. However, the week ahead is likely to witness heightened volatility as markets navigate political uncertainties, economic data releases, and corporate developments,” he said.
Despite the recovery, market momentum remains uncertain. Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said, “The sharp rebound in the market this week is encouraging, but it remains to be seen how long this momentum can be sustained. Factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing Middle East tensions, and the results of critical state elections could all have an impact in the coming week.”
Sectors such as real estate, auto, and FMCG led the rebound, while IT and banking were instrumental in capping losses and supporting the recovery. Broader indices also posted gains between 0.9 and 1.8 percent.
However, FIIs continued their selling spree, marking the third consecutive week of outflows in November. According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE), foreign investors sold equities worth ₹11,412 crore this week, taking the total net selling in November to ₹41,872 crore. Persistent outflows have added to market volatility and weighed on investor sentiment.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided critical support to the markets, purchasing equities worth ₹11,035 crore this week. Their total net buying for November stands at ₹37,559 crore, cushioning the impact of FII outflows.
Despite global and domestic challenges, analysts remain optimistic about India’s long-term growth potential. “India’s structural growth story remains intact despite short-term market fluctuations,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research.

Title: 19 agritech soonicorns, 40 minicorns embracing emerging tech for business growth: RBI paper
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:46:04 +0000
Content: The Indian agritech sector shows immense potential to bridge the technological gap in agriculture, with 19 agritech soonicorns and 40 minicorns leveraging emerging technologies like AI and innovative business models, according to a new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) paper.
While only one unicorn has been identified in India’s agritech landscape, the total number of soonicorns (startups on the verge of becoming unicorns) and minicorns (early-stage startups) is estimated at 19 and 40, respectively, stated the paper titled “Agri-Tech Startups and Innovations in Indian Agriculture” by D. Suganthi, Jobin Sebastian, and Monika Sethi.
A survey of agritech startups highlighted their reliance on government funding support, research and development, and state-backed digital infrastructure for growth.
India’s agritech ecosystem has witnessed a surge in investor interest, with investments increasing from $370 million in 2019 to $1.25 billion in 2021. However, investor interest moderated after 2021, in line with global trends.
Globally, funding for agritech companies peaked at $10.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 but sharply declined to $5.2 billion in 2023.
“In terms of funding share, the US leads with 43.2 per cent, followed by China (14.4 per cent), Canada (12 per cent), and India (8.5 per cent). This indicates that the Indian agritech ecosystem has garnered a significant share of global funding,” the paper noted.
The central government is promoting agripreneurship and innovation by reducing regulatory barriers, developing innovation-driven infrastructure, and fostering active collaboration among entrepreneurs.
“It plays a significant role in building a robust ecosystem for nurturing innovation and facilitating agritech mainstreaming by developing an agri-stack,” the paper emphasized.
Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, remote sensing, biotechnology, drones, robotics, and automation are being adopted by several agritech startups.
Government initiatives such as Digital India, Make in India, startup funds, and accelerator and incubator programs have been instrumental in accelerating the growth of agritech startups, particularly during the pandemic.
However, the paper cautioned that despite the progress made, agritech startups in India face significant challenges in scaling up their operations. The sustainability of these startups depends on the adoption of modern technologies by farmers.
“Key challenges hindering growth include insufficient funding, fragmented landholdings, and the longer time required to achieve revenue generation,” it added.

Title: Scientists decode brain activity to help treat anxiety and depression
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:32:00 +0000
Content: A team of scientists has uncovered new regions of the brain that support social interactions and are in constant communication with the ancient amygdala region—a discovery that could help treat psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression.
In a study conducted by Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine in the US, and published in the journal Science Advances, scientists sought to better understand how humans evolved to become highly skilled at interpreting what’s happening in other people’s minds.
“We spend a lot of time wondering, ‘What is that person feeling, thinking? Did I say something to upset them?’” said senior author Rodrigo Braga.
The brain regions that enable these abilities are part of the human brain’s more recently evolved areas, suggesting that this skill is a relatively new development in evolutionary terms.
“In essence, you’re putting yourself in someone else’s mind and making inferences about what that person is thinking when you cannot really know,” Braga explained.
The study found that the advanced parts of the human brain supporting social interactions—known as the social cognitive network—are connected to and in constant communication with the ancient amygdala.
Often referred to as the “lizard brain,” the amygdala is typically associated with detecting threats and processing fear.
“The amygdala is responsible for social behaviours like parenting, mating, aggression, and navigating social-dominance hierarchies,” Braga said. While earlier studies have observed co-activation of the amygdala and the social cognitive network, Braga noted that “our study is novel because it shows the communication is always happening.”
Within the amygdala, a specific region called the medial nucleus plays a critical role in social behaviours.
This study is the first to show that the medial nucleus of the amygdala is directly connected to newly evolved regions of the social cognitive network, which are involved in thinking about other people.
This connection allows the social cognitive network to access the amygdala’s role in processing emotionally significant content, the researchers explained.
Both anxiety and depression are linked to hyperactivity in the amygdala, which can lead to excessive emotional responses and impaired emotional regulation.
The study’s findings suggest that less-invasive treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), could potentially use this new knowledge of brain connections to improve treatment outcomes, the authors noted.

Title: Cargo ship sails directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh for first time in 53 years
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:25:50 +0000
Content: On 11 November, a cargo ship docked at Chittagong port in Bangladesh, overlooking the Bay of Bengal. It became the first ship to travel directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh in 53 years. The Panama-flagged M.V. Yuan Xiang Fa Zhan is operated by Anhui Guohai Sanlong Shipping of China. It first travelled from the U.A.E. to Pakistan, and then reached Bangladesh, before its onward journey to Malaysia. Chittagong port authorities said that the ship brought goods from Pakistan and the U.A.E., including raw materials for Bangladesh’s garment industry and basic foodstuffs. Previously, cargo used to be shipped from Pakistan to Bangladesh via third countries, such as, Sri Lanka, Singapore, or, Malaysia. Pakistani goods had to be off-loaded onto feeder vessels in some of these countries before travelling to Bangladesh.
A direct sea link between two erstwhile enemies is one of many changes that Bangladesh has witnessed in recent months, starting with the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August after a bloody agitation by students against a controversial quota system for Government jobs. The protests culminated in the escape of Hasina to India and the installation of an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Since then, Bangladesh’s relations with India have nose-dived.
The killing of Hindus in Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh has only made the relationship worse. Recently, a grocer in Chittagong called the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also known as Iskcon, a terrorist group, which angered the Hindu community in the neighbourhood. The clashes that followed the Facebook post by the grocer left many injured. Hindus, who make up 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population, have traditionally supported the Awami League party headed by Sheikh Hasina. Just recently, Bangladesh’s Attorney-General Mohammad Asaduzzaman called for removing Socialism and Secularism from the country’s Constitution. It has sparked fears among minorities of Bangladesh turning into an Islamic state.
In sharp contrast, Bangladesh’s ties with Pakistan are looking up despite decades of animosity. Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971. It became an independent country after a nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan. Bangladesh claims that Pakistan committed a genocide, killing 3 million of its people, and, raping hundreds and thousands of women. But in the last three months, Bangladesh and Pakistan have taken a number of steps that indicate a reset or reboot in their relationship.
— In September, Muhammad Yunus met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly in the U.S.
— The same month, Bangladesh eased import restrictions on Pakistani goods. Yunus ended mandatory, physical, inspection of goods imported from Pakistan. Such imports were previously required to undertake a physical inspection when the goods arrived, causing long delays.
— In October, Yunus cancelled certain national holidays that commemorated the 1971 Liberation War or Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
— And, in November, Bangladesh lifted a ban on students from Pakistan.
For its part, Pakistan announced free visas to Bangladesh businesspersons and certain other categories of applicants. Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Dhaka, Syed Ahmed Maroof, sparked widespread discussion on social media in Bangladesh when he said that the direct shipping route was a major step in boosting trade across the region. He wrote on Facebook that the route will promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides.
It is a radical departure from the position adopted by the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s Government.
— In 2022, Hasina denied permission to a Chinese-built Pakistani warship, the P.N.S. Taimur, from docking at Chittagong port.
— In 2015, Hasina imposed a ban on Pakistani students following Pakistan’s refusal to acknowledge the genocide and atrocities committed during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971.
— Hasina established a national Tribunal in 2010 to investigate war crimes committed in 1971 and bring the guilty to justice. The Tribunal has since convicted and sentenced numerous individuals for crimes against humanity.
The direct maritime route between Pakistan and Bangladesh poses certain challenges for India.
— For one, it could at some point into the future give rise to gun-running and drug-smuggling.
— Two, India has a more than 4-thousand-kilometre-long porous border with Bangladesh, which further complicates matters.
— Three, insurgents operating in India’s north-eastern states bordering Bangladesh and China could seek to exploit the situation.
— And last but not the least, India would need to be watchful of a growing Pakistan – China nexus in the Bay of Bengal region.
India’s fears are not without reason. The Chittagong arms haul is fresh in the minds of many. In April 2004, Bangladesh’s agencies seized illegal arms and ammunition in Chittagong. The weapons were meant for the United Liberation Front of Asom, also known as Ulfa, which operates in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam. An alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power at the time. New Delhi believed that the cache of weapons was also meant for other insurgent groups in India’s north-east in order to destabilise the region.
So will history repeat itself? For now, New Delhi is watching and waiting.

Title: Bangladesh: B.N.P. – Yunus fight out in the open
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:14:25 +0000
Content: Cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that catapulted 84-year-old Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to power. Will the Bangladesh Nationalist Party play ball? And will the Army sit idly by?
The Interim Government of Bangladesh completed a hundred days on 15 November. No grand celebrations were held. No big speeches were made on the occasion. An uneasy calm prevails in the country’s capital Dhaka, which saw a pitched battle between the police and protesters in the months leading up to the overthrow of the Government of the day.
The so-called Revolution is over, but, protests are taking place more than ever in Dhaka. People are not exactly despondent but they’re restless and impatient. Non-stop demonstrations have been reported from near the Secretariat Building – the administrative nerve centre of Bangladesh’s Government. If Government Land Office employees want higher pay and benefits, some want protections for Sufi religious shrines. Others such as garment workers hold a protest over unpaid wages. Elseqhere in Dhaka, protesters hold a torch procession on 31 October to demand better treatment of minorities in the country following a sedition charge against 19 people. The procession was led by the Bangladesh United Minority Alliance after the 19 were said to have disrespected Bangladesh’s national flag in the south-eastern city of Chittagong. The protesters called for the withdrawal of the charges against the 19, who included Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, the divisional organising secretary of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known by its acronym Iskcon, which is a Hindu religious movement. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has called for minority protection and a national process of truth and healing.
Recent developments
Here’s a quick recap of all that happened since the 5 August ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, followed by the installation of an Interim Government led by the Nobel Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, on 8 August.
In August, the U.N. calls for a peaceful and democratic transition. It urges all parties to respect human rights and ensure transparency and accountability. At the request of the interim government, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights establishes a fact-finding mission to analyse root causes and provide concrete recommendations on the next steps Bangladesh should take to address the past violations and to ensure non-recurrence.
In September, protests continue, with demonstrators demanding accountability for the violent suppression of earlier protests.
In October, the Interim Government faces legal and political challenges, including debates about its legitimacy and the need for Constitutional reforms. The International Crimes Tribunal – which was established under Bangladesh law to try and punish any individual or group of individuals responsible for committing Crimes against Humanity or Genocide in Bangladesh – issues arrest warrants for Sheikh Hasina and more than 40 others for their alleged roles in massacres and killings that took place during the protests in July and August. Mahfuj Alam, the Special Assistant to the Interim Government’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, announces that family members of the “martyred” Anti-Discrimination Student Movement would receive 30 lakh Taka, that is, about 88-thousand dollars.
And, in November, the U.N. again reminds Dhaka of the importance of a peaceful transition and the rule of law.
100 days of Yunus
A Belgium-based N.G.O., International Crisis Group, released a report titled “A New Era in Bangladesh? The First Hundred Days of Reform” in which it says that the Bangladesh Government, led by Yunus should balance demands for justice with the need for reconciliation, staying within the bounds of the Constitution to mitigate the danger of its decisions being invalidated later.
It says that the Government, which is expected to remain in office for another year or longer, should seek to hold fresh elections under a reformed polling system within a realistic timeframe, which should not extend beyond 18 months.
The report cautions that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Bangladesh to improve governance and put checks and balances in place that would stop another autocratic regime from emerging.
It warns that if the Interim Government falters, the country could revert to the status quo ante, or, worse, enter a period of military rule.
The message is clear: Yunus should avoid staying in power for too long. He should build a consensus among political parties because experience and history alike suggest that the longer an Interim Government remains in power, the larger the doubts about its legitimacy grows. Therefore, managing, let alone meeting, public expectation will be extremely challenging for the Government.
Cracks emerging
Already, the fissures are out in the open. Most noticeably, between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Yunus-led Interim Government. The B.N.P. wants an early election but the Interim Government is not willing to play ball.
Thousands of B.N.P. supporters rallied in Dhaka on 8 November demanding the holding of an election. The friends turned frenemies are no longer singing from the same hymn sheet, especially because it was the Interim Government that released B.N.P. chief Khaleda Zia from house arrest and acquitted her of corruption charges. The B.N.P. now fears that the Yunus-led Interim Government is in no mood to hold an election and that it wants to extend its rule in perpetuity. The B.N.P. wants to avoid a repeat of the past, when an Army-controlled Caretaker Government in 2006 stayed beyond its mandated three months and delayed the election by about two years, only to bring Sheikh Hasina back to power.
Things have come to such a pass that the B.N.P. is openly opposing the Interim Government’s proposal to ban its arch-rival, the Awami League – whom it ousted in the recent protests. The B.N.P. also suspects that the Interim Government might toy with the idea of reviving the Minus-Two Formula of yore, which was invoked by some caretaker governments of the past to keep the two Begums away –Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.
The B.N.P. is suspicious of the motives of student leaders, academics and others who want to delegitimise the party for their vested interests. The B.N.P. has time and again voiced its frustration over the lack of a “roadmap” for the transition to democracy. Its Secretary-General, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, has called on the Interim Government to open talks with politicians, and, hold an election within a “reasonable” time. Would he be O.K. if an election was held after two or three years? “I don’t think people will accept that,” he retorts.
Thomas Kean, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, says that cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that pushed Yunus into power. He says that for now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged.
Yunus appeals
For his part, Yunus has begged for the country’s patience to prepare for the much-awaited election. “I am not sure how much reform we will be able to make. But I promise you, if you give us the opportunity, we will complete some mandatory reforms and then go for the highly sought-after election we all are looking for. I would request you to keep patience till then. We want to create an exemplary electoral system that can be followed for years. It will save our country from annual political crises. To ensure these, I am asking for the necessary time from you,” he says in a televised address to the nation.
The Government has since appointed a new chief election commissioner and four other commissioners. Yunus says that a road map for the next election would be unveiled once electoral reforms are completed but he won’t give a timeframe for the election.
Bangladesh’s Constitutional Reform Commission has to submit its recommendations to the Government by 31 December. Its aim is to draft a new Constitution. Five other Reform Commissions are likely to submit their reports by the end of December, too.
Chequered history
Bangladesh has long struggled with political instability and military influence. In its 53 years of independence, the country has faced 29 attempted military coups, starting with the first in 1975, just four years after independence.
Bangladesh appears to be heading toward not only a political reset but also a Constitutional overhaul. The country’s Attorney General, Mohammed Asaduzzaman, has suggested removing the world “secular” from the Constitution, citing the fact that 90 per cent of Bangladesh’s population follows Islam.
So, are the fears of Bangladesh becoming an Islamic state genuine?
How will the proposed changes to the Constitution impact the country’s minorities?
Will Hindus be safe?
Will the Interim Government stay true to its promise of holding an election?
And will the Military continue to watch from the sidelines or take matters into its own hands?
There are no easy answers to these questions.
How much power the Bangladesh Army is willing to relinquish in favour of the Yunus-led Interim Government will be critical to ensuring a peaceful, democratic transition.
As things stand now, an early election is not likely. Yunus has said that the timing of the election is a political decision and that people will decide how long this Interim Government will remain in power.
Bangladesh stands at a familiar crossroads once again.
While many celebrate what they call a “Third Independence”, others remain cautiously optimistic, wary of the recurring sounds of military boots echoing through the power corridors of Dhaka.

Title: Swimmer McKeon retires as Australia’s most successful Olympian
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:44:15 +0000
Content: Australia’s most decorated Olympian, Emma McKeon, announced her retirement from all forms of swimming on Monday (November 25), bringing an end to a glittering career in which she won 14 medals at three Olympics and 20 at world championships.
The 30-year-old sprinter had signalled her retirement earlier this year at the Paris Olympics after winning a gold, silver and bronze in relays to help Australia to its most successful Summer Games.
McKeon missed out on the London Olympics as a teenager but hit her stride in Rio in 2016 where she won her first gold in the 4x100m relay as well as silvers in two other relays and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. In Tokyo in 2021, she won the 100m and 50m freestyle sprint titles which, along with two relay golds and three bronze medals, gave her the biggest medal haul for a single athlete at the delayed Games.
As well as her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was also part of relay teams which set eight world records in the pool, three of which still stand.

Title: Contentious COP29 deal shows climate cooperation fraying at edges
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:41:20 +0000
Content: When COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev stepped to the podium at the closing meeting of the Baku climate summit on Sunday morning, hoping to clinch a hard-fought agreement on global climate finance, he carried with him two speeches.
One was crafted around a hoped-for deal being struck, while the other for the possibility of a summit-collapsing impasse, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
“Yes, we had prepared different variations of the speech for various scenarios, but as we stepped onto the stage, we were confident in our success,” said one of the sources, an official in the COP29 presidency.
In the end, Babayev managed to gavel through the $300 billion finance plan to help developing nations cope with the soaring costs of global warming over the next decade before critics had time to object, allowing him to read the more positive speech.
He praised the agreement as a breakthrough and shamed the deal’s doubters as “wrong”, even as many of the climate deal’s intended recipients slammed it as woefully inadequate.
Babayev’s preparation for different outcomes at the divisive summit in the Caspian Sea nation of Azerbaijan reflected what many in the audience had already known before it began: the Baku climate talks were never going to go smoothly.
Expectations for a deal were depressed by worries of a looming U.S. withdrawal from global climate cooperation, geopolitical turmoil, and a rise of isolationist politics that had shunted climate change off much of the world’s top priorities list.
Those obstacles loomed large in Baku and will continue to overshadow global climate efforts in the months ahead as Brazil prepares for next year’s much broader conference in the Amazon rainforest city of Belem – where the world will plot a years-long course for steeper emissions cuts and building resilience in the fight against climate change.
“Multilateralism as a whole is under threat,” said Eliot Whittington, chief systems change officer at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.
“Indeed, the UNFCCC is probably the bright spot – proving that even in the face of incredibly hostile geopolitics and on fundamentally difficult questions, a deal can be made,” he said, referring to the U.N. body sponsoring the annual climate summit.
But the slow pace of progress, with global emissions still rising, has raised tensions and calls for reform.
“This is something that needs to be looked at, when just a handful of countries, based on their own economic interests, can almost wreck the entire process,” Sierra Leone Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai told Reuters.

Title: Those rejected by people repeatedly, try to control House through chaos: PM Modi slams Oppn
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:15:45 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on the Opposition on Monday, accusing them of disrupting Parliament and denying meaningful discussions.
He stated that those “who have been rejected by the people multiple times are attempting to control the House through chaos.”
Speaking to the media ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament, PM Modi underscored the significance of this session, terming it a special occasion as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Indian Constitution.
“This is the Winter Session, hopefully, the atmosphere will also be cool. This is the last session of 2024, and the country is enthusiastically awaiting 2025. This session is special in many ways. The most significant aspect is that our Constitution is entering its 75th year — a monumental moment for our democracy. Tomorrow, we will commence this extraordinary occasion together in the new Parliament building,” he said.
The Prime Minister highlighted the rigorous deliberations undertaken by the framers of the Constitution, leading to the creation of a remarkable document. “One of the Constitution’s key elements is our Parliament and our parliamentarians,” he added.
Calling for productive and healthy debates, PM Modi took aim at the Opposition for obstructing proceedings.
“The people who have been rejected repeatedly by the electorate, try to control Parliament through disruptions. While they fail, their actions are being closely observed by the people of the country. The most troubling aspect is that new MPs, who bring fresh ideas and perspectives, are being denied their rightful opportunity to speak in Parliament due to such disruptions,” he said.
Stressing the importance of intergenerational learning in a democracy, the Prime Minister said, “Every generation in a democracy has the responsibility to train future generations. However, those rejected by the people 80-90 times do not let discussions take place in Parliament.”
“They neither understand the aspirations of the people nor live up to their expectations, and that is why the public continues to reject them,” he added.
Reflecting on India’s growing prominence on the global stage, PM Modi said, “The world looks at India with hope. At such a crucial time, our discussions in Parliament can further enhance India’s standing before the world. India rarely gets opportunities like this, and it is our duty to ensure that the trust voters place in democracy and the Constitution is upheld through meaningful work in Parliament.”
He urged all members to make up for lost time and engage in substantive debates on critical issues.
“A message should go out that the dedication of voters to democracy, the Constitution, and the sanctity of parliamentary proceedings is being honoured by their elected representatives,” he said.
The Prime Minister concluded by expressing hope for a productive session, stressing that healthy discussions are essential to address the nation’s pressing concerns.
“The voters of India are committed to democracy, their loyalty to the Constitution, and their confidence in the parliamentary system. It is essential for everyone in Parliament to reflect the sentiments of the people. To achieve this, we must discuss various aspects of each topic in a constructive manner. This will inspire future generations as well. I hope this session proves to be productive, and I encourage all esteemed MPs to approach it with passion and enthusiasm,” he said.

Title: Ideologies may differ but country is supreme: Speaker Om Birla
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:06:44 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday underscored the importance of prioritizing the nation above differing ideologies and viewpoints. Reflecting on the unity demonstrated by the diverse members of the Constituent Assembly, he highlighted the strength of democracy in embracing differences while working for a common goal.
“On Constitution Day, we need to draw inspiration from the debates and discussions of the Constituent Assembly. Despite their differences, members engaged in positive and meaningful dialogue. Differences are inherent to democracy, but they should not hinder us from coming together for the nation. Ideologies and expressions may vary, but the country must always come first,” Birla told ANI.
Recalling his predecessors, Birla said they had remained steadfastly loyal to the Constitution, working under its guidance. “The Constitution is respected by everyone, including the Judiciary, Executive, and Legislative branches. Babasaheb Ambedkar remarked that a Constitution’s success depends on the vision and capability of those implementing it. We have always upheld the Constitution and ensured that democratic institutions, whether Parliament or Assemblies, function within its framework,” Birla stated.
He further emphasized that the Constitution should remain above politics, describing it as a social document and a catalyst for social and economic change. “The Constitution is our strength. It has enabled us to bring social and economic reforms while ensuring respect for the marginalized and disadvantaged. Today, the world studies India’s Constitution to understand its ideology and the progressive step of granting voting rights to all classes and castes without discrimination at that time. This foundational spirit unites us and drives collective action. That’s why the Constitution must not be drawn into the realm of politics,” Birla said.
Birla also asserted that no government, regardless of its party or ideology, can alter the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Amendments made over time, he explained, have always aimed to align with the rights and aspirations of the people.

Title: India’s economic growth expected to accelerate in Oct-Dec quarter: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:59:50 +0000
Content: India’s economy is projected to grow at a faster pace in the third quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2024) compared to the first half (April-September 2024) as positive indicators are emerging with economic activity picking up pace, according to a report by ICRA.
The report states that the preliminary data for November indicates a positive trend. The growth in electricity demand has picked up, while festive season demand continues to drive an increase in vehicle registrations. “These trends reinforce ICRA’s expectations of a pick-up in the GDP growth in Q3 FY2025 compared to H1 FY2025.”
Economic indicators related to mobility and transportation have also shown significant improvement. Vehicle registrations surged to 32.4 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, a sharp recovery from a contraction of 8.7 per cent in September 2024, the report points out.
This increase is fuelled by a strong demand for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles. Petrol consumption rose to 8.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in September, and domestic air passenger traffic increased to 9.6 per cent from 6.4 per cent.
Additionally, two-wheeler production grew by 13.4 per cent, rail freight improved to 1.5 per cent from a decline of 0.7 per cent, and diesel consumption recorded marginal growth of 0.1 per cent after a contraction of 1.9 per cent in September.
The report further states that the country’s non-oil exports have posted a robust growth of 25.6 per cent in October 2024, up from 6.8 per cent in September. The main contributors to this growth include high-value manufactured items such as electronic products, engineering goods, chemicals, and readymade garments.
The ICRA’s Business Activity Monitor, a composite indicator of economic activities, showed a year-on-year growth of 10.1 per cent in October 2024, the highest in eight months. This is an improvement from the 6.6 per cent growth recorded in September 2024, despite challenges from a high base effect, the report states. The upbeat trends across various sectors reflect India’s economic resilience and reinforce expectations of stronger GDP growth in the coming months, the report added. (IANS)

Title: PM Modi to inaugurate ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 Today
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:15:06 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 today, November 25, at 3 PM at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.  
For the first time in its 130-year history, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) is hosting its Global Cooperative Conference and General Assembly in India. Organized by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in partnership with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives such as AMUL and KRIBHCO, the event will run from November 25 to 30.  
With the theme, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” the conference resonates with the Indian Government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The program will include discussions, panel sessions, and workshops to explore how cooperatives can tackle global challenges and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Topics such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth will be addressed.
During the event, PM Modi will officially launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, centered around the theme, “Cooperatives Build a Better World.”This initiative highlights the pivotal role of cooperatives in fostering social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development. Recognized by the UN SDGs as essential to reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and eradicating poverty, cooperatives will take center stage in this global campaign to address pressing global challenges.  
PM will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s dedication to the cooperative movement. The stamp design features a lotus, representing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, in line with the cooperative principles of sustainability and community development. Its five petals reflect the Panchatatva (five elements of nature), underlining cooperatives’ focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The stamp also integrates imagery from various cooperative sectors such as agriculture, dairy, fisheries, housing, and technology, including a drone symbolizing modern agricultural innovation.  
The conference will welcome prominent international figures, including Prime Minister of Bhutan Dasho Tshering Tobgay and Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji Manoa Kamikamica, along with approximately 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries.
