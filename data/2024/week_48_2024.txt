Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 on Monday (November 25) at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital. The event will be attended by representatives from over 100 countries.
This marks the first time in the 130-year history of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) that both the ICA Global Cooperative Conference and the ICA General Assembly are being organized in India, which is the premier body for the global cooperative movement.
The Global Conference, hosted by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in collaboration with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives AMUL and KRIBHCO, will take place from November 25-30.
The theme of the conference, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” aligns with the Indian government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The event will feature discussions, panel sessions, and workshops focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities faced by cooperatives worldwide, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These discussions will touch on areas such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth.
Prime Minister Modi will also launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, which will focus on the theme “Cooperatives Build a Better World.” This initiative will highlight the transformative role cooperatives play in promoting social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development.
The UN SDGs recognize cooperatives as crucial drivers of sustainable development, especially in reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and alleviating poverty. The year 2025 will showcase the power of cooperative enterprises in addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges.
As part of the event, the Prime Minister will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s commitment to the cooperative movement. The stamp features a lotus, symbolizing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, all reflective of the cooperative values of sustainability and community development.
The five petals of the lotus represent the five elements of nature (Panchatatva), highlighting cooperatives’ dedication to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The design also incorporates sectors like agriculture, dairy, fisheries, consumer cooperatives, and housing, with a drone symbolizing the role of modern technology in agriculture.
Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica, and around 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries will also participate in the event.

Soren confirmed the date of the oath-taking ceremony while addressing the media on Sunday, stating, “On 28 November, the oath ceremony of the new government will take place.”
Earlier, Soren tendered his resignation as Chief Minister to Governor Santosh Gangwar and staked a claim to form the next government at the Raj Bhawan. “Today, we have started the procedure to form the INDIA alliance government and, as part of this process, we have staked our claim to form the government in front of the Governor. I also tendered my resignation… Congress and the RJD in-charge were also present here,” Soren said.
Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay added that Soren had been elected as the leader of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. “All party workers and leaders extended their support, and Hemant Soren was chosen as the leader of the Jharkhand Assembly House… the tentative date for the oath-taking is 28th,” Sahay stated.
The JMM, under Soren’s leadership, led the INDIA alliance to a decisive victory in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, securing 56 seats. Of these, JMM won 34 seats, while its allies Congress, RJD, and CPI-ML secured 16, 4, and 2 seats respectively.
In contrast, the BJP-led NDA alliance garnered only 24 seats, with the BJP securing 21 seats and its allies—the AJSU Party, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), and JD-U—winning one seat each.
In addition, Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha, a smaller party, secured a seat with Jairam Kumar Mahato winning in the Dumri constituency.
The JMM-led alliance retained power in Jharkhand following the assembly elections, which were held in two phases on November 13 and November 20.

Title: Gujarat’s heritage sites attract over 21 lakh tourists in 2023-24
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:48:02 +0000
Content: Gujarat, renowned for its cultural and historical legacy, has become a prime destination for tourists, both domestic and international, with its heritage sites leading the way.
According to the Gujarat Tourism Department, more than 21 lakh tourists visited the state’s major heritage sites in the year 2023-24. To further enhance these sites, the Gujarat government has invested over Rs 428 crore in development projects aimed at improving tourism facilities across the state.
In celebration of World Heritage Week, which is observed globally from November 19 to November 25, UNESCO highlights the significance of preserving cultural and historical heritage. In India, the Archaeological Survey of India partners with various institutions to organize events at historical sites, emphasizing the theme for 2024, “Discover and Experiencing Diversity.”
Under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat has focused on making its heritage sites more attractive and accessible to tourists. Notable investments include Rs 255 crore for tourism-friendly facilities at Vadnagar and Dholavira.
Vadnagar, the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has seen remarkable growth in visitor numbers. The state government has spent Rs 70 crore over three years to modernize the site’s infrastructure. As a result, the number of visitors to Vadnagar has surged nearly threefold, from 2.4 lakh in 2022-23 to approximately 7 lakh in 2023-24.
Similarly, Dholavira, a UNESCO World Heritage Site representing the Indus Valley Civilization, has been the recipient of substantial development funding. The Gujarat government has earmarked Rs 185 crore for tourism projects at Dholavira, with Phase 1 investments of Rs 76 crore already underway. Visitor numbers at Dholavira have more than doubled, from 1.41 lakh in 2022-23 to over 2.32 lakh in 2023-24.
The state’s renowned heritage sites, including the Sun Temple at Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav, have also seen increased popularity. To improve the tourism infrastructure at these locations, the government has invested Rs 20 crore, Rs 18 crore, and Rs 5 crore, respectively. These sites experienced a rise in tourist footfall, with Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav seeing increases in visitors from 3.78 lakh, 3.52 lakh, and 3.72 lakh in 2022-23 to 3.81 lakh, 3.83 lakh, and 3.86 lakh in 2023-24.
In addition to developing tourism infrastructure, Gujarat is focusing on the restoration of historical forts. Notable projects include the Rs 74 crore restoration of Uparkot Fort, Rs 21 crore for the restoration of Rajmahal in Amreli, and Rs 25 crore allocated for Lakhpat Fort.
On World Tourism Day 2024, the Government of India recognized Hafeshwar village in Gujarat as the Best Tourism Village in the heritage category. To further enhance the village’s tourism appeal, the Gujarat government plans to invest Rs 10 crore in additional tourism facilities.

Title: “Govt ready to discuss any topic, only request is House should run well”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:40:44 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, emphasized that the government is “ready to discuss any topic” in the upcoming winter session of Parliament, but stressed the importance of a peaceful and productive session.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday after the all-party meeting in Delhi, Rijiju said that numerous topics had been raised for discussion as the winter session is set to commence tomorrow. “A total of 42 leaders from 30 political parties were present in the meeting. There are many topics, and everyone has asked for discussions on various issues. However, we want a meaningful discussion in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The government is ready to discuss any topic, but our only request is that the House should function smoothly without disruptions. We need everyone’s cooperation for the smooth running of the session,” Rijiju said.
The minister also highlighted that there will be no parliamentary session on November 26 in observance of Constitution Day. “The session will begin tomorrow, but there will be no proceedings on November 26 as we celebrate Constitution Day. The 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution will be marked at the Constitution House with members of both Houses. President Droupadi Murmu will address the gathering, and we will release significant documents related to the Constitution,” Rijiju added.
Rijiju explained that since 2015, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Constitution Day has been celebrated annually to honor the document’s importance. “Many people are unaware of the processes involved in the creation of the Constitution. The book we are releasing is not just a book; it contains important photographs and descriptions. We must make an effort to spread awareness of the Constitution’s significance to the public,” he said.
Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, speaking after the meeting, urged for a discussion on the Adani Group’s indictment by the US Justice Department in a bribery case. “Congress has requested that the matter be discussed first in Parliament. The US court has taken cognizance of the fact that the Adani Group is not only controlling the industry but also influencing the government, with a bribe of Rs 2,300 crore involved. This is a serious issue and should be addressed promptly,” Tiwari said.
Tiwari also expressed concern over the ongoing situation in Manipur, criticizing the government’s handling of the state. “We raised the issue of Manipur and the fact that the Chief Minister (Biren Singh) has not been removed, and the Prime Minister has not visited the state. This neglect has contributed to the violence, including rapes and murders, in the region,” he said.
Additionally, Tiwari called for a statement from Prime Minister Modi in Parliament to clarify the situation regarding disengagement on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “There have been talks of disengagement on the LAC, and it is crucial that the government provide clarity on this issue in Parliament. Other pressing matters such as unemployment and pollution should also be discussed, as these issues are deeply affecting the country,” Tiwari added.
The all-party meeting was attended by floor leaders from various political parties, including Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari, K. Suresh, and JD(U) MP Upendra Kushwaha, among others. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 25 and continue until December 20.

Title: IPL 2025 Auction: Shreyas Iyer sold to PBKS for record-breaking bid of Rs 26.75 cr
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:17:37 +0000
Content: Former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain and IPL 2024-winning leader Shreyas Iyer was sold to Punjab Kings (PBKS) for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore, the highest-ever bid in the history of the IPL, during the IPL 2024 Auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah on Sunday.
With a base price of Rs 2 crore, KKR wasted no time in making the first bid for their former leader. However, Punjab Kings quickly joined the fray, pushing the price up to Rs 2.20 crore.
As the price surged to Rs 5 crore, it became a two-horse race between KKR and PBKS. The tension mounted as KKR pushed their bid to Rs 7.25 crore, but in a dramatic twist, Delhi Capitals (DC) entered the bidding with a Rs 7.50 crore offer. DC raised the stakes to Rs 10 crore, but the bid climbed steadily as PBKS and DC traded blows, reaching Rs 13.50 crore, then Rs 16 crore, and eventually Rs 20 crore.
At Rs 22 crore, PBKS seemed determined, but DC countered with Rs 22.50 crore. PBKS responded by pushing the bid to Rs 24.75 crore, only for DC to raise it to Rs 25 crore, making Iyer officially the most expensive player in the league’s history.
However, PBKS retaliated with Rs 26.25 crore, and after some final back-and-forth, they secured Iyer for Rs 26.75 crore, making him a marquee player for the team.
Punjab Kings entered the auction with the highest purse of Rs 110.5 crore, having retained just two players—Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh—before the event.
Earlier, Punjab Kings acquired India pacer Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore using their Right to Match (RTM) card. Kagiso Rabada was next on the list, with Gujarat Titans securing him for Rs 10.75 crore. GT entered the auction with a purse of Rs 69 crore, after retaining Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan.

Title: Stocks in India likely to react to assembly poll results and fund flows for fresh cues
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:57:14 +0000
Content: Domestic stock markets are poised to react on Monday to the outcomes of recent state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, alongside key domestic macroeconomic data and trends in foreign institutional investor (FII) fund flows, according to market analysts.
The bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting scheduled for early December is also expected to influence investor sentiment, as analysts anticipate a 25-basis-point rate cut amid concerns over slowing economic growth and moderating inflation.
The last trading session brought much-needed relief to investors after weeks of corrections. Despite a largely negative sentiment throughout the week due to persistent FII selling, Friday witnessed a sharp recovery driven by bargain hunting in index heavyweights, helping the Nifty and Sensex end near their highs. Both indices gained nearly 2 percent, closing at 23,907.20 and 79,117.10, respectively.
“Markets will initially react to the outcomes of the Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections. Additionally, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and infrastructure output will garner significant attention. Participants are keeping a close watch on FII fund flows, given the ongoing selling spree,” said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.
Manish Goel, Founder and MD of Equentis, noted that the upcoming MPC meeting from December 4-6 is generating significant interest. “Investors are cautiously optimistic about a 25-bps rate cut, which could help address concerns over slowing growth and inflation. However, the week ahead is likely to witness heightened volatility as markets navigate political uncertainties, economic data releases, and corporate developments,” he said.
Despite the recovery, market momentum remains uncertain. Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said, “The sharp rebound in the market this week is encouraging, but it remains to be seen how long this momentum can be sustained. Factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing Middle East tensions, and the results of critical state elections could all have an impact in the coming week.”
Sectors such as real estate, auto, and FMCG led the rebound, while IT and banking were instrumental in capping losses and supporting the recovery. Broader indices also posted gains between 0.9 and 1.8 percent.
However, FIIs continued their selling spree, marking the third consecutive week of outflows in November. According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE), foreign investors sold equities worth ₹11,412 crore this week, taking the total net selling in November to ₹41,872 crore. Persistent outflows have added to market volatility and weighed on investor sentiment.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided critical support to the markets, purchasing equities worth ₹11,035 crore this week. Their total net buying for November stands at ₹37,559 crore, cushioning the impact of FII outflows.
Despite global and domestic challenges, analysts remain optimistic about India’s long-term growth potential. “India’s structural growth story remains intact despite short-term market fluctuations,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research.

Title: 19 agritech soonicorns, 40 minicorns embracing emerging tech for business growth: RBI paper
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:46:04 +0000
Content: The Indian agritech sector shows immense potential to bridge the technological gap in agriculture, with 19 agritech soonicorns and 40 minicorns leveraging emerging technologies like AI and innovative business models, according to a new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) paper.
While only one unicorn has been identified in India’s agritech landscape, the total number of soonicorns (startups on the verge of becoming unicorns) and minicorns (early-stage startups) is estimated at 19 and 40, respectively, stated the paper titled “Agri-Tech Startups and Innovations in Indian Agriculture” by D. Suganthi, Jobin Sebastian, and Monika Sethi.
A survey of agritech startups highlighted their reliance on government funding support, research and development, and state-backed digital infrastructure for growth.
India’s agritech ecosystem has witnessed a surge in investor interest, with investments increasing from $370 million in 2019 to $1.25 billion in 2021. However, investor interest moderated after 2021, in line with global trends.
Globally, funding for agritech companies peaked at $10.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 but sharply declined to $5.2 billion in 2023.
“In terms of funding share, the US leads with 43.2 per cent, followed by China (14.4 per cent), Canada (12 per cent), and India (8.5 per cent). This indicates that the Indian agritech ecosystem has garnered a significant share of global funding,” the paper noted.
The central government is promoting agripreneurship and innovation by reducing regulatory barriers, developing innovation-driven infrastructure, and fostering active collaboration among entrepreneurs.
“It plays a significant role in building a robust ecosystem for nurturing innovation and facilitating agritech mainstreaming by developing an agri-stack,” the paper emphasized.
Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, remote sensing, biotechnology, drones, robotics, and automation are being adopted by several agritech startups.
Government initiatives such as Digital India, Make in India, startup funds, and accelerator and incubator programs have been instrumental in accelerating the growth of agritech startups, particularly during the pandemic.
However, the paper cautioned that despite the progress made, agritech startups in India face significant challenges in scaling up their operations. The sustainability of these startups depends on the adoption of modern technologies by farmers.
“Key challenges hindering growth include insufficient funding, fragmented landholdings, and the longer time required to achieve revenue generation,” it added.

Title: Scientists decode brain activity to help treat anxiety and depression
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:32:00 +0000
Content: A team of scientists has uncovered new regions of the brain that support social interactions and are in constant communication with the ancient amygdala region—a discovery that could help treat psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression.
In a study conducted by Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine in the US, and published in the journal Science Advances, scientists sought to better understand how humans evolved to become highly skilled at interpreting what’s happening in other people’s minds.
“We spend a lot of time wondering, ‘What is that person feeling, thinking? Did I say something to upset them?’” said senior author Rodrigo Braga.
The brain regions that enable these abilities are part of the human brain’s more recently evolved areas, suggesting that this skill is a relatively new development in evolutionary terms.
“In essence, you’re putting yourself in someone else’s mind and making inferences about what that person is thinking when you cannot really know,” Braga explained.
The study found that the advanced parts of the human brain supporting social interactions—known as the social cognitive network—are connected to and in constant communication with the ancient amygdala.
Often referred to as the “lizard brain,” the amygdala is typically associated with detecting threats and processing fear.
“The amygdala is responsible for social behaviours like parenting, mating, aggression, and navigating social-dominance hierarchies,” Braga said. While earlier studies have observed co-activation of the amygdala and the social cognitive network, Braga noted that “our study is novel because it shows the communication is always happening.”
Within the amygdala, a specific region called the medial nucleus plays a critical role in social behaviours.
This study is the first to show that the medial nucleus of the amygdala is directly connected to newly evolved regions of the social cognitive network, which are involved in thinking about other people.
This connection allows the social cognitive network to access the amygdala’s role in processing emotionally significant content, the researchers explained.
Both anxiety and depression are linked to hyperactivity in the amygdala, which can lead to excessive emotional responses and impaired emotional regulation.
The study’s findings suggest that less-invasive treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), could potentially use this new knowledge of brain connections to improve treatment outcomes, the authors noted.

Title: Cargo ship sails directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh for first time in 53 years
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:25:50 +0000
Content: On 11 November, a cargo ship docked at Chittagong port in Bangladesh, overlooking the Bay of Bengal. It became the first ship to travel directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh in 53 years. The Panama-flagged M.V. Yuan Xiang Fa Zhan is operated by Anhui Guohai Sanlong Shipping of China. It first travelled from the U.A.E. to Pakistan, and then reached Bangladesh, before its onward journey to Malaysia. Chittagong port authorities said that the ship brought goods from Pakistan and the U.A.E., including raw materials for Bangladesh’s garment industry and basic foodstuffs. Previously, cargo used to be shipped from Pakistan to Bangladesh via third countries, such as, Sri Lanka, Singapore, or, Malaysia. Pakistani goods had to be off-loaded onto feeder vessels in some of these countries before travelling to Bangladesh.
A direct sea link between two erstwhile enemies is one of many changes that Bangladesh has witnessed in recent months, starting with the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August after a bloody agitation by students against a controversial quota system for Government jobs. The protests culminated in the escape of Hasina to India and the installation of an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Since then, Bangladesh’s relations with India have nose-dived.
The killing of Hindus in Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh has only made the relationship worse. Recently, a grocer in Chittagong called the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also known as Iskcon, a terrorist group, which angered the Hindu community in the neighbourhood. The clashes that followed the Facebook post by the grocer left many injured. Hindus, who make up 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population, have traditionally supported the Awami League party headed by Sheikh Hasina. Just recently, Bangladesh’s Attorney-General Mohammad Asaduzzaman called for removing Socialism and Secularism from the country’s Constitution. It has sparked fears among minorities of Bangladesh turning into an Islamic state.
In sharp contrast, Bangladesh’s ties with Pakistan are looking up despite decades of animosity. Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971. It became an independent country after a nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan. Bangladesh claims that Pakistan committed a genocide, killing 3 million of its people, and, raping hundreds and thousands of women. But in the last three months, Bangladesh and Pakistan have taken a number of steps that indicate a reset or reboot in their relationship.
— In September, Muhammad Yunus met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly in the U.S.
— The same month, Bangladesh eased import restrictions on Pakistani goods. Yunus ended mandatory, physical, inspection of goods imported from Pakistan. Such imports were previously required to undertake a physical inspection when the goods arrived, causing long delays.
— In October, Yunus cancelled certain national holidays that commemorated the 1971 Liberation War or Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
— And, in November, Bangladesh lifted a ban on students from Pakistan.
For its part, Pakistan announced free visas to Bangladesh businesspersons and certain other categories of applicants. Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Dhaka, Syed Ahmed Maroof, sparked widespread discussion on social media in Bangladesh when he said that the direct shipping route was a major step in boosting trade across the region. He wrote on Facebook that the route will promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides.
It is a radical departure from the position adopted by the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s Government.
— In 2022, Hasina denied permission to a Chinese-built Pakistani warship, the P.N.S. Taimur, from docking at Chittagong port.
— In 2015, Hasina imposed a ban on Pakistani students following Pakistan’s refusal to acknowledge the genocide and atrocities committed during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971.
— Hasina established a national Tribunal in 2010 to investigate war crimes committed in 1971 and bring the guilty to justice. The Tribunal has since convicted and sentenced numerous individuals for crimes against humanity.
The direct maritime route between Pakistan and Bangladesh poses certain challenges for India.
— For one, it could at some point into the future give rise to gun-running and drug-smuggling.
— Two, India has a more than 4-thousand-kilometre-long porous border with Bangladesh, which further complicates matters.
— Three, insurgents operating in India’s north-eastern states bordering Bangladesh and China could seek to exploit the situation.
— And last but not the least, India would need to be watchful of a growing Pakistan – China nexus in the Bay of Bengal region.
India’s fears are not without reason. The Chittagong arms haul is fresh in the minds of many. In April 2004, Bangladesh’s agencies seized illegal arms and ammunition in Chittagong. The weapons were meant for the United Liberation Front of Asom, also known as Ulfa, which operates in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam. An alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power at the time. New Delhi believed that the cache of weapons was also meant for other insurgent groups in India’s north-east in order to destabilise the region.
So will history repeat itself? For now, New Delhi is watching and waiting.

Title: Bangladesh: B.N.P. – Yunus fight out in the open
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:14:25 +0000
Content: Cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that catapulted 84-year-old Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to power. Will the Bangladesh Nationalist Party play ball? And will the Army sit idly by?
The Interim Government of Bangladesh completed a hundred days on 15 November. No grand celebrations were held. No big speeches were made on the occasion. An uneasy calm prevails in the country’s capital Dhaka, which saw a pitched battle between the police and protesters in the months leading up to the overthrow of the Government of the day.
The so-called Revolution is over, but, protests are taking place more than ever in Dhaka. People are not exactly despondent but they’re restless and impatient. Non-stop demonstrations have been reported from near the Secretariat Building – the administrative nerve centre of Bangladesh’s Government. If Government Land Office employees want higher pay and benefits, some want protections for Sufi religious shrines. Others such as garment workers hold a protest over unpaid wages. Elseqhere in Dhaka, protesters hold a torch procession on 31 October to demand better treatment of minorities in the country following a sedition charge against 19 people. The procession was led by the Bangladesh United Minority Alliance after the 19 were said to have disrespected Bangladesh’s national flag in the south-eastern city of Chittagong. The protesters called for the withdrawal of the charges against the 19, who included Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, the divisional organising secretary of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known by its acronym Iskcon, which is a Hindu religious movement. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has called for minority protection and a national process of truth and healing.
Recent developments
Here’s a quick recap of all that happened since the 5 August ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, followed by the installation of an Interim Government led by the Nobel Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, on 8 August.
In August, the U.N. calls for a peaceful and democratic transition. It urges all parties to respect human rights and ensure transparency and accountability. At the request of the interim government, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights establishes a fact-finding mission to analyse root causes and provide concrete recommendations on the next steps Bangladesh should take to address the past violations and to ensure non-recurrence.
In September, protests continue, with demonstrators demanding accountability for the violent suppression of earlier protests.
In October, the Interim Government faces legal and political challenges, including debates about its legitimacy and the need for Constitutional reforms. The International Crimes Tribunal – which was established under Bangladesh law to try and punish any individual or group of individuals responsible for committing Crimes against Humanity or Genocide in Bangladesh – issues arrest warrants for Sheikh Hasina and more than 40 others for their alleged roles in massacres and killings that took place during the protests in July and August. Mahfuj Alam, the Special Assistant to the Interim Government’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, announces that family members of the “martyred” Anti-Discrimination Student Movement would receive 30 lakh Taka, that is, about 88-thousand dollars.
And, in November, the U.N. again reminds Dhaka of the importance of a peaceful transition and the rule of law.
100 days of Yunus
A Belgium-based N.G.O., International Crisis Group, released a report titled “A New Era in Bangladesh? The First Hundred Days of Reform” in which it says that the Bangladesh Government, led by Yunus should balance demands for justice with the need for reconciliation, staying within the bounds of the Constitution to mitigate the danger of its decisions being invalidated later.
It says that the Government, which is expected to remain in office for another year or longer, should seek to hold fresh elections under a reformed polling system within a realistic timeframe, which should not extend beyond 18 months.
The report cautions that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Bangladesh to improve governance and put checks and balances in place that would stop another autocratic regime from emerging.
It warns that if the Interim Government falters, the country could revert to the status quo ante, or, worse, enter a period of military rule.
The message is clear: Yunus should avoid staying in power for too long. He should build a consensus among political parties because experience and history alike suggest that the longer an Interim Government remains in power, the larger the doubts about its legitimacy grows. Therefore, managing, let alone meeting, public expectation will be extremely challenging for the Government.
Cracks emerging
Already, the fissures are out in the open. Most noticeably, between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Yunus-led Interim Government. The B.N.P. wants an early election but the Interim Government is not willing to play ball.
Thousands of B.N.P. supporters rallied in Dhaka on 8 November demanding the holding of an election. The friends turned frenemies are no longer singing from the same hymn sheet, especially because it was the Interim Government that released B.N.P. chief Khaleda Zia from house arrest and acquitted her of corruption charges. The B.N.P. now fears that the Yunus-led Interim Government is in no mood to hold an election and that it wants to extend its rule in perpetuity. The B.N.P. wants to avoid a repeat of the past, when an Army-controlled Caretaker Government in 2006 stayed beyond its mandated three months and delayed the election by about two years, only to bring Sheikh Hasina back to power.
Things have come to such a pass that the B.N.P. is openly opposing the Interim Government’s proposal to ban its arch-rival, the Awami League – whom it ousted in the recent protests. The B.N.P. also suspects that the Interim Government might toy with the idea of reviving the Minus-Two Formula of yore, which was invoked by some caretaker governments of the past to keep the two Begums away –Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.
The B.N.P. is suspicious of the motives of student leaders, academics and others who want to delegitimise the party for their vested interests. The B.N.P. has time and again voiced its frustration over the lack of a “roadmap” for the transition to democracy. Its Secretary-General, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, has called on the Interim Government to open talks with politicians, and, hold an election within a “reasonable” time. Would he be O.K. if an election was held after two or three years? “I don’t think people will accept that,” he retorts.
Thomas Kean, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, says that cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that pushed Yunus into power. He says that for now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged.
Yunus appeals
For his part, Yunus has begged for the country’s patience to prepare for the much-awaited election. “I am not sure how much reform we will be able to make. But I promise you, if you give us the opportunity, we will complete some mandatory reforms and then go for the highly sought-after election we all are looking for. I would request you to keep patience till then. We want to create an exemplary electoral system that can be followed for years. It will save our country from annual political crises. To ensure these, I am asking for the necessary time from you,” he says in a televised address to the nation.
The Government has since appointed a new chief election commissioner and four other commissioners. Yunus says that a road map for the next election would be unveiled once electoral reforms are completed but he won’t give a timeframe for the election.
Bangladesh’s Constitutional Reform Commission has to submit its recommendations to the Government by 31 December. Its aim is to draft a new Constitution. Five other Reform Commissions are likely to submit their reports by the end of December, too.
Chequered history
Bangladesh has long struggled with political instability and military influence. In its 53 years of independence, the country has faced 29 attempted military coups, starting with the first in 1975, just four years after independence.
Bangladesh appears to be heading toward not only a political reset but also a Constitutional overhaul. The country’s Attorney General, Mohammed Asaduzzaman, has suggested removing the world “secular” from the Constitution, citing the fact that 90 per cent of Bangladesh’s population follows Islam.
So, are the fears of Bangladesh becoming an Islamic state genuine?
How will the proposed changes to the Constitution impact the country’s minorities?
Will Hindus be safe?
Will the Interim Government stay true to its promise of holding an election?
And will the Military continue to watch from the sidelines or take matters into its own hands?
There are no easy answers to these questions.
How much power the Bangladesh Army is willing to relinquish in favour of the Yunus-led Interim Government will be critical to ensuring a peaceful, democratic transition.
As things stand now, an early election is not likely. Yunus has said that the timing of the election is a political decision and that people will decide how long this Interim Government will remain in power.
Bangladesh stands at a familiar crossroads once again.
While many celebrate what they call a “Third Independence”, others remain cautiously optimistic, wary of the recurring sounds of military boots echoing through the power corridors of Dhaka.

Title: Swimmer McKeon retires as Australia’s most successful Olympian
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:44:15 +0000
Content: Australia’s most decorated Olympian, Emma McKeon, announced her retirement from all forms of swimming on Monday (November 25), bringing an end to a glittering career in which she won 14 medals at three Olympics and 20 at world championships.
The 30-year-old sprinter had signalled her retirement earlier this year at the Paris Olympics after winning a gold, silver and bronze in relays to help Australia to its most successful Summer Games.
McKeon missed out on the London Olympics as a teenager but hit her stride in Rio in 2016 where she won her first gold in the 4x100m relay as well as silvers in two other relays and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. In Tokyo in 2021, she won the 100m and 50m freestyle sprint titles which, along with two relay golds and three bronze medals, gave her the biggest medal haul for a single athlete at the delayed Games.
As well as her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was also part of relay teams which set eight world records in the pool, three of which still stand.

Title: Contentious COP29 deal shows climate cooperation fraying at edges
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:41:20 +0000
Content: When COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev stepped to the podium at the closing meeting of the Baku climate summit on Sunday morning, hoping to clinch a hard-fought agreement on global climate finance, he carried with him two speeches.
One was crafted around a hoped-for deal being struck, while the other for the possibility of a summit-collapsing impasse, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
“Yes, we had prepared different variations of the speech for various scenarios, but as we stepped onto the stage, we were confident in our success,” said one of the sources, an official in the COP29 presidency.
In the end, Babayev managed to gavel through the $300 billion finance plan to help developing nations cope with the soaring costs of global warming over the next decade before critics had time to object, allowing him to read the more positive speech.
He praised the agreement as a breakthrough and shamed the deal’s doubters as “wrong”, even as many of the climate deal’s intended recipients slammed it as woefully inadequate.
Babayev’s preparation for different outcomes at the divisive summit in the Caspian Sea nation of Azerbaijan reflected what many in the audience had already known before it began: the Baku climate talks were never going to go smoothly.
Expectations for a deal were depressed by worries of a looming U.S. withdrawal from global climate cooperation, geopolitical turmoil, and a rise of isolationist politics that had shunted climate change off much of the world’s top priorities list.
Those obstacles loomed large in Baku and will continue to overshadow global climate efforts in the months ahead as Brazil prepares for next year’s much broader conference in the Amazon rainforest city of Belem – where the world will plot a years-long course for steeper emissions cuts and building resilience in the fight against climate change.
“Multilateralism as a whole is under threat,” said Eliot Whittington, chief systems change officer at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.
“Indeed, the UNFCCC is probably the bright spot – proving that even in the face of incredibly hostile geopolitics and on fundamentally difficult questions, a deal can be made,” he said, referring to the U.N. body sponsoring the annual climate summit.
But the slow pace of progress, with global emissions still rising, has raised tensions and calls for reform.
“This is something that needs to be looked at, when just a handful of countries, based on their own economic interests, can almost wreck the entire process,” Sierra Leone Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai told Reuters.

Title: Those rejected by people repeatedly, try to control House through chaos: PM Modi slams Oppn
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:15:45 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on the Opposition on Monday, accusing them of disrupting Parliament and denying meaningful discussions.
He stated that those “who have been rejected by the people multiple times are attempting to control the House through chaos.”
Speaking to the media ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament, PM Modi underscored the significance of this session, terming it a special occasion as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Indian Constitution.
“This is the Winter Session, hopefully, the atmosphere will also be cool. This is the last session of 2024, and the country is enthusiastically awaiting 2025. This session is special in many ways. The most significant aspect is that our Constitution is entering its 75th year — a monumental moment for our democracy. Tomorrow, we will commence this extraordinary occasion together in the new Parliament building,” he said.
The Prime Minister highlighted the rigorous deliberations undertaken by the framers of the Constitution, leading to the creation of a remarkable document. “One of the Constitution’s key elements is our Parliament and our parliamentarians,” he added.
Calling for productive and healthy debates, PM Modi took aim at the Opposition for obstructing proceedings.
“The people who have been rejected repeatedly by the electorate, try to control Parliament through disruptions. While they fail, their actions are being closely observed by the people of the country. The most troubling aspect is that new MPs, who bring fresh ideas and perspectives, are being denied their rightful opportunity to speak in Parliament due to such disruptions,” he said.
Stressing the importance of intergenerational learning in a democracy, the Prime Minister said, “Every generation in a democracy has the responsibility to train future generations. However, those rejected by the people 80-90 times do not let discussions take place in Parliament.”
“They neither understand the aspirations of the people nor live up to their expectations, and that is why the public continues to reject them,” he added.
Reflecting on India’s growing prominence on the global stage, PM Modi said, “The world looks at India with hope. At such a crucial time, our discussions in Parliament can further enhance India’s standing before the world. India rarely gets opportunities like this, and it is our duty to ensure that the trust voters place in democracy and the Constitution is upheld through meaningful work in Parliament.”
He urged all members to make up for lost time and engage in substantive debates on critical issues.
“A message should go out that the dedication of voters to democracy, the Constitution, and the sanctity of parliamentary proceedings is being honoured by their elected representatives,” he said.
The Prime Minister concluded by expressing hope for a productive session, stressing that healthy discussions are essential to address the nation’s pressing concerns.
“The voters of India are committed to democracy, their loyalty to the Constitution, and their confidence in the parliamentary system. It is essential for everyone in Parliament to reflect the sentiments of the people. To achieve this, we must discuss various aspects of each topic in a constructive manner. This will inspire future generations as well. I hope this session proves to be productive, and I encourage all esteemed MPs to approach it with passion and enthusiasm,” he said.

Title: Ideologies may differ but country is supreme: Speaker Om Birla
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:06:44 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday underscored the importance of prioritizing the nation above differing ideologies and viewpoints. Reflecting on the unity demonstrated by the diverse members of the Constituent Assembly, he highlighted the strength of democracy in embracing differences while working for a common goal.
“On Constitution Day, we need to draw inspiration from the debates and discussions of the Constituent Assembly. Despite their differences, members engaged in positive and meaningful dialogue. Differences are inherent to democracy, but they should not hinder us from coming together for the nation. Ideologies and expressions may vary, but the country must always come first,” Birla told ANI.
Recalling his predecessors, Birla said they had remained steadfastly loyal to the Constitution, working under its guidance. “The Constitution is respected by everyone, including the Judiciary, Executive, and Legislative branches. Babasaheb Ambedkar remarked that a Constitution’s success depends on the vision and capability of those implementing it. We have always upheld the Constitution and ensured that democratic institutions, whether Parliament or Assemblies, function within its framework,” Birla stated.
He further emphasized that the Constitution should remain above politics, describing it as a social document and a catalyst for social and economic change. “The Constitution is our strength. It has enabled us to bring social and economic reforms while ensuring respect for the marginalized and disadvantaged. Today, the world studies India’s Constitution to understand its ideology and the progressive step of granting voting rights to all classes and castes without discrimination at that time. This foundational spirit unites us and drives collective action. That’s why the Constitution must not be drawn into the realm of politics,” Birla said.
Birla also asserted that no government, regardless of its party or ideology, can alter the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Amendments made over time, he explained, have always aimed to align with the rights and aspirations of the people.

Title: India’s economic growth expected to accelerate in Oct-Dec quarter: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:59:50 +0000
Content: India’s economy is projected to grow at a faster pace in the third quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2024) compared to the first half (April-September 2024) as positive indicators are emerging with economic activity picking up pace, according to a report by ICRA.
The report states that the preliminary data for November indicates a positive trend. The growth in electricity demand has picked up, while festive season demand continues to drive an increase in vehicle registrations. “These trends reinforce ICRA’s expectations of a pick-up in the GDP growth in Q3 FY2025 compared to H1 FY2025.”
Economic indicators related to mobility and transportation have also shown significant improvement. Vehicle registrations surged to 32.4 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, a sharp recovery from a contraction of 8.7 per cent in September 2024, the report points out.
This increase is fuelled by a strong demand for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles. Petrol consumption rose to 8.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in September, and domestic air passenger traffic increased to 9.6 per cent from 6.4 per cent.
Additionally, two-wheeler production grew by 13.4 per cent, rail freight improved to 1.5 per cent from a decline of 0.7 per cent, and diesel consumption recorded marginal growth of 0.1 per cent after a contraction of 1.9 per cent in September.
The report further states that the country’s non-oil exports have posted a robust growth of 25.6 per cent in October 2024, up from 6.8 per cent in September. The main contributors to this growth include high-value manufactured items such as electronic products, engineering goods, chemicals, and readymade garments.
The ICRA’s Business Activity Monitor, a composite indicator of economic activities, showed a year-on-year growth of 10.1 per cent in October 2024, the highest in eight months. This is an improvement from the 6.6 per cent growth recorded in September 2024, despite challenges from a high base effect, the report states. The upbeat trends across various sectors reflect India’s economic resilience and reinforce expectations of stronger GDP growth in the coming months, the report added. (IANS)

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 today, November 25, at 3 PM at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.  
For the first time in its 130-year history, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) is hosting its Global Cooperative Conference and General Assembly in India. Organized by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in partnership with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives such as AMUL and KRIBHCO, the event will run from November 25 to 30.  
With the theme, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” the conference resonates with the Indian Government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The program will include discussions, panel sessions, and workshops to explore how cooperatives can tackle global challenges and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Topics such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth will be addressed.
During the event, PM Modi will officially launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, centered around the theme, “Cooperatives Build a Better World.”This initiative highlights the pivotal role of cooperatives in fostering social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development. Recognized by the UN SDGs as essential to reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and eradicating poverty, cooperatives will take center stage in this global campaign to address pressing global challenges.  
PM will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s dedication to the cooperative movement. The stamp design features a lotus, representing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, in line with the cooperative principles of sustainability and community development. Its five petals reflect the Panchatatva (five elements of nature), underlining cooperatives’ focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The stamp also integrates imagery from various cooperative sectors such as agriculture, dairy, fisheries, housing, and technology, including a drone symbolizing modern agricultural innovation.  
The conference will welcome prominent international figures, including Prime Minister of Bhutan Dasho Tshering Tobgay and Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji Manoa Kamikamica, along with approximately 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries.

Title: Centre to unveil startups under new National Quantum Mission guidelines
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 12:48:44 +0000
Content: The government is set to announce startups selected for support under the newly-established guidelines as part of the National Quantum Mission.
Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Dr. Jitendra Singh, will unveil the startups in the field of quantum technologies on November 26, showcasing India’s growing expertise in quantum research, development, and commercialization.
The selected startups, representing cutting-edge innovation in diverse areas including quantum communication, computing, sensing, and material sciences, were chosen through a rigorous evaluation process.
These pioneering ventures are poised to contribute significantly to India’s quantum ecosystem, addressing critical technological challenges and driving economic growth, said the ministry.
The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has established detailed guidelines to support and nurture startups in the field of quantum technologies.
These guidelines provide a structured framework for startups to access essential resources, funding opportunities, mentorship, and infrastructure support, empowering them to accelerate innovation and contribute to India’s quantum ecosystem.
A call for proposals was launched earlier this year by the I-HUB Quantum Technology Foundation, a Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) established at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS).
According to the ministry, the response from startups across the nation showcased the increasing interest in quantum technologies and the potential for ground-breaking advancements.
“With the growing momentum in India’s start-up ecosystem, the National Quantum Mission is dedicated to nurturing ventures in quantum technology and propelling the nation toward worldwide excellence in this transformative field,” it added.
India launched the National Quantum Mission in April 2023 to build capabilities in quantum-related science and technology. Today, there are more than 600 scientists and over 50 startups working in quantum technology in the country.

Title: Emerging patterns: BJP’s pro-incumbency wave in Maharashtra and beyond
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 12:06:45 +0000
Content: Maharashtra was once a Congress bastion. Now, the BJP is the dominant political party there, maintaining its lead election after election and scripting a clear narrative in a state that had become riddled with fractured electoral numbers since 1990.
In Maharashtra, no political party had touched the 100-seat threshold in the 288-member assembly since the 1990 polls. The BJP made history in 2014 when it won 122 seats and maintained its lead in upcoming elections. The party won over 100 seats in 2019 and solidified its central position in state politics in 2024, showing its strongest performance so far, with a strike rate touching 90%. The party won 132 out of 149 seats it contested.
The 2024 state election results show people’s trust in the BJP-led alliance’s vision for the state’s future and its governance model. Leading the Mahayuti alliance, the BJP faced off against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)a, coalition comprising the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray faction – SHSUBT), the Nationalist Congress Party (led by Sharad Pawar) (NCP – NCPSP), and the Congress (INC).
The outcome was a clear and massive victory for the BJP-led Mahayuti and can be seen as a shift towards stability and development after the political crises seen in the state over the last five years, with vertical splits in two of its major political parties, the Shiv Sena and the NCP.
The two splits meant the state now had five major political parties with overlapping geographical spheres of influence between different Shiv Sena and NCP factions. That implied the possibility of increased political instability in the state. The election outcome appears settled to address that for the next five years.
The spectacular win registered by the BJP is a testament to the party’s organisational strength, strategic planning, and commitment to the people of Maharashtra. Its allies, the Shiv Sena and the NCP, have also delivered strong performances, winning 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
On the other hand, the Congress, which once dominated Maharashtra’s politics, managed to secure just 16 of the 101 seats it contested, highlighting its declining electoral appeal. The party that has ruled Maharashtra for decades, either directly or in alliances, was reduced to a poor strike rate of 16% this time. Its alliance partner Shiv Sena (UBT) won just 20 seats, while the NCP (SP) was reduced to 10 seats, a significant decline from the 2019 and previous assembly poll results in the state.
Journey to the Electoral Shift
Maharashtra’s political journey began on May 1, 1960, when Bombay State was split into Maharashtra and Gujarat. The outgoing state electorally had 396 assembly seats, which were divided between Maharashtra, with 264 constituencies, and Gujarat, with 132 constituencies. Subsequently, the assembly constituencies were raised to 288 with census data and district modifications.
For decades, the Congress party held sway over Maharashtra, winning election after election from 1951-52 until 1978. However, things began to change in 1978 when Sharad Pawar, then just 38 years old, left the Congress to form the Congress (Socialist) party, marking the beginning of Maharashtra’s coalition era.
The 1978 assembly elections saw the Congress party split into Congress (Indira) and Congress (Devraj Urs). The Janata Party won 99 seats, Congress (Urs) secured 69, and Congress (Indira) won 62 seats. A coalition government was formed, led by Vasantdada Patil, with the support of Congress (Urs) and Congress (Indira), but it was short-lived. It was replaced by Sharad Pawar, who joined hands with the Janata Party and eventually became the youngest Maharashtra CM.
In 1980, the Indira Gandhi-led Union government dismissed Sharad Pawar’s government, and Congress returned to power with the new state election results. The party continued its dominance, winning the 1985 assembly elections and emerging as the largest party in the 1990 elections, securing 141 of the 288 seats. However, the political landscape of Maharashtra was gradually changing.
The 1995 assembly elections marked a turning point, as the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition ended Congress’s long-standing electoral hold. The Shiv Sena won 73 seats with BJP’s 65 seats. Manohar Joshi of Shiv Sena took over as the CM. In February 1999, the Shiv Sena replaced Manohar Joshi with Narayan Rane.
The 1999 elections witnessed a three-way contest between Shiv Sena-BJP, Congress, and NCP. The Shiv Sena won 69 seats, the BJP got 56, the Congress had 75 seats, and the NCP had 58 seats. After the election, the Congress and the NCP allied to form the government. The coalition continued to rule Maharashtra till 2014, registering victories in the 2004 and 2009 assembly elections.
However, the tide began to turn in 2014.
Historically, Shiv Sena had been the senior partner in Maharashtra politics, but as the BJP’s influence grew, the dynamics shifted, leading to tensions. When numbers were with the Shiv Sena, the BJP respected that, but when it came to the BJP’s electoral dominance in the state, the Shiv Sena refused to take a similar line. In 2014, the Shiv Sena broke away from the BJP, only to return after the BJP formed the government with outside support from the NCP. It was the year that marked the BJP’s rising dominance in Maharashtra politics, making it the single largest party with seat counts twice as large as other political parties.
In 2019, both parties fought the Lok Sabha and assembly elections together, but disputes over the chief ministerial post led to a split. In a surprising move, the Shiv Sena allied with the Congress and the NCP, forming the MVA government, with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
Uddhav Thackeray’s decision didn’t sit well with many of the Shiv Sena leaders who found their ideologies close to the BJP. In June 2022, a Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde broke away from the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction, formed an alliance with the BJP, leading to a new state government formation with Shinde being sworn in as the CM. In February 2023, the Election Commission of India awarded the original Shiv Sena name and symbol to the Shinde faction, calling it the real Shiv Sena.
In July 2023, the NCP also experienced a split, with a major party faction led by Ajit Pawar joining the BJP-led alliance. Ajit Pawar was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister. In February 2024, the Election Commission of India awarded the original party name and symbol (‘Clock’) to the Ajit Pawar faction.
The Road Ahead
The BJP’s continued electoral dominance in the state, India’s richest province, after its record-breaking performance in the Haryana assembly election concluded in October 2024,writes a new electoral pattern in India that is based on governance and development.
The results of these two assembly elections add to many electoral firsts achieved by the party and set a trend that is expected to shape India’s electoral journey in the upcoming assembly elections ahead.
The party has emerged as the largest party in every Maharashtra region and will begin the BJP-led NDA’s third term in the last 10 years. Of the last 10 years, the party-led alliance has ruled the state for over seven years. It has retained Haryana for a third consecutive term this year, the first political party to achieve such an electoral feat in the state.
It became the first political party in Uttar Pradesh since 1985 to retain consecutive terms with 2017 and 2022 victories. Uttarakhand had a trend of changing governments every five years; the BJP defied that with 2017 and 2022 poll victories. Defying anti-incumbency, it retained its governments in states like Assam, Tripura, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it was not a potent political force earlier.
The fact that the BJP won many of these states with better electoral numbers in subsequent polls indicates that the electoral population benefits from its governance model and supports the party or party-led alliances in upcoming elections.

Title: Inflation to ease, economic growth to accelerate in coming months: Finance Ministry
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 11:42:47 +0000
Content: India’s food inflation is likely to ease while the growth outlook for the economy is “cautiously optimistic” for the coming months as the agricultural sector is likely to benefit from favourable monsoon conditions, increased minimum support prices and adequate supply of inputs, according to the Finance Ministry’s monthly economic review released on Monday.
India’s retail inflation jumped to 6.21 percent in October, marking a 14-month high, driven by elevated food inflation in a few vegetables. Supply disruptions from heavy rains in major producing states contributed to price pressures on tomatoes, onions, and potatoes.
However, the bright agricultural production prospects suggest a more manageable inflation outlook, despite existing price pressures on select food items. Early November trends signalled moderation in key food prices, though geopolitical factors may continue to impact domestic inflation and supply chains, the report states.
Amid a challenging global environment, and after a brief period of softening momentum over the monsoon months, many high-frequency indicators of economic activity in India have shown a rebound in October.
These include indicators of rural and urban demand, as well as supply-side variables such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index and E-way bill generation, the report states.
On the employment front, the formal workforce is expanding, with notable increases in manufacturing jobs and a strong inflow of youth into organized sectors, it added.
As far as the external sector is concerned, the report states that India’s export recovery may encounter challenges due to softening demand in developed markets.
However, trade in the services sector is sustaining momentum. Apart from the emerging indications of domestic growth and stability, the dynamics of global interest rates, earnings growth and valuation, geopolitical developments, and policy decisions of the next administration in the US will determine the course of trade and capital flows.
Recent developments in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have caused some concern in financial markets with safe-haven assets such as US Treasuries and gold finding a bid. Geopolitical conditions remain fragile, according to the report.

Title: “Connectivity will be the new element of India-Mediterranean ties; IMEC can be a game changer”: Jaishankar at MED dialogues
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 11:21:21 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized the growing importance of connectivity in strengthening India’s relationship with the Mediterranean region, describing the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) as a potential “game changer.” Speaking at the MED Mediterranean Dialogues Conference in Rome on Monday, Jaishankar highlighted how connectivity would be a new key element in these ties, particularly amid the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict and its regional impacts.
“The Mediterranean presents both opportunities and risks in an uncertain and volatile world. Beyond extrapolating current trends, the new element of our relationship will be connectivity. The IMEC, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor that was announced in September 2020, can be a game changer,” Jaishankar said in his opening remarks.
He acknowledged the challenges posed by the current Middle East conflict but assured that progress on IMEC continues, especially between India, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Jaishankar also highlighted the significance of the I2U2 grouping, which includes India, Israel, the UAE, and the US, predicting that it would become increasingly active in the future.
The IMEC, launched during India’s G20 presidency, aims to enhance connectivity and integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe through a network involving countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and the European Union. Jaishankar’s comments at the conference emphasized the continued forward momentum despite regional tensions.
Shifting focus to India’s engagement with the Mediterranean, Jaishankar revealed that the region holds substantial economic and political relevance for India, with annual trade totaling approximately USD 80 billion. He also said the presence of a large Indian diaspora, with about 460,000 people residing in Mediterranean countries, 40 percent of whom are based in Italy.
India’s key interests in the Mediterranean, according to Jaishankar, span various sectors, including fertilizers, energy, technology, diamonds, defense, and cyber capabilities. India is also actively involved in significant infrastructure projects, such as airports, ports, railways, and green hydrogen initiatives.
Jaishankar further explained India’s robust ties with the Middle East, citing the Gulf region’s annual trade with India, which stands between USD 160 billion and USD 180 billion. An additional USD 20 billion comes from trade with the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. He highlighted the substantial presence of over 9 million Indians living and working in the Middle East, with India’s activities there deeply rooted in energy, technology, industrial projects, and services. The Minister also acknowledged India’s long-standing historical, cultural, and security ties with the region.
“Let me now shift to the Middle East and present India’s interest there. Our trade with the Gulf alone is in the range of 160 to 180 billion dollars annually. The rest of MENA adds about another USD 20 billion. More than 9 million Indians live and work in the Middle East. Whether it is energy, technology, industrial projects, or services… It is also a region to which we are connected in history, culture, and security,” Jaishankar said, adding that India’s presence and activities in the region would continue to grow as the country advances towards becoming the third-largest economy in the world.
Jaishankar’s remarks came as part of his ongoing three-day official visit to Italy, during which he is also participating in the Outreach Session of the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiuggi, Italy, where India has been invited as a guest country.

The rally was broad-based, while capex-linked sectors like infra, capital goods, and industrials outperformed in expectation of a surge in new order inflows.
“The prospects of H2 remain positive due to a good monsoon, festival, and marriage season, which could ease the impact of earnings downgrades that happened in Q2,” an expert added.
On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs 1,278.37 crore. Conversely, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) supported the market with net purchases of Rs 1,722.15 crore, highlighting robust domestic buying interest despite weak global sentiment.

Title: Olympic medallist Richardson banned from competing for Australia after allegiance switch
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:53:57 +0000
Content: Matthew Richardson will not be permitted to rejoin the Australian Cycling Team in the future, governing body AusCycling said on Monday, following a review into the cyclist’s switch of allegiance from Australia to Britain.
England-born Richardson switched his international allegiance to Britain in August, days after winning silver in the individual sprint and the keirin as well as bronze in the team sprint at the Paris Olympics.
The 25-year-old’s defection triggered some criticism from former cyclists in Australia.
In its review of the incident, AusCycling said Richardson had requested that world governing body UCI delay official disclosure of his nationality change until after the Olympics, while also withholding the news from AusCycling and teammates.
The body added that Richardson asked to take AusCycling property including a custom bike, cockpit, and Olympic race suit to Britain.
“The review, which involved a thorough investigation of Richardson’s actions, has determined he acted in a way which conflicted with the values of AusCycling, the Australian National Team and the broader cycling community,” the body said.
“Richardson will not be eligible to rejoin the Australian Cycling Team at any point in the future.
“He is also prohibited from using any resources associated with the Australian Cycling Team or its partners. Richardson will be ineligible for any AusCycling-related awards, effective immediately.”
Under UCI rules, cyclists who switch allegiance are not eligible to represent their new national team at the following edition of world and continental championships, meaning Richardson missed last month’s world championships in Denmark.

Title: Tech-wary Germans get hooked with online shopping habit
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:43:46 +0000
Content: In only a few years, Germans have become a nation of online shoppers, with most now turning to devices to buy clothes, groceries and medicines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A survey showed that 99% of adults in Germany, where more than 70% of companies still use fax machines, now shop online, with 39% of respondents doing so at least once a week.
This is despite Germans being more negative on technology trends than the European average, with a 2022 McKinsey study finding them particularly critical of hyper-personalisation.
But that is changing, according to the study from the German GfK institute with Mastercard, seen exclusively by Reuters.
Alvaro Pinilla furnished his new apartment in Berlin online, buying lamps, kitchen utensils, rugs and furniture online.
“It is the comfort of not having to leave home,” the 30-year-old lawyer told Reuters. “I also think that online prices are as competitive, or even better than, in a physical store.”
Black Friday and Cyber Monday, as well as the impending Christmas season, will mark highs for online trade and Germany’s main retail association HDE expects sales of 87.1 billion euros ($91.66 billion) for the e-commerce industry this year.
“If there’s a week when I haven’t bought anything, my brain tells me ‘time to treat yourself’,” said Pinilla, who plans to take advantage of Black Friday discounts to buy a new coat, boots, scarf and gloves.
The survey of more than 1,000 respondents found that fashion is by far the most popular product category in online retail: Two-thirds ordered clothing and shoes online in the past 12 months, while at the start of the pandemic in 2020 it was 43%.
“I’ve kind of got into the habit of buying online during the pandemic,” Pinilla told Reuters, adding he had got better at finding the things he wanted.
Germany accounted for $37.6 billion of Amazon’s revenue in 2023, making it the company’s biggest international market.
‘SALES QUEEN’
Sarah Schedler also enjoys buying clothes online, because she feels she can find what she needs faster than in a store.
“If something is at full price, I usually put it on my wish list and then wait until it’s reduced,” said Schedler, a 29-year-old content manager. “I’m a bit of a sales queen.”
Electronics are the second most popular category for online shoppers, the GfK survey showed, with almost half of Germans ordering these products online this year.
Schedler plans to replace her 10-year-old laptop this Black Friday as she has seen good deals.
“I have the feeling that the prices are somehow lower online, but it could just be my feeling,” she said.
In just four years, online grocery shopping has also risen to 25% from 7% in 2020, while the proportion of people who order personal care products on the Internet has almost doubled, from 18% in 2020 to 35% in 2024, GfK said.
Almost four in 10 Germans prefer to shop on their mobile phone, 10% a tablet and half from a computer, the survey showed.
“Most people always have their smartphone ready … This makes it easy to make spontaneous purchases,” said Peter Robejsek, Mastercard Germany managing director.
HDE estimates sales of almost 47 billion euros were generated via smartphones, which accounted for a record 55% of total online retail sales in Germany last year.

Title: Kremlin says Trump circle is talking about a peace deal for Ukraine as Biden escalates
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:36:46 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday it had noted that President-elect Donald Trump’s circle was speaking about a potential peace plan for Ukraine while the current U.S. administration of Joe Biden was not and was seeking to escalate the conflict instead.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made his remarks after being asked to comment on an interview that Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, gave to Fox News on Sunday.
Waltz said that Trump had been “very concerned” about an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine and that the war must be brought “to a responsible end”.
Waltz noted what he said was the involvement of North Korea and Iran in the conflict, Russia’s use of a hypersonic ballistic missile against Ukraine, a decision by some Western countries to let Kyiv fire their missiles deep into Russia, and said South Korea was considering whether to get involved too.
“What we need to be discussing is who’s at that table, whether it’s an agreement, an armistice, how to get both sides to the table, and then what’s the framework of a deal,” Waltz said.
Peskov said the Kremlin had taken note of the comments and that President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly signalled that Moscow was ready for dialogue over Ukraine.
“Indeed, from the circle of Trump supporters and those who have been nominated for future positions in the future administration, the word ‘peace’ or ‘peace plan’ is being heard,” Peskov said, when asked about Waltz’s comments.
“No such words are being heard from the current (Biden) administration while provocative escalatory actions continue. That is the reality that we face,” he said.
Putin spelled out in June what he wanted in order to start peace talks – for Ukraine to drop its NATO membership ambitions and to hand over the entirety of four provinces claimed by Moscow.
Moscow says the terms reflect reality on the battlefield where Russian forces have been advancing. But Ukraine says such terms would amount to an unacceptable capitulation for Kyiv.

Title: After SC suggestion, CAQM permits hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:56:17 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has permitted hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools following a suggestion by the Supreme Court to consider relaxing restrictions on educational institutions.
The CAQM directed state governments in Delhi-NCR to ensure that all classes up to the 12th standard operate in a hybrid mode, acknowledging the challenges faced by primary schools that lack the capability to conduct classes entirely online.
The Supreme Court, while urging the CAQM to review restrictions, noted that many students are being deprived of mid-day meals due to school closures and the lack of access to online education facilities. The bench highlighted that children in homes without air purifiers may face the same air quality challenges as they would in schools, necessitating immediate action to address these issues.
The apex court also asked the commission to specifically evaluate the ban on physical classes for students in Classes 10 and 12, given their academic requirements. “We expect a decision to be made by the Commission during the day or by tomorrow morning to ensure timely implementation. All other Stage IV measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) must continue to be rigorously enforced,” the court stated.
Additionally, the Supreme Court ordered the CAQM to take immediate action against defaulting officers and entities that have failed to implement Stage IV measures of GRAP in Delhi-NCR. The court emphasized that relaxation of Stage IV norms would not be considered unless there is a consistent downward trend in the Air Quality Index (AQI).
The case, addressing broader pollution control measures, is set to be heard next on Thursday.

Title: Cabinet approves ₹7,927 crore multitracking projects to boost rail connectivity
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:41:28 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved three major multitracking projects for Indian Railways at a cost of approximately ₹7,927 crore. The initiative aims to enhance rail connectivity, reduce congestion, and contribute to economic growth.
The projects include the Jalgaon-Manmad 4th Line (160 km), Bhusawal-Khandwa 3rd & 4th Line (131 km), and Prayagraj (Iradatganj)-Manikpur 3rd Line (84 km), covering a total length of 639 km. These tracks are part of the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan, designed to integrate multi-modal connectivity and ensure the seamless movement of people and goods.
According to an official release, the projects span seven districts across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, impacting around 1,319 villages and benefiting a population of approximately 38 lakh. Notably, the improved connectivity will serve two aspirational districts, Khandwa and Chitrakoot, and enhance the Mumbai-Prayagraj-Varanasi route, a key rail corridor.
The enhanced rail infrastructure is expected to accommodate more passenger trains, making it easier for pilgrims to access religious sites such as Trimbakeshwar in Nashik, Omkareshwar in Khandwa, Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi, and other locations in Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, and Shirdi. Tourists will also benefit from improved access to heritage sites like the Ajanta and Ellora Caves and Khajuraho.
On the freight front, the projects are poised to add an estimated 51 million tonnes of annual freight capacity, facilitating the transport of agricultural produce, coal, steel, and cement. This is expected to lower logistics costs and stimulate economic growth.
The environmentally friendly rail infrastructure will contribute to India’s climate goals, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 271 crore kilograms annually—equivalent to planting 11 crore trees. “These projects not only support economic development but also underline India’s commitment to sustainability,” the release said.

It addresses the critical need to keep our agricultural land free of chemicals, ensuring healthier and more sustainable farming practices,” Vaishnaw said.
The mission aims to transition farmers towards natural farming methods that are chemical-free and rooted in traditional knowledge systems. These practices involve integrating local livestock with diversified crop systems, utilizing location-specific technologies, and promoting agro-ecological principles tailored to local conditions.
According to an official release, NMNF is designed to support farmers in reducing the cost of cultivation by decreasing reliance on externally purchased inputs. By fostering healthy soil ecosystems, encouraging biodiversity, and promoting diverse cropping systems, the mission aims to enhance agricultural resilience and sustainability.
Natural Farming (NF) will provide safe, nutritious food for consumers while also ensuring long-term soil health and environmental sustainability. The initiative seeks to revive and strengthen traditional agricultural practices, making them more climate-resilient and sustainable for both farmer families and consumers.

Title: Named in FIR, Sambhal MP and MLA’s son deny involvement in violence
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:17:35 +0000
Content: Facing FIRs over the deadly violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal city, Samajwadi Party MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq and Nawab Suhail Iqbal, son of SP legislator Iqbal Mehmood, on Monday denied any wrongdoing and accused the administration and police of mishandling the situation, which led to the deaths of four people.
MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq told IANS, “I have been booked in a false case by the police, who are trying to hide their own failure.”
Barq and Nawab Suhail Iqbal were named in seven FIRs filed by the Uttar Pradesh Police against 400 people for the violence on Sunday.
The unrest left four people dead and dozens injured, including 22 police personnel, during protests against a court-ordered survey of the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid. The survey was prompted by a petition claiming the mosque was constructed in 1529 after demolishing a Hindu temple.
Barq asserted his innocence, stating, “I was not even in Sambhal when the violence occurred. I was attending a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in Bangalore.” He also demanded action against the policemen responsible for what he described as the killing of innocent youths.
Denying allegations of delivering inflammatory speeches, Barq claimed he had previously intervened to prevent violence when an earlier survey attempt was made.
Similarly, Nawab Suhail Iqbal denied his involvement in the violence, saying, “Show me any video or photo that proves I was present at the site.” He added that he had stayed home as directed by the administration and even attempted to convince people to cooperate with the survey team.
Iqbal confirmed visiting the mosque in the morning to convey his father’s message, urging people to cooperate with the court-ordered survey team. He emphasized that he had not delivered any speech inciting communal hatred.
Advocate Zafar Ali, representing the Jama Masjid in Sambhal, also claimed that neither the MP nor the MLA’s son was present at the scene of the violence. “The SDM and police officials are to blame for the deaths of four people,” he said, adding that the survey team found nothing objectionable during its inspection.
Police sources reported that at least 25 individuals, including two women, have been detained or arrested in connection with Sunday’s violence. Protesters allegedly torched vehicles and pelted stones, prompting police to use tear gas and baton charges to disperse the crowd.
SP MP Awadhesh Prasad expressed grief over the incident, calling it “heartbreaking and painful” and accused the BJP of inciting unrest to divert attention from electoral issues. He defended Barq, stating, “The MP was with us at the time of the violence. This is a baseless case aimed at silencing him in Parliament.”

Title: Centre approves ₹3,689 crore investment for two hydroelectric projects in Arunachal Pradesh
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:59:41 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday approved an investment of ₹3,689 crore for the construction of two hydroelectric projects in Arunachal Pradesh’s Shi Yomi district. Both projects are expected to be completed within 50 months.
An outlay of ₹1,939 crore has been sanctioned for the Heo Hydroelectric Project (HEP), while ₹1,750 crore has been approved for the Tato-I Hydroelectric Project (HEP), according to an official statement issued after the CCEA meeting.
The Heo Hydroelectric Project (HEP), with an installed capacity of 240 MW (3 x 80 MW), is expected to generate 1,000 Million Units (MU) of energy annually. The power produced will enhance the electricity supply in Arunachal Pradesh and contribute to balancing the national grid.
The Tato-I Hydroelectric Project (HEP), with an installed capacity of 186 MW (3 x 62 MW), will generate 802 MU of energy annually, further strengthening the state’s power infrastructure and the national grid.
Both projects will be implemented through a joint venture between the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. (NEEPCO) and the government of Arunachal Pradesh.
The Government of India will extend budgetary support of ₹127.28 crore and ₹77.37 crore for the Heo and Tato-I projects, respectively, to facilitate the construction of roads, bridges, and associated transmission lines under enabling infrastructure. Additionally, Central Financial Assistance of ₹130.43 crore and ₹120.43 crore has been approved for the equity share of the state in the respective projects.
The projects will offer Arunachal Pradesh 12% free power and an additional 1% for the Local Area Development Fund (LADF). These measures aim to drive significant socio-economic development and infrastructure improvements in the region.
Infrastructure enhancements include the development of around 10 kilometers of roads and bridges, primarily for local use. Dedicated project funds of ₹15 crore will finance essential facilities such as hospitals, schools, vocational training institutes like ITIs, marketplaces, and playgrounds.
The projects are expected to generate substantial employment during construction and operation phases. Approximately 200 personnel from NEEPCO and around 400 workers from contractors will be engaged during construction. Indirect employment opportunities will arise through small contracts, services, and various allied activities.
In addition to direct employment, the projects will stimulate economic activity in transportation, tourism, and small-scale businesses, contributing to the region’s growth. Local communities will also benefit from compensations, CSR initiatives, and vocational training programs.
The hydroelectric projects align with the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan by promoting local enterprise involvement, eco-friendly energy generation, and self-reliance.

Title: Centre approves PAN 2.0 project worth ₹1,435 crore to transform taxpayer registration
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:49:29 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday approved the Income Tax Department’s PAN 2.0 project with an allocation of ₹1,435 crore.
The PAN 2.0 project aims to introduce a technology-driven overhaul of taxpayer registration services, offering several key benefits, including improved accessibility, faster service delivery, enhanced data accuracy, eco-friendly processes, cost efficiency, and upgraded infrastructure security for greater agility.
According to a cabinet communique, the project is an e-governance initiative designed to re-engineer the business processes of taxpayer registration services. It will enable a more seamless digital experience for taxpayers through a revamped PAN/TAN ecosystem.
The project will consolidate core and non-core PAN/TAN activities and upgrade the PAN validation service, thereby replacing the existing PAN/TAN 1.0 system.
The CCEA noted that the PAN 2.0 project aligns with the government’s Digital India vision by establishing PAN as a universal identifier across digital systems for specified government agencies.
Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has expressed confidence in surpassing the direct tax collection target of ₹22.07 lakh crore set in the Union Budget for the current fiscal year.
Between April 1 and November 10 of the current financial year, India’s net direct tax collections—comprising corporate tax and personal income tax—rose by 15.4% to ₹12.1 lakh crore, according to the latest data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
The ₹22.07 lakh crore collection target for FY24 includes ₹10.20 lakh crore from corporate tax and ₹11.87 lakh crore from personal income tax, non-corporate tax, and other categories.

Title: SC issues notice on PIL seeking directions to integrate legal education, self-defence training into school curriculum
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:42:40 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking directions to incorporate legal education and self-defence training into the school curriculum.
A bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan issued notices to the Centre and state governments, seeking their responses on the matter. The plea is tentatively listed for hearing on January 7, 2024, as per the computerised case status.
The petition, filed by advocate Reepak Kansal, argued that integrating legal education and self-defence training in schools would empower students with knowledge of their rights and equip them to handle unforeseen threats.
“It is essential for every citizen to understand the basic laws of the nation to assert and protect their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. In the absence of legal knowledge, individuals may struggle to fully exercise these rights,” the petition stated. It further emphasized the need for self-defence training at the school level, enabling children to protect themselves in adverse situations.
Highlighting India’s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990), the plea underscored the importance of protecting children from all forms of violence and abuse. Articles 39(e) and 39(f) of the Indian Constitution also mandate the government to safeguard children and ensure equal opportunities for their development.
The petition referred to Section 34 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, which protects individuals acting in private defence from criminal liability. It suggested that teaching this provision to school students would help them understand their legal rights and develop skills to safeguard themselves in emergencies.
“Several incidents have shown that child victims were unable to defend themselves due to a lack of self-defence skills. Educating students about Section 34 of the BNS, 2023, would prepare them to protect themselves and seek help in critical situations,” the PIL said.
The petition also emphasized that legal literacy would enhance students’ understanding of their rights, enable them to avoid illegal activities, and empower them to seek assistance when needed. It added that this would particularly benefit girls by boosting their confidence and teaching them essential self-defence skills.

Title: Supreme court refuses to ease GRAP-IV curbs amid Delhi’s alarming air pollution levels
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:27:05 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday declined to relax the stringent measures imposed under the fourth stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-IV) in Delhi to combat severe air pollution. However, the court directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider easing restrictions on educational institutions, highlighting the adverse impact on students deprived of midday meals, online learning, and access to air purifiers.
The GRAP-IV measures were enforced last week after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassed the hazardous 450 mark. The Supreme Court had previously asserted that these curbs could not be eased without its explicit approval.
A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and A.G. Masih instructed the CAQM to review whether exceptions could be made or norms relaxed, particularly for schools and Anganwadis, which have remained closed under the GRAP-IV guidelines. The bench mandated the CAQM to decide on the issue by today or tomorrow morning, ensuring implementation of any changes by Wednesday.
The court also addressed the ongoing ban on physical classes for 10th and 12th-grade students, leaving it to the Commission to decide whether this restriction should continue. However, the apex court made it clear that GRAP-IV measures would not be relaxed unless there was a consistent decline in AQI levels.
During the proceedings, the court emphasized the broader societal impact of GRAP-IV measures. It instructed the CAQM to ensure that laborers, daily wage workers, and other vulnerable groups do not suffer due to the restrictions. The court directed the Commission to issue necessary mitigating measures under Section 12(1) of the CAQM Act. Additionally, it ordered states to utilize labor cess funds for the welfare and subsistence of construction workers affected by the ban on construction activities.
The court also criticized lapses in enforcement, particularly regarding the implementation of GRAP-IV measures at Delhi’s 13 entry points. It noted the lack of adequate check posts and sought clarity on the number of posts operational. Amicus Curiae Aparajita Singh pointed out that while personnel had been deployed after court orders, there was confusion among them regarding directions.
Expressing dissatisfaction, the bench asked CAQM to issue show-cause notices to agencies responsible for enforcement failures and consider prosecuting them. The court also demanded details on steps taken by the Delhi Government to inform the public about the prohibition of truck entry through the city’s 13 entry points.
Despite its critical observations, the court lauded the 13 court-appointed commissioners for their efforts in monitoring compliance. Their appointments were extended, with directions to continue their site visits and submit periodic reports to the court.
The matter has been listed for further hearing on Thursday.

Title: ISRO gets government approval for Venus mission “Shukrayaan”
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:52:36 +0000
Content: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has received approval from the Indian government for its upcoming Venus Orbiting Satellite mission, named Shukrayaan, which is slated for launch in 2028. This announcement was made by Nilesh Desai, Director of ISRO, during a recent media interaction.
“The Indian government has recently given a nod to our Venus Orbiting Satellite — Shukrayaan… It will be launched in 2028… The idea of Chandrayaan 4 has been proposed as a follow up of Chandrayaan 3, where we will land not only on the moon but also will return with soil and rock samples,” Desai said.
Additionally, Desai unveiled plans for Chandrayaan 4, a follow-up to the successful Chandrayaan 3 mission. This ambitious project will be a joint effort between India and Japan, aiming for a precise landing at the Moon’s south pole at 90 degrees south latitude. This mission will also include a significantly heavier rover, weighing 350 kg—12 times the size of its predecessor. Although the project has not yet received full approval, Desai is optimistic that with governmental clearance, the mission could be executed by 2030.
Apart from these missions, ISRO is also working on enhancing its weather and communication systems. Discussions are underway regarding the launch of advanced sensors and satellites as part of the INSAT 4 series. These new technologies will enable ISRO to catch up with global advancements in meteorology and oceanography, improving weather forecasts and satellite communication systems.
Desai also shared plans for future Mars exploration. As part of the Mars mission, ISRO intends not only to place a satellite in Mars’ orbit but also to make an attempt to land on its surface.
“As a part of the Mars mission, we will not only put a satellite on the Mars orbit but we will also attempt to land on it’s suface.. Gaganyaan will be launched in the next two years.. It will be an unmanned flight after which we will launch a manned flight. The government has also given an approval to construct India’s own space station. It will not be as big as the ISS but will have five modules. We will launch the first module in 2028 and India’s space station will be ready by 2035.. As a part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to land on the moon by 2040, our space station will function as a transit facility en route,” he said. (ANI)

Title: India leads in anti-terrorism efforts: 26/11 Mumbai attacks remembered
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:46:47 +0000
Content: On the 16th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, along with other leaders, paid homage to the victims and security personnel who lost their lives during the horrific events.
The 26/11 attacks, a series of coordinated terrorist strikes by ten Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives from Pakistan, targeted key locations in Mumbai, including the Taj Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Leopold Cafe, Nariman House, Cama Hospital, and Metro Cinema.
Over three days of terror, 166 people, including 20 security personnel and 26 foreigners, were killed, while more than 300 were injured.
Taking to X, Home Minister Shah expressed his condolences and pride in India’s strengthened stance against terrorism.
“On this day in 2008, cowardly terrorists shamed humanity by killing innocent people in Mumbai. I pay my emotional tribute to the soldiers who attained martyrdom while fighting terrorists in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and salute those who lost their lives,” he wrote.
Highlighting the government’s approach, Shah stated, “Terrorism is a blot on the entire human civilisation. The Modi government’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy against terrorism has been appreciated by the entire world, and today India has become a world leader in anti-terrorism initiatives.”
BJP National President J.P. Nadda also paid his tributes, acknowledging the bravery and sacrifices made by the victims and security forces.
“I pay my heartfelt tribute and salute all the brave soldiers, policemen, and innocent citizens who made the supreme sacrifice for the country in the cowardly terrorist attack on 26/11 in Mumbai,” he wrote on X.
Nadda underscored the destructive nature of terrorism and credited Prime Minister Modi’s leadership for India’s robust anti-terrorism policies.
“Today, the tough anti-terrorism policy and global initiative of the Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made India a leader among the countries leading the anti-terrorism campaign, along with making it safe,” he added.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also marked the occasion with a heartfelt tribute.
“On the anniversary of 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, the nation remembers those who lost their lives that fateful day. We pay homage to the security personnel who fought with utmost courage and made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. We remember, and we will never forget those wounds,” the Defence Minister posted on X.

Title: Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde resigns, appointed caretaker CM
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:43:01 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde submitted his resignation to Governor C.P. Radhakrishnan on Tuesday as the term of the state assembly ended.
Deputy CMs Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis also reached the Governor’s office today morning to tender their resignation.
Shinde has been appointed the caretaker Chief Minister until the state’s government is formed.
After a decisive Mahayuti alliance win, and Bharatiya Janata Party emerging as the largest party by winning over 132 seat, the alliance is yet to decide on a Chief Minister to lead the government.
Earlier, BJP leader and former Maharashtra Assembly speaker Rahul Narvekar said that when CM Shinde resigns, he will be appointed as the caretaker CM till the new government is formed.
“Today the term of the assembly is ending. If he (CM Shinde) resigns today, he will be requested to work as a caretaker CM till a new government is formed. The leaders of the three parties, our parliamentary board, will decide on this (CM) matter. And soon the government will be formed in Maharashtra,” Narvekar told ANI.
The Mahayuti alliance is yet to decide on its Chief Ministerial candidate after its huge win in the state. Two time Chief Minister and current Deputy CM, Devendra Fadnavis is also seen as a choice for the position, as he is part of the BJP, the single largest party in the assembly.
“Out of love for me, some congregations have appealed to everyone to gather together and come to Mumbai. I am deeply grateful for your love. But I appeal that no one should come together in my support in such a manner. Once again it is my humble request that Shiv Sena workers should not assemble at Varsha bungalow (official residence of CM) or anywhere else,” said the X post by Shinde.
“After the great victory of Mahayutti, our government will be formed once again in the state. As a grand alliance, we contested the election together and are still together today,” the post added.
Earlier, Devendra Fadnavis said that the victory of the alliance will “inspire our Maharashtra.”
“This victory of the Mahayuti has given a new direction only because of your support. This success will continue to inspire our Maharashtra to realize the dream of a developed India with a developed Maharashtra under the leadership of Hon. Modiji with a progressive and inclusive future,” Devendra Fadnavis said in an open letter to the people of Maharashtra.

Title: Cricket-Stick or twist? Australia digests Perth mauling
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:07:16 +0000
Content: After fixating obsessively over one spot in the batting order for the best part of the spring, Australia’s media pundits and cricket fans have been handed a plethora of talking points by the abject defeat in the first test against India.
India’s 295-run victory was sealed inside four days at Perth Stadium on Monday, shattering Australian confidence that Pat Cummins’s team could halt the long run of series losses at the hands of the game’s financial superpower.
If the humiliation of India being able to declare their second innings on 487-6 reflected poorly on the bowling unit, it was the Australian batting line-up dismissed for 104 in their first innings that bore the brunt of the blame.
Debutant Nathan McSweeney, who won the much-discussed race to open the batting, was not alone in being awarded derisory marks in the media player ratings with Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith also hovering around the 2/10 mark.
Marnus Labuschagne, once the world’s top-ranked test batsman, received 1/10 in one publication after making five runs in two innings in Perth, the second brought to an end when he was trapped in front by Jasprit Bumrah without offering a shot.
“The top order is a major concern,” former test skipper Greg Chappell wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
“To avoid forced changes, they must deliver in Adelaide. Marnus Labuschagne knows he is under pressure … he must rediscover his form quickly and revert to the free-flowing style of old.”
Chappell’s view that the players who underperformed in Perth be given a chance to redeem themselves in the day-night second test in Adelaide was supported by other former players.
“I’m giving them Adelaide,” 119-test wicketkeeper Ian Healy told SEN radio.
“They can do it, they can do it, as long as they train smart this week and get really fresh and fit and strong.”
More importantly, perhaps, captain Cummins thought wholesale changes were highly unlikely after just one test in the five-match series.
GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS
The good news for Australia is that they have played seven pink ball tests at Adelaide Oval and won them all, including an eight-wicket victory over India in 2020 when they dismissed the tourists for 36 in their second innings.
The bad news is that they have not won a home series after losing the first test since they beat West Indies in 1968-69 and will probably face a stronger Indian line-up when the second test begins on Dec. 6. Paceman Bumrah, uniformly awarded 10/10 by Australian media for his performance in Perth, will hand the captaincy back to the returning Rohit Sharma, while Shubman Gill could be fit to play after recovering from a thumb injury.
For cricket writer Bharat Sundaresan, the biggest concern for Australia was not the playing talent in the squad but the body language of the home team in Perth when the match was not going their way.
“It (was) a thrashing. It (was) a hammering worthy of the level of outrage from the cricket fans around the country,” he wrote in The Australian newspaper.
“More so in the wake of just how defeated the Australians looked at the end of day three, a day that will go down in infamy … for the complete lack of challenge posed by them against the unrelenting assault by the Indians …”

Content: The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved One Nation One Subscription, a new Central Sector Scheme for providing country-wide access to scholarly research articles and journal publication. PM Modi has time and again pointed out the importance of research and development in our country in the Amrit Kaal.
The scheme will be administered through a simple, user friendly and fully digital process. This will be a “One Nation One Subscription” facility for the government higher education institutions and R&D laboratories of the central government.
A total of about Rs.6,000 crore has been allocated for One Nation One Subscription for 3 calendar years, 2025, 2026 and 2027 as a new Central Sector Scheme. One Nation One Subscription will build on and further enhance the scope and reach of the range of initiatives undertaken by the Government of India over the past decade in the domains of education, for maximizing access to quality higher education for the youth of India.
This will supplement the ANRF initiative to promote research and development and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout government universities, colleges, research institutions, and R&D laboratories.
The benefits of One Nation One Subscription scheme will be provided to all Higher Educational Institutions under the management of the Central or State Government and Research & Development Institutions of the Central Government, through a national subscription coordinated by a central agency, namely the Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET), an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission (UGC).
This list covers more than 6,300 institutions, translating into nearly 1.8 crore students, faculty and researchers, who will be able to potentially avail benefits of One Nation One Subscription.
This is in line with the goals of Viksitbharat@2047, National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). The initiative will expand access to scholarly journals to a vast diaspora of students, faculty, researchers and scientists of all disciplines, including those in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, thereby promoting core as well as interdisciplinary research in the country.
The ANRF will periodically review the usage of One Nation One Subscription and publications of Indian authors of these institutions. The Department of Higher Education will have a unified portal “One Nation One Subscription” through which the institutions will be able to access the journals.
The ANRF will periodically review the usage of One Nation One Subscription and publications of Indian authors of these institutions. The DHE and other Ministries having HEIs and R&D Institutions under their management shall be proactively conducting Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns among students, faculty and researchers of these institutions about availability and method of access to One Nation One Subscription, resulting in improved usage of the facility across the country.
The State Governments will also be requested to carry out campaigns at their level for maximizing usage of the unique facility by students, faculty and researchers of all government institutions.

Content: Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav met with British leaders and business executives on Monday as part of his week-long trip to the UK and Germany from November 24-30. The visit aims to attract global investors to Madhya Pradesh by showcasing the state’s opportunities across key sectors.
During the meeting, UK House of Lords member Raminder Ranger praised India’s rapid economic growth. “The future belongs to India. Economies in Europe and America are stagnating, but India is growing phenomenally at 7-8%, which is incredible for a country of its size,” he said.
Raminder highlighted India’s democratic stability and strong legal system as key factors encouraging foreign investment.
He also lauded India’s hard-working population, citing the success of Indian leaders in global blue-chip companies as proof of their dedication. “The returns of investments into India will be very quick and very big,” he added.
Another House of Lords member, Kulveer Ranger, also expressed optimism about Madhya Pradesh’s investment potential. He pointed to opportunities in solar energy, technology ecosystems, higher education, agriculture, and health tech.
Echoing Prime Minister Modi’s vision of the Indian diaspora as “living bridges,” Kulveer Ranger emphasized that the All Party Parliamentary Group for India in the UK would work to strengthen connections and boost investment ties with Madhya Pradesh.

Title: Sensex, Nifty rise as realty gains and investor sentiment lift markets
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:05:06 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened higher on Tuesday, driven by buying in the realty sector and positive momentum from the previous two sessions.
The Sensex climbed 94.14 points, or 0.12%, to reach 80,203.9, while the Nifty advanced 31.20 points, or 0.13%, to 24,253.10 as of 9:53 AM.
However, market analysts cautioned that the indices may not see sustained gains due to a subdued earnings season, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. The Nifty’s recent performance has raised key support levels, with a drop below 23,956 likely to trigger renewed bearish sentiment.
On the global front, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s reported selection of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary was viewed positively by market experts, given Bessent’s reputation as a fiscal conservative. This could help lower U.S. bond yields, potentially benefiting emerging markets, including India.
Market breadth remained favorable, with 1,572 stocks advancing and 694 declining.
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank, midcap, and smallcap registered modest gains. Top performers on the Sensex included Infosys, Tata Steel, and ICICI Bank, while UltraTech Cement and Hindustan Unilever saw declines.
In broader Asian markets, Jakarta, Seoul, and Tokyo declined, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Bangkok traded higher.

Title: Trump vows new Canada, Mexico, China tariffs that threaten global trade
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:03:21 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Monday pledged significant tariffs on the United States’ three largest trading partners—Canada, Mexico, and China—detailing his plans to implement campaign promises that could potentially trigger trade wars.
Trump, who will take office on January 20, 2025, announced he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico unless they take stronger action to curb drugs, especially fentanyl, and halt illegal migration. This move could violate existing free-trade agreements.
He also revealed plans for an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, marking some of his most specific comments about his economic agenda since winning the Nov. 5 election on promises to “put America first.”
“On January 20th, as one of my first Executive Orders, I will sign documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products entering the United States, and address its ridiculous open borders,” he posted on Truth Social.
Despite record migrant arrests under President Joe Biden, illegal border crossings have significantly dropped this year due to new restrictions and increased enforcement by Mexico.
Trump’s tariff proposals could disrupt industries, particularly those reliant on Mexico as a manufacturing base for the U.S. market. This could affect many Asian auto and electronics manufacturers. His tariff plans also seem to contradict the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed into law in 2020, which ensures largely duty-free trade between the countries. The agreement includes a “sunset” provision, which could allow Trump to renegotiate it in 2026.
After issuing his tariff threat, Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to discuss trade and border security. A Canadian source indicated the conversation was productive, and they agreed to remain in contact.
Trump’s threatened tariffs could serve as leverage to prompt renegotiations of the USMCA, said William Reinsch, a former president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “This strikes me more as a threat than anything else,” he said.
Mexico’s Ricardo Monreal, leader of the ruling Morena party, advocated for using bilateral mechanisms to address issues like human trafficking and drug trade, warning that escalating trade retaliation would only harm consumers.
Trump’s announcement led to a rally in the U.S. dollar, which rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while Asian and European equity markets fell.
On China, Trump criticized Beijing for not doing enough to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. from Mexico, threatening a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.
A Chinese embassy spokesperson responded, stating that China-U.S. trade cooperation is mutually beneficial and emphasized that no one wins a trade war. The spokesperson added that China had already taken steps to limit fentanyl-related exports.
Trump has previously threatened to end China’s most-favored-nation trading status and impose tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese imports.
Trump’s tariff proposals, including the potential invocation of the USMCA’s six-year review provision in 2026, have sparked concerns about a significant shift in U.S. trade policy. Economists warn that such tariffs could inflate costs, disrupt global trade, and impact U.S. businesses and consumers.

Title: One killed, dozens injured in clashes with Imran Khan’s supporters near Pakistan’s capital
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:02:56 +0000
Content: At least one police officer was killed and dozens of people injured in Pakistan as supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan clashed with security forces outside the capital Islamabad on Monday, officials and Khan’s party said.
Authorities have enforced a security lockdown for the last two days after Khan called for a march on parliament for a sit-in demonstration to demand his release, while highways into the city have been barricaded.
One police officer was shot and killed, at least 119 others were injured, and 22 police vehicles were torched in clashes just outside Islamabad and elsewhere in the Punjab province, provincial police chief Usman Anwar said. Two officers were in critical condition, he said.
Khan’s party said scores of its workers were also hurt.
It said the jailed leader’s third wife, Bushra Bibi, and a key aide, Ali Amin Gandapur, who is the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, were leading a march that arrived almost inside Islamabad on Monday night.
The government has used shipping containers to block major roads and streets in Islamabad, with patrols of police and paramilitary personnel in riot gear.
Officials and witnesses said all public transport between cities and terminals had also been shut down in the eastern province to keep away the protesters,
Provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari said about 80 of Khan’s supporters had been arrested.
Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told local Geo News TV that the government sought talks with leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to calm the situation. “It was a sincere attempt I must say but it didn’t yield any results,” he said.
