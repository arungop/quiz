Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:01 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 on Monday (November 25) at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital. The event will be attended by representatives from over 100 countries.
This marks the first time in the 130-year history of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) that both the ICA Global Cooperative Conference and the ICA General Assembly are being organized in India, which is the premier body for the global cooperative movement.
The Global Conference, hosted by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in collaboration with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives AMUL and KRIBHCO, will take place from November 25-30.
The theme of the conference, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” aligns with the Indian government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The event will feature discussions, panel sessions, and workshops focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities faced by cooperatives worldwide, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These discussions will touch on areas such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth.
Prime Minister Modi will also launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, which will focus on the theme “Cooperatives Build a Better World.” This initiative will highlight the transformative role cooperatives play in promoting social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development.
The UN SDGs recognize cooperatives as crucial drivers of sustainable development, especially in reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and alleviating poverty. The year 2025 will showcase the power of cooperative enterprises in addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges.
As part of the event, the Prime Minister will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s commitment to the cooperative movement. The stamp features a lotus, symbolizing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, all reflective of the cooperative values of sustainability and community development.
The five petals of the lotus represent the five elements of nature (Panchatatva), highlighting cooperatives’ dedication to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The design also incorporates sectors like agriculture, dairy, fisheries, consumer cooperatives, and housing, with a drone symbolizing the role of modern technology in agriculture.
Bhutan’s Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica, and around 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries will also participate in the event.

Soren confirmed the date of the oath-taking ceremony while addressing the media on Sunday, stating, “On 28 November, the oath ceremony of the new government will take place.”
Earlier, Soren tendered his resignation as Chief Minister to Governor Santosh Gangwar and staked a claim to form the next government at the Raj Bhawan. “Today, we have started the procedure to form the INDIA alliance government and, as part of this process, we have staked our claim to form the government in front of the Governor. I also tendered my resignation… Congress and the RJD in-charge were also present here,” Soren said.
Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay added that Soren had been elected as the leader of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. “All party workers and leaders extended their support, and Hemant Soren was chosen as the leader of the Jharkhand Assembly House… the tentative date for the oath-taking is 28th,” Sahay stated.
The JMM, under Soren’s leadership, led the INDIA alliance to a decisive victory in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, securing 56 seats. Of these, JMM won 34 seats, while its allies Congress, RJD, and CPI-ML secured 16, 4, and 2 seats respectively.
In contrast, the BJP-led NDA alliance garnered only 24 seats, with the BJP securing 21 seats and its allies—the AJSU Party, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), and JD-U—winning one seat each.
In addition, Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha, a smaller party, secured a seat with Jairam Kumar Mahato winning in the Dumri constituency.
The JMM-led alliance retained power in Jharkhand following the assembly elections, which were held in two phases on November 13 and November 20.

Title: Gujarat’s heritage sites attract over 21 lakh tourists in 2023-24
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:48:02 +0000
Content: Gujarat, renowned for its cultural and historical legacy, has become a prime destination for tourists, both domestic and international, with its heritage sites leading the way.
According to the Gujarat Tourism Department, more than 21 lakh tourists visited the state’s major heritage sites in the year 2023-24. To further enhance these sites, the Gujarat government has invested over Rs 428 crore in development projects aimed at improving tourism facilities across the state.
In celebration of World Heritage Week, which is observed globally from November 19 to November 25, UNESCO highlights the significance of preserving cultural and historical heritage. In India, the Archaeological Survey of India partners with various institutions to organize events at historical sites, emphasizing the theme for 2024, “Discover and Experiencing Diversity.”
Under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat has focused on making its heritage sites more attractive and accessible to tourists. Notable investments include Rs 255 crore for tourism-friendly facilities at Vadnagar and Dholavira.
Vadnagar, the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has seen remarkable growth in visitor numbers. The state government has spent Rs 70 crore over three years to modernize the site’s infrastructure. As a result, the number of visitors to Vadnagar has surged nearly threefold, from 2.4 lakh in 2022-23 to approximately 7 lakh in 2023-24.
Similarly, Dholavira, a UNESCO World Heritage Site representing the Indus Valley Civilization, has been the recipient of substantial development funding. The Gujarat government has earmarked Rs 185 crore for tourism projects at Dholavira, with Phase 1 investments of Rs 76 crore already underway. Visitor numbers at Dholavira have more than doubled, from 1.41 lakh in 2022-23 to over 2.32 lakh in 2023-24.
The state’s renowned heritage sites, including the Sun Temple at Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav, have also seen increased popularity. To improve the tourism infrastructure at these locations, the government has invested Rs 20 crore, Rs 18 crore, and Rs 5 crore, respectively. These sites experienced a rise in tourist footfall, with Modhera, Rani ki Vav, and Adalaj ni Vav seeing increases in visitors from 3.78 lakh, 3.52 lakh, and 3.72 lakh in 2022-23 to 3.81 lakh, 3.83 lakh, and 3.86 lakh in 2023-24.
In addition to developing tourism infrastructure, Gujarat is focusing on the restoration of historical forts. Notable projects include the Rs 74 crore restoration of Uparkot Fort, Rs 21 crore for the restoration of Rajmahal in Amreli, and Rs 25 crore allocated for Lakhpat Fort.
On World Tourism Day 2024, the Government of India recognized Hafeshwar village in Gujarat as the Best Tourism Village in the heritage category. To further enhance the village’s tourism appeal, the Gujarat government plans to invest Rs 10 crore in additional tourism facilities.

Title: “Govt ready to discuss any topic, only request is House should run well”: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:40:44 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, emphasized that the government is “ready to discuss any topic” in the upcoming winter session of Parliament, but stressed the importance of a peaceful and productive session.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday after the all-party meeting in Delhi, Rijiju said that numerous topics had been raised for discussion as the winter session is set to commence tomorrow. “A total of 42 leaders from 30 political parties were present in the meeting. There are many topics, and everyone has asked for discussions on various issues. However, we want a meaningful discussion in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The government is ready to discuss any topic, but our only request is that the House should function smoothly without disruptions. We need everyone’s cooperation for the smooth running of the session,” Rijiju said.
The minister also highlighted that there will be no parliamentary session on November 26 in observance of Constitution Day. “The session will begin tomorrow, but there will be no proceedings on November 26 as we celebrate Constitution Day. The 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution will be marked at the Constitution House with members of both Houses. President Droupadi Murmu will address the gathering, and we will release significant documents related to the Constitution,” Rijiju added.
Rijiju explained that since 2015, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Constitution Day has been celebrated annually to honor the document’s importance. “Many people are unaware of the processes involved in the creation of the Constitution. The book we are releasing is not just a book; it contains important photographs and descriptions. We must make an effort to spread awareness of the Constitution’s significance to the public,” he said.
Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, speaking after the meeting, urged for a discussion on the Adani Group’s indictment by the US Justice Department in a bribery case. “Congress has requested that the matter be discussed first in Parliament. The US court has taken cognizance of the fact that the Adani Group is not only controlling the industry but also influencing the government, with a bribe of Rs 2,300 crore involved. This is a serious issue and should be addressed promptly,” Tiwari said.
Tiwari also expressed concern over the ongoing situation in Manipur, criticizing the government’s handling of the state. “We raised the issue of Manipur and the fact that the Chief Minister (Biren Singh) has not been removed, and the Prime Minister has not visited the state. This neglect has contributed to the violence, including rapes and murders, in the region,” he said.
Additionally, Tiwari called for a statement from Prime Minister Modi in Parliament to clarify the situation regarding disengagement on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “There have been talks of disengagement on the LAC, and it is crucial that the government provide clarity on this issue in Parliament. Other pressing matters such as unemployment and pollution should also be discussed, as these issues are deeply affecting the country,” Tiwari added.
The all-party meeting was attended by floor leaders from various political parties, including Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari, K. Suresh, and JD(U) MP Upendra Kushwaha, among others. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 25 and continue until December 20.

Title: IPL 2025 Auction: Shreyas Iyer sold to PBKS for record-breaking bid of Rs 26.75 cr
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 11:17:37 +0000
Content: Former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain and IPL 2024-winning leader Shreyas Iyer was sold to Punjab Kings (PBKS) for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore, the highest-ever bid in the history of the IPL, during the IPL 2024 Auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah on Sunday.
With a base price of Rs 2 crore, KKR wasted no time in making the first bid for their former leader. However, Punjab Kings quickly joined the fray, pushing the price up to Rs 2.20 crore.
As the price surged to Rs 5 crore, it became a two-horse race between KKR and PBKS. The tension mounted as KKR pushed their bid to Rs 7.25 crore, but in a dramatic twist, Delhi Capitals (DC) entered the bidding with a Rs 7.50 crore offer. DC raised the stakes to Rs 10 crore, but the bid climbed steadily as PBKS and DC traded blows, reaching Rs 13.50 crore, then Rs 16 crore, and eventually Rs 20 crore.
At Rs 22 crore, PBKS seemed determined, but DC countered with Rs 22.50 crore. PBKS responded by pushing the bid to Rs 24.75 crore, only for DC to raise it to Rs 25 crore, making Iyer officially the most expensive player in the league’s history.
However, PBKS retaliated with Rs 26.25 crore, and after some final back-and-forth, they secured Iyer for Rs 26.75 crore, making him a marquee player for the team.
Punjab Kings entered the auction with the highest purse of Rs 110.5 crore, having retained just two players—Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh—before the event.
Earlier, Punjab Kings acquired India pacer Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore using their Right to Match (RTM) card. Kagiso Rabada was next on the list, with Gujarat Titans securing him for Rs 10.75 crore. GT entered the auction with a purse of Rs 69 crore, after retaining Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan.

Title: Stocks in India likely to react to assembly poll results and fund flows for fresh cues
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:57:14 +0000
Content: Domestic stock markets are poised to react on Monday to the outcomes of recent state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, alongside key domestic macroeconomic data and trends in foreign institutional investor (FII) fund flows, according to market analysts.
The bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting scheduled for early December is also expected to influence investor sentiment, as analysts anticipate a 25-basis-point rate cut amid concerns over slowing economic growth and moderating inflation.
The last trading session brought much-needed relief to investors after weeks of corrections. Despite a largely negative sentiment throughout the week due to persistent FII selling, Friday witnessed a sharp recovery driven by bargain hunting in index heavyweights, helping the Nifty and Sensex end near their highs. Both indices gained nearly 2 percent, closing at 23,907.20 and 79,117.10, respectively.
“Markets will initially react to the outcomes of the Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections. Additionally, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and infrastructure output will garner significant attention. Participants are keeping a close watch on FII fund flows, given the ongoing selling spree,” said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.
Manish Goel, Founder and MD of Equentis, noted that the upcoming MPC meeting from December 4-6 is generating significant interest. “Investors are cautiously optimistic about a 25-bps rate cut, which could help address concerns over slowing growth and inflation. However, the week ahead is likely to witness heightened volatility as markets navigate political uncertainties, economic data releases, and corporate developments,” he said.
Despite the recovery, market momentum remains uncertain. Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said, “The sharp rebound in the market this week is encouraging, but it remains to be seen how long this momentum can be sustained. Factors like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing Middle East tensions, and the results of critical state elections could all have an impact in the coming week.”
Sectors such as real estate, auto, and FMCG led the rebound, while IT and banking were instrumental in capping losses and supporting the recovery. Broader indices also posted gains between 0.9 and 1.8 percent.
However, FIIs continued their selling spree, marking the third consecutive week of outflows in November. According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE), foreign investors sold equities worth ₹11,412 crore this week, taking the total net selling in November to ₹41,872 crore. Persistent outflows have added to market volatility and weighed on investor sentiment.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided critical support to the markets, purchasing equities worth ₹11,035 crore this week. Their total net buying for November stands at ₹37,559 crore, cushioning the impact of FII outflows.
Despite global and domestic challenges, analysts remain optimistic about India’s long-term growth potential. “India’s structural growth story remains intact despite short-term market fluctuations,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research.

Title: 19 agritech soonicorns, 40 minicorns embracing emerging tech for business growth: RBI paper
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:46:04 +0000
Content: The Indian agritech sector shows immense potential to bridge the technological gap in agriculture, with 19 agritech soonicorns and 40 minicorns leveraging emerging technologies like AI and innovative business models, according to a new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) paper.
While only one unicorn has been identified in India’s agritech landscape, the total number of soonicorns (startups on the verge of becoming unicorns) and minicorns (early-stage startups) is estimated at 19 and 40, respectively, stated the paper titled “Agri-Tech Startups and Innovations in Indian Agriculture” by D. Suganthi, Jobin Sebastian, and Monika Sethi.
A survey of agritech startups highlighted their reliance on government funding support, research and development, and state-backed digital infrastructure for growth.
India’s agritech ecosystem has witnessed a surge in investor interest, with investments increasing from $370 million in 2019 to $1.25 billion in 2021. However, investor interest moderated after 2021, in line with global trends.
Globally, funding for agritech companies peaked at $10.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 but sharply declined to $5.2 billion in 2023.
“In terms of funding share, the US leads with 43.2 per cent, followed by China (14.4 per cent), Canada (12 per cent), and India (8.5 per cent). This indicates that the Indian agritech ecosystem has garnered a significant share of global funding,” the paper noted.
The central government is promoting agripreneurship and innovation by reducing regulatory barriers, developing innovation-driven infrastructure, and fostering active collaboration among entrepreneurs.
“It plays a significant role in building a robust ecosystem for nurturing innovation and facilitating agritech mainstreaming by developing an agri-stack,” the paper emphasized.
Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, remote sensing, biotechnology, drones, robotics, and automation are being adopted by several agritech startups.
Government initiatives such as Digital India, Make in India, startup funds, and accelerator and incubator programs have been instrumental in accelerating the growth of agritech startups, particularly during the pandemic.
However, the paper cautioned that despite the progress made, agritech startups in India face significant challenges in scaling up their operations. The sustainability of these startups depends on the adoption of modern technologies by farmers.
“Key challenges hindering growth include insufficient funding, fragmented landholdings, and the longer time required to achieve revenue generation,” it added.

Title: Scientists decode brain activity to help treat anxiety and depression
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 10:32:00 +0000
Content: A team of scientists has uncovered new regions of the brain that support social interactions and are in constant communication with the ancient amygdala region—a discovery that could help treat psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression.
In a study conducted by Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine in the US, and published in the journal Science Advances, scientists sought to better understand how humans evolved to become highly skilled at interpreting what’s happening in other people’s minds.
“We spend a lot of time wondering, ‘What is that person feeling, thinking? Did I say something to upset them?’” said senior author Rodrigo Braga.
The brain regions that enable these abilities are part of the human brain’s more recently evolved areas, suggesting that this skill is a relatively new development in evolutionary terms.
“In essence, you’re putting yourself in someone else’s mind and making inferences about what that person is thinking when you cannot really know,” Braga explained.
The study found that the advanced parts of the human brain supporting social interactions—known as the social cognitive network—are connected to and in constant communication with the ancient amygdala.
Often referred to as the “lizard brain,” the amygdala is typically associated with detecting threats and processing fear.
“The amygdala is responsible for social behaviours like parenting, mating, aggression, and navigating social-dominance hierarchies,” Braga said. While earlier studies have observed co-activation of the amygdala and the social cognitive network, Braga noted that “our study is novel because it shows the communication is always happening.”
Within the amygdala, a specific region called the medial nucleus plays a critical role in social behaviours.
This study is the first to show that the medial nucleus of the amygdala is directly connected to newly evolved regions of the social cognitive network, which are involved in thinking about other people.
This connection allows the social cognitive network to access the amygdala’s role in processing emotionally significant content, the researchers explained.
Both anxiety and depression are linked to hyperactivity in the amygdala, which can lead to excessive emotional responses and impaired emotional regulation.
The study’s findings suggest that less-invasive treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), could potentially use this new knowledge of brain connections to improve treatment outcomes, the authors noted.

Title: Cargo ship sails directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh for first time in 53 years
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:25:50 +0000
Content: On 11 November, a cargo ship docked at Chittagong port in Bangladesh, overlooking the Bay of Bengal. It became the first ship to travel directly from Pakistan to Bangladesh in 53 years. The Panama-flagged M.V. Yuan Xiang Fa Zhan is operated by Anhui Guohai Sanlong Shipping of China. It first travelled from the U.A.E. to Pakistan, and then reached Bangladesh, before its onward journey to Malaysia. Chittagong port authorities said that the ship brought goods from Pakistan and the U.A.E., including raw materials for Bangladesh’s garment industry and basic foodstuffs. Previously, cargo used to be shipped from Pakistan to Bangladesh via third countries, such as, Sri Lanka, Singapore, or, Malaysia. Pakistani goods had to be off-loaded onto feeder vessels in some of these countries before travelling to Bangladesh.
A direct sea link between two erstwhile enemies is one of many changes that Bangladesh has witnessed in recent months, starting with the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August after a bloody agitation by students against a controversial quota system for Government jobs. The protests culminated in the escape of Hasina to India and the installation of an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Since then, Bangladesh’s relations with India have nose-dived.
The killing of Hindus in Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh has only made the relationship worse. Recently, a grocer in Chittagong called the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also known as Iskcon, a terrorist group, which angered the Hindu community in the neighbourhood. The clashes that followed the Facebook post by the grocer left many injured. Hindus, who make up 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population, have traditionally supported the Awami League party headed by Sheikh Hasina. Just recently, Bangladesh’s Attorney-General Mohammad Asaduzzaman called for removing Socialism and Secularism from the country’s Constitution. It has sparked fears among minorities of Bangladesh turning into an Islamic state.
In sharp contrast, Bangladesh’s ties with Pakistan are looking up despite decades of animosity. Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971. It became an independent country after a nine-month Liberation War against Pakistan. Bangladesh claims that Pakistan committed a genocide, killing 3 million of its people, and, raping hundreds and thousands of women. But in the last three months, Bangladesh and Pakistan have taken a number of steps that indicate a reset or reboot in their relationship.
— In September, Muhammad Yunus met Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly in the U.S.
— The same month, Bangladesh eased import restrictions on Pakistani goods. Yunus ended mandatory, physical, inspection of goods imported from Pakistan. Such imports were previously required to undertake a physical inspection when the goods arrived, causing long delays.
— In October, Yunus cancelled certain national holidays that commemorated the 1971 Liberation War or Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
— And, in November, Bangladesh lifted a ban on students from Pakistan.
For its part, Pakistan announced free visas to Bangladesh businesspersons and certain other categories of applicants. Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Dhaka, Syed Ahmed Maroof, sparked widespread discussion on social media in Bangladesh when he said that the direct shipping route was a major step in boosting trade across the region. He wrote on Facebook that the route will promote new opportunities for businesses on both sides.
It is a radical departure from the position adopted by the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s Government.
— In 2022, Hasina denied permission to a Chinese-built Pakistani warship, the P.N.S. Taimur, from docking at Chittagong port.
— In 2015, Hasina imposed a ban on Pakistani students following Pakistan’s refusal to acknowledge the genocide and atrocities committed during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971.
— Hasina established a national Tribunal in 2010 to investigate war crimes committed in 1971 and bring the guilty to justice. The Tribunal has since convicted and sentenced numerous individuals for crimes against humanity.
The direct maritime route between Pakistan and Bangladesh poses certain challenges for India.
— For one, it could at some point into the future give rise to gun-running and drug-smuggling.
— Two, India has a more than 4-thousand-kilometre-long porous border with Bangladesh, which further complicates matters.
— Three, insurgents operating in India’s north-eastern states bordering Bangladesh and China could seek to exploit the situation.
— And last but not the least, India would need to be watchful of a growing Pakistan – China nexus in the Bay of Bengal region.
India’s fears are not without reason. The Chittagong arms haul is fresh in the minds of many. In April 2004, Bangladesh’s agencies seized illegal arms and ammunition in Chittagong. The weapons were meant for the United Liberation Front of Asom, also known as Ulfa, which operates in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam. An alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was in power at the time. New Delhi believed that the cache of weapons was also meant for other insurgent groups in India’s north-east in order to destabilise the region.
So will history repeat itself? For now, New Delhi is watching and waiting.

Title: Bangladesh: B.N.P. – Yunus fight out in the open
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:14:25 +0000
Content: Cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that catapulted 84-year-old Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to power. Will the Bangladesh Nationalist Party play ball? And will the Army sit idly by?
The Interim Government of Bangladesh completed a hundred days on 15 November. No grand celebrations were held. No big speeches were made on the occasion. An uneasy calm prevails in the country’s capital Dhaka, which saw a pitched battle between the police and protesters in the months leading up to the overthrow of the Government of the day.
The so-called Revolution is over, but, protests are taking place more than ever in Dhaka. People are not exactly despondent but they’re restless and impatient. Non-stop demonstrations have been reported from near the Secretariat Building – the administrative nerve centre of Bangladesh’s Government. If Government Land Office employees want higher pay and benefits, some want protections for Sufi religious shrines. Others such as garment workers hold a protest over unpaid wages. Elseqhere in Dhaka, protesters hold a torch procession on 31 October to demand better treatment of minorities in the country following a sedition charge against 19 people. The procession was led by the Bangladesh United Minority Alliance after the 19 were said to have disrespected Bangladesh’s national flag in the south-eastern city of Chittagong. The protesters called for the withdrawal of the charges against the 19, who included Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, the divisional organising secretary of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known by its acronym Iskcon, which is a Hindu religious movement. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has called for minority protection and a national process of truth and healing.
Recent developments
Here’s a quick recap of all that happened since the 5 August ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, followed by the installation of an Interim Government led by the Nobel Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, on 8 August.
In August, the U.N. calls for a peaceful and democratic transition. It urges all parties to respect human rights and ensure transparency and accountability. At the request of the interim government, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights establishes a fact-finding mission to analyse root causes and provide concrete recommendations on the next steps Bangladesh should take to address the past violations and to ensure non-recurrence.
In September, protests continue, with demonstrators demanding accountability for the violent suppression of earlier protests.
In October, the Interim Government faces legal and political challenges, including debates about its legitimacy and the need for Constitutional reforms. The International Crimes Tribunal – which was established under Bangladesh law to try and punish any individual or group of individuals responsible for committing Crimes against Humanity or Genocide in Bangladesh – issues arrest warrants for Sheikh Hasina and more than 40 others for their alleged roles in massacres and killings that took place during the protests in July and August. Mahfuj Alam, the Special Assistant to the Interim Government’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, announces that family members of the “martyred” Anti-Discrimination Student Movement would receive 30 lakh Taka, that is, about 88-thousand dollars.
And, in November, the U.N. again reminds Dhaka of the importance of a peaceful transition and the rule of law.
100 days of Yunus
A Belgium-based N.G.O., International Crisis Group, released a report titled “A New Era in Bangladesh? The First Hundred Days of Reform” in which it says that the Bangladesh Government, led by Yunus should balance demands for justice with the need for reconciliation, staying within the bounds of the Constitution to mitigate the danger of its decisions being invalidated later.
It says that the Government, which is expected to remain in office for another year or longer, should seek to hold fresh elections under a reformed polling system within a realistic timeframe, which should not extend beyond 18 months.
The report cautions that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Bangladesh to improve governance and put checks and balances in place that would stop another autocratic regime from emerging.
It warns that if the Interim Government falters, the country could revert to the status quo ante, or, worse, enter a period of military rule.
The message is clear: Yunus should avoid staying in power for too long. He should build a consensus among political parties because experience and history alike suggest that the longer an Interim Government remains in power, the larger the doubts about its legitimacy grows. Therefore, managing, let alone meeting, public expectation will be extremely challenging for the Government.
Cracks emerging
Already, the fissures are out in the open. Most noticeably, between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Yunus-led Interim Government. The B.N.P. wants an early election but the Interim Government is not willing to play ball.
Thousands of B.N.P. supporters rallied in Dhaka on 8 November demanding the holding of an election. The friends turned frenemies are no longer singing from the same hymn sheet, especially because it was the Interim Government that released B.N.P. chief Khaleda Zia from house arrest and acquitted her of corruption charges. The B.N.P. now fears that the Yunus-led Interim Government is in no mood to hold an election and that it wants to extend its rule in perpetuity. The B.N.P. wants to avoid a repeat of the past, when an Army-controlled Caretaker Government in 2006 stayed beyond its mandated three months and delayed the election by about two years, only to bring Sheikh Hasina back to power.
Things have come to such a pass that the B.N.P. is openly opposing the Interim Government’s proposal to ban its arch-rival, the Awami League – whom it ousted in the recent protests. The B.N.P. also suspects that the Interim Government might toy with the idea of reviving the Minus-Two Formula of yore, which was invoked by some caretaker governments of the past to keep the two Begums away –Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.
The B.N.P. is suspicious of the motives of student leaders, academics and others who want to delegitimise the party for their vested interests. The B.N.P. has time and again voiced its frustration over the lack of a “roadmap” for the transition to democracy. Its Secretary-General, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, has called on the Interim Government to open talks with politicians, and, hold an election within a “reasonable” time. Would he be O.K. if an election was held after two or three years? “I don’t think people will accept that,” he retorts.
Thomas Kean, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, says that cracks are emerging in the fragile alliance that pushed Yunus into power. He says that for now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged.
Yunus appeals
For his part, Yunus has begged for the country’s patience to prepare for the much-awaited election. “I am not sure how much reform we will be able to make. But I promise you, if you give us the opportunity, we will complete some mandatory reforms and then go for the highly sought-after election we all are looking for. I would request you to keep patience till then. We want to create an exemplary electoral system that can be followed for years. It will save our country from annual political crises. To ensure these, I am asking for the necessary time from you,” he says in a televised address to the nation.
The Government has since appointed a new chief election commissioner and four other commissioners. Yunus says that a road map for the next election would be unveiled once electoral reforms are completed but he won’t give a timeframe for the election.
Bangladesh’s Constitutional Reform Commission has to submit its recommendations to the Government by 31 December. Its aim is to draft a new Constitution. Five other Reform Commissions are likely to submit their reports by the end of December, too.
Chequered history
Bangladesh has long struggled with political instability and military influence. In its 53 years of independence, the country has faced 29 attempted military coups, starting with the first in 1975, just four years after independence.
Bangladesh appears to be heading toward not only a political reset but also a Constitutional overhaul. The country’s Attorney General, Mohammed Asaduzzaman, has suggested removing the world “secular” from the Constitution, citing the fact that 90 per cent of Bangladesh’s population follows Islam.
So, are the fears of Bangladesh becoming an Islamic state genuine?
How will the proposed changes to the Constitution impact the country’s minorities?
Will Hindus be safe?
Will the Interim Government stay true to its promise of holding an election?
And will the Military continue to watch from the sidelines or take matters into its own hands?
There are no easy answers to these questions.
How much power the Bangladesh Army is willing to relinquish in favour of the Yunus-led Interim Government will be critical to ensuring a peaceful, democratic transition.
As things stand now, an early election is not likely. Yunus has said that the timing of the election is a political decision and that people will decide how long this Interim Government will remain in power.
Bangladesh stands at a familiar crossroads once again.
While many celebrate what they call a “Third Independence”, others remain cautiously optimistic, wary of the recurring sounds of military boots echoing through the power corridors of Dhaka.

Title: Swimmer McKeon retires as Australia’s most successful Olympian
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:44:15 +0000
Content: Australia’s most decorated Olympian, Emma McKeon, announced her retirement from all forms of swimming on Monday (November 25), bringing an end to a glittering career in which she won 14 medals at three Olympics and 20 at world championships.
The 30-year-old sprinter had signalled her retirement earlier this year at the Paris Olympics after winning a gold, silver and bronze in relays to help Australia to its most successful Summer Games.
McKeon missed out on the London Olympics as a teenager but hit her stride in Rio in 2016 where she won her first gold in the 4x100m relay as well as silvers in two other relays and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. In Tokyo in 2021, she won the 100m and 50m freestyle sprint titles which, along with two relay golds and three bronze medals, gave her the biggest medal haul for a single athlete at the delayed Games.
As well as her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was also part of relay teams which set eight world records in the pool, three of which still stand.

Title: Contentious COP29 deal shows climate cooperation fraying at edges
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:41:20 +0000
Content: When COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev stepped to the podium at the closing meeting of the Baku climate summit on Sunday morning, hoping to clinch a hard-fought agreement on global climate finance, he carried with him two speeches.
One was crafted around a hoped-for deal being struck, while the other for the possibility of a summit-collapsing impasse, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
“Yes, we had prepared different variations of the speech for various scenarios, but as we stepped onto the stage, we were confident in our success,” said one of the sources, an official in the COP29 presidency.
In the end, Babayev managed to gavel through the $300 billion finance plan to help developing nations cope with the soaring costs of global warming over the next decade before critics had time to object, allowing him to read the more positive speech.
He praised the agreement as a breakthrough and shamed the deal’s doubters as “wrong”, even as many of the climate deal’s intended recipients slammed it as woefully inadequate.
Babayev’s preparation for different outcomes at the divisive summit in the Caspian Sea nation of Azerbaijan reflected what many in the audience had already known before it began: the Baku climate talks were never going to go smoothly.
Expectations for a deal were depressed by worries of a looming U.S. withdrawal from global climate cooperation, geopolitical turmoil, and a rise of isolationist politics that had shunted climate change off much of the world’s top priorities list.
Those obstacles loomed large in Baku and will continue to overshadow global climate efforts in the months ahead as Brazil prepares for next year’s much broader conference in the Amazon rainforest city of Belem – where the world will plot a years-long course for steeper emissions cuts and building resilience in the fight against climate change.
“Multilateralism as a whole is under threat,” said Eliot Whittington, chief systems change officer at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.
“Indeed, the UNFCCC is probably the bright spot – proving that even in the face of incredibly hostile geopolitics and on fundamentally difficult questions, a deal can be made,” he said, referring to the U.N. body sponsoring the annual climate summit.
But the slow pace of progress, with global emissions still rising, has raised tensions and calls for reform.
“This is something that needs to be looked at, when just a handful of countries, based on their own economic interests, can almost wreck the entire process,” Sierra Leone Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai told Reuters.

Title: Those rejected by people repeatedly, try to control House through chaos: PM Modi slams Oppn
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:15:45 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on the Opposition on Monday, accusing them of disrupting Parliament and denying meaningful discussions.
He stated that those “who have been rejected by the people multiple times are attempting to control the House through chaos.”
Speaking to the media ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament, PM Modi underscored the significance of this session, terming it a special occasion as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Indian Constitution.
“This is the Winter Session, hopefully, the atmosphere will also be cool. This is the last session of 2024, and the country is enthusiastically awaiting 2025. This session is special in many ways. The most significant aspect is that our Constitution is entering its 75th year — a monumental moment for our democracy. Tomorrow, we will commence this extraordinary occasion together in the new Parliament building,” he said.
The Prime Minister highlighted the rigorous deliberations undertaken by the framers of the Constitution, leading to the creation of a remarkable document. “One of the Constitution’s key elements is our Parliament and our parliamentarians,” he added.
Calling for productive and healthy debates, PM Modi took aim at the Opposition for obstructing proceedings.
“The people who have been rejected repeatedly by the electorate, try to control Parliament through disruptions. While they fail, their actions are being closely observed by the people of the country. The most troubling aspect is that new MPs, who bring fresh ideas and perspectives, are being denied their rightful opportunity to speak in Parliament due to such disruptions,” he said.
Stressing the importance of intergenerational learning in a democracy, the Prime Minister said, “Every generation in a democracy has the responsibility to train future generations. However, those rejected by the people 80-90 times do not let discussions take place in Parliament.”
“They neither understand the aspirations of the people nor live up to their expectations, and that is why the public continues to reject them,” he added.
Reflecting on India’s growing prominence on the global stage, PM Modi said, “The world looks at India with hope. At such a crucial time, our discussions in Parliament can further enhance India’s standing before the world. India rarely gets opportunities like this, and it is our duty to ensure that the trust voters place in democracy and the Constitution is upheld through meaningful work in Parliament.”
He urged all members to make up for lost time and engage in substantive debates on critical issues.
“A message should go out that the dedication of voters to democracy, the Constitution, and the sanctity of parliamentary proceedings is being honoured by their elected representatives,” he said.
The Prime Minister concluded by expressing hope for a productive session, stressing that healthy discussions are essential to address the nation’s pressing concerns.
“The voters of India are committed to democracy, their loyalty to the Constitution, and their confidence in the parliamentary system. It is essential for everyone in Parliament to reflect the sentiments of the people. To achieve this, we must discuss various aspects of each topic in a constructive manner. This will inspire future generations as well. I hope this session proves to be productive, and I encourage all esteemed MPs to approach it with passion and enthusiasm,” he said.

Title: Ideologies may differ but country is supreme: Speaker Om Birla
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 06:06:44 +0000
Content: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday underscored the importance of prioritizing the nation above differing ideologies and viewpoints. Reflecting on the unity demonstrated by the diverse members of the Constituent Assembly, he highlighted the strength of democracy in embracing differences while working for a common goal.
“On Constitution Day, we need to draw inspiration from the debates and discussions of the Constituent Assembly. Despite their differences, members engaged in positive and meaningful dialogue. Differences are inherent to democracy, but they should not hinder us from coming together for the nation. Ideologies and expressions may vary, but the country must always come first,” Birla told ANI.
Recalling his predecessors, Birla said they had remained steadfastly loyal to the Constitution, working under its guidance. “The Constitution is respected by everyone, including the Judiciary, Executive, and Legislative branches. Babasaheb Ambedkar remarked that a Constitution’s success depends on the vision and capability of those implementing it. We have always upheld the Constitution and ensured that democratic institutions, whether Parliament or Assemblies, function within its framework,” Birla stated.
He further emphasized that the Constitution should remain above politics, describing it as a social document and a catalyst for social and economic change. “The Constitution is our strength. It has enabled us to bring social and economic reforms while ensuring respect for the marginalized and disadvantaged. Today, the world studies India’s Constitution to understand its ideology and the progressive step of granting voting rights to all classes and castes without discrimination at that time. This foundational spirit unites us and drives collective action. That’s why the Constitution must not be drawn into the realm of politics,” Birla said.
Birla also asserted that no government, regardless of its party or ideology, can alter the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Amendments made over time, he explained, have always aimed to align with the rights and aspirations of the people.

Title: India’s economic growth expected to accelerate in Oct-Dec quarter: Report
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:59:50 +0000
Content: India’s economy is projected to grow at a faster pace in the third quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2024) compared to the first half (April-September 2024) as positive indicators are emerging with economic activity picking up pace, according to a report by ICRA.
The report states that the preliminary data for November indicates a positive trend. The growth in electricity demand has picked up, while festive season demand continues to drive an increase in vehicle registrations. “These trends reinforce ICRA’s expectations of a pick-up in the GDP growth in Q3 FY2025 compared to H1 FY2025.”
Economic indicators related to mobility and transportation have also shown significant improvement. Vehicle registrations surged to 32.4 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, a sharp recovery from a contraction of 8.7 per cent in September 2024, the report points out.
This increase is fuelled by a strong demand for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles. Petrol consumption rose to 8.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in September, and domestic air passenger traffic increased to 9.6 per cent from 6.4 per cent.
Additionally, two-wheeler production grew by 13.4 per cent, rail freight improved to 1.5 per cent from a decline of 0.7 per cent, and diesel consumption recorded marginal growth of 0.1 per cent after a contraction of 1.9 per cent in September.
The report further states that the country’s non-oil exports have posted a robust growth of 25.6 per cent in October 2024, up from 6.8 per cent in September. The main contributors to this growth include high-value manufactured items such as electronic products, engineering goods, chemicals, and readymade garments.
The ICRA’s Business Activity Monitor, a composite indicator of economic activities, showed a year-on-year growth of 10.1 per cent in October 2024, the highest in eight months. This is an improvement from the 6.6 per cent growth recorded in September 2024, despite challenges from a high base effect, the report states. The upbeat trends across various sectors reflect India’s economic resilience and reinforce expectations of stronger GDP growth in the coming months, the report added. (IANS)

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the ICA Global Cooperative Conference 2024 and launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025 today, November 25, at 3 PM at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.  
For the first time in its 130-year history, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) is hosting its Global Cooperative Conference and General Assembly in India. Organized by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in partnership with ICA, the Government of India, and Indian cooperatives such as AMUL and KRIBHCO, the event will run from November 25 to 30.  
With the theme, “Cooperatives Build Prosperity for All,” the conference resonates with the Indian Government’s vision of “Sahkar Se Samriddhi” (Prosperity through Cooperation). The program will include discussions, panel sessions, and workshops to explore how cooperatives can tackle global challenges and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Topics such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and sustainable economic growth will be addressed.
During the event, PM Modi will officially launch the UN International Year of Cooperatives 2025, centered around the theme, “Cooperatives Build a Better World.”This initiative highlights the pivotal role of cooperatives in fostering social inclusion, economic empowerment, and sustainable development. Recognized by the UN SDGs as essential to reducing inequality, promoting decent work, and eradicating poverty, cooperatives will take center stage in this global campaign to address pressing global challenges.  
PM will unveil a commemorative postal stamp symbolizing India’s dedication to the cooperative movement. The stamp design features a lotus, representing peace, strength, resilience, and growth, in line with the cooperative principles of sustainability and community development. Its five petals reflect the Panchatatva (five elements of nature), underlining cooperatives’ focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The stamp also integrates imagery from various cooperative sectors such as agriculture, dairy, fisheries, housing, and technology, including a drone symbolizing modern agricultural innovation.  
The conference will welcome prominent international figures, including Prime Minister of Bhutan Dasho Tshering Tobgay and Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji Manoa Kamikamica, along with approximately 3,000 delegates from over 100 countries.

Title: Centre to unveil startups under new National Quantum Mission guidelines
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 12:48:44 +0000
Content: The government is set to announce startups selected for support under the newly-established guidelines as part of the National Quantum Mission.
Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Dr. Jitendra Singh, will unveil the startups in the field of quantum technologies on November 26, showcasing India’s growing expertise in quantum research, development, and commercialization.
The selected startups, representing cutting-edge innovation in diverse areas including quantum communication, computing, sensing, and material sciences, were chosen through a rigorous evaluation process.
These pioneering ventures are poised to contribute significantly to India’s quantum ecosystem, addressing critical technological challenges and driving economic growth, said the ministry.
The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has established detailed guidelines to support and nurture startups in the field of quantum technologies.
These guidelines provide a structured framework for startups to access essential resources, funding opportunities, mentorship, and infrastructure support, empowering them to accelerate innovation and contribute to India’s quantum ecosystem.
A call for proposals was launched earlier this year by the I-HUB Quantum Technology Foundation, a Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) established at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS).
According to the ministry, the response from startups across the nation showcased the increasing interest in quantum technologies and the potential for ground-breaking advancements.
“With the growing momentum in India’s start-up ecosystem, the National Quantum Mission is dedicated to nurturing ventures in quantum technology and propelling the nation toward worldwide excellence in this transformative field,” it added.
India launched the National Quantum Mission in April 2023 to build capabilities in quantum-related science and technology. Today, there are more than 600 scientists and over 50 startups working in quantum technology in the country.

Title: Emerging patterns: BJP’s pro-incumbency wave in Maharashtra and beyond
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 12:06:45 +0000
Content: Maharashtra was once a Congress bastion. Now, the BJP is the dominant political party there, maintaining its lead election after election and scripting a clear narrative in a state that had become riddled with fractured electoral numbers since 1990.
In Maharashtra, no political party had touched the 100-seat threshold in the 288-member assembly since the 1990 polls. The BJP made history in 2014 when it won 122 seats and maintained its lead in upcoming elections. The party won over 100 seats in 2019 and solidified its central position in state politics in 2024, showing its strongest performance so far, with a strike rate touching 90%. The party won 132 out of 149 seats it contested.
The 2024 state election results show people’s trust in the BJP-led alliance’s vision for the state’s future and its governance model. Leading the Mahayuti alliance, the BJP faced off against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)a, coalition comprising the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray faction – SHSUBT), the Nationalist Congress Party (led by Sharad Pawar) (NCP – NCPSP), and the Congress (INC).
The outcome was a clear and massive victory for the BJP-led Mahayuti and can be seen as a shift towards stability and development after the political crises seen in the state over the last five years, with vertical splits in two of its major political parties, the Shiv Sena and the NCP.
The two splits meant the state now had five major political parties with overlapping geographical spheres of influence between different Shiv Sena and NCP factions. That implied the possibility of increased political instability in the state. The election outcome appears settled to address that for the next five years.
The spectacular win registered by the BJP is a testament to the party’s organisational strength, strategic planning, and commitment to the people of Maharashtra. Its allies, the Shiv Sena and the NCP, have also delivered strong performances, winning 57 and 41 seats, respectively.
On the other hand, the Congress, which once dominated Maharashtra’s politics, managed to secure just 16 of the 101 seats it contested, highlighting its declining electoral appeal. The party that has ruled Maharashtra for decades, either directly or in alliances, was reduced to a poor strike rate of 16% this time. Its alliance partner Shiv Sena (UBT) won just 20 seats, while the NCP (SP) was reduced to 10 seats, a significant decline from the 2019 and previous assembly poll results in the state.
Journey to the Electoral Shift
Maharashtra’s political journey began on May 1, 1960, when Bombay State was split into Maharashtra and Gujarat. The outgoing state electorally had 396 assembly seats, which were divided between Maharashtra, with 264 constituencies, and Gujarat, with 132 constituencies. Subsequently, the assembly constituencies were raised to 288 with census data and district modifications.
For decades, the Congress party held sway over Maharashtra, winning election after election from 1951-52 until 1978. However, things began to change in 1978 when Sharad Pawar, then just 38 years old, left the Congress to form the Congress (Socialist) party, marking the beginning of Maharashtra’s coalition era.
The 1978 assembly elections saw the Congress party split into Congress (Indira) and Congress (Devraj Urs). The Janata Party won 99 seats, Congress (Urs) secured 69, and Congress (Indira) won 62 seats. A coalition government was formed, led by Vasantdada Patil, with the support of Congress (Urs) and Congress (Indira), but it was short-lived. It was replaced by Sharad Pawar, who joined hands with the Janata Party and eventually became the youngest Maharashtra CM.
In 1980, the Indira Gandhi-led Union government dismissed Sharad Pawar’s government, and Congress returned to power with the new state election results. The party continued its dominance, winning the 1985 assembly elections and emerging as the largest party in the 1990 elections, securing 141 of the 288 seats. However, the political landscape of Maharashtra was gradually changing.
The 1995 assembly elections marked a turning point, as the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition ended Congress’s long-standing electoral hold. The Shiv Sena won 73 seats with BJP’s 65 seats. Manohar Joshi of Shiv Sena took over as the CM. In February 1999, the Shiv Sena replaced Manohar Joshi with Narayan Rane.
The 1999 elections witnessed a three-way contest between Shiv Sena-BJP, Congress, and NCP. The Shiv Sena won 69 seats, the BJP got 56, the Congress had 75 seats, and the NCP had 58 seats. After the election, the Congress and the NCP allied to form the government. The coalition continued to rule Maharashtra till 2014, registering victories in the 2004 and 2009 assembly elections.
However, the tide began to turn in 2014.
Historically, Shiv Sena had been the senior partner in Maharashtra politics, but as the BJP’s influence grew, the dynamics shifted, leading to tensions. When numbers were with the Shiv Sena, the BJP respected that, but when it came to the BJP’s electoral dominance in the state, the Shiv Sena refused to take a similar line. In 2014, the Shiv Sena broke away from the BJP, only to return after the BJP formed the government with outside support from the NCP. It was the year that marked the BJP’s rising dominance in Maharashtra politics, making it the single largest party with seat counts twice as large as other political parties.
In 2019, both parties fought the Lok Sabha and assembly elections together, but disputes over the chief ministerial post led to a split. In a surprising move, the Shiv Sena allied with the Congress and the NCP, forming the MVA government, with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
Uddhav Thackeray’s decision didn’t sit well with many of the Shiv Sena leaders who found their ideologies close to the BJP. In June 2022, a Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde broke away from the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction, formed an alliance with the BJP, leading to a new state government formation with Shinde being sworn in as the CM. In February 2023, the Election Commission of India awarded the original Shiv Sena name and symbol to the Shinde faction, calling it the real Shiv Sena.
In July 2023, the NCP also experienced a split, with a major party faction led by Ajit Pawar joining the BJP-led alliance. Ajit Pawar was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister. In February 2024, the Election Commission of India awarded the original party name and symbol (‘Clock’) to the Ajit Pawar faction.
The Road Ahead
The BJP’s continued electoral dominance in the state, India’s richest province, after its record-breaking performance in the Haryana assembly election concluded in October 2024,writes a new electoral pattern in India that is based on governance and development.
The results of these two assembly elections add to many electoral firsts achieved by the party and set a trend that is expected to shape India’s electoral journey in the upcoming assembly elections ahead.
The party has emerged as the largest party in every Maharashtra region and will begin the BJP-led NDA’s third term in the last 10 years. Of the last 10 years, the party-led alliance has ruled the state for over seven years. It has retained Haryana for a third consecutive term this year, the first political party to achieve such an electoral feat in the state.
It became the first political party in Uttar Pradesh since 1985 to retain consecutive terms with 2017 and 2022 victories. Uttarakhand had a trend of changing governments every five years; the BJP defied that with 2017 and 2022 poll victories. Defying anti-incumbency, it retained its governments in states like Assam, Tripura, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it was not a potent political force earlier.
The fact that the BJP won many of these states with better electoral numbers in subsequent polls indicates that the electoral population benefits from its governance model and supports the party or party-led alliances in upcoming elections.

Title: Inflation to ease, economic growth to accelerate in coming months: Finance Ministry
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 11:42:47 +0000
Content: India’s food inflation is likely to ease while the growth outlook for the economy is “cautiously optimistic” for the coming months as the agricultural sector is likely to benefit from favourable monsoon conditions, increased minimum support prices and adequate supply of inputs, according to the Finance Ministry’s monthly economic review released on Monday.
India’s retail inflation jumped to 6.21 percent in October, marking a 14-month high, driven by elevated food inflation in a few vegetables. Supply disruptions from heavy rains in major producing states contributed to price pressures on tomatoes, onions, and potatoes.
However, the bright agricultural production prospects suggest a more manageable inflation outlook, despite existing price pressures on select food items. Early November trends signalled moderation in key food prices, though geopolitical factors may continue to impact domestic inflation and supply chains, the report states.
Amid a challenging global environment, and after a brief period of softening momentum over the monsoon months, many high-frequency indicators of economic activity in India have shown a rebound in October.
These include indicators of rural and urban demand, as well as supply-side variables such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index and E-way bill generation, the report states.
On the employment front, the formal workforce is expanding, with notable increases in manufacturing jobs and a strong inflow of youth into organized sectors, it added.
As far as the external sector is concerned, the report states that India’s export recovery may encounter challenges due to softening demand in developed markets.
However, trade in the services sector is sustaining momentum. Apart from the emerging indications of domestic growth and stability, the dynamics of global interest rates, earnings growth and valuation, geopolitical developments, and policy decisions of the next administration in the US will determine the course of trade and capital flows.
Recent developments in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have caused some concern in financial markets with safe-haven assets such as US Treasuries and gold finding a bid. Geopolitical conditions remain fragile, according to the report.

Title: “Connectivity will be the new element of India-Mediterranean ties; IMEC can be a game changer”: Jaishankar at MED dialogues
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 11:21:21 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized the growing importance of connectivity in strengthening India’s relationship with the Mediterranean region, describing the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) as a potential “game changer.” Speaking at the MED Mediterranean Dialogues Conference in Rome on Monday, Jaishankar highlighted how connectivity would be a new key element in these ties, particularly amid the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict and its regional impacts.
“The Mediterranean presents both opportunities and risks in an uncertain and volatile world. Beyond extrapolating current trends, the new element of our relationship will be connectivity. The IMEC, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor that was announced in September 2020, can be a game changer,” Jaishankar said in his opening remarks.
He acknowledged the challenges posed by the current Middle East conflict but assured that progress on IMEC continues, especially between India, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Jaishankar also highlighted the significance of the I2U2 grouping, which includes India, Israel, the UAE, and the US, predicting that it would become increasingly active in the future.
The IMEC, launched during India’s G20 presidency, aims to enhance connectivity and integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe through a network involving countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and the European Union. Jaishankar’s comments at the conference emphasized the continued forward momentum despite regional tensions.
Shifting focus to India’s engagement with the Mediterranean, Jaishankar revealed that the region holds substantial economic and political relevance for India, with annual trade totaling approximately USD 80 billion. He also said the presence of a large Indian diaspora, with about 460,000 people residing in Mediterranean countries, 40 percent of whom are based in Italy.
India’s key interests in the Mediterranean, according to Jaishankar, span various sectors, including fertilizers, energy, technology, diamonds, defense, and cyber capabilities. India is also actively involved in significant infrastructure projects, such as airports, ports, railways, and green hydrogen initiatives.
Jaishankar further explained India’s robust ties with the Middle East, citing the Gulf region’s annual trade with India, which stands between USD 160 billion and USD 180 billion. An additional USD 20 billion comes from trade with the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. He highlighted the substantial presence of over 9 million Indians living and working in the Middle East, with India’s activities there deeply rooted in energy, technology, industrial projects, and services. The Minister also acknowledged India’s long-standing historical, cultural, and security ties with the region.
“Let me now shift to the Middle East and present India’s interest there. Our trade with the Gulf alone is in the range of 160 to 180 billion dollars annually. The rest of MENA adds about another USD 20 billion. More than 9 million Indians live and work in the Middle East. Whether it is energy, technology, industrial projects, or services… It is also a region to which we are connected in history, culture, and security,” Jaishankar said, adding that India’s presence and activities in the region would continue to grow as the country advances towards becoming the third-largest economy in the world.
Jaishankar’s remarks came as part of his ongoing three-day official visit to Italy, during which he is also participating in the Outreach Session of the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiuggi, Italy, where India has been invited as a guest country.

The rally was broad-based, while capex-linked sectors like infra, capital goods, and industrials outperformed in expectation of a surge in new order inflows.
“The prospects of H2 remain positive due to a good monsoon, festival, and marriage season, which could ease the impact of earnings downgrades that happened in Q2,” an expert added.
On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs 1,278.37 crore. Conversely, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) supported the market with net purchases of Rs 1,722.15 crore, highlighting robust domestic buying interest despite weak global sentiment.

Title: Olympic medallist Richardson banned from competing for Australia after allegiance switch
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:53:57 +0000
Content: Matthew Richardson will not be permitted to rejoin the Australian Cycling Team in the future, governing body AusCycling said on Monday, following a review into the cyclist’s switch of allegiance from Australia to Britain.
England-born Richardson switched his international allegiance to Britain in August, days after winning silver in the individual sprint and the keirin as well as bronze in the team sprint at the Paris Olympics.
The 25-year-old’s defection triggered some criticism from former cyclists in Australia.
In its review of the incident, AusCycling said Richardson had requested that world governing body UCI delay official disclosure of his nationality change until after the Olympics, while also withholding the news from AusCycling and teammates.
The body added that Richardson asked to take AusCycling property including a custom bike, cockpit, and Olympic race suit to Britain.
“The review, which involved a thorough investigation of Richardson’s actions, has determined he acted in a way which conflicted with the values of AusCycling, the Australian National Team and the broader cycling community,” the body said.
“Richardson will not be eligible to rejoin the Australian Cycling Team at any point in the future.
“He is also prohibited from using any resources associated with the Australian Cycling Team or its partners. Richardson will be ineligible for any AusCycling-related awards, effective immediately.”
Under UCI rules, cyclists who switch allegiance are not eligible to represent their new national team at the following edition of world and continental championships, meaning Richardson missed last month’s world championships in Denmark.

Title: Tech-wary Germans get hooked with online shopping habit
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:43:46 +0000
Content: In only a few years, Germans have become a nation of online shoppers, with most now turning to devices to buy clothes, groceries and medicines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A survey showed that 99% of adults in Germany, where more than 70% of companies still use fax machines, now shop online, with 39% of respondents doing so at least once a week.
This is despite Germans being more negative on technology trends than the European average, with a 2022 McKinsey study finding them particularly critical of hyper-personalisation.
But that is changing, according to the study from the German GfK institute with Mastercard, seen exclusively by Reuters.
Alvaro Pinilla furnished his new apartment in Berlin online, buying lamps, kitchen utensils, rugs and furniture online.
“It is the comfort of not having to leave home,” the 30-year-old lawyer told Reuters. “I also think that online prices are as competitive, or even better than, in a physical store.”
Black Friday and Cyber Monday, as well as the impending Christmas season, will mark highs for online trade and Germany’s main retail association HDE expects sales of 87.1 billion euros ($91.66 billion) for the e-commerce industry this year.
“If there’s a week when I haven’t bought anything, my brain tells me ‘time to treat yourself’,” said Pinilla, who plans to take advantage of Black Friday discounts to buy a new coat, boots, scarf and gloves.
The survey of more than 1,000 respondents found that fashion is by far the most popular product category in online retail: Two-thirds ordered clothing and shoes online in the past 12 months, while at the start of the pandemic in 2020 it was 43%.
“I’ve kind of got into the habit of buying online during the pandemic,” Pinilla told Reuters, adding he had got better at finding the things he wanted.
Germany accounted for $37.6 billion of Amazon’s revenue in 2023, making it the company’s biggest international market.
‘SALES QUEEN’
Sarah Schedler also enjoys buying clothes online, because she feels she can find what she needs faster than in a store.
“If something is at full price, I usually put it on my wish list and then wait until it’s reduced,” said Schedler, a 29-year-old content manager. “I’m a bit of a sales queen.”
Electronics are the second most popular category for online shoppers, the GfK survey showed, with almost half of Germans ordering these products online this year.
Schedler plans to replace her 10-year-old laptop this Black Friday as she has seen good deals.
“I have the feeling that the prices are somehow lower online, but it could just be my feeling,” she said.
In just four years, online grocery shopping has also risen to 25% from 7% in 2020, while the proportion of people who order personal care products on the Internet has almost doubled, from 18% in 2020 to 35% in 2024, GfK said.
Almost four in 10 Germans prefer to shop on their mobile phone, 10% a tablet and half from a computer, the survey showed.
“Most people always have their smartphone ready … This makes it easy to make spontaneous purchases,” said Peter Robejsek, Mastercard Germany managing director.
HDE estimates sales of almost 47 billion euros were generated via smartphones, which accounted for a record 55% of total online retail sales in Germany last year.

Title: Kremlin says Trump circle is talking about a peace deal for Ukraine as Biden escalates
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 10:36:46 +0000
Content: The Kremlin said on Monday it had noted that President-elect Donald Trump’s circle was speaking about a potential peace plan for Ukraine while the current U.S. administration of Joe Biden was not and was seeking to escalate the conflict instead.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made his remarks after being asked to comment on an interview that Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, gave to Fox News on Sunday.
Waltz said that Trump had been “very concerned” about an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine and that the war must be brought “to a responsible end”.
Waltz noted what he said was the involvement of North Korea and Iran in the conflict, Russia’s use of a hypersonic ballistic missile against Ukraine, a decision by some Western countries to let Kyiv fire their missiles deep into Russia, and said South Korea was considering whether to get involved too.
“What we need to be discussing is who’s at that table, whether it’s an agreement, an armistice, how to get both sides to the table, and then what’s the framework of a deal,” Waltz said.
Peskov said the Kremlin had taken note of the comments and that President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly signalled that Moscow was ready for dialogue over Ukraine.
“Indeed, from the circle of Trump supporters and those who have been nominated for future positions in the future administration, the word ‘peace’ or ‘peace plan’ is being heard,” Peskov said, when asked about Waltz’s comments.
“No such words are being heard from the current (Biden) administration while provocative escalatory actions continue. That is the reality that we face,” he said.
Putin spelled out in June what he wanted in order to start peace talks – for Ukraine to drop its NATO membership ambitions and to hand over the entirety of four provinces claimed by Moscow.
Moscow says the terms reflect reality on the battlefield where Russian forces have been advancing. But Ukraine says such terms would amount to an unacceptable capitulation for Kyiv.

Title: After SC suggestion, CAQM permits hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:56:17 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has permitted hybrid classes in Delhi-NCR schools following a suggestion by the Supreme Court to consider relaxing restrictions on educational institutions.
The CAQM directed state governments in Delhi-NCR to ensure that all classes up to the 12th standard operate in a hybrid mode, acknowledging the challenges faced by primary schools that lack the capability to conduct classes entirely online.
The Supreme Court, while urging the CAQM to review restrictions, noted that many students are being deprived of mid-day meals due to school closures and the lack of access to online education facilities. The bench highlighted that children in homes without air purifiers may face the same air quality challenges as they would in schools, necessitating immediate action to address these issues.
The apex court also asked the commission to specifically evaluate the ban on physical classes for students in Classes 10 and 12, given their academic requirements. “We expect a decision to be made by the Commission during the day or by tomorrow morning to ensure timely implementation. All other Stage IV measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) must continue to be rigorously enforced,” the court stated.
Additionally, the Supreme Court ordered the CAQM to take immediate action against defaulting officers and entities that have failed to implement Stage IV measures of GRAP in Delhi-NCR. The court emphasized that relaxation of Stage IV norms would not be considered unless there is a consistent downward trend in the Air Quality Index (AQI).
The case, addressing broader pollution control measures, is set to be heard next on Thursday.

Title: Cabinet approves ₹7,927 crore multitracking projects to boost rail connectivity
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:41:28 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved three major multitracking projects for Indian Railways at a cost of approximately ₹7,927 crore. The initiative aims to enhance rail connectivity, reduce congestion, and contribute to economic growth.
The projects include the Jalgaon-Manmad 4th Line (160 km), Bhusawal-Khandwa 3rd & 4th Line (131 km), and Prayagraj (Iradatganj)-Manikpur 3rd Line (84 km), covering a total length of 639 km. These tracks are part of the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan, designed to integrate multi-modal connectivity and ensure the seamless movement of people and goods.
According to an official release, the projects span seven districts across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, impacting around 1,319 villages and benefiting a population of approximately 38 lakh. Notably, the improved connectivity will serve two aspirational districts, Khandwa and Chitrakoot, and enhance the Mumbai-Prayagraj-Varanasi route, a key rail corridor.
The enhanced rail infrastructure is expected to accommodate more passenger trains, making it easier for pilgrims to access religious sites such as Trimbakeshwar in Nashik, Omkareshwar in Khandwa, Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi, and other locations in Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, and Shirdi. Tourists will also benefit from improved access to heritage sites like the Ajanta and Ellora Caves and Khajuraho.
On the freight front, the projects are poised to add an estimated 51 million tonnes of annual freight capacity, facilitating the transport of agricultural produce, coal, steel, and cement. This is expected to lower logistics costs and stimulate economic growth.
The environmentally friendly rail infrastructure will contribute to India’s climate goals, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 271 crore kilograms annually—equivalent to planting 11 crore trees. “These projects not only support economic development but also underline India’s commitment to sustainability,” the release said.

It addresses the critical need to keep our agricultural land free of chemicals, ensuring healthier and more sustainable farming practices,” Vaishnaw said.
The mission aims to transition farmers towards natural farming methods that are chemical-free and rooted in traditional knowledge systems. These practices involve integrating local livestock with diversified crop systems, utilizing location-specific technologies, and promoting agro-ecological principles tailored to local conditions.
According to an official release, NMNF is designed to support farmers in reducing the cost of cultivation by decreasing reliance on externally purchased inputs. By fostering healthy soil ecosystems, encouraging biodiversity, and promoting diverse cropping systems, the mission aims to enhance agricultural resilience and sustainability.
Natural Farming (NF) will provide safe, nutritious food for consumers while also ensuring long-term soil health and environmental sustainability. The initiative seeks to revive and strengthen traditional agricultural practices, making them more climate-resilient and sustainable for both farmer families and consumers.

Title: Named in FIR, Sambhal MP and MLA’s son deny involvement in violence
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:17:35 +0000
Content: Facing FIRs over the deadly violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal city, Samajwadi Party MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq and Nawab Suhail Iqbal, son of SP legislator Iqbal Mehmood, on Monday denied any wrongdoing and accused the administration and police of mishandling the situation, which led to the deaths of four people.
MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq told IANS, “I have been booked in a false case by the police, who are trying to hide their own failure.”
Barq and Nawab Suhail Iqbal were named in seven FIRs filed by the Uttar Pradesh Police against 400 people for the violence on Sunday.
The unrest left four people dead and dozens injured, including 22 police personnel, during protests against a court-ordered survey of the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid. The survey was prompted by a petition claiming the mosque was constructed in 1529 after demolishing a Hindu temple.
Barq asserted his innocence, stating, “I was not even in Sambhal when the violence occurred. I was attending a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in Bangalore.” He also demanded action against the policemen responsible for what he described as the killing of innocent youths.
Denying allegations of delivering inflammatory speeches, Barq claimed he had previously intervened to prevent violence when an earlier survey attempt was made.
Similarly, Nawab Suhail Iqbal denied his involvement in the violence, saying, “Show me any video or photo that proves I was present at the site.” He added that he had stayed home as directed by the administration and even attempted to convince people to cooperate with the survey team.
Iqbal confirmed visiting the mosque in the morning to convey his father’s message, urging people to cooperate with the court-ordered survey team. He emphasized that he had not delivered any speech inciting communal hatred.
Advocate Zafar Ali, representing the Jama Masjid in Sambhal, also claimed that neither the MP nor the MLA’s son was present at the scene of the violence. “The SDM and police officials are to blame for the deaths of four people,” he said, adding that the survey team found nothing objectionable during its inspection.
Police sources reported that at least 25 individuals, including two women, have been detained or arrested in connection with Sunday’s violence. Protesters allegedly torched vehicles and pelted stones, prompting police to use tear gas and baton charges to disperse the crowd.
SP MP Awadhesh Prasad expressed grief over the incident, calling it “heartbreaking and painful” and accused the BJP of inciting unrest to divert attention from electoral issues. He defended Barq, stating, “The MP was with us at the time of the violence. This is a baseless case aimed at silencing him in Parliament.”

Title: Centre approves ₹3,689 crore investment for two hydroelectric projects in Arunachal Pradesh
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:59:41 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday approved an investment of ₹3,689 crore for the construction of two hydroelectric projects in Arunachal Pradesh’s Shi Yomi district. Both projects are expected to be completed within 50 months.
An outlay of ₹1,939 crore has been sanctioned for the Heo Hydroelectric Project (HEP), while ₹1,750 crore has been approved for the Tato-I Hydroelectric Project (HEP), according to an official statement issued after the CCEA meeting.
The Heo Hydroelectric Project (HEP), with an installed capacity of 240 MW (3 x 80 MW), is expected to generate 1,000 Million Units (MU) of energy annually. The power produced will enhance the electricity supply in Arunachal Pradesh and contribute to balancing the national grid.
The Tato-I Hydroelectric Project (HEP), with an installed capacity of 186 MW (3 x 62 MW), will generate 802 MU of energy annually, further strengthening the state’s power infrastructure and the national grid.
Both projects will be implemented through a joint venture between the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. (NEEPCO) and the government of Arunachal Pradesh.
The Government of India will extend budgetary support of ₹127.28 crore and ₹77.37 crore for the Heo and Tato-I projects, respectively, to facilitate the construction of roads, bridges, and associated transmission lines under enabling infrastructure. Additionally, Central Financial Assistance of ₹130.43 crore and ₹120.43 crore has been approved for the equity share of the state in the respective projects.
The projects will offer Arunachal Pradesh 12% free power and an additional 1% for the Local Area Development Fund (LADF). These measures aim to drive significant socio-economic development and infrastructure improvements in the region.
Infrastructure enhancements include the development of around 10 kilometers of roads and bridges, primarily for local use. Dedicated project funds of ₹15 crore will finance essential facilities such as hospitals, schools, vocational training institutes like ITIs, marketplaces, and playgrounds.
The projects are expected to generate substantial employment during construction and operation phases. Approximately 200 personnel from NEEPCO and around 400 workers from contractors will be engaged during construction. Indirect employment opportunities will arise through small contracts, services, and various allied activities.
In addition to direct employment, the projects will stimulate economic activity in transportation, tourism, and small-scale businesses, contributing to the region’s growth. Local communities will also benefit from compensations, CSR initiatives, and vocational training programs.
The hydroelectric projects align with the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan by promoting local enterprise involvement, eco-friendly energy generation, and self-reliance.

Title: Centre approves PAN 2.0 project worth ₹1,435 crore to transform taxpayer registration
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:49:29 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday approved the Income Tax Department’s PAN 2.0 project with an allocation of ₹1,435 crore.
The PAN 2.0 project aims to introduce a technology-driven overhaul of taxpayer registration services, offering several key benefits, including improved accessibility, faster service delivery, enhanced data accuracy, eco-friendly processes, cost efficiency, and upgraded infrastructure security for greater agility.
According to a cabinet communique, the project is an e-governance initiative designed to re-engineer the business processes of taxpayer registration services. It will enable a more seamless digital experience for taxpayers through a revamped PAN/TAN ecosystem.
The project will consolidate core and non-core PAN/TAN activities and upgrade the PAN validation service, thereby replacing the existing PAN/TAN 1.0 system.
The CCEA noted that the PAN 2.0 project aligns with the government’s Digital India vision by establishing PAN as a universal identifier across digital systems for specified government agencies.
Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has expressed confidence in surpassing the direct tax collection target of ₹22.07 lakh crore set in the Union Budget for the current fiscal year.
Between April 1 and November 10 of the current financial year, India’s net direct tax collections—comprising corporate tax and personal income tax—rose by 15.4% to ₹12.1 lakh crore, according to the latest data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
The ₹22.07 lakh crore collection target for FY24 includes ₹10.20 lakh crore from corporate tax and ₹11.87 lakh crore from personal income tax, non-corporate tax, and other categories.

Title: SC issues notice on PIL seeking directions to integrate legal education, self-defence training into school curriculum
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:42:40 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking directions to incorporate legal education and self-defence training into the school curriculum.
A bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan issued notices to the Centre and state governments, seeking their responses on the matter. The plea is tentatively listed for hearing on January 7, 2024, as per the computerised case status.
The petition, filed by advocate Reepak Kansal, argued that integrating legal education and self-defence training in schools would empower students with knowledge of their rights and equip them to handle unforeseen threats.
“It is essential for every citizen to understand the basic laws of the nation to assert and protect their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. In the absence of legal knowledge, individuals may struggle to fully exercise these rights,” the petition stated. It further emphasized the need for self-defence training at the school level, enabling children to protect themselves in adverse situations.
Highlighting India’s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990), the plea underscored the importance of protecting children from all forms of violence and abuse. Articles 39(e) and 39(f) of the Indian Constitution also mandate the government to safeguard children and ensure equal opportunities for their development.
The petition referred to Section 34 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, which protects individuals acting in private defence from criminal liability. It suggested that teaching this provision to school students would help them understand their legal rights and develop skills to safeguard themselves in emergencies.
“Several incidents have shown that child victims were unable to defend themselves due to a lack of self-defence skills. Educating students about Section 34 of the BNS, 2023, would prepare them to protect themselves and seek help in critical situations,” the PIL said.
The petition also emphasized that legal literacy would enhance students’ understanding of their rights, enable them to avoid illegal activities, and empower them to seek assistance when needed. It added that this would particularly benefit girls by boosting their confidence and teaching them essential self-defence skills.

Title: Supreme court refuses to ease GRAP-IV curbs amid Delhi’s alarming air pollution levels
Publication Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:27:05 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday declined to relax the stringent measures imposed under the fourth stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-IV) in Delhi to combat severe air pollution. However, the court directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider easing restrictions on educational institutions, highlighting the adverse impact on students deprived of midday meals, online learning, and access to air purifiers.
The GRAP-IV measures were enforced last week after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassed the hazardous 450 mark. The Supreme Court had previously asserted that these curbs could not be eased without its explicit approval.
A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and A.G. Masih instructed the CAQM to review whether exceptions could be made or norms relaxed, particularly for schools and Anganwadis, which have remained closed under the GRAP-IV guidelines. The bench mandated the CAQM to decide on the issue by today or tomorrow morning, ensuring implementation of any changes by Wednesday.
The court also addressed the ongoing ban on physical classes for 10th and 12th-grade students, leaving it to the Commission to decide whether this restriction should continue. However, the apex court made it clear that GRAP-IV measures would not be relaxed unless there was a consistent decline in AQI levels.
During the proceedings, the court emphasized the broader societal impact of GRAP-IV measures. It instructed the CAQM to ensure that laborers, daily wage workers, and other vulnerable groups do not suffer due to the restrictions. The court directed the Commission to issue necessary mitigating measures under Section 12(1) of the CAQM Act. Additionally, it ordered states to utilize labor cess funds for the welfare and subsistence of construction workers affected by the ban on construction activities.
The court also criticized lapses in enforcement, particularly regarding the implementation of GRAP-IV measures at Delhi’s 13 entry points. It noted the lack of adequate check posts and sought clarity on the number of posts operational. Amicus Curiae Aparajita Singh pointed out that while personnel had been deployed after court orders, there was confusion among them regarding directions.
Expressing dissatisfaction, the bench asked CAQM to issue show-cause notices to agencies responsible for enforcement failures and consider prosecuting them. The court also demanded details on steps taken by the Delhi Government to inform the public about the prohibition of truck entry through the city’s 13 entry points.
Despite its critical observations, the court lauded the 13 court-appointed commissioners for their efforts in monitoring compliance. Their appointments were extended, with directions to continue their site visits and submit periodic reports to the court.
The matter has been listed for further hearing on Thursday.

Title: ISRO gets government approval for Venus mission “Shukrayaan”
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:52:36 +0000
Content: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has received approval from the Indian government for its upcoming Venus Orbiting Satellite mission, named Shukrayaan, which is slated for launch in 2028. This announcement was made by Nilesh Desai, Director of ISRO, during a recent media interaction.
“The Indian government has recently given a nod to our Venus Orbiting Satellite — Shukrayaan… It will be launched in 2028… The idea of Chandrayaan 4 has been proposed as a follow up of Chandrayaan 3, where we will land not only on the moon but also will return with soil and rock samples,” Desai said.
Additionally, Desai unveiled plans for Chandrayaan 4, a follow-up to the successful Chandrayaan 3 mission. This ambitious project will be a joint effort between India and Japan, aiming for a precise landing at the Moon’s south pole at 90 degrees south latitude. This mission will also include a significantly heavier rover, weighing 350 kg—12 times the size of its predecessor. Although the project has not yet received full approval, Desai is optimistic that with governmental clearance, the mission could be executed by 2030.
Apart from these missions, ISRO is also working on enhancing its weather and communication systems. Discussions are underway regarding the launch of advanced sensors and satellites as part of the INSAT 4 series. These new technologies will enable ISRO to catch up with global advancements in meteorology and oceanography, improving weather forecasts and satellite communication systems.
Desai also shared plans for future Mars exploration. As part of the Mars mission, ISRO intends not only to place a satellite in Mars’ orbit but also to make an attempt to land on its surface.
“As a part of the Mars mission, we will not only put a satellite on the Mars orbit but we will also attempt to land on it’s suface.. Gaganyaan will be launched in the next two years.. It will be an unmanned flight after which we will launch a manned flight. The government has also given an approval to construct India’s own space station. It will not be as big as the ISS but will have five modules. We will launch the first module in 2028 and India’s space station will be ready by 2035.. As a part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to land on the moon by 2040, our space station will function as a transit facility en route,” he said. (ANI)

Title: India leads in anti-terrorism efforts: 26/11 Mumbai attacks remembered
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:46:47 +0000
Content: On the 16th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, along with other leaders, paid homage to the victims and security personnel who lost their lives during the horrific events.
The 26/11 attacks, a series of coordinated terrorist strikes by ten Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives from Pakistan, targeted key locations in Mumbai, including the Taj Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Leopold Cafe, Nariman House, Cama Hospital, and Metro Cinema.
Over three days of terror, 166 people, including 20 security personnel and 26 foreigners, were killed, while more than 300 were injured.
Taking to X, Home Minister Shah expressed his condolences and pride in India’s strengthened stance against terrorism.
“On this day in 2008, cowardly terrorists shamed humanity by killing innocent people in Mumbai. I pay my emotional tribute to the soldiers who attained martyrdom while fighting terrorists in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and salute those who lost their lives,” he wrote.
Highlighting the government’s approach, Shah stated, “Terrorism is a blot on the entire human civilisation. The Modi government’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy against terrorism has been appreciated by the entire world, and today India has become a world leader in anti-terrorism initiatives.”
BJP National President J.P. Nadda also paid his tributes, acknowledging the bravery and sacrifices made by the victims and security forces.
“I pay my heartfelt tribute and salute all the brave soldiers, policemen, and innocent citizens who made the supreme sacrifice for the country in the cowardly terrorist attack on 26/11 in Mumbai,” he wrote on X.
Nadda underscored the destructive nature of terrorism and credited Prime Minister Modi’s leadership for India’s robust anti-terrorism policies.
“Today, the tough anti-terrorism policy and global initiative of the Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made India a leader among the countries leading the anti-terrorism campaign, along with making it safe,” he added.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also marked the occasion with a heartfelt tribute.
“On the anniversary of 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, the nation remembers those who lost their lives that fateful day. We pay homage to the security personnel who fought with utmost courage and made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. We remember, and we will never forget those wounds,” the Defence Minister posted on X.

Title: Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde resigns, appointed caretaker CM
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:43:01 +0000
Content: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde submitted his resignation to Governor C.P. Radhakrishnan on Tuesday as the term of the state assembly ended.
Deputy CMs Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis also reached the Governor’s office today morning to tender their resignation.
Shinde has been appointed the caretaker Chief Minister until the state’s government is formed.
After a decisive Mahayuti alliance win, and Bharatiya Janata Party emerging as the largest party by winning over 132 seat, the alliance is yet to decide on a Chief Minister to lead the government.
Earlier, BJP leader and former Maharashtra Assembly speaker Rahul Narvekar said that when CM Shinde resigns, he will be appointed as the caretaker CM till the new government is formed.
“Today the term of the assembly is ending. If he (CM Shinde) resigns today, he will be requested to work as a caretaker CM till a new government is formed. The leaders of the three parties, our parliamentary board, will decide on this (CM) matter. And soon the government will be formed in Maharashtra,” Narvekar told ANI.
The Mahayuti alliance is yet to decide on its Chief Ministerial candidate after its huge win in the state. Two time Chief Minister and current Deputy CM, Devendra Fadnavis is also seen as a choice for the position, as he is part of the BJP, the single largest party in the assembly.
“Out of love for me, some congregations have appealed to everyone to gather together and come to Mumbai. I am deeply grateful for your love. But I appeal that no one should come together in my support in such a manner. Once again it is my humble request that Shiv Sena workers should not assemble at Varsha bungalow (official residence of CM) or anywhere else,” said the X post by Shinde.
“After the great victory of Mahayutti, our government will be formed once again in the state. As a grand alliance, we contested the election together and are still together today,” the post added.
Earlier, Devendra Fadnavis said that the victory of the alliance will “inspire our Maharashtra.”
“This victory of the Mahayuti has given a new direction only because of your support. This success will continue to inspire our Maharashtra to realize the dream of a developed India with a developed Maharashtra under the leadership of Hon. Modiji with a progressive and inclusive future,” Devendra Fadnavis said in an open letter to the people of Maharashtra.

Title: Cricket-Stick or twist? Australia digests Perth mauling
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:07:16 +0000
Content: After fixating obsessively over one spot in the batting order for the best part of the spring, Australia’s media pundits and cricket fans have been handed a plethora of talking points by the abject defeat in the first test against India.
India’s 295-run victory was sealed inside four days at Perth Stadium on Monday, shattering Australian confidence that Pat Cummins’s team could halt the long run of series losses at the hands of the game’s financial superpower.
If the humiliation of India being able to declare their second innings on 487-6 reflected poorly on the bowling unit, it was the Australian batting line-up dismissed for 104 in their first innings that bore the brunt of the blame.
Debutant Nathan McSweeney, who won the much-discussed race to open the batting, was not alone in being awarded derisory marks in the media player ratings with Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith also hovering around the 2/10 mark.
Marnus Labuschagne, once the world’s top-ranked test batsman, received 1/10 in one publication after making five runs in two innings in Perth, the second brought to an end when he was trapped in front by Jasprit Bumrah without offering a shot.
“The top order is a major concern,” former test skipper Greg Chappell wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
“To avoid forced changes, they must deliver in Adelaide. Marnus Labuschagne knows he is under pressure … he must rediscover his form quickly and revert to the free-flowing style of old.”
Chappell’s view that the players who underperformed in Perth be given a chance to redeem themselves in the day-night second test in Adelaide was supported by other former players.
“I’m giving them Adelaide,” 119-test wicketkeeper Ian Healy told SEN radio.
“They can do it, they can do it, as long as they train smart this week and get really fresh and fit and strong.”
More importantly, perhaps, captain Cummins thought wholesale changes were highly unlikely after just one test in the five-match series.
GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS
The good news for Australia is that they have played seven pink ball tests at Adelaide Oval and won them all, including an eight-wicket victory over India in 2020 when they dismissed the tourists for 36 in their second innings.
The bad news is that they have not won a home series after losing the first test since they beat West Indies in 1968-69 and will probably face a stronger Indian line-up when the second test begins on Dec. 6. Paceman Bumrah, uniformly awarded 10/10 by Australian media for his performance in Perth, will hand the captaincy back to the returning Rohit Sharma, while Shubman Gill could be fit to play after recovering from a thumb injury.
For cricket writer Bharat Sundaresan, the biggest concern for Australia was not the playing talent in the squad but the body language of the home team in Perth when the match was not going their way.
“It (was) a thrashing. It (was) a hammering worthy of the level of outrage from the cricket fans around the country,” he wrote in The Australian newspaper.
“More so in the wake of just how defeated the Australians looked at the end of day three, a day that will go down in infamy … for the complete lack of challenge posed by them against the unrelenting assault by the Indians …”

Content: The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved One Nation One Subscription, a new Central Sector Scheme for providing country-wide access to scholarly research articles and journal publication. PM Modi has time and again pointed out the importance of research and development in our country in the Amrit Kaal.
The scheme will be administered through a simple, user friendly and fully digital process. This will be a “One Nation One Subscription” facility for the government higher education institutions and R&D laboratories of the central government.
A total of about Rs.6,000 crore has been allocated for One Nation One Subscription for 3 calendar years, 2025, 2026 and 2027 as a new Central Sector Scheme. One Nation One Subscription will build on and further enhance the scope and reach of the range of initiatives undertaken by the Government of India over the past decade in the domains of education, for maximizing access to quality higher education for the youth of India.
This will supplement the ANRF initiative to promote research and development and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout government universities, colleges, research institutions, and R&D laboratories.
The benefits of One Nation One Subscription scheme will be provided to all Higher Educational Institutions under the management of the Central or State Government and Research & Development Institutions of the Central Government, through a national subscription coordinated by a central agency, namely the Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET), an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission (UGC).
This list covers more than 6,300 institutions, translating into nearly 1.8 crore students, faculty and researchers, who will be able to potentially avail benefits of One Nation One Subscription.
This is in line with the goals of Viksitbharat@2047, National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). The initiative will expand access to scholarly journals to a vast diaspora of students, faculty, researchers and scientists of all disciplines, including those in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, thereby promoting core as well as interdisciplinary research in the country.
The ANRF will periodically review the usage of One Nation One Subscription and publications of Indian authors of these institutions. The Department of Higher Education will have a unified portal “One Nation One Subscription” through which the institutions will be able to access the journals.
The ANRF will periodically review the usage of One Nation One Subscription and publications of Indian authors of these institutions. The DHE and other Ministries having HEIs and R&D Institutions under their management shall be proactively conducting Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns among students, faculty and researchers of these institutions about availability and method of access to One Nation One Subscription, resulting in improved usage of the facility across the country.
The State Governments will also be requested to carry out campaigns at their level for maximizing usage of the unique facility by students, faculty and researchers of all government institutions.

Content: Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav met with British leaders and business executives on Monday as part of his week-long trip to the UK and Germany from November 24-30. The visit aims to attract global investors to Madhya Pradesh by showcasing the state’s opportunities across key sectors.
During the meeting, UK House of Lords member Raminder Ranger praised India’s rapid economic growth. “The future belongs to India. Economies in Europe and America are stagnating, but India is growing phenomenally at 7-8%, which is incredible for a country of its size,” he said.
Raminder highlighted India’s democratic stability and strong legal system as key factors encouraging foreign investment.
He also lauded India’s hard-working population, citing the success of Indian leaders in global blue-chip companies as proof of their dedication. “The returns of investments into India will be very quick and very big,” he added.
Another House of Lords member, Kulveer Ranger, also expressed optimism about Madhya Pradesh’s investment potential. He pointed to opportunities in solar energy, technology ecosystems, higher education, agriculture, and health tech.
Echoing Prime Minister Modi’s vision of the Indian diaspora as “living bridges,” Kulveer Ranger emphasized that the All Party Parliamentary Group for India in the UK would work to strengthen connections and boost investment ties with Madhya Pradesh.

Title: Sensex, Nifty rise as realty gains and investor sentiment lift markets
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:05:06 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened higher on Tuesday, driven by buying in the realty sector and positive momentum from the previous two sessions.
The Sensex climbed 94.14 points, or 0.12%, to reach 80,203.9, while the Nifty advanced 31.20 points, or 0.13%, to 24,253.10 as of 9:53 AM.
However, market analysts cautioned that the indices may not see sustained gains due to a subdued earnings season, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. The Nifty’s recent performance has raised key support levels, with a drop below 23,956 likely to trigger renewed bearish sentiment.
On the global front, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s reported selection of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary was viewed positively by market experts, given Bessent’s reputation as a fiscal conservative. This could help lower U.S. bond yields, potentially benefiting emerging markets, including India.
Market breadth remained favorable, with 1,572 stocks advancing and 694 declining.
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank, midcap, and smallcap registered modest gains. Top performers on the Sensex included Infosys, Tata Steel, and ICICI Bank, while UltraTech Cement and Hindustan Unilever saw declines.
In broader Asian markets, Jakarta, Seoul, and Tokyo declined, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Bangkok traded higher.

Title: Trump vows new Canada, Mexico, China tariffs that threaten global trade
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:03:21 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Monday pledged significant tariffs on the United States’ three largest trading partners—Canada, Mexico, and China—detailing his plans to implement campaign promises that could potentially trigger trade wars.
Trump, who will take office on January 20, 2025, announced he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico unless they take stronger action to curb drugs, especially fentanyl, and halt illegal migration. This move could violate existing free-trade agreements.
He also revealed plans for an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, marking some of his most specific comments about his economic agenda since winning the Nov. 5 election on promises to “put America first.”
“On January 20th, as one of my first Executive Orders, I will sign documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products entering the United States, and address its ridiculous open borders,” he posted on Truth Social.
Despite record migrant arrests under President Joe Biden, illegal border crossings have significantly dropped this year due to new restrictions and increased enforcement by Mexico.
Trump’s tariff proposals could disrupt industries, particularly those reliant on Mexico as a manufacturing base for the U.S. market. This could affect many Asian auto and electronics manufacturers. His tariff plans also seem to contradict the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed into law in 2020, which ensures largely duty-free trade between the countries. The agreement includes a “sunset” provision, which could allow Trump to renegotiate it in 2026.
After issuing his tariff threat, Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to discuss trade and border security. A Canadian source indicated the conversation was productive, and they agreed to remain in contact.
Trump’s threatened tariffs could serve as leverage to prompt renegotiations of the USMCA, said William Reinsch, a former president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “This strikes me more as a threat than anything else,” he said.
Mexico’s Ricardo Monreal, leader of the ruling Morena party, advocated for using bilateral mechanisms to address issues like human trafficking and drug trade, warning that escalating trade retaliation would only harm consumers.
Trump’s announcement led to a rally in the U.S. dollar, which rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while Asian and European equity markets fell.
On China, Trump criticized Beijing for not doing enough to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. from Mexico, threatening a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.
A Chinese embassy spokesperson responded, stating that China-U.S. trade cooperation is mutually beneficial and emphasized that no one wins a trade war. The spokesperson added that China had already taken steps to limit fentanyl-related exports.
Trump has previously threatened to end China’s most-favored-nation trading status and impose tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese imports.
Trump’s tariff proposals, including the potential invocation of the USMCA’s six-year review provision in 2026, have sparked concerns about a significant shift in U.S. trade policy. Economists warn that such tariffs could inflate costs, disrupt global trade, and impact U.S. businesses and consumers.

Title: One killed, dozens injured in clashes with Imran Khan’s supporters near Pakistan’s capital
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:02:56 +0000
Content: At least one police officer was killed and dozens of people injured in Pakistan as supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan clashed with security forces outside the capital Islamabad on Monday, officials and Khan’s party said.
Authorities have enforced a security lockdown for the last two days after Khan called for a march on parliament for a sit-in demonstration to demand his release, while highways into the city have been barricaded.
One police officer was shot and killed, at least 119 others were injured, and 22 police vehicles were torched in clashes just outside Islamabad and elsewhere in the Punjab province, provincial police chief Usman Anwar said. Two officers were in critical condition, he said.
Khan’s party said scores of its workers were also hurt.
It said the jailed leader’s third wife, Bushra Bibi, and a key aide, Ali Amin Gandapur, who is the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, were leading a march that arrived almost inside Islamabad on Monday night.
The government has used shipping containers to block major roads and streets in Islamabad, with patrols of police and paramilitary personnel in riot gear.
Officials and witnesses said all public transport between cities and terminals had also been shut down in the eastern province to keep away the protesters,
Provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari said about 80 of Khan’s supporters had been arrested.
Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told local Geo News TV that the government sought talks with leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to calm the situation. “It was a sincere attempt I must say but it didn’t yield any results,” he said.

Title: Bangladeshi cybercriminals target ISKCON’s spiritual media platforms after arrest of Hindu priest
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:48:56 +0000
Content: Hours after Bangladeshi authorities arrested and sent Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari to jail, ISKCON Bangladesh reported on Tuesday that its official social media page—critical for the promotion of Sanatan Dharma and the well-being of the Hindu community in the country—has been targeted by cybercriminals.
In a social media post, Charu Chanda Das Brahmachari, Secretary General of ISKCON Bangladesh, revealed that the organization’s official Facebook page, ISKCON TV Dhaka, had been maliciously attacked and removed by a group calling itself “Cyber Defender Bangladesh.” This group, claiming to be cybersecurity experts, publicly took responsibility for the attack, which violates Facebook’s policies and constitutes cyber harassment of the Hindu community.
“Unfortunately, our ISKCON TV Dhaka page was targeted and taken down by this group. This platform is integral for promoting Sanatan Dharma, ISKCON’s teachings, and Hindu spiritual values. Such acts are deeply distressing and unacceptable,” said Charu Chanda Das.
The attack was not limited to ISKCON TV Dhaka. Other significant platforms, including Mayapur TV, Jayapataka Swami Bangla, and the ISKCON Youth Forum Sylhet, were also targeted, causing widespread disruption.
In response, ISKCON has taken immediate action. “We have filed a General Diary (GD) with the Bangladesh Police and are in continuous communication with the Cyber Crime Investigation Department, DMP, Dhaka. The Deputy Commissioner of Cyber Crime Investigation has assured us of strict action against the perpetrators. We trust their support and are hopeful for swift justice,” Charu Chanda Das said.
He also highlighted the efforts of Garuda Cyber Shield, a team of dedicated Hindu cyber experts providing voluntary support to safeguard ISKCON’s online platforms. While the team successfully restored the ISKCON TV Dhaka page once, it was taken down again by the attackers. “Despite this setback, Garuda Cyber Shield continues its efforts to restore the page and enhance its security. Cyber harassment is a crime, and such attacks on religious platforms should not be tolerated,” he emphasized.
Charu Chanda Das also criticized Bangladeshi authorities for arresting Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who is closely associated with ISKCON Bangladesh.
The priest was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. He was produced before Judge Kazi Shariful Islam of Chittagong’s 6th Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Tuesday morning, where his bail plea was rejected, and he was sent to jail.
ISKCON Bangladesh, along with other Hindu organizations, has condemned the arrest, urging the Indian government to intervene. In a statement released late Monday, ISKCON said, “It is outrageous to make baseless allegations that ISKCON has anything to do with terrorism anywhere in the world. ISKCON is a peace-loving Bhakti movement. We urge the Indian government to speak to the Bangladeshi authorities and ensure the immediate release of Chinmoy Krishna Das.”
The organization further highlighted its prayers to Lord Krishna for the protection of devotees and reaffirmed its commitment to promoting harmony and spirituality despite the challenges posed by such attacks.

Title: Russia condemns “irresponsible” talk of nuclear weapons for Ukraine
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:37:18 +0000
Content: Discussion in the West about arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons is “absolutely irresponsible”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, in response to a report in the New York Times citing unidentified officials who suggested such a possibility.
The New York Times reported last week that some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine nuclear weapons before he leaves office.
“Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications,” the newspaper wrote.
Asked about the report, Peskov told reporters: “These are absolutely irresponsible arguments of people who have a poor understanding of reality and who do not feel a shred of responsibility when making such statements. We also note that all of these statements are anonymous.”
Earlier, senior Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev said that if the West supplied nuclear weapons to Ukraine then Moscow could consider such a transfer to be tantamount to an attack on Russia, providing grounds for a nuclear response.
Ukraine inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse, but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last month that as Ukraine had handed over the nuclear weapons, joining NATO was the only way it could deter Russia.
The 33-month Russia-Ukraine war saw escalations on both sides last week, after Ukraine fired U.S. and British missiles into Russia for the first time, with permission from the West, and Moscow responded by launching a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile into Ukraine.
Asked about the risk of a nuclear escalation, Peskov said the West should “listen carefully” to Putin and read Russia’s newly updated nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons.
Separately, Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said Moscow opposes simply freezing the conflict in Ukraine because it needs a “solid and long-term peace” that resolves the core reasons for the crisis.

Title: Israel expected to approve ceasefire with Hezbollah, Israeli official says
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:37:04 +0000
Content: Israel looks set to approve a U.S. plan for a ceasefire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah on Tuesday, a senior Israeli official said, clearing the way for an end to the conflict that has killed thousands of people since it was ignited by the Gaza war 14 months ago.
That optimism was shared by Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib who expressed hope at a G7 meeting in Italy that a ceasefire would be reached by Tuesday night.
Israel’s security cabinet is expected to convene later on Tuesday to discuss and likely approve the text at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said.
This would pave the way for a ceasefire declaration by U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, four senior Lebanese sources told Reuters on Monday.
In Washington, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday, “We’re close” but “nothing is done until everything is done”. The French presidency said discussions on a ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah had made significant progress.
The agreement requires Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon and Lebanon’s army to deploy in the region – a Hezbollah stronghold – within 60 days, officials say. Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the border south of the Litani River.
Israel demands effective U.N. enforcement of an eventual ceasefire with Lebanon and will show “zero tolerance” toward any infraction, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday.
The agreement with Lebanon will maintain Israel’s freedom of operation there to act in defence to remove threats posed by Hezbollah and enable displaced residents to return safely to their homes in northern Israel, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer told Reuters.
The proposal has already won approval in Beirut, where Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker Elias Bou Saab told Reuters on Monday there were no serious obstacles left to start implementing it – unless Netanyahu changed his mind.
Signs of a diplomatic breakthrough have been accompanied by a military escalation. Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday demolished more of Beirut’s Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, while the armed group has kept up rocket fire into Israel.
The widespread destruction left by Israeli airstrikes has brought into focus a huge reconstruction bill awaiting cash-strapped Lebanon, with more than 1 million people displaced and many left homeless heading into winter.
In Israel, a ceasefire will pave the way for 60,000 people to return to homes in the north, which they evacuated as Hezbollah began firing rockets in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas a day after that group’s Oct. 7, 2023 assault.
‘THE MISSILES ARE CHASING US’
Israel has dealt Hezbollah massive blows since going on the offensive against the group in September, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other top commanders, and pounding areas of Lebanon where the group holds sway.
“Regarding the ceasefire, I think it will be implemented. Both sides are tired – both sides are tired,” said Selim Ayoub, a 37-year-old mechanic from Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Hezbollah launched some 250 rockets on Sunday in one of its heaviest barrages yet. The northern Israeli city of Nahariya came under more rocket fire overnight.
“As we were about to sleep, we suddenly heard a huge explosion, the window in our fortified room was shaking,” said Ofir Ben David, who was evacuated earlier in the conflict from the Israeli community of Shomera on the Lebanese border.
“The missiles are chasing us all the time.”
Diplomacy to end the fighting has focused on restoring a ceasefire based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last major war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.
Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said on Monday that Israel would maintain an ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement.
Lebanon has previously objected to Israel being granted such a right, and Lebanese officials have said such language is not included in the draft proposal.
Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel has a side agreement with the U.S. allowing it to take action in Lebanon against “imminent threats.”
Senior Hezbollah official Mohammad Raad, writing in a Lebanese newspaper on Tuesday, said it was unlikely Israel would “accept any talk about halting its aggression against Lebanon without pressure or without exhausting the option of using force on the ground”.
“However, we will wait and see the results of the indirect negotiations,” he wrote.
Hezbollah, seen as a terrorist group by Washington, has endorsed its ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to negotiate.
DEATH TOLL
Over the past year, more than 3,750 people have been killed in Lebanon and over one million have been forced from their homes, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures.
Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 civilians in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.
Biden’s administration, which leaves office in January, has emphasised diplomacy to end the Lebanon conflict, even as all negotiations to halt the parallel war in Gaza are frozen.
U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk will be in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss using a potential Lebanon ceasefire as a catalyst for a deal to end hostilities in Gaza, the White House said.

Title: Sensex, Nifty end flat after two-day rally
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:35:18 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets closed flat on Tuesday, pausing after a strong two-day rally that had boosted indices by nearly 4%.
The Sensex ended the session at 80,004.06 points, slipping 105.79 points or 0.13%, while the Nifty settled at 24,194.50 points, down 27.40 points or 0.11%. Despite the gains from the recent uptrend, the Sensex remains about 6,000 points below its record high of 85,978 points.
The recent rally helped recoup some earlier losses driven by fund outflows, weaker-than-expected Q2 corporate earnings, and stubbornly high inflation. However, experts caution that the gains may be short-lived.
VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that the rally is unlikely to sustain amid persistent earnings concerns. He added, “The impact of short-covering and positive sentiment from the Maharashtra election results will be temporary. A sustained rally can only occur when signs of an earnings revival emerge, which is still some time away.”
Similarly, Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, observed a bullish intraday market sentiment but flagged temporary overbought conditions that could limit activity in the near term.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are poised to end November as net sellers in Indian stock markets for the second consecutive month, following a four-month buying streak until September.
According to data from the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), FPIs have sold stocks worth Rs 25,460 crore in November so far, though the pace of outflows has slowed in recent days.
Looking ahead to December, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting will be closely monitored for fresh cues. Persistent food inflation continues to delay potential rate cuts by the central bank.
The GDP figures, set to be released on November 29, will provide insights into the economy’s health. In the previous quarter, India’s GDP grew by 6.7%, falling short of the RBI’s 7.1% forecast. Persistently high food inflation is also delaying potential rate cuts by the central bank.

Title: World Athletics President ‘very pleased’ with India’s 2036 Olympic Games interest but warns of hurdles
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:21:48 +0000
Content: World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said he was delighted with India’s interest in hosting the 2036 summer Games but cautioned the South Asian nation that organising an Olympics was one of the world’s most complex projects.
Coe, 68, a two-time Olympic 1,500 metres champion, is one of seven people bidding to replace Thomas Bach as the next president of the International Olympic Committee.
India is a growing sports power but has never hosted the Olympics. Its capital New Delhi hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi’s answer to the Beijing Olympics.
But a series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation in the leadup to the Delhi Commonwealth Games muddied India’s reputation as hosts of international multi-sports events.
On Monday, Coe, whose grandfather was Indian, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the country’s sports minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, in Delhi where the prospect of India’s bid for the 2036 Games was discussed.
“I was very pleased that India is obviously keen to one day stage an Olympic Games,” Coe, who headed the bidding and organising committee that delivered the hugely successful 2012 London Olympics, told Reuters on Tuesday.
“We know that the Olympic Games is a unique sporting event and it doesn’t surprise me that a country with the type of ambitions that India has and the vision for sports beyond the field of play and into the delivery of social and economic benefits, (it) would look at staging a Games.”
Indonesia, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also among countries that have shown interest in hosting the 2036 Games. Los Angeles has been picked for the 2028 Games while Australia’s Brisbane will stage the 2032 Olympics.
India would need political support throughout the delivery phase if it wins the bid, Coe said, adding that the organising committee must regularly inform the nation and the local communities about the benefits of hosting the Games.
“And be clear about what the legacy is. Don’t let others define your legacy, define it yourself,” he said during an interview in Mumbai, the country’s financial capital.
“Whether it’s on sports or social and urban planning, whether it’s about health and related fitness, it may be all of those things, but be very clear what your legacy is, because if you’re not, then others will define it for you, and that may not end well.”
The world’s most populous nation has an astonishingly poor return at the Olympics and the seven medals won in Tokyo 2020 was its biggest haul from a single Games. Eight of its 10 gold medals came from hockey between 1928-1980 while shooting and athletics yielded one each.
However, Coe lauded the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for its role in promoting ‘kids’ athletics’ in India and said his visit was recognition for the AFI’s efforts.
“… It is a way of encouraging obviously more young people into athletics, but also critically more young people into healthy lifestyles, both mental and physical. Athletics as we know, is the Queen, the mother, of all sports,” he said.

Title: “21% posts lying vacant in district courts, government must invest more”: Former CJI Chandrachud
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:21:25 +0000
Content: Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud has called on the government to address the severe shortage of judges in district courts, highlighting that 21% of judicial posts remain vacant.
In a recent interview, Justice Chandrachud, who recently retired, pointed out that India’s judge-to-population ratio is among the lowest in the world, stressing the need for urgent reforms.
“We do not have the necessary number of judges to handle the immense caseload coming into the district judiciary. The first priority should be to increase the judge-to-population ratio by appointing more judges,” Justice Chandrachud said.
Highlighting the staffing shortages in the judiciary, he said: “At present, about 21% of the posts in district judiciaries are vacant. Additionally, 27% of staffing positions in the district judiciary remain unfilled. In a federal structure like ours, recruitment is handled by high courts and public service commissions in certain states.”
To address these gaps, the former CJI proposed the creation of a national judicial service examination to streamline recruitment across the country.
“I believe one solution to fill these vacancies is to establish an all-India judicial service examination, where recruitment would take place through a unified system. States would conduct the recruitment, but there should be a national examination every year, scheduled in advance, with selections made based on merit,” he said, adding that such a reform would require a constitutional amendment, as state governors currently oversee district judge appointments.
Justice Chandrachud also defended the Supreme Court’s role as a protector of the common man, countering perceptions that it primarily serves the wealthy.
“The Supreme Court is not a court for the rich. It deals with the issues of the common people. In the last two years, we disposed of 21,358 bail applications, more than were filed. Many of these applications were from ordinary citizens facing charges such as cheating, assaults, and narcotics-related offenses.”
Responding to concerns about potential religious bias in court decisions, Justice Chandrachud refuted such claims, pointing out that bail is granted across all communities based on the merits of individual cases. “The number of people from all communities who are granted bail proves that religious factors do not influence decisions. The decision to grant bail is based on the specifics of each case, as assessed by the bench or judge,” he added.
However, he expressed concerns about the reluctance of district courts to grant bail, attributing it to a growing culture of mistrust.
District judges are hesitant to grant bail due to fears of extraneous allegations. This mistrust is a concern. We, as superior court judges, must protect the integrity of judges at the lower levels of the judiciary. If a district judge grants bail incorrectly, it can be corrected by a higher court. But we should not target judges who make such decisions,” he said.

Title: Bangladesh: Sound grenades fired, batons used against supporters of Chinmoy Prabhu in Chittagong
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 10:45:45 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, law enforcement authorities used batons and fired sound grenades at devotees and followers of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, also known as Chinmoy Prabhu of ISKCON Pundrik Dham, who had gathered outside the Chittagong Magistrate’s Court to demand the release of their leader.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Chittagong Metropolitan Court ordered the imprisonment of Chinmoy Prabhu, who also serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Manch, after rejecting his bail plea. He was arrested by Dhaka police on Monday at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport while attempting to board a flight to Chittagong.
Chinmoy Krishna Das and the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote have been advocating for the rights and safety of the Sanatani (Hindu) community across Bangladesh. They have raised eight key demands for the protection and rights of minorities in the country.
Following his arrest, thousands of Hindu men and women held protest marches in Chittagong, particularly in the Cheragi Pahar area, demanding his immediate release. Similar rallies were held in cities including Dhaka, Rangpur, Khulna, and Cox’s Bazar.
In Dhaka, protesters were attacked by miscreants while marching near Shahbagh Junction, leaving two individuals injured.
On October 30, a sedition case was filed against Chinmoy Prabhu and 18 others at Kotwali Police Station in Chittagong. The charges were related to allegedly hoisting a saffron flag above the official flag of Bangladesh during a public rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram on October 25.
Following large-scale public rallies by the Hindu community in Chittagong on October 25 and in Rangpur, North Bangladesh on November 22, Chinmoy Prabhu has sparked significant attention in Bangladesh’s socio-political circles.

Title: India urges Bangladesh to ensure safety of Hindus and all minorities after arrest of Hindu priest
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 10:08:49 +0000
Content: India has expressed its “deep concern” over the arrest and subsequent denial of bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sanatan Jagaran Mancha and head of Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.
Das was taken into custody by the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport around 4:30 pm on Monday. He was later produced before Judge Kazi Shariful Islam of Chittagong’s 6th Metropolitan Magistrate Court at approximately 10:30 am local time on Tuesday.
After rejecting his bail plea, the judge sent the Hindu priest—who is also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)—to jail.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) condemned the arrest and denial of bail, stating it has taken note of the incident with “deep concern.” The MEA also highlighted the broader issue of ongoing violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh. The ministry added, “This incident follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh. Documented cases of arson, looting of minority homes and businesses, theft, vandalism, and desecration of deities and temples are deeply troubling.”
The MEA expressed concern that while the perpetrators of these attacks remain at large, charges were pressed against a religious leader who had been peacefully gathering to present legitimate demands. The ministry also noted the attacks on minorities protesting peacefully against Das’s arrest.
India called on Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, emphasizing their right to peaceful assembly and expression.
Protests erupted in several parts of Bangladesh after news of Das’s arrest spread on social media late Monday. In Chittagong, hundreds of Hindus gathered at the Cheragi intersection to demand his immediate release. Video footage circulating online showed Bangladeshi police charging at the protesters, who were chanting slogans in support of Das. It is believed that several Hindu protesters were injured during the clash.
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) also called on the Indian government to intervene. “We have come across disturbing reports that Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das, one of the prominent leaders of ISKCON Bangladesh, has been detained by Dhaka police. It is outrageous to make baseless allegations that ISKCON has anything to do with terrorism anywhere in the world,” ISKCON said in a press release late Monday night. “ISKCON urges the Government of India to take immediate steps, speak to the government of Bangladesh, and convey that we are a peace-loving Bhakti movement.”
ISKCON, a Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindu religious organization with followers worldwide, also appealed for the immediate release of Das, offering prayers for his safety and protection.
This latest incident has raised serious concerns about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh, who form the country’s largest minority community. There have been repeated incidents of vandalism, looting, arson, land grabbing, and threats to force Hindus to leave the country, particularly since the interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus assumed power on August 8.
Earlier, the Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Oikya Parishad sent an open letter to Yunus, expressing profound sorrow and concern over the increasing violence against minorities. Despite assurances from Yunus and his religious affairs advisor A.F.M. Khalid Hossain that the current government supports communal harmony, the violence, which intensified after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka, continues to foster widespread fear and uncertainty among Bangladesh’s Hindu community.

Title: All you need to know about PAN 2.0
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:47:46 +0000
Content: A day after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved PAN 2.0, the Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a detailed clarification on the project, comprising 11 frequently asked questions (FAQs) to offer taxpayers detailed insights into the new system.
1. What is PAN 2.0? 
PAN 2.0 is an e-Governance initiative by the Income Tax Department aimed at re-engineering business processes for taxpayer registration services. The objective is to enhance the quality of PAN services by adopting the latest technology. The project consolidates all processes related to PAN allotment, updates, corrections, and merges TAN-related services. Additionally, online PAN authentication/validation services will be available for user agencies, including financial institutions, banks, and central and state government bodies.
2. How will PAN 2.0 differ from the existing setup? 
i. Integration of Platforms: Currently, PAN-related services are hosted across three portals (e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal, and Protean e-Gov Portal). PAN 2.0 will unify all PAN/TAN-related services under a single portal, providing end-to-end services like allotment, corrections, Aadhaar-PAN linking, online PAN validation (OPV), and e-PAN requests. 
ii. Adoption of Paperless Processes: PAN 2.0 will enable fully online, paperless processes, unlike the existing modes. 
iii. Taxpayer Facilitation: PAN updates/corrections will be free, and e-PANs will be sent to registered email addresses. For physical PAN cards, applicants must pay Rs 50 for domestic delivery or Rs 15 plus postal charges for international delivery.
3. Do existing PAN cardholders need to apply for a new PAN under the upgraded system? 
No, existing PAN cardholders are not required to apply for a new PAN under PAN 2.0.
4. Can corrections like name, spelling, or address changes be made to PAN? 
Yes. Existing PAN holders can update details such as name, date of birth, email, mobile number, or address free of cost after PAN 2.0 is launched. Until then, PAN holders can update email, mobile, or address through Aadhaar-based facilities using these links: 
– [NSDL Address Update](https://www.onlineservices.nsdl.com/paam/endUserAddressUpdate.html) 
– [UTIITSL Address Update](https://www.pan.utiitsl.com/PAN_ONLINE/homeaddresschange)
For other updates/corrections, users can follow the existing process by visiting physical centers or applying online with applicable fees.
5. Do I need to replace my current PAN card under PAN 2.0? 
No, your current PAN card remains valid unless you request updates or corrections.
6. What about those using outdated addresses? How will new PAN cards be delivered? 
No new PAN cards will be delivered unless requested by the holder due to updates/corrections. Address changes can be made for free using the Aadhaar-based update facilities mentioned above.
7. If new PAN cards are QR code-enabled, will older ones still work? What is the purpose of the QR code? 
i. QR codes have been a feature since 2017-18 and will continue under PAN 2.0 with enhancements like dynamic QR codes that display the latest data in the PAN database. 
ii. PAN holders with older cards without QR codes can request a new card in both the current and PAN 2.0 systems. 
iii. QR codes validate PAN details, and a specific QR reader app displays details such as photo, name, signature, and date of birth.
8. What is the “Common Business Identifier for all business-related activities”? 
As announced in the Union Budget 2023, PAN will serve as a common identifier for business establishments required to use it across all specified government agency systems.
9. Will the Common Business Identifier replace the PAN? 
No, PAN itself will function as the Common Business Identifier.
10. What does the “Unified Portal” mean? 
Currently, PAN-related services are spread across three portals. Under PAN 2.0, all services related to PAN and TAN, including allotments, corrections, and validation, will be hosted on a single unified portal. This will streamline processes, reduce delays, and simplify grievance redressal.
11. How will the system address cases of duplicate PANs? 
Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, individuals cannot hold more than one PAN. If anyone holds multiple PANs, they are required to notify their jurisdictional assessing officer for deactivation. PAN 2.0 will employ advanced system logic and centralized mechanisms to minimize instances of duplicate PANs.

Title: Pakistan: Violent clashes erupt as PTI protestors seize Islamabad’s zero point
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:42 +0000
Content: After violent clashes with security forces that left at least six people dead earlier in the day, thousands of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protestors have forced their way into Islamabad and seized Zero Point ‘D-Chowk,’ where they plan to stage an indefinite sit-in until their leader, former Prime Minister Imran Khan, is released from jail.
Violence continues to erupt across the capital as security forces struggle to contain the unrest. Bushra Bibi, the wife of Imran Khan and the rally’s driving force, has urged party workers and supporters to maintain their grip on the sensitive location.
Addressing a massive crowd at Jinnah Avenue, Bushra Bibi took an oath from the supporters, pledging to stay at the site until her husband’s release. “Promise me that we will not leave D-Chowk until Imran Khan is released and stands here among us. If anyone claims I have left, know that it is a lie,” she said.
“I appeal to the people of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to join us. Do not leave D-Chowk, even if we face a shortage of food and water. We will stay here for as long as it takes,” she added, cautioning protestors not to trust any statements allegedly made by Imran Khan from Adiala Jail.
“Our plan will not change until Imran Khan comes out and tells us what to do next. No matter the pressure, wait for him to address us directly,” she insisted.
Meanwhile, the government has warned of “extreme measures” to protect the capital from what it described as “mob attacks.”
“We have called in the Pakistan Army to secure the Red Zone. I want to warn PTI again not to test our patience. We are exercising extreme caution and refraining from using force against PTI miscreants to avoid loss of life and bloodshed. However, our forces have been attacked with gunfire and direct assaults, leading to the martyrdom of police and ranger personnel,” said Federal Information Minister Atta Tarar.
“PTI wants to see dead bodies to play its dirty politics and is exploiting innocent lives to further its evil agenda. We will not allow this chaos to continue for too long,” he added.
Despite the government’s warnings, PTI leadership remains in contact with Imran Khan, seeking his input on backdoor negotiations with the government. However, Bushra Bibi has reiterated that the protest will not end until Khan is released.
Analysts suggest that Bushra Bibi has emerged as the central decision-maker in the PTI, overshadowing senior leaders like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.

Title: ‘Committed to upholding communal harmony,’ Says Bangladesh govt after jailing Hindu priest
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:51:29 +0000
Content: Facing severe backlash from Hindus worldwide over the shocking arrest and jailing of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sanatan Jagaran Mancha and head of Pundarik Dham in Chittagong, the Bangladesh government, led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus, went into damage control mode, asserting its commitment to “upholding communal harmony” in the country.
After being taken into custody by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Detective Branch (DB) at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport around 4:30 PM on Monday, Das was presented before Judge Kazi Shariful Islam of Chittagong’s 6th Metropolitan Court at around 10:30 AM local time on Tuesday.
The judge, after rejecting his bail plea, sent the Hindu priest—who is also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)—to jail.
Condemning the shocking developments, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Tuesday that it had noted with “deep concern” the arrest and denial of bail to Das, who is also affiliated with ISKCON in Bangladesh.
Highlighting the broader context of continuing violence against minorities in Bangladesh, especially Hindus, the MEA added, “This incident follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh. Documented cases of arson, looting of minority homes and businesses, theft, vandalism, and desecration of deities and temples have been deeply troubling.”
“It is unfortunate that, while the perpetrators of these incidents remain at large, charges are being pressed against a religious leader who was presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings. We also note with concern the attacks on minorities protesting peacefully against the arrest of Shri Das,” the Ministry said.
India also urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right to peaceful assembly and expression.
Reacting to MEA’s statement late Tuesday evening, the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry said that the matter was an “internal affair” of Bangladesh.
“It is with utter dismay and a deep sense of hurt that the Government of Bangladesh notes that the arrest of Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued by certain quarters since Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested on specific charges. The Government of Bangladesh maintains that such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighboring countries,” read a statement issued by the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry.
It further emphasized that India’s statement does not reflect the harmony that exists among the peoples of all faiths and the commitment and efforts of the Bangladeshi government and its people in maintaining such unity.
“Bangladesh reaffirms in the strongest terms that every Bangladeshi, regardless of religious identity, has the right to establish, maintain, and perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance. Ensuring the safety and security of all citizens, particularly religious minorities, remains a duty of the Government of Bangladesh. This was yet again vindicated by the peaceful observance of Durga Puja throughout Bangladesh only last month,” the statement continued.
Meanwhile, local authorities in Chittagong have claimed that a lawyer was killed during a clash between police and followers of Das in the Chattogram Court Building area.
The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry stated that the interim government is deeply concerned over the “brutal killing” of 32-year-old advocate Saiful Islam Alif, and authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at all costs.
However, local media quoted Hindu leaders who denied any involvement in the lawyer’s death.
“Kanchan Acharjee, a central leader of the Sammilita Jagaran Jote, denied the involvement of their organization in the violence and the killing of the lawyer in Chattogram. He also demanded the authorities concerned carry out a proper investigation into the killing and bring the culprits to justice,” reported Bangladesh’s Daily Star.

Title: Terrorist organizations challenging India’s security will face befitting reply: PM Modi on Constitution day
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:56:38 +0000
Content: On the occasion of Constitution Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaffirmed India’s commitment to countering terrorist threats, asserting that any terrorist organization challenging India’s security will receive a “befitting reply.” Speaking at a special event at the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister emphasized the significance of the Indian Constitution, marking its 75th year and highlighting its guiding role in shaping the nation’s present and future.
Reflecting on the Constitution’s enduring relevance, PM Modi described it as a “vibrant, constantly flowing stream.” He said that the Constitution is not just a historical document but a living guide that continues to shape India’s policies, ensuring the welfare of citizens and facilitating ease of living. The Prime Minister also stressed the government’s ongoing efforts to implement policies in alignment with the spirit of the Constitution.
In his speech, PM Modi recalled the tragic Mumbai terror attack of 2008, which occurred on Constitution Day, and paid tribute to those who lost their lives. He underscored the nation’s resolve to confront terrorism, adding, “Every terrorist organization challenging the security of India will get a befitting reply.”
The Prime Minister also highlighted various initiatives that reflect the government’s commitment to improving citizens’ quality of life. Citing the Digital Life Certificate, a facility that enables senior citizens to confirm their pensions online without having to visit banks in person, PM Modi pointed out that around 1.5 crore senior citizens have benefited from the service.
Continuing his focus on welfare, PM Modi mentioned the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, which has now expanded to cover citizens over the age of 70. He also emphasized the importance of accessible tap water, noting that while it may seem commonplace today, only three crore households had access to it even after 75 years of independence.
On the cultural and moral foundation of India, PM Modi referred to the original copy of the Constitution, which includes images of Lord Ram and Mother Sita. These images, he explained, symbolize the core human values that continue to guide India’s policies and decisions today.
The Prime Minister also addressed challenges to the Constitution, particularly referencing the Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi government. He reflected on his government’s historic decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which he said ensured full implementation of the Constitution in the region. “It’s the power of the Constitution that today, in Jammu and Kashmir, Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution is fully implemented,” he said.
PM Modi acknowledged the significant transformation India is undergoing, with the Constitution serving as a beacon during this period of change. He quoted Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who famously stated during the Constituent Assembly debates, “The Constitution is not a mere lawyer’s document. Its spirit is always the spirit of age.” This spirit, according to the Prime Minister, continues to guide India’s progress.
During the Constitution Day celebrations, Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna presented a painting made by a prisoner from Tihar Jail to PM Modi. The Prime Minister also released the Annual Report of the Indian Judiciary 2023-24, marking another significant milestone in the country’s judicial journey.

Title: Amit Sadh returns with the thrilling season 2 of ‘motorcycles saved my life’
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:53:52 +0000
Content: Amit Sadh, the Bollywood actor renowned for his passion for motorcycling, is back with the much-anticipated Season 2 of “Motorcycles Saved My Life (MSML).” Building on the success of the first season, which followed his transformative 5,288-kilometer solo journey through Kinnaur, Spiti, Zanskar Valley, and Leh, the new season ventures even deeper into the rugged beauty of Leh and Ladakh, offering an experience filled with raw adventure and profound personal discovery.
In the first season, Amit took viewers on a thrilling ride through breathtaking landscapes. But for Season 2, he pushes beyond the well-trodden paths, venturing into hidden corners of the Himalayas, from remote villages to untouched plains, and exploring locations that are steeped in rich culture and history.
This season takes audiences on an intimate journey through the tranquility of Pangong Lake, the ancient meditation caves of Alchi, and the nomadic settlements of the Kharnak Valley, revealing the unfiltered essence of adventure and the deep human connections found along the way.
Speaking about the second season, Amit shared said, “Motorcycles Saved My Life is more than just a ride—it’s a journey into the soul. Season 1 was transformative, but this time, I’ve ventured even further into the unknown. It’s about pushing boundaries, embracing the wild, and finding connections in the most unexpected places. Whether it’s sharing moments with nomads or exploring untouched landscapes, this season is a celebration of the freedom and joy that riding brings.”
Season 2 of “Motorcycles Saved My Life”
Reflecting on his transformative journey in Season 1, Amit recalls how his ride on the Triumph Tiger wasn’t merely a test of endurance but a quest for deeper connection with nature, the people he met, and himself. For Amit, MSML became more than a television series—it was a platform for him to showcase his authentic self and invite his fans to join him on a deeply personal journey of growth and discovery.
Season 2, however, takes this philosophy to a whole new level, as Amit pushes into even more remote and untouched locations in Ladakh. The landscapes he encounters are nothing short of otherworldly—vast plains, isolated villages, and locations that seem frozen in time. Amidst this raw beauty, Amit finds profound moments of connection with nature and the people who inhabit these remote areas, offering a glimpse into a way of life that remains largely untouched by modernity.
One of the highlights of this season includes Amit’s time spent at Tso Kar, where he not only immersed himself in the serene surroundings of the village of Thukje but also got a taste of the nomadic lifestyle. There, he forged meaningful connections with locals, who shared their unique ways of life, deepened by their enduring relationship with the land.
Amit’s emotional journey continued in Kharnak Valley, where he met Chopel Ji, the Goba, or leader, of the nomads of Thukje. In their temporary settlement, Amit learned firsthand about the sacrifices and resilience required to live in such a harsh environment. He was moved by the strength of their culture and the quiet dignity they carried, even in the face of the challenges of their nomadic existence.
A Journey of Self-Discovery
Throughout his journey, Amit had several opportunities to witness the region’s rich wildlife. On the remote plains, he encountered blue sheep, kiyangs (wild horses), and herds of goats, underscoring the pristine, untouched nature of Ladakh and its thriving ecosystem. Amit also had an unforgettable camping experience at Merak Village, on the peaceful southern banks of Pangong Lake. There, under the stars, he braved the icy waters of the lake, and in a rare and magical moment, witnessed a double rainbow, a sight that reinforced the wonder and beauty of the region.
One of the season’s most touching moments occurred when Amit met a group of international motorcyclists at Merak. Despite their diverse backgrounds, a shared love for riding created an instant bond among them. Amit remarked that the shared passion for motorcycles bridges cultural and geographic divides, creating connections that transcend borders.
Another highlight was his visit to Thiksey, where Amit engaged in a profound conversation with a senior Lama. The Lama’s calm demeanor and insightful wisdom had a lasting impact on Amit, prompting deep reflection on his own journey and personal growth.
While exploring the Buddhist meditation caves of Alchi, Amit was struck by the rich history and spiritual energy of the place. However, he also noticed something that troubled him deeply—graffiti and names scribbled on the walls of the caves. The disrespect shown to such sacred spaces left him uneasy, underscoring the importance of preserving and honoring the cultural and spiritual heritage of these sacred sites.
Spiritual Reflections
Throughout the season, Amit’s journey was marked by moments of introspection and growth. For him, Motorcycles Saved My Life is more than just about crossing kilometers or ticking off destinations from a list. It’s about experiencing life in its rawest form, embracing the freedom that riding offers, and finding beauty in both the landscapes and the people encountered along the way.
As Amit put it, “Riding isn’t just about the destination; it’s about the joy, the freedom, and the connection I feel with the road and the bike beneath me. It’s about finding the beauty in the landscapes, the people I meet, and even the challenges I face along the way.”
The philosophy behind MSML aligns seamlessly with Reise Moto, a key collaborator for the series. The company’s tagline, “The Joy of Riding,” resonates deeply with Amit’s approach to motorcycling and exploration. Through this collaboration, both Amit and Reise Moto seek to inspire viewers to embrace the thrill of adventure and the unparalleled joy that comes from connecting with the world through the lens of a motorcycle.
“Life is a Ride”
Beyond his work on Motorcycles Saved My Life, Amit Sadh has a busy year ahead, with several exciting film projects lined up. He is set to appear in two much-anticipated movies: Pune Highway, a gripping thriller directed by Bugs Bhargav and produced under the 10 Years Younger Productions banner, and Pratap, an action-packed drama by UV Films where Amit plays an encounter specialist in a high-stakes, powerful role. Both films showcase Amit’s impressive range as an actor and promise to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.
But for Amit, Motorcycles Saved My Life is more than just a show—it’s a movement. Through every episode, he invites viewers to join him in embracing the joy of adventure, reconnecting with their inner spirit, and experiencing the transformative power of exploration. As he eloquently put it, “Life is a ride. It’s not about getting from point A to point B; it’s about enjoying the journey, the people you meet along the way, and the moments that make life unforgettable.”

Title: Seven NDRF teams deployed as IMD warns of heavy rain in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:34:24 +0000
Content: In anticipation of heavy to very heavy rainfall over the next three days, seven teams from the 4th Battalion of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), each comprising 30 rescuers and two canine units, have been mobilized across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The teams are set to be deployed in key districts, including Karaikal, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, and Mayiladuthurai, to assist in rescue and relief operations.
The Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai reported on Tuesday that a depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal has intensified into a deep depression and is likely to develop into a cyclonic storm by Wednesday, November 27. The system is expected to move northwards toward the Tamil Nadu coast, skirting Sri Lanka’s coastline.
S. Balachandran, Director of the RMC, Chennai, confirmed the development, saying, “The depression intensified into a deep depression this morning and is likely to strengthen into a cyclonic storm. Continuous monitoring is underway to track its movement and intensification.”
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued multiple weather alerts, including a red alert for extremely heavy rainfall in Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, and Tiruvarur on November 26, extending to two other districts on November 27. Chennai has been placed under a yellow alert for heavy rain from November 27 to 29, with neighboring districts, including Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu, under yellow and orange alerts until November 30.
The city of Chennai and its suburbs have already experienced widespread rainfall, leading to waterlogging in several areas. Streets remain inundated with rainwater mixed with sewage, causing disruptions and forcing residents to remain indoors. Schools and colleges in multiple districts, including Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, and Tiruvarur, have been closed as a precautionary measure.
The IMD has forecast intense rainfall activity for November 26, with extremely heavy rain expected in Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, and Karaikal. Heavy to very heavy rain is also predicted for isolated locations in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Villupuram, Cuddalore, and Puducherry.
For November 27, light to moderate rain accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning is expected in most parts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. On November 28, similar weather conditions are forecast, particularly in coastal Tamil Nadu and parts of interior Tamil Nadu.

Title: Constitution has lived up to every expectation and need of country: PM Modi
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 13:58:41 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday lauded the Indian Constitution as a guiding light that has lived up to the nation’s expectations and needs, highlighting its role in shaping India’s transformation. Speaking at the Constitution Day celebrations held in the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister emphasized the Constitution’s enduring relevance in steering the country through monumental changes.
“Our Constitution has fulfilled every expectation and need of the country. It is due to its power that the vision of Baba Saheb’s Constitution has been fully realized in Jammu and Kashmir,” PM Modi said, referring to the complete implementation of the Indian Constitution in the region following the abrogation of Article 370. He added that for the first time, Constitution Day was also celebrated in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a historic milestone.
The Prime Minister underscored the transformative phase India is currently experiencing and attributed this progress to the Constitution’s guiding principles. Quoting Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, he said, “The Constitution is not a mere lawyer’s document; its spirit is always the spirit of the age.”
PM Modi also paid homage to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, which coincides with Constitution Day, and issued a stern warning to terrorist organizations. “Those who challenge India’s security will face a befitting response. I pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the Mumbai terror attack and reiterate the country’s commitment to safeguarding its security.”
As part of the celebrations, Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna presented PM Modi with a painting created by a prisoner from Tihar Jail. Additionally, the Prime Minister released the Annual Report of Indian Judiciary 2023-24, showcasing the judiciary’s achievements and initiatives over the past year.
Marking the 75th year of the adoption of the Indian Constitution, PM Modi expressed pride in the nation’s journey, saluting the members of the Constituent Assembly who laid the foundation for a modern, democratic India. “This Constitution is our guiding light, ensuring that our democracy thrives and our nation progresses,” he said.

Title: World’s oldest man dies aged 112 in England

Content: John Tinniswood, an Englishman born the same year the Titanic sank and who survived two world wars and two global pandemics, has died aged 112, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, months after it recognised him as the world’s oldest man.
Tinniswood passed away on Monday at a care home in Southport, northwest England, surrounded by “music and love”, his family told Guinness World Records in a statement.
“John had many fine qualities. He was intelligent, decisive, brave, calm in any crisis, talented at maths and a great conversationalist,” his family said.
Born in August 1912 in Liverpool, he went on to meet his wife Blodwen at a dance before marrying her in 1942, at the height of World War II when he served in the Royal Army Pay Corps, which was responsible for finances and food supplies.
Tinniswood, who is survived by a daughter, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, later worked as an accountant in the oil industry before retiring aged 60. His wife died in 1986.
From the age of 100 to 110 he received a birthday card each year from the late Queen Elizabeth, who was 14 years his junior. She died in 2022.
Besides eating a portion of his favourite food (battered fish and chips) every Friday, Tinniswood followed no special diet.
He stayed mentally active, keeping up with the news and managing his own finances, which may have contributed to his longevity, Guinness World Records said.
When Guinness World Records awarded him the title of world’s oldest man in April this year, Tinniswood said there was no huge secret to his longevity, insisting it was “just luck”.
“You either live long or you live short, and you can’t do much about it,” he said.

Title: Bangladeshi cybercriminals target ISKCON’s spiritual media platforms after arrest of Hindu priest
Publication Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:48:56 +0000
Content: Hours after Bangladeshi authorities arrested and sent Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari to jail, ISKCON Bangladesh reported on Tuesday that its official social media page—critical for the promotion of Sanatan Dharma and the well-being of the Hindu community in the country—has been targeted by cybercriminals.
In a social media post, Charu Chanda Das Brahmachari, Secretary General of ISKCON Bangladesh, revealed that the organization’s official Facebook page, ISKCON TV Dhaka, had been maliciously attacked and removed by a group calling itself “Cyber Defender Bangladesh.” This group, claiming to be cybersecurity experts, publicly took responsibility for the attack, which violates Facebook’s policies and constitutes cyber harassment of the Hindu community.
“Unfortunately, our ISKCON TV Dhaka page was targeted and taken down by this group. This platform is integral for promoting Sanatan Dharma, ISKCON’s teachings, and Hindu spiritual values. Such acts are deeply distressing and unacceptable,” said Charu Chanda Das.
The attack was not limited to ISKCON TV Dhaka. Other significant platforms, including Mayapur TV, Jayapataka Swami Bangla, and the ISKCON Youth Forum Sylhet, were also targeted, causing widespread disruption.
In response, ISKCON has taken immediate action. “We have filed a General Diary (GD) with the Bangladesh Police and are in continuous communication with the Cyber Crime Investigation Department, DMP, Dhaka. The Deputy Commissioner of Cyber Crime Investigation has assured us of strict action against the perpetrators. We trust their support and are hopeful for swift justice,” Charu Chanda Das said.
He also highlighted the efforts of Garuda Cyber Shield, a team of dedicated Hindu cyber experts providing voluntary support to safeguard ISKCON’s online platforms. While the team successfully restored the ISKCON TV Dhaka page once, it was taken down again by the attackers. “Despite this setback, Garuda Cyber Shield continues its efforts to restore the page and enhance its security. Cyber harassment is a crime, and such attacks on religious platforms should not be tolerated,” he emphasized.
Charu Chanda Das also criticized Bangladeshi authorities for arresting Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who is closely associated with ISKCON Bangladesh.
The priest was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. He was produced before Judge Kazi Shariful Islam of Chittagong’s 6th Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Tuesday morning, where his bail plea was rejected, and he was sent to jail.
ISKCON Bangladesh, along with other Hindu organizations, has condemned the arrest, urging the Indian government to intervene. In a statement released late Monday, ISKCON said, “It is outrageous to make baseless allegations that ISKCON has anything to do with terrorism anywhere in the world. ISKCON is a peace-loving Bhakti movement. We urge the Indian government to speak to the Bangladeshi authorities and ensure the immediate release of Chinmoy Krishna Das.”
The organization further highlighted its prayers to Lord Krishna for the protection of devotees and reaffirmed its commitment to promoting harmony and spirituality despite the challenges posed by such attacks.

Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 07:14:48 +0000
Content: The Centre has approved an outlay of Rs 1,000 crore for various disaster mitigation and capacity-building projects to tackle natural calamities in 15 states, according to an official statement.
A sum of Rs 139 crore each was approved for Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, Rs 100 crore for Maharashtra, Rs 72 crore each for Karnataka and Kerala, Rs 50 crore each for Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and Rs 378 crore for the eight Northeastern states — Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura.
The decision was taken by a high-level committee headed by Home Minister Amit Shah with Union Ministers for finance and agriculture and the vice chairman of the NITI Aayog as members. They considered the proposal to mitigate landslide risk in 15 states for funding from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF).
The committee also gave the go-ahead to a project for training and capacity building of civil defence volunteers in all states and union territories at a total outlay of Rs 115.67 crore. The funding window of the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) will be used to finance the project.
Earlier, the committee approved Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Projects in seven cities at a total outlay of Rs 3,075.65 crore and Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) risk management projects in four states at a total outlay of Rs 150 crore from the NDMF.
“To fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of disaster resilient India, the Ministry of Home Affairs has taken several initiatives to ensure effective management of disasters in the country,” the statement said.
Several measures have been taken to prevent any extensive loss of life and property during disasters by strengthening the disaster risk reduction system in India, the statement said.
Under the Modi government, more than Rs 21,476 crore has already been released to the states during this year. This includes Rs 14,878.40 crore from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to 26 states, Rs 4,637.66 crore from the NDRF to 15 states, Rs 1,385.45 crore from the State Disaster Mitigation Fund to 11 states and Rs 574.93 crore from NDMF to six states, the statement added.

Title: Jaishankar defends India’s energy policy and calls for diplomacy in Ukraine conflict amid western criticism
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 06:02:52 +0000
Content: In a strong rebuttal to Western criticism over India’s continued purchase of Russian oil amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized that nations must prioritize their own interests, just as Europe does, and questioned the selective approach towards disengagement with Russia.
In an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera, Jaishankar responded to concerns over India’s oil imports from Russia, asserting that every region has its own priorities. He pointed out that Europe’s business dealings with Russia had been far from consistent and accused European nations of applying “unreasonable expectations” to the rest of the world.

“This part of the world has to understand that every part of the world has its own interests. The priorities of Europe are different from those of countries in Asia, Africa, or Latin America. If everything is truly a matter of principle, Europe should have cut off all its business with Russia. But it hasn’t. It has been selective in its disengagement,” Jaishankar said. He further questioned, “Why should India pay higher prices just to make you (Europe) happy?”
Jaishankar also noted that Europe’s shift away from Russian energy sources had placed additional pressure on global oil markets. “Europe was importing energy from Russia, and when it started diverting to other producers, it impacted global prices. What are we supposed to do? Pay higher prices to accommodate Europe’s decisions?” Jaishankar asked, stressing the importance of respecting the interests of all countries.
Jaishankar reiterated that India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war advocates for diplomacy and dialogue as the primary means to resolve the conflict. “We believe that the war should end through negotiations. The solution does not lie on the battlefield,” he stated. He highlighted India’s efforts in encouraging peace talks, asserting that both Moscow and Kyiv must engage in direct discussions to understand each side’s position.
“It’s now nearly three years into the conflict. We won’t find a solution through fighting. At some point, both sides need to come to the table,” Jaishankar added. He emphasized that the war has global ramifications, affecting not only Europe but countries worldwide. “More effort is needed to bring both sides to negotiations. The sooner it happens, the better,” he said, calling for a global push for dialogue.
On the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Jaishankar stressed that nations must take initiative and explore diplomatic solutions, despite the challenges. “Countries need to make efforts, however difficult it may seem, to find common ground and work towards a better future,” he said.
In a sharp critique of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jaishankar pointed out that India is not a signatory to the ICC. “When you’re not members of a body, that already tells you what your views are about that body,” he remarked, suggesting that India’s stance is informed by its independent position on global institutions.

Title: FTA an ongoing process, UK govt ready to restart negotiations: Indian envoy
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 06:02:30 +0000
Content: Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Vikram Doraiswami, on Tuesday said that the Keir Starmer-led government is prepared to resume Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with India, following the completion of the UK’s internal review in July.
Speaking to ANI, Doraiswami said, “The FTA is an ongoing process. The government that came to power here in the UK in July completed their internal review and is now ready to restart negotiations. We welcome that. Let’s not prejudge what happens in the negotiations because they need to restart. Let’s see what happens beyond that.”
He highlighted the growing bilateral trade between the two nations and expressed optimism about the negotiations. “The movement of goods and services between us continues to grow, and our investments remain significant in each other’s economies,” he added.
Earlier, on November 22, Richard Heald, Chair of the UK-India Business Council (UKIBC), emphasized the transformative potential of the FTA for businesses and bilateral trade. He said that the agreement would simplify business operations and enhance economic ties.
“If you look at those companies that are not here [in India], the FTA will make a difference. It will make it easier and more reassuring to enter India and integrate into the economy, whether through joint ventures or direct investment,” Heald said.
Commenting on Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav’s visit to the UK to attract investments, Doraiswami expressed his satisfaction and underscored the special relationship between the two nations.
“We’re very glad that the chief minister chose the UK for his first visit outside the state in his current capacity. The India-UK relationship is a special one, with a long history and significant contributions to both nations’ development. The role of people of Indian origin has been a key binding factor between the two economies,” he said.
Doraiswami added that the chief minister focused on aligning the UK’s strengths with the opportunities emerging in Madhya Pradesh. “His focus has been on exploring ways to dovetail the UK’s strengths with Madhya Pradesh’s opportunities, particularly in education, technology, and the IT sector,” he noted.
CM Mohan Yadav is on a six-day visit to the United Kingdom and Germany, engaging with industrialists, business leaders, and government representatives to attract investments for the state.

Title: Lawyer dies in Bangladesh court clash amid protests over sedition arrest, As media freedom faces increasing threats
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:57:44 +0000
Content: In a tragic incident on Tuesday, a young lawyer was killed during violent clashes at the Chittagong court premises in Bangladesh. The unrest erupted following the court’s denial of bail to Sanatan Jagran Manch spokesperson Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who was arrested at Dhaka airport on charges of sedition. The protest, organized by Brahmachari’s followers, quickly escalated into violence as police fired sound grenades and used batons to disperse the crowd. In the chaos, advocate Saiful Islam was critically injured and later succumbed to his injuries.
Bangladesh’s Interim Government, headed by Prof. Muhammad Yunus, has ordered a thorough investigation into the lawyer’s death. Yunus condemned the incident and promised legal action. A statement from his office urged calm and called on citizens to avoid participating in any further violence. “The government will take appropriate legal steps regarding this tragic event,” the statement read.
The clash in Chittagong came as part of wider unrest surrounding Brahmachari’s arrest. His followers, who have been vocal in protesting his detention, claimed that the court’s decision to send him to judicial custody was politically motivated. Brahmachari’s arrest, on sedition charges, has fueled tensions between his supporters and the authorities.
Meanwhile, press freedom in Bangladesh is also under siege, as global organizations express concern over mounting threats against the country’s media. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), based in the United States, called for an immediate investigation into recent threats of violence directed at the staff of two leading Bangladeshi dailies, The Daily Star and Prothom Alo. The CPJ’s statement, issued via X (formerly Twitter), condemned the vandalization of *Prothom Alo*’s office in Rajshahi and ongoing intimidation of media workers.
On Monday, mobs targeted the Prothom Alo office in Rajshahi, following earlier protests in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. These demonstrations were fueled by dissatisfaction with the newspapers’ editorial policies. Last week, similar protests were staged in front of *The Daily Star*’s office.
In response, the Newspaper Owners Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) issued a strong statement condemning the attacks, calling on the government to take action against the perpetrators. “If anyone disagrees with any report or editorial, they should express their concerns in a civilized manner,” NOAB said, urging the government to prevent such attacks and ensure the safety of journalists.
The media landscape in Bangladesh has become increasingly hostile, with government actions raising concerns about press freedom. Recently, the interim government, led by Prof. Yunus, canceled the press accreditation of 167 journalists without providing any explanation. This move has been widely criticized by international organizations, which have called it a crackdown on free expression.
As Bangladesh grapples with political tensions and escalating violence, the protection of journalists and the legal rights of individuals remain at the forefront of global scrutiny.

Title: Imran Khan’s party suspends protests after security forces raid in Islamabad
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:56:28 +0000
Content: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), suspended its street protests demanding his release from jail after a midnight raid by security forces in Islamabad, which resulted in hundreds of arrests, local media reported on Wednesday.
Geo News, citing a PTI statement, reported that the party had announced a “temporary suspension” of the protest, during which at least six people, including four paramilitary soldiers and two protesters, were killed.
Thousands of protesters had gathered in central Islamabad on Tuesday after a convoy led by Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, breached several lines of security, reaching the edge of the capital’s heavily fortified red zone.
Security forces launched a large-scale operation in central Islamabad, where power was cut off and teargas was fired to disperse the crowd. By the early hours of Wednesday, the protest was largely dismantled.
City workers were seen clearing debris and removing shipping containers that had blocked roads. The red zone, once occupied by protesters, was now empty, though several vehicles were left behind, including a truck, once used by Bushra Bibi to lead the protests, which appeared to have been scorched by flames.
PTI had originally planned a sit-in in the red zone until Khan’s release. However, PTI’s president for Peshawar, Mohammad Asim, confirmed that the protest had been called off.
“We will develop a new strategy after proper consultation,” Asim told Reuters.
Bushra Bibi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a key ally of Khan, had returned “safely” to their province after the raid.
Pakistan’s benchmark share index .KSE rose more than 3% in early Wednesday trading, recovering losses from Tuesday, when the index closed down 3.6% amid the political unrest.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open flat amid weak sentiment in Asian markets
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:45:44 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened on a cautious note on Wednesday, reflecting the subdued sentiment in Asian markets.
The Nifty rose by 10.30 points to start at 24,204.80, while the Sensex gained 122 points, opening at 80,121.03.
In early trade, Coal India, Adani Enterprises, Mahindra & Mahindra, Adani Ports, and Kotak Mahindra Bank emerged as the top gainers, while IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Tata Consumer Products, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement were among the major laggards.
Among sectoral indices, the Auto and IT sectors opened in the green, while banking, financial services, FMCG, media, pharma, PSU, private banks, realty, healthcare, and consumer sectors saw declines.
The Nifty IT index hit a record high on Tuesday despite broader market consolidation. However, sentiment around the Adani Group remained cautious, as Fitch and Moody’s downgraded the outlook for several of its companies to “negative,” citing rising legal and governance risks.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net buyers, reversing a long stretch of selling, partly due to MSCI rebalancing. Market experts suggest that the near-term outlook for the domestic market remains positive.
Ajay Bagga, a market and banking expert, said, “Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to a US-mediated 60-day ceasefire. This is positive for the markets, as it raises hopes for some agreement to stop the fighting in Gaza and sharply reduces the risks of Iran widening the Middle East conflict.”
“Nifty futures are pointing to a flat to slightly positive start this morning. We expect Indian markets to trend upwards in the December series as seasonality, better earnings in H2 FY2025, and better global cues set the stage for a slow and steady recovery,” he added.
Varun Aggarwal, MD of Profit Idea, said that IT stocks and Adani Group companies are likely to remain in focus.
Globally, Asian equities faced pressure due to concerns over potential US tariffs, with President-elect Donald Trump planning to impose levies on China, Mexico, and Canada. Despite this, US stocks hit record highs, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6 percent and the Dow Jones gaining 0.3 percent.

Title: Rural students’ options shrink as US colleges slash majors: Report
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:21:22 +0000
Content: Across the United States, rural students are feeling shortchanged and frustrated, as many of the comparatively few universities that serve them are eliminating large numbers of programs and majors, blaming plummeting enrollment and resulting financial crises, local media reported.
“Nationwide, college enrollment has declined by 2 million students, or 10 per cent, in the 10 years ending in 2022, hitting rural schools particularly hard,” report Xinhua news agency, quoting The Washington Post on Tuesday.
“An increasing number of rural private, nonprofit colleges are not only cutting majors but closing altogether.”
For many rural students, there are already few places to go. About 13 million people live in higher education “deserts,” the American Council on Education estimates, mostly in the Midwest and Great Plains, where the nearest university is beyond a reasonable commute away, according to the report.
Meanwhile, more than a dozen private, nonprofit universities and colleges that were in rural areas or served large proportions of rural students have closed since 2020, data show.
Rural-serving institutions are defined by the Alliance for Research on Regional Colleges as those located in counties classified as rural and not near a metropolitan area.

Title: Australia moves closer to ban social media for children
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:13:14 +0000
Content: Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament’s lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet’s Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
Australia’s House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
Media outlets, including News Corp, have backed the ban.
Some youth advocates including Australia’s human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children’s rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77% of Australians backed the ban, up from 61% in an August survey.
The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for systemic breaches.
Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban, some of the toughest social media controls imposed by any country to date.
A Senate committee late on Tuesday backed the bill but inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age.
In its report, the Senate’s environment and communications legislation committee said social media platforms “must set out alternative methods for assuring age as reasonable steps with consideration given to the age assurance trial.”
A progress report on the age assurance trial must be submitted by the communications minister to parliament by Sept. 30, 2025, the committee said as it urged the government to “meaningfully engage” with youth when framing the law.
“Young people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the centre of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,” committee Chair Senator Karen Grogan said.
In separate submissions to parliament, Google and Meta said the social media ban should be delayed until the age-verification trial finishes. Bytedance’s TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk’s X said the proposed law might hurt children’s human rights.
Some opposition and independent lawmakers have criticised the government for trying to pass the legislation in a week. The bill was introduced last Thursday, submissions on it closed the following day, and a brief public hearing was held on Monday.

Title: Delhi-NCR air quality deteriorates as AQI nears ‘severe’ levels
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 04:55:02 +0000
Content: The air quality in Delhi-NCR remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday, with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 396, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
The worsening pollution levels have escalated health concerns for the region’s residents, with several areas in Delhi witnessing AQI levels above 400, indicating a potential shift to the ‘severe’ category.
Mundka reported the highest AQI at 443, followed by Rohini and Vivek Vihar at 432 each. Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 431, while AQI in Jahangirpuri stood at 422. Other severely affected areas included Sonia Vihar at 425, Shadipur at 423, and Punjabi Bagh at 413. Alipur (416), Narela (415), and Ashok Vihar (420) also saw AQI levels in the ‘severe’ range, further highlighting the dire situation.
The neighbouring NCR cities have experienced a slight dip in air quality, with Faridabad recording an AQI of 184, Gurugram at 160, and Noida at 257. While these levels are relatively better than those in Delhi, they still pose significant health risks.
An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’, 401-450 ‘severe’, and above 450 ‘severe plus’, as per the CPCB.
The Supreme Court on Monday refused to relax restrictions imposed under Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), aimed at mitigating air pollution in the region.
Measures include a ban on the entry of trucks, except for those carrying essential goods or using clean fuel such as LNG, CNG, BS-VI diesel, or electric power. Construction activities at public infrastructure projects have also been suspended to curb dust emissions.
The deteriorating air quality has drawn attention to the urgent need for effective and sustained pollution control measures. Residents have been advised to limit outdoor activities and take precautions as the region grapples with hazardous air conditions.

Title: Trump chooses US COVID policy critic Bhattacharya to lead NIH
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 04:54:35 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday chose Stanford academic and U.S. COVID policy critic Jay Bhattacharya to run the National Institutes of Health, the country’s top public funder of medical research with a budget of some $47.3 billion
The NIH has been in the crosshairs of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH.
The NIH director oversees 27 institutes and centers that conduct early stage research on everything from vaccines for emerging pandemic threats to targets for new drugs.
Just days before his nomination as HHS secretary, RFK Jr. said he would act quickly to fire 600 people at the NIH and replace them all with new hires. The agency employs nearly 20,000 people.
In addition to job cuts, Kennedy has said he aims to shift NIH’s focus from infectious diseases such as COVID-19, to tackling potential cures for chronic diseases, such as diabetes.
Bhattacharya, a Stanford health policy professor and doctor, was an outspoken critic of the U.S. government’s COVID-19 policies during the pandemic. Along with two other academics, he published the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020, which called for a return to life as normal for those who were not vulnerable to the virus.
He sued the government afterward, alleging that it pressured social media platforms to censor his opinions.
Bhattacharya graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine in 1997 and received his doctorate from Stanford’s Department of Economics in 2000, according to his resume.
During the COVID pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease who served on President Trump’s coronavirus task force, became a frequent target of Republicans for contradicting some of Trump’s coronavirus policies and recommendations, leading to calls for his dismissal.
Francis Collins, the NIH director and Fauci’s boss, defended Fauci in a July 2020 interview with STAT News, saying it was “unimaginable” to consider firing Fauci, as some Republicans had demanded. As a career federal employee, Fauci’s job was shielded from political firings by federal civil service regulations, protections Trump has vowed to undo.

Title: Bangladesh High Court Seeks Government’s Stance on ISKCON
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 13:26:08 +0000
Content: The High Court (HC) of Bangladesh on Wednesday directed the government to clarify its position regarding the Hindu religious organization ISKCON, its activities, and the measures it has taken concerning the group.
The directive came during a hearing of a writ petition seeking a ban on ISKCON and the imposition of Section 144 in Chattogram and Rangpur to prevent potential unrest. The court instructed Attorney General Asaduzzaman to present the government’s stance by Thursday, according to the United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
In the meantime, Chittagong Police have arrested at least six individuals suspected of involvement in the death of advocate Saiful Islam during clashes that erupted when police attempted to transport Sanatan Jagran Manch spokesperson Chinmoy Prabhu to jail. Official sources confirmed that an additional 21 individuals have been detained for their alleged involvement in vandalism and attacks on law enforcement during the clash at the Chittagong court premises on Tuesday.
Chinmoy Krishna Das of ISKCON Pundrik Dham and the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote have been advocating for the rights and safety of the Hindu community across Bangladesh, issuing an eight-point demand to safeguard minorities.
Chinmoy Prabhu was arrested by Dhaka police on Monday at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Chittagong. He was subsequently brought before a Chattogram court on Tuesday in connection with a “sedition” case. The court rejected his bail plea and ordered judicial custody.
Following the court’s decision, hundreds of Chinmoy Prabhu’s supporters surrounded the police van transporting him, halting it for over an hour. Security personnel eventually dispersed the crowd using tear gas and batons.
The sedition case against Chinmoy Prabhu and 18 others was filed on October 30 at the Kotwali Police Station in Chittagong. The charges stem from allegations of hoisting a saffron flag above the national flag of Bangladesh during a public rally at Chattogram’s Laldighi Maidan on October 25.
Chinmoy Prabhu’s activities, including major public rallies of the Hindu community in Chattogram on October 25 and Rangpur on November 22, have sparked significant discussion in Bangladesh’s socio-political circles.

Content: India and Japan inaugurated their first-ever Dialogue on Economic Security in Tokyo on Wednesday, focusing on bolstering industrial and technological resilience. The dialogue included discussions on strategic trade and technology, with senior officials and experts from both nations in attendance.
The meeting was co-chaired by India’s Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, and Japan’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masataka Okano, along with representatives from key ministries and agencies. According to an official release by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the dialogue was initially announced during the India-Japan 2+2 Ministerial meeting in New Delhi on August 20, 2024.
The discussions highlighted economic security policies and the need for collaboration to strengthen critical infrastructure and build resilient supply chains. Both sides emphasized fostering partnerships between businesses and academic institutions to advance industrial and technological growth.
In addition to economic measures, the dialogue explored talent exchange and upskilling initiatives in mutually beneficial sectors. Recognizing the importance of human resource development, both nations reaffirmed their commitment to achieving concrete outcomes through sustained cooperation.
Describing the dialogue as a “timely and significant step,” the two countries reiterated their dedication to reinforcing their Special Strategic and Global Partnership. This partnership, underpinned by shared values, has become a cornerstone of advancing bilateral economic, technological, and strategic ties.
The MEA highlighted the historical depth of the India-Japan relationship, tracing its roots to ancient cultural and religious exchanges. Examples include the influence of Hindu traditions on Japan’s Shichifukujin (seven lucky gods) and Indian monk Bodhisena’s role in consecrating the Todaiji Temple statue in 752 AD. In modern times, figures like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and JRD Tata have further strengthened bilateral ties.
Today, the Indian diaspora of over 40,000 in Japan, particularly in areas like Tokyo’s Nishikasai, continues to foster these dynamic relations. Established in 1903, the Japan-India Association remains Japan’s oldest international friendship organization, symbolizing the enduring bond between the two nations.

Title: Maharashtra CM uncertainty persists: As Eknath Shinde vows to abide by PM Modi’s decision
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:40:12 +0000
Content: The uncertainty over the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra continues, as caretaker CM Eknath Shinde expressed his readiness to accept any decision made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Wednesday, Shinde affirmed his commitment to the ruling BJP-led Mahayuti alliance’s unity and pledged the support of Shiv Sainiks to the leader chosen as CM.
“I have told the Prime Minister that if there is any issue in forming the government in Maharashtra because of me, he should not hesitate. Whatever decision he takes, I will accept it,” Shinde said. He is set to leave for Delhi later in the day for discussions with the BJP top brass, including PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.
Describing PM Modi as the head of the Mahayuti “family,” Shinde added, “The way BJP members respect his decisions, Shiv Sainiks will also abide by them. I have assured both the PM and the Home Minister that I will not let my position hinder the formation of the government.”
Reflecting on his tenure, Shinde said he always viewed himself as a “common man” rather than a Chief Minister. “CM means Common Man. I worked with this mindset and focused on addressing the struggles of ordinary citizens,” he stated.
The Mahayuti alliance, comprising the BJP, the Shiv Sena faction led by Shinde, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, secured a decisive victory in the November 23 Maharashtra Assembly elections. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats, while the Shiv Sena and NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively, in the 280-member assembly.
However, the alliance has yet to finalize its Chief Minister. Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis traveled to Delhi earlier on Wednesday to consult the BJP leadership. Speaking to the media, Fadnavis assured that a decision on the Chief Minister would be announced soon.
“The answer will come shortly. Senior leaders from all three Mahayuti parties are deliberating together,” Fadnavis said, adding that cabinet appointments would follow the CM’s selection.

Title: Failure of AstraZeneca’s opioid drug trial a major blow for addiction medications: report
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:32:57 +0000
Content: The failure of AstraZeneca’s AZD4041 drug trial to combat opioid use disorder (OUD) highlights the challenges in developing non-opioid medications for addiction and withdrawal, according to a report on Wednesday.
OUD is a chronic neurological disorder that causes compulsive, repeated use of opioid drugs, leading to prolonged self-administration.
The company recently terminated the development of AZD4041 during a Phase II trial, as the orexin 1 receptor antagonist showed a drug-drug interaction with an antifungal.
The GlobalData report, a data and analytics company, showed that six out of the seven agents currently in late-stage development (Phases IIb–III) are non-opioids. It added that there is a distinct lack of efficacy data for other pipeline agents.
“Opioid agonists dominate the treatment landscape for OUD, but their use is marked by a risk of ‘diversion’—the illicit use of opioid medications—which means their dispensing is often restricted to specialized treatment programs,” said Jos Opdenakker, Pharma Analyst at GlobalData.
Opdenakker said these issues have led to a significant push for the development of non-opioid medications to treat addiction and withdrawal.
Amid tough competition from existing opioid medications, “finding a non-opioid to match their efficacy is proving to be challenging,” he added.
Further, the report said that non-opioid pipeline treatments are expected to enter the market as adjunctive treatments to the existing first-line therapies. Hence, they are unlikely to replace standard opioid treatments like methadone or buprenorphine as first-line treatments for OUD, the report said.
The report also forecasts that opioid agonist therapies could drive combined sales of approximately $1.75 billion by 2033 in eight major markets— the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Canada, and Australia—and make up 83.8 percent of the OUD market.
Such market dominance reflects the lack of an effective alternative to opioid agonist therapies and highlights patient preferences, which play a key role in OUD treatment.
“The OUD treatment landscape is bereft of an effective non-opioid therapy to challenge existing opioid agonists. Although opioid agonists are the gold standard for treating OUD, they have not solved the opioid crisis,” Opdenakker said.
“Any non-opioid product that reaches the market with a strong efficacy and safety profile for treating OUD would likely see strong uptake and disrupt the OUD market,” he added.

Title: Nothing short of genocide: ISKCON’s Radharaman slams Das’ arrest, Bangladesh situation (Ld)
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:29:27 +0000
Content: ISKCON Kolkata Vice President and spokesperson Radharaman Das on Wednesday strongly condemned the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a prominent Hindu priest and religious minority leader in Bangladesh and said this was “nothing short of genocide.”
Radharaman Das expressed his concern over the growing unrest in the country, which has been intensifying for over a hundred days, particularly targeting minorities.
“Chinmoy Krishna Das became the voice of the resistance movement in Bangladesh, speaking out against the atrocities being committed against religious minorities,” Das said.
He highlighted that the ongoing protests have attracted massive participation, with hundreds of thousands of people in Dhaka joining the rallies demanding justice.
“Just a few days ago, a peaceful protest in Bangladesh saw over four lakh people calling for the government to act on a list of eight demands, which included a five-day holiday for Durga Puja and a security commission to protect minority communities,” he added.
However, the protests have met with a heavy-handed response from the authorities in Bangladesh.
Das recounted that members of the protest movement were facing legal action, and two days ago when Chinmoy Krishna Das was travelling from Dhaka to Chittagong, he was arrested by police who were in plainclothes at the airport.
“The police did not inform anything about his arrest and took him away without disclosing where he would be held,” Das said, later revealing that the arresting officers were from the Intelligence department.
Das also claimed that the arrest occurred secretly during the night.
“As tensions escalate, reports have emerged of threats from certain Muslim groups, including slogans calling for violence against Hindus and ISKCON followers. There have also been reports of houses being set on fire, with over 250 people injured in the violence. A Kali temple was also demolished. A Muslim lawyer was also killed amid protests outside the court in Chittagong,” he stated.
“This is nothing short of genocide,” Das declared, condemning the rising attacks on religious minorities in Bangladesh.
He further claimed that the Muslim groups are trying to portray Chinmoy Krishna Das as a traitor.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh stepped up security in the port city of Chittagong on Wednesday as police arrested six people in connection with the murder of the Muslim lawyer.
The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das sparked widespread protests in Dhaka and Chittagong, where his supporters clashed with security forces.

Title: UK police complaints watchdog calls for measures to stop ‘adultification’ of Black children
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:30:12 +0000
Content: Britain’s police complaints watchdog has called on Wednesday for urgent measures to stop the “adultification” of Black children and young people during interactions with officers, including in cases of stop and search and use of force.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct said in a report that “adultification” was a form of bias where children from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities were perceived as being more grown up, less innocent and less vulnerable than other children.
The IOPC said it found cases involving stop and search, use of force and strip search where officers assumed those aged under 18 were older than they were and did not apply appropriate safeguards.
Home Office data showed young Black males aged 10-17 had the highest rate of stop and search at 106.3 per 1,000 people, compared with 27.1 for their white counterparts.
“The IOPC is calling for urgent steps to be taken to safeguard children from adultification during police interactions,” the watchdog said. “It is crucial that officers and staff understand how adultification can influence decision making leading to unjust treatment of children.”
IOPC Director General Rachel Watson said the police had improved the way it handles racial discrimination, but “a lot more needs to be done”.
“Too often Black communities feel over-policed as suspects and under-protected,” Watson said.
The report highlighted how the police must investigate discrimination allegations properly to ensure they are effectively handled the first time so people can have confidence in the police complaints system.
Around 66% of young Black people said they would call the police if in danger compared with 87% of white children and teenagers, research from crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory showed.

Title: Coote under investigation by England FA for alleged betting scandal involving yellow card
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:26:10 +0000
Content: England’s FA said it is investigating allegations that referee David Coote had a discussion with a friend about issuing a yellow card to a player the day before a match, allegations which the under-fire referee has denied.
On Tuesday, The Sun newspaper said the friend had jokingly told Coote to issue a yellow card to then-Leeds United player Ezgjan Alioski during a second-tier match against West Bromwich Albion in 2019 so that he could place a bet with bookmakers.
Coote yellow carded Alioski in the match the following day, and later sent a message to the fan saying: “I hope you backed as discussed”.
Coote said he had always refereed with integrity.
“I strongly refute these false and defamatory allegations,” he said in a statement.
“Whatever issues I may have had in my personal life they have never affected my decision making on the field. I have always held the integrity of the game in the highest regard, refereeing matches impartially and to the best of my ability.”
A spokesperson for the FA said: “These are very serious allegations and we are investigating as a ­matter of urgency.”
The PGMOL, English soccer’s referees’ body, said the facts needed to be established.
“We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to any breach of our Integrity Code of Conduct, which is signed by all match officials on an annual basis,” the body added.
“PGMOL Board is committed to taking the appropriate action should any breach of that code be proven.”
Leeds United did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Coote is already being investigated for separate incidents by the FA, PGMOL and European soccer governing body UEFA, who have also suspended him.
A video of the 42-year-old emerged this month which showed him allegedly abusing Liverpool and their former manager Juergen Klopp.
“David Coote remains suspended and subject to an ongoing disciplinary process by PGMOL, separate to the investigation into this matter which will be carried out independently by The FA,” the PGMOL added.
“We will be making no further comment at this stage.”

Title: Centre completes auction of 9 coal mines, to yield Rs 1,446 crore annual revenue
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:07:32 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Coal announced on Wednesday that it has successfully auctioned 9 mines as part of the 10th round of commercial coal mine auctions.
These mines are expected to generate an annual revenue of around Rs 1,446 crore (excluding partially explored mines). They are also likely to attract a capital investment of around Rs 2,115 crore and create 19,063 employment opportunities, the ministry said.
The nine mines hold a combined geological reserve of approximately 3,998.73 million tonnes. The cumulative Peak Rated Capacity (PRC) of these mines stands at 14.10 MTPA, excluding partially explored coal mines, according to the Ministry’s statement.
While three of these coal mines are in Jharkhand, there are two each in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh.
The Ministry of Coal launched the 10th round of coal mine auctions for commercial mining on June 21, 2024. In the forward auctions, a total of nine coal mines were successfully auctioned, comprising three fully explored mines and six partially explored coal mines, the statement said.
The auctions witnessed intense competition, achieving an average revenue share of 17.44 percent. This reflects the sustained interest of industries in the coal sector and the Ministry’s efforts to provide a stable and transparent policy framework, the statement added.
Since the inception of commercial coal mining in 2020, a total of 113 coal mines have been auctioned successfully, with a production capacity of 257.60 million tonnes per year. Upon operationalization, these mines will immensely contribute to enhancing domestic coal production and making the country self-reliant in the coal sector.
Collectively, these mines are expected to generate annual revenue of Rs 35,437 crores, attract capital investment of Rs 38,641 crore, and provide employment for 348,268 people in coal-bearing regions, the statement said.
“These strategic initiatives of the Ministry of Coal reaffirm the Ministry’s dedication to transforming the coal sector into a key driver of economic growth. These initiatives not only address the nation’s energy demands but also foster economic stability and create employment opportunities, contributing to the vision of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat,'” the statement added.

Title: WHO launches 16 days of activism to end violence against women
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:04:29 +0000
Content: The World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Regional Director, Saima Wazed, has launched a campaign aimed at ending gender-based violence.
The 16 Days of Activism, which began on November 25, coinciding with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, will run until December 10, concluding on International Human Rights Day.
This year’s campaign is of particular significance, given the upcoming 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPOA), set to be reviewed at the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2025. Signed by 189 member states in 1995, the BPOA remains the most comprehensive global policy framework for advancing women’s rights and gender equality.
Wazed emphasized that as the global review of BPOA approaches, it is essential to reflect on both the progress made and the barriers that continue to hinder the elimination of violence against women and girls. She pointed out that the 16 Days of Activism presents a crucial opportunity for individuals and organizations to amplify efforts to eradicate all forms of gender-based violence in various settings, including private, public, workplace, and online spaces.
Wazed also highlighted that women and girls living in humanitarian emergencies face heightened risks. “Given the ongoing conflicts and disasters worldwide, this year’s WHO campaign focuses on addressing the particular needs of women and girls in these vulnerable situations,” she said.
Gender-based violence (GBV) manifests in various forms, including intimate partner violence, early marriage, workplace harassment, and digital violence. Such violence escalates during armed conflicts, disease outbreaks, or natural disasters, often leading to large-scale displacement. Women and girls in refugee camps or with limited mobility are especially at risk, according to the WHO.
The consequences of GBV are severe, leading to both physical and mental health repercussions for survivors, including injury, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), depression, and post-traumatic stress. Wazed added that the lack of adequate healthcare further exacerbates these challenges, leading to continued disempowerment and hindering women’s socio-economic development.
Despite some progress, significant challenges remain. The WHO pointed to laws, policies, and essential services that have been implemented in several countries, such as India’s Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, Thailand’s Domestic Violence Victim Protection Act, 2007, and Indonesia’s breakthrough Sexual Violence Crime Law passed in 2022. Additionally, services like One-Stop Centres and Helplines have been set up in countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand to support survivors of GBV.
However, Wazed emphasized that much work remains to be done. “Violence against women remains a global, national, and local challenge, with an estimated 736 million women experiencing physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence at least once in their lifetime,” she said. The WHO South-East Asia Region, which is prone to natural hazards, faces exacerbated vulnerabilities to violence, particularly in conflict and disaster-prone areas.
To address these issues, Wazed proposed a “4P approach,” which focuses on Promoting investment in women and girls, Providing access to essential services, Protecting marginalized populations, and Performing by ensuring the availability of disaggregated data to drive fair and effective healthcare systems.
The WHO’s technical tools, such as the RESPECT framework for GBV and INNOV8 for health equity, are key to mitigating risks, restoring women’s health, and ensuring long-term change. WHO is also working with multiple partners in the region to advance initiatives like Spotlight 2.0 to end violence against women.
Wazed said, “As we approach the Beijing +30 Global Review, achieving progress requires a collaborative approach with targeted efforts for conflict and hazard-prone settings. WHO South-East Asia is committed to facilitating regional cooperation, bringing together governments, international organizations, civil society, and communities to take action. Together, we can accelerate efforts to combat GBV, as healthy, safe, and empowered women and girls are the foundation of resilient societies today and in the future.”

Title: Row erupts after petition demands ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh, calling it a ‘radical organisation’
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:32:15 +0000
Content: A legal petition demanding a ban on the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangladesh has triggered widespread debate and escalating tensions in the country. The petition, filed by Supreme Court lawyer Al Mamun Russell and 10 other legal professionals, accuses ISKCON of being a “radical organisation” that threatens national security and incites communal unrest.
The legal notice, addressed to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the Inspector General of Police, accuses ISKCON of fostering religious intolerance, forcibly recruiting members, and encroaching upon Sanatan temples. It further claims ISKCON has evicted traditional Hindu community members and allegedly carried out attacks on mosques.
Citing incidents of violence, the petition highlights the discovery of firearms in an ISKCON temple in Sylhet in 2016 and alleged attacks on police vehicles during ISKCON processions in Gopalganj. It also attributes the recent unrest following the arrest of former ISKCON Bangladesh priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari to the organisation, including the alleged murder of government legal officer Advocate Saiful Islam.
The controversy intensified after Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former ISKCON priest, was arrested on sedition charges for allegedly displaying Bangladesh’s national flag improperly. He was denied bail by a Chittagong court on Tuesday and remains in custody. His arrest has sparked widespread protests, with many calling for his immediate release.
ISKCON Bangladesh issued a statement denouncing the arrest and urging the government to promote peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance strongly defended ISKCON, describing it as a peaceful organisation working for the welfare of the poor.
“We strongly oppose this statement of those who are saying that ISKCON should be banned. ISKCON is the international consciousness of Sri Krishna… it is a peaceful organisation,” said Mrityunjay Kumar Roy, the alliance’s general secretary.
The arrest and the petition have drawn reactions from within Bangladesh and India. Congress leader Pawan Khera expressed “deep concern” over the insecurity faced by religious minorities in Bangladesh. In a statement, he urged the Indian government to press Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of minorities.
“The Indian National Congress expresses its deep concern at the atmosphere of insecurity being faced by religious minorities in Bangladesh. The arrest of the ISKCON monk is the latest example. We expect the Government of India to prevail upon Bangladesh to ensure the security of minorities,” Khera said.
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs echoed these concerns, condemning the denial of bail for Chinmoy Krishna Das and highlighting a series of recent attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. “This incident follows multiple attacks on minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh, including documented cases of arson, looting, and desecration of temples,” the ministry said.
The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry responded to the growing tension by reaffirming its commitment to upholding religious harmony and the rule of law. In an official statement, it said, “Bangladesh’s government is firm in upholding religious harmony in the country, irrespective of religious affiliation, and ensuring the rule of law for every Bangladeshi without distinction.”

Title: Network-based readiness: India climbs 11 spots to enter top 50 nations
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:21:47 +0000
Content: India has risen 11 places in the latest Network Readiness Index 2024 (NRI 2024), securing the 49th rank globally, the government announced on Wednesday.
The country not only improved its ranking but also increased its score from 49.93 in 2023 to 53.63 in 2024, according to the index published by the Portulans Institute, an independent non-profit research and educational organization based in Washington, DC.
Notably, India leads in several indicators, such as AI, FTTH Internet subscriptions, and mobile broadband internet traffic, according to the Ministry of Communications.
India ranked first in “AI scientific publications,” “AI talent concentration,” and “ICT services exports.” It also secured second place in “FTTH/Building Internet subscriptions,” “mobile broadband internet traffic within the country,” and “international internet bandwidth.” Additionally, it ranked third in “domestic market scale” and fourth in “annual investment in telecommunication services.”
The report maps the network-based readiness landscape of 133 economies, assessing their performance across four pillars—technology, people, governance, and impact—using 54 variables.
According to the report, India has demonstrated significant digital progress, showcasing strengths in technological innovation and digital transformation.
India’s performance in NRI 2024 is part of a series of advancements in the telecommunications sector. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has made remarkable progress in enhancing India’s telecommunication infrastructure.
Over the past decade, teledensity has risen from 75.2% to 84.69%, while wireless connections have reached 119 crore. The Digital India initiative has played a crucial role in expanding broadband access to rural areas through partnerships with technology companies. This has led to a sharp increase in internet subscribers, from 25.1 crore to 94.4 crore, alongside a significant rise in wireless internet usage.
Moreover, the launch of 5G services in 2022 has boosted India’s global mobile broadband speed ranking, elevating it from 118th to 15th position.
India now aims to establish itself as a leader in next-generation telecom technologies through the Bharat 6G Vision.

Title: Centre launches E-Daakhil to Ladakh, completes pan-India rollout of consumer grievance platform
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:04:54 +0000
Content: The Government of India has achieved a major milestone with the nationwide implementation of the E-Daakhil portal, an online consumer grievance redressal platform, now operational across all states and union territories. The final phase of this rollout was marked by the portal’s launch in Ladakh on November 22, 2024, by the Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh, Brig. (Dr.) B.D. Mishra (Retd.).
Introduced under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 and launched on September 7, 2020, E-Daakhil is an innovative platform designed to provide consumers with a hassle-free, paperless mechanism to file complaints online. This system eliminates the need for physical visits to consumer forums, ensuring convenience and efficiency in resolving grievances. The rollout in Ladakh signifies the government’s commitment to extending consumer rights to even the most remote regions.
The portal offers an easy-to-use interface for filing complaints, paying necessary fees, and tracking case statuses. Users can register using their mobile numbers or email addresses, streamlining the process for both consumers and advocates. By November 2024, E-Daakhil had successfully registered over 2,81,024 users, with 1,98,725 cases filed and 38,453 already resolved.
The platform has already delivered significant outcomes in consumer grievance redressal. For instance, the Sambalpur District Commission in Odisha ruled in favor of a consumer on January 8, 2024, awarding compensation of Rs. 25,000 for a faulty Hero Electric Atria and Rs. 5,000 for litigation costs. Similarly, in the Andaman District Commission, a complainant received a refund of Rs. 3,980 with 6% interest and Rs. 10,000 for mental anguish after being charged twice for fuel due to a failed UPI transaction.
Building on E-Daakhil’s success, the government is now working on launching the E-Jagriti platform, aimed at further enhancing the consumer grievance system.

Title: Bangladesh High Court Seeks Government’s Stance on ISKCON
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 13:26:08 +0000
Content: The High Court (HC) of Bangladesh on Wednesday directed the government to clarify its position regarding the Hindu religious organization ISKCON, its activities, and the measures it has taken concerning the group.
The directive came during a hearing of a writ petition seeking a ban on ISKCON and the imposition of Section 144 in Chattogram and Rangpur to prevent potential unrest. The court instructed Attorney General Asaduzzaman to present the government’s stance by Thursday, according to the United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
In the meantime, Chittagong Police have arrested at least six individuals suspected of involvement in the death of advocate Saiful Islam during clashes that erupted when police attempted to transport Sanatan Jagran Manch spokesperson Chinmoy Prabhu to jail. Official sources confirmed that an additional 21 individuals have been detained for their alleged involvement in vandalism and attacks on law enforcement during the clash at the Chittagong court premises on Tuesday.
Chinmoy Krishna Das of ISKCON Pundrik Dham and the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote have been advocating for the rights and safety of the Hindu community across Bangladesh, issuing an eight-point demand to safeguard minorities.
Chinmoy Prabhu was arrested by Dhaka police on Monday at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Chittagong. He was subsequently brought before a Chattogram court on Tuesday in connection with a “sedition” case. The court rejected his bail plea and ordered judicial custody.
Following the court’s decision, hundreds of Chinmoy Prabhu’s supporters surrounded the police van transporting him, halting it for over an hour. Security personnel eventually dispersed the crowd using tear gas and batons.
The sedition case against Chinmoy Prabhu and 18 others was filed on October 30 at the Kotwali Police Station in Chittagong. The charges stem from allegations of hoisting a saffron flag above the national flag of Bangladesh during a public rally at Chattogram’s Laldighi Maidan on October 25.
Chinmoy Prabhu’s activities, including major public rallies of the Hindu community in Chattogram on October 25 and Rangpur on November 22, have sparked significant discussion in Bangladesh’s socio-political circles.

Title: India, Japan launch economic security dialogue to strengthen industrial and technological resilience
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:50:14 +0000
Content: India and Japan inaugurated their first-ever Dialogue on Economic Security in Tokyo on Wednesday, focusing on bolstering industrial and technological resilience. The dialogue included discussions on strategic trade and technology, with senior officials and experts from both nations in attendance.
The meeting was co-chaired by India’s Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, and Japan’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masataka Okano, along with representatives from key ministries and agencies. According to an official release by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the dialogue was initially announced during the India-Japan 2+2 Ministerial meeting in New Delhi on August 20, 2024.
The discussions highlighted economic security policies and the need for collaboration to strengthen critical infrastructure and build resilient supply chains. Both sides emphasized fostering partnerships between businesses and academic institutions to advance industrial and technological growth.
In addition to economic measures, the dialogue explored talent exchange and upskilling initiatives in mutually beneficial sectors. Recognizing the importance of human resource development, both nations reaffirmed their commitment to achieving concrete outcomes through sustained cooperation.
Describing the dialogue as a “timely and significant step,” the two countries reiterated their dedication to reinforcing their Special Strategic and Global Partnership. This partnership, underpinned by shared values, has become a cornerstone of advancing bilateral economic, technological, and strategic ties.
The MEA highlighted the historical depth of the India-Japan relationship, tracing its roots to ancient cultural and religious exchanges. Examples include the influence of Hindu traditions on Japan’s Shichifukujin (seven lucky gods) and Indian monk Bodhisena’s role in consecrating the Todaiji Temple statue in 752 AD. In modern times, figures like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and JRD Tata have further strengthened bilateral ties.
Today, the Indian diaspora of over 40,000 in Japan, particularly in areas like Tokyo’s Nishikasai, continues to foster these dynamic relations. Established in 1903, the Japan-India Association remains Japan’s oldest international friendship organization, symbolizing the enduring bond between the two nations.

Title: Maharashtra CM uncertainty persists: As Eknath Shinde vows to abide by PM Modi’s decision
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:40:12 +0000
Content: The uncertainty over the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra continues, as caretaker CM Eknath Shinde expressed his readiness to accept any decision made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Wednesday, Shinde affirmed his commitment to the ruling BJP-led Mahayuti alliance’s unity and pledged the support of Shiv Sainiks to the leader chosen as CM.
“I have told the Prime Minister that if there is any issue in forming the government in Maharashtra because of me, he should not hesitate. Whatever decision he takes, I will accept it,” Shinde said. He is set to leave for Delhi later in the day for discussions with the BJP top brass, including PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.
Describing PM Modi as the head of the Mahayuti “family,” Shinde added, “The way BJP members respect his decisions, Shiv Sainiks will also abide by them. I have assured both the PM and the Home Minister that I will not let my position hinder the formation of the government.”
Reflecting on his tenure, Shinde said he always viewed himself as a “common man” rather than a Chief Minister. “CM means Common Man. I worked with this mindset and focused on addressing the struggles of ordinary citizens,” he stated.
The Mahayuti alliance, comprising the BJP, the Shiv Sena faction led by Shinde, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, secured a decisive victory in the November 23 Maharashtra Assembly elections. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 132 seats, while the Shiv Sena and NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively, in the 280-member assembly.
However, the alliance has yet to finalize its Chief Minister. Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis traveled to Delhi earlier on Wednesday to consult the BJP leadership. Speaking to the media, Fadnavis assured that a decision on the Chief Minister would be announced soon.
“The answer will come shortly. Senior leaders from all three Mahayuti parties are deliberating together,” Fadnavis said, adding that cabinet appointments would follow the CM’s selection.

Title: Failure of AstraZeneca’s opioid drug trial a major blow for addiction medications: report
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:32:57 +0000
Content: The failure of AstraZeneca’s AZD4041 drug trial to combat opioid use disorder (OUD) highlights the challenges in developing non-opioid medications for addiction and withdrawal, according to a report on Wednesday.
OUD is a chronic neurological disorder that causes compulsive, repeated use of opioid drugs, leading to prolonged self-administration.
The company recently terminated the development of AZD4041 during a Phase II trial, as the orexin 1 receptor antagonist showed a drug-drug interaction with an antifungal.
The GlobalData report, a data and analytics company, showed that six out of the seven agents currently in late-stage development (Phases IIb–III) are non-opioids. It added that there is a distinct lack of efficacy data for other pipeline agents.
“Opioid agonists dominate the treatment landscape for OUD, but their use is marked by a risk of ‘diversion’—the illicit use of opioid medications—which means their dispensing is often restricted to specialized treatment programs,” said Jos Opdenakker, Pharma Analyst at GlobalData.
Opdenakker said these issues have led to a significant push for the development of non-opioid medications to treat addiction and withdrawal.
Amid tough competition from existing opioid medications, “finding a non-opioid to match their efficacy is proving to be challenging,” he added.
Further, the report said that non-opioid pipeline treatments are expected to enter the market as adjunctive treatments to the existing first-line therapies. Hence, they are unlikely to replace standard opioid treatments like methadone or buprenorphine as first-line treatments for OUD, the report said.
The report also forecasts that opioid agonist therapies could drive combined sales of approximately $1.75 billion by 2033 in eight major markets— the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Canada, and Australia—and make up 83.8 percent of the OUD market.
Such market dominance reflects the lack of an effective alternative to opioid agonist therapies and highlights patient preferences, which play a key role in OUD treatment.
“The OUD treatment landscape is bereft of an effective non-opioid therapy to challenge existing opioid agonists. Although opioid agonists are the gold standard for treating OUD, they have not solved the opioid crisis,” Opdenakker said.
“Any non-opioid product that reaches the market with a strong efficacy and safety profile for treating OUD would likely see strong uptake and disrupt the OUD market,” he added.

Title: Nothing short of genocide: ISKCON’s Radharaman slams Das’ arrest, Bangladesh situation (Ld)
Publication Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:29:27 +0000
Content: ISKCON Kolkata Vice President and spokesperson Radharaman Das on Wednesday strongly condemned the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a prominent Hindu priest and religious minority leader in Bangladesh and said this was “nothing short of genocide.”
Radharaman Das expressed his concern over the growing unrest in the country, which has been intensifying for over a hundred days, particularly targeting minorities.
“Chinmoy Krishna Das became the voice of the resistance movement in Bangladesh, speaking out against the atrocities being committed against religious minorities,” Das said.
He highlighted that the ongoing protests have attracted massive participation, with hundreds of thousands of people in Dhaka joining the rallies demanding justice.
“Just a few days ago, a peaceful protest in Bangladesh saw over four lakh people calling for the government to act on a list of eight demands, which included a five-day holiday for Durga Puja and a security commission to protect minority communities,” he added.
However, the protests have met with a heavy-handed response from the authorities in Bangladesh.
Das recounted that members of the protest movement were facing legal action, and two days ago when Chinmoy Krishna Das was travelling from Dhaka to Chittagong, he was arrested by police who were in plainclothes at the airport.
“The police did not inform anything about his arrest and took him away without disclosing where he would be held,” Das said, later revealing that the arresting officers were from the Intelligence department.
Das also claimed that the arrest occurred secretly during the night.
“As tensions escalate, reports have emerged of threats from certain Muslim groups, including slogans calling for violence against Hindus and ISKCON followers. There have also been reports of houses being set on fire, with over 250 people injured in the violence. A Kali temple was also demolished. A Muslim lawyer was also killed amid protests outside the court in Chittagong,” he stated.
“This is nothing short of genocide,” Das declared, condemning the rising attacks on religious minorities in Bangladesh.
He further claimed that the Muslim groups are trying to portray Chinmoy Krishna Das as a traitor.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh stepped up security in the port city of Chittagong on Wednesday as police arrested six people in connection with the murder of the Muslim lawyer.
The arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das sparked widespread protests in Dhaka and Chittagong, where his supporters clashed with security forces.

Title: Global study links 1.5 million deaths every year to air pollution from wildfires
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 07:10:10 +0000
Content: An Australian-led international research has found that over 1.5 million deaths globally every year were linked to the health impacts of air pollution caused by landscape fires.
According to the research published on Thursday by Monash University in Melbourne, 1.53 million deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 were attributable to wildfire-sourced air pollution, Xinhua news agency reported.
The study found that over 90 per cent of all deaths attributable to landscape fire-sourced air pollution occurred in low and middle-income countries — particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast, south and east Asia.
It was a comprehensive assessment of the health risks associated with air pollution from landscape fires, involving researchers from universities around the world.
Of the 1.53 million annual deaths globally, 450,000 were attributed to cardiovascular disease and 220,000 to respiratory disease.
Fine particulate matter from wildfires fires contributed to 77.6 per cent of deaths and surface ozone to 22.4 per cent.
“As wildfires are increasingly frequent and severe in a warming climate, urgent action is required to address such substantial impact on climate-related mortality and associated environmental injustice,” the authors wrote in the study.
The countries with the highest attributable mortality rates to landscape fires were all in sub-Saharan Africa.
The authors advocate for high-income countries to provide financial and technological support to help vulnerable developing countries manage the health impacts of wildfire-sourced air pollution and address the socioeconomic disparities in mortality rates.

Title: India register comprehensive 11-0 victory over Thailand in Men’s Junior Asia Cup 2024
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 06:54:52 +0000
Content: The Indian junior men’s hockey team on Thursday registered an 11-0 victory in their men’s junior Asia Cup 2024 campaign opener against Thailand in Muscat.
According to a release from Hockey India, Araijeet Singh Hundal (2′, 24′) will feature for Team Gonasika in the upcoming HIL, while Delhi SG Pipers’ Sourabh Anand Kushwaha (19′, 52′) and UP Rudras’ Gurjot Singh (18′, 45′) scored braces in the game on Wednesday.
Arshdeep Singh (8′), Sharda Nand Tiwari (10′), Dilraj Singh (21′), Rohit (29′), and Mukesh Toppo (59′) each scored a goal in India’s comprehensive victory.
India maintained control of the ball from the starting whistle and quickly found the back of the net. Araijeet Singh Hundal scored the first goal with a reverse shot from the left wing, following an incisive pass from Priyobarta Talem in the backline.
India continued to apply constant pressure on Thailand, frequently advancing into the shooting circle with aerial passes to the wings. Soon after, Talem made a clever pass to the left wing, and Arshdeep Singh was alert enough to push the ball into the goal after a save from Thailand’s goalkeeper, Thawin Phomjunt. With five minutes left in the quarter, India earned a penalty corner, and Sharda Nand Tiwari stepped up to drag the ball past Thailand’s defense, making it 3-0 for India.
Minutes into the second quarter, Gurjot deflected Araijeet’s shot on goal past the keeper to extend India’s lead. While Thailand was still regrouping, Sourabh pounced on a rebound from a close-range shot and lifted it over the keeper to make it 5-0.
Dilraj then etched his name on the scoresheet, picking up a deflected ball in the circle and beating the keeper with a reverse shot from the top of the circle. India’s dominance continued as they stole the ball in Thailand’s half and pushed forward in search of another goal.
In the 24th minute, Araijeet danced past multiple defenders in the circle and picked out the top left corner with a sublime reverse shot. With little more than a minute left in the half, Amir earned a penalty stroke, and Rohit stepped up to make it 8-0 with a low, powerful shot from the spot.
In the third quarter, India created multiple chances but missed the finishing touch. Thailand grew into the game with more possession and territory but failed to threaten the Indian goal. Gurjot tested the keeper with a reverse shot from the center of the circle at the nine-minute mark but couldn’t beat him.
India held onto possession and pushed Thailand back, but their defense repelled every advance until Roshan Kujur found Gurjot Singh, who deflected the ball into the goal, making it 9-0 for India with seconds left in the third quarter.
In the final quarter, India showed more patience in their build-up, with Manmeet, Araijeet, Dilraj, and other Indian forwards constantly threatening to score. Sourabh found the finishing touch in the 52nd minute, deflecting Amir’s pass from the left wing to score India’s 10th goal.
Maintaining complete control of the ball and displaying exemplary defense, India continued to seek another goal. As the game came to a close, Mukesh found himself unmarked in the circle and rifled the ball into the goal, sealing India’s 11-0 victory.

Title: Centre sanctions Rs 3,417 crore for 90 infra projects in Northeast states
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 06:52:04 +0000
Content: A total of 90 projects, valued at Rs 3,417.68 crore, have been sanctioned under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) over the last three financial years (2021-22 to 2023-24) and in the current fiscal year (2024-25), according to the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (MDoNER).

Title: NIA raids 22 places across 6 states in human trafficking case
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 06:50:46 +0000
Content: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted searches at 22 locations across six states on Thursday in connection with a human trafficking case.
The operation, which began early this morning, is still ongoing with separate NIA teams working closely with state police forces. This effort, focused on dismantling a well-organized trafficking network, is being executed at the residences of suspected individuals, following detailed intelligence.
According to official sources, the raids spanned multiple states, targeting individuals and organizations suspected of involvement in the trafficking of vulnerable individuals. These coordinated searches are part of an ongoing investigation into a criminal network engaged in trafficking for illegal purposes, including forced labour and exploitation.
The NIA took over the case (RC-10/2024/NIA/DLI) from local police. The case reportedly involves the trafficking of men, women, and children across state borders and possibly internationally.
The NIA, India’s premier counter-terrorism and investigative agency, took over the case following suspicions of a larger organized network with links to cross-border syndicates.
Authorities have intensified efforts to combat human trafficking in recent years, with increased focus on disrupting the supply chains of traffickers and rescuing victims. The NIA’s raid is a significant step toward dismantling such operations.
India has long grappled with the issue of human trafficking, with thousands of individuals, particularly from economically vulnerable communities, falling prey to traffickers each year. Despite stringent laws and international commitments, trafficking networks continue to operate across regions, often exploiting gaps in enforcement. (ANI)

Content: Indonesian rescuers are searching for passengers trapped in a minibus buried in mud after flash floods and landslides hit several locations in North Sumatra province, killing at least 27, an official said on Thursday.
Torrential rain in the province since last week had caused flash floods and landslides in four different districts, Indonesia’s disaster agency has said.
A landslide in a village in Deli Serdang on Wednesday killed seven and injured 20, Hadi Wahyudi, North Sumatra police spokesperson told Reuters.
Rescuers were looking for missing people, including those trapped in a minibus and other vehicles on a hilly interprovince road hit by a mudslide, he said, adding he could not give an estimate for the number of affected people.
In other places, rescuers have found 20 dead during a search that started over the weekend. They are still searching for two missing.
“Today, we’re focusing our search to find missing people and clearing the roads affected by the landslides,” said Hadi, adding excavators were deployed.
The landslides and flash floods damaged houses, mosques, and rice fields.
Heavy rains also triggered floods in the provincial capital of Medan, forcing a delay in votes for a regional election in some polling stations.
Extreme weather is expected in Indonesia towards the end of 2024, as the La Nina phenomenon increases rainfalls across the tropical archipelago, the country’s weather agency has warned.

Simultaneously, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) has ramped up coordination with Tamil Nadu authorities to ensure the safety of maritime operations. The ICG has issued advisories urging fishing boats to return to harbors as weather conditions worsen.
“Deep Depression in the Bay of Bengal likely to intensify into a cyclone and move towards Tamil Nadu, as per IMD. ICG ships, aircraft, and radar stations are issuing advisories for fishing boats to return to harbor,” the ICG said in a social media update.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the deep depression moved north-northwestward at a slow pace of 3 km/h over the past several hours. As of 5:30 PM IST on November 27, it was located about 100 km east-northeast of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, 320 km southeast of Nagappattinam, 420 km southeast of Puducherry, and 500 km south-southeast of Chennai.
The IMD predicts the system will intensify into a cyclonic storm within the next 12 hours, skirting Sri Lanka’s coastline before reaching the north Tamil Nadu-Puducherry coasts as a deep depression on the morning of November 30.
Residents in Tamil Nadu have been advised to stay informed about weather updates and take necessary precautions as authorities prepare for the storm’s potential impact.

Title: Biden readies $725 million arms aid package for Ukraine, sources say
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 04:47:11 +0000
Content: U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is preparing a $725 million weapons package for Ukraine, two U.S. officials said on Wednesday, as the outgoing president seeks to bolster the government in Kyiv before leaving office in January.
According to an official familiar with the plan, the Biden administration plans to provide a variety of anti-tank weapons from U.S. stocks to blunt Russia’s advancing troops, including land mines, drones, Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).
The package is also expected to include cluster munitions, which are typically found in Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets fired by HIMARS launchers, according to the notification, seen by Reuters.
The formal notification to Congress of the weapons package could come as soon as Monday, one official said.
The contents and size of the package could change in the coming days ahead of Biden’s expected signature.
It marks a steep uptick in size from Biden’s recent use of so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which allows the U.S. to draw from current weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency.
Recent PDA announcements have typically ranged from $125 million to $250 million. Biden has an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion in PDA already authorized by Congress that he is expected to use before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
The United States has not exported landmines in decades, and their use is controversial because of the potential harm to civilians. Although more than 160 countries have signed a treaty banning their use, Kyiv has been asking for them since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022 and Russian forces have used them on the front lines.
Russian forces currently are making gains in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers said this week.
The United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians.
Trump on Wednesday tapped Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who presented him with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, to serve as special envoy for the conflict. Quickly winding down the Ukraine war was one of Trump’s central campaign promises, though he has avoided discussing how he would do so.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open flat; realty stocks shine
Publication Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2024 04:38:29 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices remained muted in early trade on Thursday, with buying seen in the realty sector.
The Sensex dropped 40.02 points, or 0.05 percent, to 80,194.06, while the Nifty inched up by 2.35 points, or 0.01 percent, to 24,277.25 as of 09:39 AM.
Market sentiment was positive, with 1,792 stocks advancing and 464 declining on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank rose by 224.35 points, or 0.43 percent, to 52,526.15. The Nifty Midcap 100 index gained 381.35 points, or 0.68 percent, reaching 56,653.70, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 added 165.30 points, or 0.89 percent, to stand at 18,668.15.
Akshay Chinchalkar of Axis Securities said, “Nifty has formed a bullish pattern within a three-day range of 24,125-24,350. This is rare, as all three candles share a similar high-to-low range, which makes the pattern significant, especially after the Monday gap-up.”
“The immediate resistance level to watch is 24,360, with the next at 24,540. Critical support lies at 24,120, with bears gaining strength only if the index closes below 23,956,” he added.
Top gainers included Hindustan Unilever, ITC, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Nestle India, and Adani Ports. Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, Power Grid, TCS, M&M, and Bajaj Finance were the major laggards.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 7.78 crore on Wednesday, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 1,301.97 crore.
Across broader Asian markets, Seoul and Japan were trading higher, while China, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Jakarta were in the red. US markets declined in the previous session.
