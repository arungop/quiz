Title: Russia will abandon its unilateral missile moratorium, Lavrov says
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:09:45 +0000
Content: Russia will scrap a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate and shorter range nuclear-capable missiles because the United States has deployed such weapons in various regions around the world, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday.
Russia’s move, long signalled, will kill off all that remains from one of the most significant arms control treaties of the Cold War, amid fears that the world’s two biggest nuclear powers could be entering a new arms race together with China.
Russia and the United States, who both admit their relations are worse than at any time since the depths of the Cold War, have both expressed regret about the disintegration of the tangle of arms control treaties which sought to slow the arms race and reduce the risk of nuclear war.
Asked by state news agency RIA if Russia could withdraw from the New START treaty before its expiry in February 2026, Lavrov said that there were currently “no conditions” for a strategic dialogue with Washington.
“Today it is clear that, for example, our moratorium on the deployment of short- and intermediate-range missiles is no longer practically viable and will have to be abandoned,” Lavrov said.
“The U.S. has arrogantly ignored the warnings of Russia and China and in practice has moved on to the deployment of weapons of this class in various regions of the world.”
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan in 1987, marked the first time the superpowers had agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals and eliminated a whole category of nuclear weapons.
The United States under former President Donald Trump formally withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019 after saying that Moscow was violating the accord, an accusation the Kremlin repeatedly denied and dismissed as a pretext.
Russia then imposed a moratorium on its own development of missiles previously banned by the INF treaty – ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 km to 5,500 km (310 miles to 3,417 miles).
Trump in 2018 said he wanted to terminate the INF Treaty because of what he said were years of Russian violations and his concerns about China’s intermediate-range missile arsenal.
The United States publicly blamed Russia’s development of the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile, known in NATO as the SSC-8, as the reason for it leaving the INF Treaty.
In his moratorium proposal, Putin suggested Russia could agree not to deploy the missiles in its Baltic coast exclave of Kaliningrad. Since leaving the pact, the United States has tested missiles with a similar profile.
Russia fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik”, or Hazel Tree, at Ukraine on Nov. 21 in what Putin said was a direct response to strikes on Russia by Ukrainian forces with U.S. and British missiles.

Title: Arshdeep Singh nominated for ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:49:04 +0000
Content: India pacer Arshdeep Singh has been shortlisted for the ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year after a splendid year with the Men in Blue that saw him lift the T20 World Cup in Barbados.
Arshdeep will compete against Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza, Australia’s Travis Head and former Pakistan captain Babar Azam for the annual accolade of the shortest format.
Jasprit Bumrah’s selective T20I appearances have allowed Arshdeep to excel as India’s primary pacer in the format. Arshdeep claimed 36 wickets in 18 matches in 2022, just one behind Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s 37 but in significantly fewer games.
Filling the left-arm pacer void, Arshdeep delivered match-winning performances across conditions, including key contributions to India’s T20 World Cup triumph. His standout moment came in the final, where he removed Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock before bowling a tight 19th over that sealed the second T20 title for the Rohit Sharma-led side.
Raza continues to shine for Zimbabwe, earning a shortlist nod for the third consecutive year. The 39-year-old all-rounder led his side to an unbeaten run in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup sub-regional Africa Qualifier Group B, scoring 199 runs and taking 10 wickets.
His highlight came against India in July this year, where he claimed 3/25 on a tricky track to secure a 13-run win, breaking key partnerships to script the upset.
Babar was Pakistan’s leading T20I run-scorer in 2023, hitting six fifties and maintaining a strike rate of 133.21. He is on the brink of surpassing Rohit Sharma as the all-time leading T20I scorer. His standout knock was a 75 off 42 balls against Ireland, leading Pakistan to a series-clinching win.
Australia’s Head demonstrated his versatility in 2024, scoring 539 T20I runs at a strike rate of 178.47. He was the third-highest run-getter in the T20 World Cup with 255 runs.
His explosive 59 off 23 balls in the Powerplay against England helped Australia secure a commanding win in Southampton. Despite Australia’s World Cup exit, Head’s consistent performances cemented his place as a dynamic T20I batter.

Title: Israel detains 240 Palestinians including medics after Gaza hospital raid
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:42:04 +0000
Content: Israeli forces detained more than 240 Palestinians including dozens of medical staff from a north Gaza hospital they raided on Friday, including its director, according to the Health Ministry in the enclave and Israel’s military.
The Health Ministry said it was concerned for the wellbeing of Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, as some staff freed by the Israeli military late on Friday said he had been beaten up by soldiers.
The Israeli military said the hospital was being used as a command centre for Hamas military operations and those arrested were suspected militants. It said Abu Safiya had been taken for questioning as he was suspected of being a Hamas operative.
On Friday, Hamas dismissed Israel’s assertion that its fighters had operated from the hospital throughout the 15-month-old Gaza war, saying no fighters had been in the hospital. The group had not yet commented on the 240 arrests.
In its statement on Saturday, Hamas urged the U.N. and relevant international agencies to intervene urgently to protect the remaining hospitals and medical facilities in northern Gaza and supply them.
The group also called for U.N. observers to be sent to medical facilities in Gaza to refute the Israeli allegations that they were being used for military purposes.
The raid on the hospital, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of Gaza, put the last major health facility in the area out of service, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a post on X.
“WHO is appalled by yesterday’s raid. The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on North Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk,” it said.
Some patients were evacuated from Kamal Adwan to the Indonesian Hospital, which is not in service, and medics were prevented from joining them there, the Health Ministry said. Other patients and staff were taken to other medical facilities.
MUCH OF NORTHERN GAZA RAZED AND EMPTIED BY ISRAELI FORCES
The Israeli military said 350 patients and medical personnel had been evacuated prior to the Kamal Adwan operation, while another 95 had been evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital during the operation, in coordination with local health authorities.
Separately, the Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli strikes across the enclave had killed 18 Palestinians on Saturday, at least nine of them in a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes and fatalities.
In the past few months, Israeli forces have pushed people out and razed much of the area around the northern Gaza towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya.
Palestinians have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing by depopulating those areas to create a buffer zone. Israel denies it is doing this, saying it aims to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping in the areas.
The Israeli military said on Saturday it had begun operating overnight against targets in the Beit Hanoun area, adding that “troops are enabling civilians still in the area to move away for their own safety”.
It then ordered residents to leave and head towards southern parts of the Strip, saying rockets had been fired from the area.
It said two rockets fired from north Gaza, including one towards Jerusalem, had been intercepted.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas, which previously controlled Gaza, has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, according to health officials in the enclave. Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
The war was triggered by Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Title: India-Australia trade surges to USD 26 billion, reflecting successful agreement
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 08:00:09 +0000
Content: The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA) has completed two years, marking a significant milestone in bilateral trade relations and fostering mutual growth. Since its signing, the agreement has not only strengthened the economic ties between the two countries but also created new opportunities for businesses, MSMEs, and employment, reinforcing the foundation of their economic partnership.
In the two years since the agreement’s implementation, bilateral merchandise trade has more than doubled, increasing from USD 12.2 billion in 2020-21 to USD 26 billion in 2022-23. Though trade moderated slightly in 2023-24, reaching USD 24 billion, India’s exports to Australia have grown by 14%, maintaining strong momentum. As of November 2024, total merchandise trade between the two nations stood at USD 16.3 billion.
The preferential import data exchange between India and Australia, which began in 2023, highlights the successful implementation of the ECTA. The data shows impressive export utilization at 79% and import utilization at 84%, demonstrating the agreement’s effectiveness.
Key sectors such as textiles, chemicals, and agriculture have seen substantial growth under the agreement, while new exports, including gold-studded diamonds and turbojets, signal diversification in trade. Additionally, India’s imports of critical raw materials—like metalliferous ores, cotton, and wood products—have supported the country’s industries, reinforcing the mutually beneficial nature of the partnership. There is also considerable potential for growth in sectors like electronics and engineering.
Building on the success of the ECTA, the India-Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) is currently in progress. Ten formal rounds of discussions have taken place, along with inter-sessional talks. A recent stocktake visit to New Delhi from 4th to 6th December 2024 assessed the progress of the CECA and set the stage for the next steps.
Both countries are determined to continue building on the success of the ECTA and work towards their shared goal of achieving USD 100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030.

Title: At least 85 dead in fiery South Korea airliner crash, two crew rescued
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 06:23:42 +0000
Content: At least 85 people were killed when an airliner landed without wheels, veering off the runway and erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea’s Muan International Airport on Sunday, the national fire agency said.
Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 181 people on board, was attempting to land shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea’s transport ministry said.
The ministry also confirmed the casualties in the deadliest air accident involving a South Korean airline in nearly three decades.
Two crew members, a man and a woman, were rescued from the tail section of the burning plane, Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told a briefing. The fire was extinguished by 1 p.m., Lee said.
“Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of (the plane) looks almost impossible to recognise,” he said.
Authorities have switched from rescue to recovery operations and because of the force of the impact, are searching nearby areas for bodies possibly thrown from the plane, Lee added.
The two crew were being treated at hospitals with medium to severe injuries, said the head of the local public health centre.
Yonhap news agency cited a fire official as saying most of 175 passengers and six crew were presumed dead.
At least 58 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, another fire official told Reuters.
Authorities had worked to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters shortly after the crash.
Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane.
‘MY LAST WORDS’
The crash is the worst by any South Korean airline since a 1997 Korean Air crash in Guam that killed more than 200 people, according to transportation ministry data.
Investigators are looking into bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors, Lee said. Yonhap cited airport authorities as saying a bird strike may have caused the landing gear to malfunction.
A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, the News1 agency reported. The person’s final message was, “Should I say my last words?”
The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry.
The plane was a Boeing 737-800 jet operated by Jeju Air, which was seeking details of the accident, including its casualties and cause, an airline spokesperson said. The transport ministry said the plane was manufactured in 2009.
Jeju Air posted a message apologising for the accident.
Boeing said in a emailed statement, “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.”
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
All domestic and international flights at Muan airport had been cancelled, Yonhap reported.
South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, named interim leader of the country on Friday in an ongoing political crisis, arrived at the scene of the accident and said the government was putting all its resources into dealing with the crash.
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra sent condolences to the families of the dead and injured in a post on X, saying she had instructed the foreign ministry to provide assistance.
The ministry said in a statement it was in touch with the South Korean authorities.

Title: Bosnia’s “Balkan Blues” earns UNESCO recognition
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:53:50 +0000
Content: Every Friday, folk musician Enes Salman performs the Sevdalinka, an ancient form of love song from Bosnia and Herzegovina that this month was included in UNESCO’s National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
Sevdalinka, often referred to as the Balkan Blues, is a melancholic urban love song dating back to the 16th century. It is a mix of South Slavic oral poetry and the music of the Ottoman Empire.
Salman is one of a few musicians who are keeping the old tradition alive.
“I have been playing and singing Sevdalinka since I was 14,” Salman said before a recent performance.
Sevdalinka, often performed a capella or accompanied by traditional instruments like a lute, has been carried from generation to generation through performances at family gatherings.
In recent years, novel interpretations of Sevdalinka by a few younger musicians have brought it to global audiences.
One of them is Damir Imamovic, whose father and grandfather were famous Sevdalinka bards. Imamovic won awards in 2020/2021 for the European best album by world music magazines Songlines and Transglobal.
Imamovic promotes Sevdalinka internationally through his SevdahLab project, which drummed up support for the song’s inclusion on the UNESCO’s World Heritage list.
“I realised how little the public knows about the Sevdalinka genre and wanted to reveal the story behind that music,” he said.
Zanin Berbic, 28, an ethno-musicologist who plays saz, a long-necked lute used in Ottoman classical music, says that Sevdalinka tells the story of Bosnia’s history.
“Most of my days I spend either singing or playing Sevdalinka songs or reading or talking about them,” said Berbic, who works as a custodian in the music department of Bosnia’s Regional Museum in Sarajevo.
“Sevdalinka is my life.”

Title: NASA spacecraft ‘safe’ after closest-ever approach to Sun
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:35:25 +0000
Content: NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was “safe” and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the Sun by any human-made object.
The spacecraft passed 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface on Dec. 24, flying into the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth’s closest star.
The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday.
The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on Jan. 1, NASA added.
Moving at up to 430,000 mph (692,000 kph), the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (982 degrees Celsius), according to the NASA website.
“This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,” the agency added.
“We’re rewriting the textbooks on how the Sun works with the data from this probe,” Dr. Joseph Westlake, NASA’s heliophysics director told Reuters.
“This mission was theorized in the Fifties,”, he said, adding that it is an “amazing achievement to create technologies that let us delve into our understanding of how the sun operates”.
The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer towards the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.
Westlake said the team is preparing for even more flybys in the extended mission phase, hoping to capture unique events.

Title: Trump sides with Elon Musk in H-1B visa debate, says he’s always been in favor of the program
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:30:41 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday sided with key supporter and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk in a public dispute over the use of the H-1B visa, saying he fully backs the program for foreign tech workers opposed by some of his supporters.
Trump’s remarks followed a series of social media posts from Musk, the CEO of Tesla TSLA.O and SpaceX, who vowed late Friday to go to “war” to defend the visa program for foreign tech workers.
Trump, who moved to limit the visas’ use during his first presidency, told The New York Post on Saturday he was likewise in favor of the visa program.
“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” he was quoted as saying.
Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his electric-car company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas this year. H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards.
The altercation was set off earlier this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
Musk’s tweet was directed at Trump’s supporters and immigration hard-liners who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas.
On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued “big tech oligarchs” for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization.
In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration.
Trump has promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens and severely restrict immigration.
The visa issue highlights how tech leaders like Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base.
The U.S. tech industry relies on the government’s H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens.
Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies.

Title: Delhi air quality ‘very poor’ again despite rain record
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:10:41 +0000
Content: After a slight improvement in air quality due to heavy rainfall over the past two to three days, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has once again deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ category. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall AQI in the national capital was recorded at 223 at 7 a.m. on Sunday.
A thin fog layer blanketed the city in the morning, with the minimum temperature dipping to 12 degrees Celcius.
CPCB data highlights varying AQI levels across Delhi’s regions at 7 a.m.: Okhla Phase 2 recorded AQI at 245, Alipur (202), Rohini (271), ITO (243), Ashok Vihar (251), Shadipur (222), Mundka (270), Jahangirpuri (288), Narela (191), DTU (140), R.K. Puram (252), Anand Vihar (287), Pusa (238), and Punjabi Bagh (214).
The air quality had briefly improved to the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday, because of the rains that brought temporary relief. However, the current AQI levels continue to pose health risks, especially for vulnerable populations.
Delhi received 41.2 mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, marking the highest single-day December rainfall in 101 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The Centre’s air quality monitoring panel revoked Stage III measures of the revised Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Friday, citing favourable weather conditions, including continuous rainfall in Delhi-NCR.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Saturday recommended lifting the curbs after the India Meteorological Department and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology predicted further improvement owing to favourable meteorological conditions. The Stage III restrictions were imposed on December 16.
Despite the improvement brought by the rain, the return to ‘very poor’ AQI highlights the persistent air quality challenges during winter. CPCB’s AQI scale categorises levels from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe plus’ (above 450).
Authorities urge residents to limit outdoor activities and remain cautious as winter intensifies, emphasising the need for continuous air quality monitoring and preventive measures.

Title: PM Modi calls on India’s creative industry to join WAVES summit, honors cinema legends
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 07:18:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended a call to India’s entertainment and creative industries to come together and showcase the nation’s creative prowess on the global stage. In the 117th episode of his monthly radio program ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ the Prime Minister announced that India will host the inaugural World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) from February 5-9, 2025, marking a milestone moment for the country’s burgeoning media and entertainment sector.
WAVES Summit
Drawing comparisons with global economic forums like Davos, Prime Minister Modi described WAVES as a golden opportunity for India to highlight its creative talent and cement its position as a global hub for content creation. “Giants from the global media and entertainment industry, alongside creative minds from across the world, will converge in India. This summit is a crucial step towards making India a global hub of content creation,” he said.
The Prime Minister underscored the pivotal role of young creators in this vision, crediting their vibrant contributions as a driving force in India’s journey to becoming a $5 trillion economy. He invited stakeholders from Bollywood, regional cinema, television, animation, gaming, and entertainment technology to actively participate in the summit.
He said, “Whether you are a young creator or an established artist, associated with Bollywood or regional cinema, a professional from the TV industry, an expert in animation, gaming, or an innovator in entertainment technology, I encourage you to be a part of the WAVE Summit”, Prime Minister said while urging all stakeholders in the entertainment and creative industries to actively participate in the WAVES.
The summit will spotlight advancements in animation, gaming, entertainment technology, and regional and mainstream cinema, fostering collaborations and setting the stage for India’s creative economy to shine globally.
In a heartfelt tribute, the Prime Minister commemorated the 100th birth anniversaries of Indian cinema stalwarts Raj Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, Akkineni Nageswara Rao (ANR), and Tapan Sinha, acknowledging their timeless contributions to the golden era of Indian cinema.
He celebrated Raj Kapoor’s role in elevating India’s cultural diplomacy through his iconic films, Mohammed Rafi’s soulful voice that transcended generations, ANR’s efforts in redefining Telugu cinema while reflecting Indian traditions, and Tapan Sinha’s socially conscious filmmaking that inspired unity and awareness.
The 55th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) earlier this year paid homage to these cinematic icons through tributes, screenings, and interactive sessions, offering a deeper appreciation of their extraordinary legacy.

Title: 4th Test: Cummins, Boland pick three as Aus take 2-1 lead with 184-run win over India
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 07:03:11 +0000
Content: Captain Pat Cummins and Scott Boland picked three wickets each as a terrific bowling performance from Australia led them to a 184-run win over India in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday.
India was at 112/3 at tea, with Yashasvi Jaiswal hitting a controlled fifty and Rishabh Pant showing remarkable restraint.
But in the final session of the gripping Test match, Pant fell to Travis Head, and that opened up the door for Australia to barge in as India collapsed from 121/3 to 155 all out.
The visitors’ losing their last seven wickets for 34 runs in 20.3 overs has meant Australia now has a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, ahead of the final match in Sydney.
For India, they will be disappointed, as it was a game that they could have drawn but have now ended up on the losing side.
The shot selection of the batters in the second innings fell like a pack of cards, along with the failing form of their senior batters, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, which will come under more scrutiny as the final Test in Sydney now becomes a must-win affair for India to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
Australia had a funky start to the final session by opening the bowling with the part-time off-spin of Travis Head. The ploy worked for Australia when Head broke the 88-run stand by having Rishabh Pant miscue a pull to tumble long-on and fall for 30 off 104 balls.
Three overs later, Boland struck by getting a back-of-the-length ball to jump at Ravindra Jadeja, who can’t help but fend at it, and edged behind to Alex Carey.
Nathan Lyon joined the wicket-takers party by getting a to skid on straight and take the outside edge of a defending Nitish Kumar Reddy to first slip, as the batter fell for just one.
Jaiswal continued to battle hard alongside Washington Sundar, even as Australia tested him against the short ball.
The ploy worked when Jaiswal looked to pull a bouncer from Cummins, but gloved behind to Carey, who took a great low catch.
Australia went for the review, where third umpire Sharfuddoula ruled Jaiswal out for 84, citing the enormous and visible deflection between bat and glove, despite no line showing on snicko.
From there, the result was a foregone conclusion – Boland had Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah caught out while Lyon trapped Mohammed Siraj lbw to seal a memorable win for Australia.
Brief Scores: Australia 474 and 234 in 83.4 overs (Marnus Labuschagne 70, Nathan Lyon 41; Jasprit Bumrah 5-57, Mohammed Siraj 3-70) beat India 369 and 155 in 79.1 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 84, Rishabh Pant 30; Pat Cummins 3-28, Scott Boland 3-39) by 184 runs

Title: J-K: Relief for farmers in Udhampur as four-month dry spell ends with rains
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:33:24 +0000
Content: Farmers in Udhampur district, Jammu and Kashmir, have breathed a sigh of relief as rains finally ended a four-month-long dry spell that had left their crops withering and their fields parched.
The prolonged lack of rainfall had caused immense anxiety among farmers, who were unsure of their harvest’s fate. However, the recent showers have revived hopes of a better yield and brought much-needed respite.
Sanjeev Kumar, a farmer from Debrah village, shared his relief over the rains arriving just in time. “We were waiting for rainfall for the last four months. The vegetable crops I planted were drying up, and I was very worried. If it hadn’t rained, our crops would have been destroyed,” Kumar said. He added that the rainfall promises good profits, as it has significantly improved the prospects for his harvest.
The rainfall has not only rejuvenated crops in Udhampur but also brought cheer to farmers across the region, many of whom had been grappling with the harsh consequences of the dry spell.
Meanwhile, much of northwest India, including parts of Jammu and Kashmir, witnessed dense fog on Thursday, adding to the seasonal chill. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, experienced snowfall as temperatures dipped further.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in a post on X, reported a widespread fog layer across several regions, including South Jammu, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat.

Title: ISRO to launch SpaDeX mission today
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:21:11 +0000
Content: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to launch its year-end mission, the “Space Docking Experiment” (SpaDeX),on Monday. The mission, aimed at advancing India’s capabilities in orbital docking, will lift off at 10:00:15 PM IST from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.
ISRO confirmed the launch time in a post on X, saying, “Tonight at precisely 10:00:15 PM, PSLV-C60 with SpaDeX and innovative payloads are set for liftoff. SpaDeX is a pioneering mission to establish India’s capability in orbital docking, a key technology for future human spaceflight and satellite servicing missions.”
The SpaDeX mission will be carried aboard the PSLV-C60 rocket, which is designed to deliver two small spacecraft into low-Earth orbit. The primary objective of this mission is to demonstrate crucial technologies for the rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two spacecraft: SDX01, the Chaser, and SDX02, the Target. 
This test mission will be conducted in a low-Earth circular orbit, where the spacecraft will perform intricate docking maneuvers, showcasing India’s growing expertise in space technologies.
One of the most challenging aspects of SpaDeX is the precision required for these docking maneuvers, particularly given the small size and mass of the spacecraft compared to previous missions. The mission aims to lay the groundwork for autonomous docking operations in future lunar missions, including the planned Chandrayaan-4 mission, which will operate without Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) support.
Both spacecraft will carry a differential GNSS-based Satellite Positioning System (SPS) that provides Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solutions. The system will be enhanced by a novel Relative Orbit Determination and Prediction (RODP) processor, which will enable the precise measurement of the relative position and velocity between the Chaser and Target spacecraft. This processor will subtract carrier phase measurements from shared GNSS satellites to determine the highly accurate relative states of both satellites. VHF/UHF (very high frequency/ultra high frequency) transceivers in each spacecraft will further aid this process by transferring GNSS data between the two.
The spacecraft were designed and built by ISRO’s UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), with support from other ISRO centers. During the orbital phase, the SpaDeX spacecraft will be controlled from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) using ground stations both from ISRO and external sources.

Title: In a first, Ukraine captures North Korean soldier
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:16:19 +0000
Content: In a first, Ukraine claims to have captured a North Korean soldier who was fighting alongside Russian forces in the Kursk region. A photo of the purportedly captured North Korean soldier, who appeared to have sustained injuries, circulated on Telegram. The soldier was captured alive but has since died from his wounds. He is believed to be the first North Korean prisoner of war captured since Pyongyang deployed forces to support Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s military-focussed news outlet Militarnyi reported on Thursday that Ukraine’s forces captured the soldier from Kursk, without specifying when the incident occurred. Ukraine came to partially occupy Russia’s Kursk region in August after it launched an offensive that surprised Moscow and Kyiv’s allies alike.
Although Seoul believes about a thousand North Korean soldiers have died in combat so far, Kyiv claims that Pyongyang has suffered more than 3 thousand casualties.
In recent days, Ukraine has published information about articles seized from North Korean soldiers who died in combat in Kursk region. A diagram drawn on a piece of paper explains how to shoot down a Ukrainian drone. Another shows a hand-written letter that was found on the dead soldier’s person.
A South Korean lawmaker, Lee Seong-kweun, attributes the heavy losses to the lack of experience by North Korean troops in drone warfare and unfamiliarity with the open terrain where they are taking part in the battle. He says Pyongyang’s soldiers are nothing but cannon fodder.
For its part, North Korea is projecting its troop deployment as an opportunity to train its forces in modern warfare, get valuable combat experience and also help Moscow in its war effort in return for nuclear and missile technologies to improve its deterrence against South Korea and its Western allies. But neither Russia nor North Korea have made any comment about troop deployments or casualties so far.
North Korea is reported to have sent more than 10 thousand troops to Russia. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it amounts to a new escalation in the nearly 34-month-old war. “Russia drew one more country into this war, to the fullest extent. If this is not considered to be escalation, then what is escalation which so many people talked about? It is Putin who makes steps that expand and prolong this war. It is him who pushes back the possibility of peace. He wants to add more problems for the world in Asia. That’s why Russians are teaching modern war to North Korea,” says Zelenskyy.
NATO chief Mark Rutte airs a similar sentiment. “Well, North Korean troops being deployed in Russia against Ukraine, this is a significant escalation and it makes us even more focused and determined to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to fight off the Russians, including the North Koreans.”
North Korea maintains that its military alliance with Russia is proving effective in deterring the U.S. and its quote-unquote vassal forces, denouncing a recent statement by Washington, D.C. and allies against growing ties between Pyongyang and Moscow. North Korea and Russia signed a mutual defence treaty in June. It followed Kim Jong-un’s visit to Russia in September 2023. In November 2024, Russia’s Defence Minister Andrei Belousov met Kim in Pyongyang. Belousov says, “The results of the historic meeting between President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and Chairman of State Affairs of the D.P.R.K. Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang in June this year demonstrated the highest level of mutual trust. As well as the mutual desire of our countries to further expand mutually beneficial cooperation in a difficult international situation.”
A South Korean military official says North Korea could dispatch more reinforcements to Russia, including rocket launchers and self-propelled artillery. In a tit-for-tat, South Korea is mulling sending arms to Ukraine. Since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, the two Koreas have remained technically at war. It seems there’s no end to tensions on the Korean peninsula, just as there is no resolution in sight for the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Title: Afghan Taliban hit back at Pakistan, targets soldiers
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:11:25 +0000
Content: Pakistani airstrikes kill 46 people in Afghanistan on 24 December. Pakistan claims it targeted a hideout of its homegrown terrorist group — the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan to avenge the killings of 16 Pakistani soldiers by the T.T.P. three days ago. But the Afghan Taliban, which rules Kabul, is not entirely convinced. It says dozens of civilians, including women and children, are among the dead — a claim corroborated by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Kabul lodges a formal protest with Islamabad over violation of its sovereignty. The Afghan Foreign Ministry issues a statement condemning the aggression by Pakistani Military at a time when Pakistan’s Special Envoy for Afghanistan was visiting Kabul for talks with Taliban officials. The Afghan Defence Ministry puts out a more strongly-worded statement, saying that Kabul will not let this cowardly act go unanswered. And true to form, the Afghan Taliban retaliates on 28 December by targeting Pakistani soldiers.
Taliban Spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid says Pakistan bombarded four areas in the Barmal district of Afghanistan’s Paktika province. Across the border from Paktika lies North Waziristan, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. North Waziristan has historically been a hive of militancy and was the target of a long-running Pakistani military offensive and U.S. drone strikes during the post-9/11 occupation of Afghanistan that saw many people take shelter in Afghanistan. Pakistan and the T.T.P. have been engaging in a series of tit-for-tat killings for some time now. In March 2024, Pakistan had carried out similar airstrikes in the border regions of Afghanistan.
So why are relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan descending into chaos? Let’s rewind a bit to understand what is happening and why. In September 2021, the then I.S.I. chief Faiz Hameed makes a triumphant visit to Kabul after the Taliban seizes Afghanistan. After all, Pakistan’s spy agency and its ideological fellow traveller, the Taliban, go back a long way. In fact, the Haqqani Network, a close Pakistani ally and a part of the Taliban, was the first to enter Kabul on 15 August 2021 — the day Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. Hameed is seen sipping tea in the foyer of a five-star hotel in the Afghan capital. He also interacts, briefly, with a Western journalist.
Cut to February 2023. Everything is not O.K. as Hameed’s successor, Nadeen Anjum, returns to Kabul, this time with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in tow. The mood is far from celebratory because, apparently, the Taliban is no longer doing Pakistan’s bidding! And that’s something the Generals in Rawalpindi, who use Afghanistan for strategic depth and treat the Taliban as their proxy, simply cannot digest. What hurts them is that the T.T.P., which fought alongside the Taliban against the U.S.-backed NATO forces in Afghanistan, is now turning on Pakistan. Clearly, chickens have come home to roost for Pakistan that’s accused of being the epicentre of terrorism. What hurts the Pakistani Generals even more is that the Taliban is not persuading or prevailing upon the T.T.P. to stop its attacks inside Pakistan especially after the T.T.P. called off a ceasefire on 28 November 2022. Adding to their woes, all this is happening at a time when Pakistan’s economy is fragile and the country remains dependent on foreign aid.
Pakistan’s complaint is that the Afghan Taliban harbours the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. Pakistan’s Chargé d’Aff­a­ires in Kabul, Obaid Nizamani, met Taliban Defence Minister Mul­lah Yaqoob on 27 November. Afghanistan’s Chargé d’Affaires Sardar Ahmad Shakeeb, in turn, called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of Pakistan on 9 December. A Pakistani official says the Taliban has been repeatedly urged to take action against the T.T.P. but its response has been lukewarm. The T.T.P., formed in 2007, comprises a large number of Pakistani nationals who want to overthrow the Government in Islamabad and introduce Islamic law or Sharia in Pakistan.
Adding insult to Pakistan’s injury, some Taliban leaders are seeking to establish ties with its archrival, India. Taliban Defence Minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob has publicly been leading efforts to build relations with India, including urging the Indian Government to train Taliban forces. In fact, in November 2024, an Indian diplomat called on Yaqoob in Kabul. Yaqoob is the son of Taliban founder and the late supreme leader Mullah Omar. India, like much like the rest of the world, does not recognise the Taliban regime but it re-opened its mission in Kabul in June 2022. Since then, India has provided humanitarian aid, including wheat and medicines, for the Afghan people.
On the other hand, the Taliban’s list of complaints against Pakistan is longer. Taliban resents Pakistan for expelling 5 hundred-thousand undocumented Afghan migrants. The Taliban is also miffed with Pakistan for not recognising its Government in Kabul unlike 2001 when Pakistan was only one of three countries to recognise the Taliban Government. Given the difficulties in its ties with Pakistan, Taliban has been distancing itself from its former benefactor in order to show its independence to foreign donors.
The two neighbours have another long-standing dispute. Afghanistan does not recognise the 2,640-kilometre-long Durand Line, drawn by the British colonialists in 1893, as its border with Pakistan. It has been a source of tension for decades on end. Pakistan has tried to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts have met with hostility from Kabul.

Title: Trump wants control over Panama Canal to counter China threat
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:04:58 +0000
Content: After threatening China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs, Donald Trump wants the U.S. to take back control of the Panama Canal. As if on cue, Trump’s son, Eric, posts an image on X that shows the U.S. adding Greenland, the Panama Canal and Canada to an Amazon online shopping cart. Trump is known to make off the cuff remarks but this was a well-calculated attempt to test the waters with Panama and at the same time put China on notice.
The Panama Canal is an 82-kilometre-long waterway in the Central American country of Panama, linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The U.S. built the Canal in 1914 and administered the territory surrounding the waterway for decades. In 1977, the U.S. agreed to return the Canal to Panama but it handed over full control of the Canal only on 31 December 1999. The Canal has since been administered by the Panamanian Government’s Panama Canal Authority. The fee it charges from ships and shipping companies is a key source of income for the country. It earned record revenues of nearly 5 billion dollars in 2023.
The Canal’s utility lies in the fact that it allows ships travelling from Asia and the western coast of the U.S. to the U.S. East Coast and beyond to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America. The Canal saves ships thousands of kilometres and weeks of travel around the stormy, icy, southern tip of South America. The journey for ships traveling from Los Angeles to New York is 13 thousand kilometres and 22 days shorter via the canal compared to travelling through the Strait of Magellan off Tierra del Fuego, an archipelago that embraces southern Chile and Argentina.
Nearly 15 thousand ships travel through the Panama Canal each year. They include cargo ships and military vessels. The main users of the Canal are the U.S., China, Japan and South Korea. In fact, China is the second-largest user of the Panama Canal after the U.S. This is where geopolitics and big power rivalry come in.
The Panama Canal is crucial for U.S. trade. 75 per cent of the cargo passing through the waterway in 2023 was either bound for or originated from the U.S. but it is equally important for another reason. In the event of a military conflict with China, the U.S. would need to use the Canal to move its ships and other assets to the Indo-Pacific but growing Chinese influence over governments and economies in Latin America could pose a problem for the U.S.
— China has major economic investments in Panama. In 2017, Panama cut its ties with Taiwan and instead established diplomatic relations with China. What will Panama do if China goes to war with the U.S.?
— China does not control or administer the Canal but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based C.K. Hutchison Holdings manages two ports located on the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances. Will the U.S. be able to use the Canal during a conflict with China over Taiwan?
— The 1977 U.S. — Panama Treaty guarantees fair access to the Canal for all nations and non-discriminatory fees but will it be honoured?
It probably explains why Trump says in his Truth Social post that the U.S. has a vested interest in the secure, efficient and reliable operation of the Canal. Trump goes on to say that the U.S. would and will never let the Panama Canal fall into the wrong hands. He says the U.S. did not give the Canal for the benefit of others but merely as a token of co-operation between the U.S. and Panama and that the Canal was solely for Panama to manage, not China or anyone else. Trump’s other complaints are that the U.S. Navy and Commerce have been treated unfairly, the fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, and this so-called rip-off needs to stop.
Incidentally, Trump’s threat coincided with the 35th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Panama. 20 December is National Mourning Day in Panama. It is a public holiday that commemorates the Panamanians who died during the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama. Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino Quintero was quick to push back. He said in a recorded statement released on X that every square metre of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belong to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama and that Panama’s sovereignty and independence are non-negotiable. He also defended the fee charged from ships and shipping companies using the Panama Canal, saying that the fees were carefully and transparently evaluated; they were not set on a whim. Mulino re-affirmed the country’s sovereignty over the Panama Canal in a statement signed alongside three former presidents of the country. Mexico’s President came out in support of Panama. Besides Mexico, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America — People’s Trade Treaty said in a statement that its member states strongly reject the statements made by Trump. Mulino also rejected Trump’s allegation that Chinese soldiers were illegally operating the Canal.
All eyes are on 20 January when Trump will officially enter the White House. For now, Panama can only wait and watch.

Title: IDF eliminates Hamas terrorists involved in October 7 massacre
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 06:00:52 +0000
Content: The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced the elimination of six Hamas terrorists directly involved in the October 7 massacre in Israel, during targeted operations in Gaza’s Jabaliya and Beit Lahia regions.
The joint operations, conducted in collaboration with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), resulted in the deaths of key individuals responsible for the brutal attack. Those neutralized included Mohammed Abd al-Hamid Salah, Zaher Abd Rabbo Mohammed Shahab, Ali Magad Ali Ramadan, and Mohammed Hamouda.
Among the prominent figures eliminated was Rasem Judeh, a Hamas company commander in Jabaliya, who played a pivotal role in the October 7 assault. Judeh was killed alongside four other Hamas commanders and five additional operatives. In total, 14 terrorists, including six involved in the infiltration of Israeli territory, were neutralized.
“The IDF and ISA will continue to operate against every terrorist who participated in the brutal October 7 massacre,” the IDF affirmed in a statement on X.
IDF International Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani provided further updates, revealing that approximately 240 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad were apprehended for investigation. Additionally, around 20 terrorists were eliminated during close-quarter combat operations, which also dismantled powerful explosive devices planted by the militants.
Of those detained, 15 were identified as having infiltrated Israel during the October 7 attack, where they participated directly in the atrocities.
The operations are part of an ongoing effort by the IDF to dismantle Hamas’ terror network and ensure the safety of Israeli civilians. “More details to follow,” Shoshani said.

Title: India’s BoP strengthened by robust inflows from NRI deposits, external commercial borrowing in the quarter: report
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 05:55:27 +0000
Content: India’s Balance of Payments (BoP) witnessed a significant boost in the second quarter of FY25, driven by robust inflows from Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits, External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), and Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPIs), according to a report by the Bank of Baroda.
The report highlighted a sharp rise in the capital account surplus, which climbed to $11.9 billion in Q2 FY25, compared to $10.3 billion in the same quarter last fiscal year. The BoP registered an accretion of $18.6 billion this quarter, a substantial increase from $2.5 billion in Q2 FY24.
While Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) outflows rose to $2.2 billion this quarter from $0.8 billion in the corresponding period last year, other key components of the capital account recorded remarkable growth.
FPI inflows surged to $19.9 billion in Q2 FY25, a fourfold increase from $4.9 billion in the same period the previous year. Similarly, NRI deposit inflows more than doubled to $6.2 billion, up from $3.2 billion in Q2 FY24. ECBs also demonstrated a strong recovery, recording net inflows of $5 billion, reversing the $1.9 billion net outflows seen in Q2 FY24.
The report attributed these trends to favorable global financial conditions and improved investor confidence, which have bolstered India’s external position despite ongoing challenges in the current account deficit and trade balance.

Title: Sensex, Nifty open lower amid weak investor sentiment
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 05:49:33 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened in the red on Monday, as investor sentiment remained subdued, leading to broad-based selling across sectors including auto, IT, PSU banks, financial services, FMCG, media, energy, and metals in early trade.
The Sensex dropped 175.82 points, or 0.22 percent, to 78,523.25, while the Nifty fell by 55.20 points, or 0.23 percent, to 23,758.20, as of 9:30 am. Market breadth was negative, with 1,454 stocks trading lower, and 815 stocks gaining on the NSE.
The Nifty Bank index was down 74.80 points, or 0.15 percent, at 51,236.50. The Nifty Midcap 100 index fell by 182.90 points, or 0.32 percent, to 56,796.90, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index dropped 82.10 points, or 0.44 percent, to 18,673.75.
Sector-wise, buying was seen only in the pharma and healthcare sectors.
Top laggards included Tata Steel, M&M, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Reliance, while Adani Ports, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Zomato, Nestle India, ICICI Bank, NTPC, and UltraTech Cement were among the top gainers.
Market experts attributed the weak sentiment to the lack of strong buying, dampening hopes of a year-end rally. Analysts expect markets to remain under pressure, with any sharp movement likely only after policy announcements from Donald Trump in his second term.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said, “It looks like a dull week ahead for Indian markets, with the so-called Santa Claus rally failing to materialize. Asian markets are soft, following a slight tech-led dip in US markets on Friday. As Trump takes office on January 20, all eyes will be on his early executive orders. With Trump, every statement seems geared toward creating space for negotiation. At the moment, the outlook is not favorable for global or Indian markets.”
Sunil Gurjar, research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services, added, “The Nifty 50 is trading around a strong resistance level at 23,800. As we move into 2025, this key level is critical to watch. Resistance levels at 24,650 and 25,300 could trigger a bullish rally if broken. On the downside, 23,300 is a crucial support level, and a breakdown below it could signal a strong downtrend.”
In broader Asian markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, and Taiwan’s Weighted Index were down at the time of reporting, while South Korea’s KOSPI was marginally higher.

Title: Govt rolling out Rs 15,000 crore roadmap to help steel industry cut carbon emissions
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 13:18:13 +0000
Content: The government is preparing the ‘Green Steel Mission’ with an estimated cost of Rs 15,000 crore for helping the steel industry to reduce carbon emissions and progress towards the Net Zero Target, according to the year-end review released by the Ministry of Steel on Monday.  
The mission includes a PLI Scheme for Green Steel, incentives for the use of renewable energy and mandates for government agencies to buy Green Steel to enhance the industry’s environmental sustainability.
The National Green Hydrogen Mission, spearheaded by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, integrates the steel sector into the broader goal of producing and using green hydrogen, contributing to the decarbonisation of steel production.
A report on ‘Greening the Steel Sector in India on the basis of the recommendations of 14 Task Forces constituted by the Ministry of Steel on various key levers of decarbonisation of the steel sector, was released in September this year. This was followed by the release of the Taxonomy of Green Steel for India earlier this month which defines the star rating for green steel.
 The Steel Scrap Recycling Policy further complements these efforts by increasing the availability of domestically generated scrap, thus promoting resource efficiency, the review states.
The Ministry released the Taxonomy for Green Steel on December 12 to provide standards for defining and categorising the low emission steel, facilitating the green transition of the steel industry. It provides a framework for the production of green steel, the creation of a market for green steel, and seeking financial support.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission for green hydrogen production and usage. The steel sector is also a stakeholder in the Mission and has been allocated budgetary support of Rs 455 crore for the implementation of pilot projects in the iron & steel sector under the Mission up to the Financial Year 2029-30.
Under this mission, the Ministry of Steel has awarded two Pilot Projects to produce Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) using 100 per cent Hydrogen in the vertical shaft and one Pilot Project to use hydrogen in the existing Blast Furnace to reduce coal/ coke consumption in September this year. Pilot projects for the injection of Green Hydrogen in existing vertical shaft-based DRI-making units to partially substitute the natural gas are also being explored.
The government has also launched a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme as a key initiative to attract more investment to boost the domestic manufacturing of ‘Specialty Steel’, and reduce imports. Participating companies have committed to an investment of Rs 27,106 crore, direct employment of 14,760 and estimated production of 7.90 million tonnes of ‘Specialty Steel’ identified in the scheme. As of October 2024, companies have already invested Rs 17,581 crore and generated over 8,660 in employment.
The review further highlights that the government is formulating a comprehensive global strategy to position India as a leader in the steel industry, capable of meeting domestic needs while also becoming a significant exporter. A Working Group has been constituted to formulate India’s Steel Global Outlook Strategy with a focus on the four strategic areas for collaboration viz. 
Raw Materials, Investments, Technologies, and Steel Exports. After extensive consultations with the stakeholders, a Strategy Paper will be formulated identifying focused areas of cooperation and an action plan for priority countries.
Measures have also been taken to formulate standards for the steel consumed in the country and incorporate them in the quality control order (QCO). 
Standardisation involves establishing uniform specifications, testing methods, and manufacturing processes for steel production. This ensures consistency in the quality of steel across different manufacturers. Such steel is required to adhere to the standard defined by BIS and domestic as well as foreign manufacturers are required to obtain a BIS license for manufacturing. By enforcing QCO, the government enforces the supply of only quality products, the review added.

Title: Berlin says Elon Musk trying to exert influence over German election
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:54:46 +0000
Content: U.S. billionaire Elon Musk is trying to exert influence over the German election taking place in February, a government spokesperson said on Monday.
“It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,” with X posts and an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the weekend, she said.
Musk was free to express his opinion, the spokesperson added. “After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.”
The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.
The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote “only the AfD can save Germany” and praised the party’s approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.

Title: India’s defence production poised to clock 20 pc annual growth in FY 2024-29
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:29:21 +0000
Content: On the back of robust government reforms and increasing private sector participation, India’s defence sector production is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 20 per cent during FY24-FY29, according to a report released on Monday.
Indian defence sector companies are set to further enhance the country’s defence capabilities, reduce import dependence, and elevate its global stature, the CareEdge Ratings report stated.
The collaboration between government and private sector entities in India’s defence sector has driven advancements in arms and ammunition, aerospace, electronics, and naval technologies.
Private sector entities, both domestic and multinational, are expected to play a pivotal role in advancing defence modernisation, leveraging their engineering and technological expertise, the report observed.
This collaboration has been supported by policies such as ‘Make in India’ and liberalised FDI norms, which have enhanced domestic manufacturing capabilities, attracted international investments in defence innovation and driven notable growth in exports of military equipment, the report pointed out.
In recent years, India’s defence budget has consistently ranged between 1.90 to 2.8 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
For the fiscal year 2024-25, a substantial allocation of Rs 6.22 lakh crore has been dedicated for the defence sector.
Furthermore, India has set an ambitious annual defence production outlay of Rs 1.75 lakh crore for FY25 which is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 20 per cent to Rs 3 lakh crore (as per Ministry of Defence) by FY29, underscoring its commitment to becoming a self-reliant defence powerhouse, the report noted.
India is making progress in transforming its defence sector, moving towards self-reliance with a focus on indigenous manufacturing and technology development. Supported by initiatives like ‘Make in India,’ the country is steadily reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers and advancing its defence capabilities.
Over the last six years ending FY24, Indian defence exports have grown at a healthy CAGR of approximately 28 per cent.
CareEdge Ratings anticipated that India’s defence exports will grow in tandem with government spending in the sector at an estimated rate of about 19 per cent during the next 5 years (i.e. from FY24 to FY29) on a more extensive base.
India’s defence exports include various products, such as aircraft, naval systems, missile technology, and military hardware.

Title: Study links coffee, tea consumption to reduced risk of head and neck cancer
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:28:21 +0000
Content: A new study has revealed that drinking coffee and tea may significantly lower the risk of developing head and neck cancers, a group that includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and larynx.
Published in the peer-reviewed journal CANCER by the American Cancer Society, the research sheds light on the potential protective effects of these widely consumed beverages.
The pooled analysis, conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, combined data from 14 studies involving over 9,500 patients with head and neck cancer and more than 15,700 cancer-free individuals.
Key findings revealed that individuals consuming more than four cups of caffeinated coffee daily had a 17% lower risk of developing head and neck cancers compared to non-coffee drinkers. Regular coffee drinkers experienced even greater benefits, including a 30% reduced risk of oral cavity cancer and a 22% lower risk of throat cancer.
Notably, drinking 3–4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of hypopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer found at the bottom of the throat. Decaffeinated coffee also showed protective effects, with drinkers having a 25% reduced risk of oral cavity cancer.
Tea consumption demonstrated similarly promising results, with regular tea drinkers showing a 29% reduced risk of hypopharyngeal cancer. Drinking one cup or less of tea daily was linked to a 9% lower overall risk of head and neck cancers and a 27% reduced risk of hypopharyngeal cancer.
However, the study also highlighted complexities in the relationship between tea and cancer. Consuming more than one cup of tea daily was associated with a 38% increased risk of laryngeal cancer, emphasizing the nuanced effects of these beverages on different cancer types.
The analysis suggests that compounds beyond caffeine may contribute to the protective benefits of coffee and tea, particularly in the case of decaffeinated coffee.
Lead researcher Yuan-Chin Amy Lee, PhD, from the Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah School of Medicine, stressed the need for more research to fully understand these findings. “Coffee and tea habits are fairly complex, and these findings support the need for more data and further studies around the impact that coffee and tea can have on reducing cancer risk,” Lee said.
While the results provide compelling evidence for the inclusion of coffee and tea in a balanced diet, researchers caution that additional studies are necessary to confirm the beverages’ role in cancer prevention.

Title: Pakistan approves construction of largest nuclear power plant
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:17:53 +0000
Content: Islamabad has given the go-ahead for the construction of its largest nuclear power facility, marking another step forward in the country’s pursuit of expanding its nuclear capabilities. Despite global concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear and missile programmes, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) has received approval for the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit 5 (C-5).
The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) recently issued a licence for C-5, enabling the construction of the power plant with a capacity of at least 1,200 MWe. This addition will make the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant the largest electricity-producing facility in the country.
According to the PNRA, PAEC submitted its application for the licence in April this year. The application included a Preliminary Safety Assessment Report along with documents addressing nuclear safety, radiation protection, waste management, emergency preparedness, and security measures.
“After a thorough review and assessment of and fulfilment of regulatory requirements in compliance with the relevant national and international standards, the licence was issued,” stated PNRA.
The C-5 project will feature a third-generation Pressurized Water Reactor of Chinese Hualung design. It will include advanced safety mechanisms, such as a double-shell containment and reactor-filtered venting system, ensuring a lifespan of at least 60 years.
This marks the third nuclear power plant in Pakistan utilizing the Hualung design, following the successful operation of Karachi Nuclear Power Plant units 2 and 3.
The construction of C-5 is projected to cost $3.7 billion, with funding already approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council. When operational, the unit will significantly boost Pakistan’s nuclear energy capacity, which currently stands at 3,530 MW, supplying about 27% of the country’s energy needs.
The Chashma Nuclear Power Generating Station (CNPGS) site already hosts multiple nuclear units, generating 325 MW from C-1 and C-2 and 340 MW from C-3 and C-4. Adding C-5 will elevate its total capacity by at least 1,200 MW.
Experts have described nuclear energy as a cost-effective and environment-friendly solution.
“Nuclear energy is safe in terms of the robust active and passive mechanisms installed at the plants, reliable for ensuring energy security and round-the-year availability, economical in terms of being cost-effective as well as environment-friendly for emitting zero carbon,” they said.

Title: Bumrah nominated for ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year Award
Publication Date: Mon, 30 Dec 2024 10:56:56 +0000
Content: India’s fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been nominated for the 2024 ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year award. Alongside him, Sri Lanka all-rounder Kamindu Mendis and England batting duo Joe Root and Harry Brook have also been nominated for this prestigious honour.
Having returned to the Test arena in 2022 during the series against South Africa after a back surgery kept him out, Bumrah dominated the bowling charts in the longer format in 2024 by picking up 71 wickets in 13 Tests, the most scalps taken by a bowler this year.
Bumrah’s 71 scalps in 2024 are also the fifth most wickets taken by an Indian bowler in a Test calendar year, with the list being led by Kapil Dev, who picked up 75 wickets in 18 matches in 1983. Be it in South Africa and Australia, or conditions back home, Bumrah has been consistently impressive.
In the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, Bumrah finished as the leading wicket-taker with 30 wickets at an average of 12.83. He also completed 200 Test wickets in Australia, becoming the fastest Indian pacer to achieve this feat.
Apart from his six-wicket haul against England at Visakhapatnam, Bumrah’s most memorable Test performance came as captain when he guided India to a mammoth 295-run win in Perth. After India was dismissed for just 150 in the first innings, Bumrah wrested back control of the match with a five-wicket haul that bowled Australia out for 104.
With Australia chasing 534 in the fourth innings, Bumrah picked up three wickets to secure a memorable victory for India. That performance won Bumrah the Player of the Match award and propelled him back to the top of the ICC Men’s Test Bowling Rankings.
Root, England’s premier batter, accumulated 1556 runs from 17 Tests at an average of 55.57, his second-best annual run tally in Tests after amassing 1708 runs in 2021. It was also the fifth instance of Root scoring over 1000 Test runs in a calendar year.
With six Test hundreds alongside five fifties, Root’s impressive run saw him become the joint-fifth highest century maker in Tests (36) alongside Rahul Dravid. In addition to his batting feats, Root impressed with a four-wicket haul in the Test series against India.
His teammate Brook scored 1100 runs in 12 Tests at an average of 55, comprising three fifties and four centuries, including a maiden triple century in Pakistan, establishing himself as England’s breakthrough batter in the format.
Mendis, meanwhile, earns a nomination after scoring 1049 runs from nine Tests at an average of 74.92. Mendis also became the joint-third quickest to score 1000 Test runs, equalling Sir Don Bradman’s 13-innings mark to reach the milestone. He also scored twin hundreds in Sri Lanka’s 2-0 series sweep over New Zealand at home.
