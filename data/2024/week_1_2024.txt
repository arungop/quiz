Title: Russia will abandon its unilateral missile moratorium, Lavrov says
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:09:45 +0000
Content: Russia will scrap a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate and shorter range nuclear-capable missiles because the United States has deployed such weapons in various regions around the world, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday.
Russia’s move, long signalled, will kill off all that remains from one of the most significant arms control treaties of the Cold War, amid fears that the world’s two biggest nuclear powers could be entering a new arms race together with China.
Russia and the United States, who both admit their relations are worse than at any time since the depths of the Cold War, have both expressed regret about the disintegration of the tangle of arms control treaties which sought to slow the arms race and reduce the risk of nuclear war.
Asked by state news agency RIA if Russia could withdraw from the New START treaty before its expiry in February 2026, Lavrov said that there were currently “no conditions” for a strategic dialogue with Washington.
“Today it is clear that, for example, our moratorium on the deployment of short- and intermediate-range missiles is no longer practically viable and will have to be abandoned,” Lavrov said.
“The U.S. has arrogantly ignored the warnings of Russia and China and in practice has moved on to the deployment of weapons of this class in various regions of the world.”
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan in 1987, marked the first time the superpowers had agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals and eliminated a whole category of nuclear weapons.
The United States under former President Donald Trump formally withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019 after saying that Moscow was violating the accord, an accusation the Kremlin repeatedly denied and dismissed as a pretext.
Russia then imposed a moratorium on its own development of missiles previously banned by the INF treaty – ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 km to 5,500 km (310 miles to 3,417 miles).
Trump in 2018 said he wanted to terminate the INF Treaty because of what he said were years of Russian violations and his concerns about China’s intermediate-range missile arsenal.
The United States publicly blamed Russia’s development of the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile, known in NATO as the SSC-8, as the reason for it leaving the INF Treaty.
In his moratorium proposal, Putin suggested Russia could agree not to deploy the missiles in its Baltic coast exclave of Kaliningrad. Since leaving the pact, the United States has tested missiles with a similar profile.
Russia fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik”, or Hazel Tree, at Ukraine on Nov. 21 in what Putin said was a direct response to strikes on Russia by Ukrainian forces with U.S. and British missiles.

Title: Arshdeep Singh nominated for ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:49:04 +0000
Content: India pacer Arshdeep Singh has been shortlisted for the ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year after a splendid year with the Men in Blue that saw him lift the T20 World Cup in Barbados.
Arshdeep will compete against Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza, Australia’s Travis Head and former Pakistan captain Babar Azam for the annual accolade of the shortest format.
Jasprit Bumrah’s selective T20I appearances have allowed Arshdeep to excel as India’s primary pacer in the format. Arshdeep claimed 36 wickets in 18 matches in 2022, just one behind Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s 37 but in significantly fewer games.
Filling the left-arm pacer void, Arshdeep delivered match-winning performances across conditions, including key contributions to India’s T20 World Cup triumph. His standout moment came in the final, where he removed Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock before bowling a tight 19th over that sealed the second T20 title for the Rohit Sharma-led side.
Raza continues to shine for Zimbabwe, earning a shortlist nod for the third consecutive year. The 39-year-old all-rounder led his side to an unbeaten run in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup sub-regional Africa Qualifier Group B, scoring 199 runs and taking 10 wickets.
His highlight came against India in July this year, where he claimed 3/25 on a tricky track to secure a 13-run win, breaking key partnerships to script the upset.
Babar was Pakistan’s leading T20I run-scorer in 2023, hitting six fifties and maintaining a strike rate of 133.21. He is on the brink of surpassing Rohit Sharma as the all-time leading T20I scorer. His standout knock was a 75 off 42 balls against Ireland, leading Pakistan to a series-clinching win.
Australia’s Head demonstrated his versatility in 2024, scoring 539 T20I runs at a strike rate of 178.47. He was the third-highest run-getter in the T20 World Cup with 255 runs.
His explosive 59 off 23 balls in the Powerplay against England helped Australia secure a commanding win in Southampton. Despite Australia’s World Cup exit, Head’s consistent performances cemented his place as a dynamic T20I batter.

Title: Israel detains 240 Palestinians including medics after Gaza hospital raid
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:42:04 +0000
Content: Israeli forces detained more than 240 Palestinians including dozens of medical staff from a north Gaza hospital they raided on Friday, including its director, according to the Health Ministry in the enclave and Israel’s military.
The Health Ministry said it was concerned for the wellbeing of Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, as some staff freed by the Israeli military late on Friday said he had been beaten up by soldiers.
The Israeli military said the hospital was being used as a command centre for Hamas military operations and those arrested were suspected militants. It said Abu Safiya had been taken for questioning as he was suspected of being a Hamas operative.
On Friday, Hamas dismissed Israel’s assertion that its fighters had operated from the hospital throughout the 15-month-old Gaza war, saying no fighters had been in the hospital. The group had not yet commented on the 240 arrests.
In its statement on Saturday, Hamas urged the U.N. and relevant international agencies to intervene urgently to protect the remaining hospitals and medical facilities in northern Gaza and supply them.
The group also called for U.N. observers to be sent to medical facilities in Gaza to refute the Israeli allegations that they were being used for military purposes.
The raid on the hospital, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of Gaza, put the last major health facility in the area out of service, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a post on X.
“WHO is appalled by yesterday’s raid. The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on North Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk,” it said.
Some patients were evacuated from Kamal Adwan to the Indonesian Hospital, which is not in service, and medics were prevented from joining them there, the Health Ministry said. Other patients and staff were taken to other medical facilities.
MUCH OF NORTHERN GAZA RAZED AND EMPTIED BY ISRAELI FORCES
The Israeli military said 350 patients and medical personnel had been evacuated prior to the Kamal Adwan operation, while another 95 had been evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital during the operation, in coordination with local health authorities.
Separately, the Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli strikes across the enclave had killed 18 Palestinians on Saturday, at least nine of them in a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes and fatalities.
In the past few months, Israeli forces have pushed people out and razed much of the area around the northern Gaza towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya.
Palestinians have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing by depopulating those areas to create a buffer zone. Israel denies it is doing this, saying it aims to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping in the areas.
The Israeli military said on Saturday it had begun operating overnight against targets in the Beit Hanoun area, adding that “troops are enabling civilians still in the area to move away for their own safety”.
It then ordered residents to leave and head towards southern parts of the Strip, saying rockets had been fired from the area.
It said two rockets fired from north Gaza, including one towards Jerusalem, had been intercepted.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas, which previously controlled Gaza, has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, according to health officials in the enclave. Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
The war was triggered by Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Title: India-Australia trade surges to USD 26 billion, reflecting successful agreement
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 08:00:09 +0000
Content: The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA) has completed two years, marking a significant milestone in bilateral trade relations and fostering mutual growth. Since its signing, the agreement has not only strengthened the economic ties between the two countries but also created new opportunities for businesses, MSMEs, and employment, reinforcing the foundation of their economic partnership.
In the two years since the agreement’s implementation, bilateral merchandise trade has more than doubled, increasing from USD 12.2 billion in 2020-21 to USD 26 billion in 2022-23. Though trade moderated slightly in 2023-24, reaching USD 24 billion, India’s exports to Australia have grown by 14%, maintaining strong momentum. As of November 2024, total merchandise trade between the two nations stood at USD 16.3 billion.
The preferential import data exchange between India and Australia, which began in 2023, highlights the successful implementation of the ECTA. The data shows impressive export utilization at 79% and import utilization at 84%, demonstrating the agreement’s effectiveness.
Key sectors such as textiles, chemicals, and agriculture have seen substantial growth under the agreement, while new exports, including gold-studded diamonds and turbojets, signal diversification in trade. Additionally, India’s imports of critical raw materials—like metalliferous ores, cotton, and wood products—have supported the country’s industries, reinforcing the mutually beneficial nature of the partnership. There is also considerable potential for growth in sectors like electronics and engineering.
Building on the success of the ECTA, the India-Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) is currently in progress. Ten formal rounds of discussions have taken place, along with inter-sessional talks. A recent stocktake visit to New Delhi from 4th to 6th December 2024 assessed the progress of the CECA and set the stage for the next steps.
Both countries are determined to continue building on the success of the ECTA and work towards their shared goal of achieving USD 100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030.

Title: At least 85 dead in fiery South Korea airliner crash, two crew rescued
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 06:23:42 +0000
Content: At least 85 people were killed when an airliner landed without wheels, veering off the runway and erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea’s Muan International Airport on Sunday, the national fire agency said.
Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 181 people on board, was attempting to land shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea’s transport ministry said.
The ministry also confirmed the casualties in the deadliest air accident involving a South Korean airline in nearly three decades.
Two crew members, a man and a woman, were rescued from the tail section of the burning plane, Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told a briefing. The fire was extinguished by 1 p.m., Lee said.
“Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of (the plane) looks almost impossible to recognise,” he said.
Authorities have switched from rescue to recovery operations and because of the force of the impact, are searching nearby areas for bodies possibly thrown from the plane, Lee added.
The two crew were being treated at hospitals with medium to severe injuries, said the head of the local public health centre.
Yonhap news agency cited a fire official as saying most of 175 passengers and six crew were presumed dead.
At least 58 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, another fire official told Reuters.
Authorities had worked to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters shortly after the crash.
Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane.
‘MY LAST WORDS’
The crash is the worst by any South Korean airline since a 1997 Korean Air crash in Guam that killed more than 200 people, according to transportation ministry data.
Investigators are looking into bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors, Lee said. Yonhap cited airport authorities as saying a bird strike may have caused the landing gear to malfunction.
A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, the News1 agency reported. The person’s final message was, “Should I say my last words?”
The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry.
The plane was a Boeing 737-800 jet operated by Jeju Air, which was seeking details of the accident, including its casualties and cause, an airline spokesperson said. The transport ministry said the plane was manufactured in 2009.
Jeju Air posted a message apologising for the accident.
Boeing said in a emailed statement, “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.”
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
All domestic and international flights at Muan airport had been cancelled, Yonhap reported.
South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, named interim leader of the country on Friday in an ongoing political crisis, arrived at the scene of the accident and said the government was putting all its resources into dealing with the crash.
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra sent condolences to the families of the dead and injured in a post on X, saying she had instructed the foreign ministry to provide assistance.
The ministry said in a statement it was in touch with the South Korean authorities.

Title: Bosnia’s “Balkan Blues” earns UNESCO recognition
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:53:50 +0000
Content: Every Friday, folk musician Enes Salman performs the Sevdalinka, an ancient form of love song from Bosnia and Herzegovina that this month was included in UNESCO’s National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
Sevdalinka, often referred to as the Balkan Blues, is a melancholic urban love song dating back to the 16th century. It is a mix of South Slavic oral poetry and the music of the Ottoman Empire.
Salman is one of a few musicians who are keeping the old tradition alive.
“I have been playing and singing Sevdalinka since I was 14,” Salman said before a recent performance.
Sevdalinka, often performed a capella or accompanied by traditional instruments like a lute, has been carried from generation to generation through performances at family gatherings.
In recent years, novel interpretations of Sevdalinka by a few younger musicians have brought it to global audiences.
One of them is Damir Imamovic, whose father and grandfather were famous Sevdalinka bards. Imamovic won awards in 2020/2021 for the European best album by world music magazines Songlines and Transglobal.
Imamovic promotes Sevdalinka internationally through his SevdahLab project, which drummed up support for the song’s inclusion on the UNESCO’s World Heritage list.
“I realised how little the public knows about the Sevdalinka genre and wanted to reveal the story behind that music,” he said.
Zanin Berbic, 28, an ethno-musicologist who plays saz, a long-necked lute used in Ottoman classical music, says that Sevdalinka tells the story of Bosnia’s history.
“Most of my days I spend either singing or playing Sevdalinka songs or reading or talking about them,” said Berbic, who works as a custodian in the music department of Bosnia’s Regional Museum in Sarajevo.
“Sevdalinka is my life.”

Title: NASA spacecraft ‘safe’ after closest-ever approach to Sun
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:35:25 +0000
Content: NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was “safe” and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the Sun by any human-made object.
The spacecraft passed 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface on Dec. 24, flying into the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth’s closest star.
The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday.
The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on Jan. 1, NASA added.
Moving at up to 430,000 mph (692,000 kph), the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (982 degrees Celsius), according to the NASA website.
“This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,” the agency added.
“We’re rewriting the textbooks on how the Sun works with the data from this probe,” Dr. Joseph Westlake, NASA’s heliophysics director told Reuters.
“This mission was theorized in the Fifties,”, he said, adding that it is an “amazing achievement to create technologies that let us delve into our understanding of how the sun operates”.
The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer towards the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.
Westlake said the team is preparing for even more flybys in the extended mission phase, hoping to capture unique events.

Title: Trump sides with Elon Musk in H-1B visa debate, says he’s always been in favor of the program
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:30:41 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday sided with key supporter and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk in a public dispute over the use of the H-1B visa, saying he fully backs the program for foreign tech workers opposed by some of his supporters.
Trump’s remarks followed a series of social media posts from Musk, the CEO of Tesla TSLA.O and SpaceX, who vowed late Friday to go to “war” to defend the visa program for foreign tech workers.
Trump, who moved to limit the visas’ use during his first presidency, told The New York Post on Saturday he was likewise in favor of the visa program.
“I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” he was quoted as saying.
Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his electric-car company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas this year. H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards.
The altercation was set off earlier this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
Musk’s tweet was directed at Trump’s supporters and immigration hard-liners who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas.
On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued “big tech oligarchs” for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization.
In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration.
Trump has promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens and severely restrict immigration.
The visa issue highlights how tech leaders like Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base.
The U.S. tech industry relies on the government’s H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens.
Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies.

Title: Delhi air quality ‘very poor’ again despite rain record
Publication Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2024 04:10:41 +0000
Content: After a slight improvement in air quality due to heavy rainfall over the past two to three days, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has once again deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ category. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall AQI in the national capital was recorded at 223 at 7 a.m. on Sunday.
A thin fog layer blanketed the city in the morning, with the minimum temperature dipping to 12 degrees Celcius.
CPCB data highlights varying AQI levels across Delhi’s regions at 7 a.m.: Okhla Phase 2 recorded AQI at 245, Alipur (202), Rohini (271), ITO (243), Ashok Vihar (251), Shadipur (222), Mundka (270), Jahangirpuri (288), Narela (191), DTU (140), R.K. Puram (252), Anand Vihar (287), Pusa (238), and Punjabi Bagh (214).
The air quality had briefly improved to the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday, because of the rains that brought temporary relief. However, the current AQI levels continue to pose health risks, especially for vulnerable populations.
Delhi received 41.2 mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, marking the highest single-day December rainfall in 101 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The Centre’s air quality monitoring panel revoked Stage III measures of the revised Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Friday, citing favourable weather conditions, including continuous rainfall in Delhi-NCR.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Saturday recommended lifting the curbs after the India Meteorological Department and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology predicted further improvement owing to favourable meteorological conditions. The Stage III restrictions were imposed on December 16.
Despite the improvement brought by the rain, the return to ‘very poor’ AQI highlights the persistent air quality challenges during winter. CPCB’s AQI scale categorises levels from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe plus’ (above 450).
Authorities urge residents to limit outdoor activities and remain cautious as winter intensifies, emphasising the need for continuous air quality monitoring and preventive measures.
