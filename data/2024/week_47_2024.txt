Title: World agrees on USD 300 billion climate aid for developing nations
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 05:18:52 +0000
Content: COP29 in Baku concluded with wealthy nations committing $300 billion annually by 2035 to help developing countries combat the escalating climate crisis. The agreement, reached after over two weeks of contentious talks, was hailed as a step forward but criticized as inadequate by vulnerable nations facing the brunt of climate disasters.
The negotiations were fraught with disagreements, boycotts, and protests. Talks nearly collapsed on Saturday when representatives of small island states and least-developed nations staged a walkout. After 30 hours of extended deliberations, a fragile consensus was reached early Sunday morning.
Simon Stiell, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, described the agreement as “an insurance policy for humanity” while acknowledging the difficult path to its finalization. “It has been a challenging journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” he said. The funding is intended to help poorer nations manage devastating climate impacts and transition to clean energy.
However, the $300 billion pledge falls significantly short of the $1.3 trillion economists estimate is required annually to address the climate crisis in developing countries. India’s representative, Chandni Raina, condemned the sum as “a paltry amount,” calling the deal “nothing more than an optical illusion.” Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege also criticized the agreement, stating it provided only “a small portion” of what vulnerable nations urgently need.
Stege further accused fossil fuel interests of undermining negotiations, claiming they “blocked progress” toward ambitious climate goals. Over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists attended COP29, outnumbering many national delegations, prompting sharp criticism from climate groups accusing them of derailing meaningful progress.
The agreement commits developed nations, including the US and European countries, to provide $300 billion annually by 2035, with aspirations to scale up to $1.3 trillion over time. Developing nations, however, pushed for a larger share of grants rather than loans to avoid debt burdens. The G77 group had initially demanded $500 billion annually, but wealthier nations deemed this financially unfeasible under current economic conditions.
Efforts to involve emerging economies like China and Saudi Arabia in mandatory contributions failed, with the agreement only “encouraging” such nations to make voluntary pledges.
Avinash Persaud, special advisor to the President of the Inter-American Development Bank, acknowledged the compromise, calling it “the boundary between what is politically achievable today and what is necessary for developing nations.”
The negotiations took place amid record-breaking climate disasters and a politically charged backdrop. Saudi Arabia, a major oil exporter, rejected the inclusion of fossil fuels in the agreement, while concerns over a potential return of Donald Trump to the US presidency loomed large, raising doubts about future global climate commitments.
Climate activists and developing nations sharply criticized the outcome. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, described COP29 as “another shady, oil-stained COP,” while Tasneem Essop of Climate Action Network accused wealthy nations of betraying the Global South. “This was meant to be the finance COP, but the Global North turned up with a plan to betray us,” she said.
Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative called the agreement “false hope,” stressing the need for greater financial commitments and accountability. “We must persist in our fight,” he said, urging a significant increase in climate financing.

Title: EAM Jaishankar to visit Italy for G7 outreach session and MED Mediterranean dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 04:36:47 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar will embark on a three-day official visit to Italy from November 24 to 26, 2024. During the visit, he will participate in key international events, including the Outreach Session of the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiuggi, where India has been invited as a guest country.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, “EAM S. Jaishankar will undertake an official visit to Italy from November 24 to 26, 2024.” He will engage in G7-related activities and hold bilateral discussions with his Italian and other international counterparts.
Jaishankar is also slated to attend the 10th edition of the MED Mediterranean Dialogue in Rome. Organized by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in collaboration with the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), the MED Dialogues aim to address security and socio-economic challenges in the Mediterranean region and promote a “positive agenda” for regional development. The conference will take place from November 25 to 27.
Adding to the itinerary, Jaishankar will inaugurate the new premises of the Indian Embassy in Rome, reflecting the growing ties between India and Italy.
This marks Jaishankar’s second visit to Italy in recent years. During his previous bilateral visit from November 2-3, 2023, he and his Italian counterpart, Antonio Tajani, reviewed the Strategic Partnership, signing agreements on Migration and Mobility Partnership and Cultural Cooperation for 2023-27.
India has been a regular participant in G7 Outreach Sessions. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the G7 Summit in Italy’s Apulia region, meeting world leaders including Pope Francis, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. These interactions underscored India’s expanding role on the global stage.

Title: India counted 640 mln votes in one day: Elon Musk on “tragic” delay in California results
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 04:03:03 +0000
Content: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has expressed dissatisfaction with the prolonged vote-counting process in California following the 2024 US presidential election. Drawing a sharp contrast, Musk praised India’s efficient electoral process, highlighting how the country counted 640 million votes in a single day.
Sharing his thoughts on X, the social media platform he owns, Musk wrote, “India counted 640 million votes in 1 day. California is still counting votes,” accompanied by a facepalm emoji to underscore his frustration. His remarks came as California, which has over 22 million registered voters, has yet to announce its final results more than two weeks after the election.
Musk’s comments were made in response to a meme posted by an X user, in which he described the delay as “tragic.” His criticism of California’s slow vote-counting process comes amid Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race. Trump, securing 295 electoral votes, defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who garnered 226 votes, earning him a second term in the White House. The President-elect has already begun assembling his foreign policy and national security teams ahead of his January 2025 inauguration.
California, known for its complex voting system and large voter base, adheres to meticulous legal protocols that contribute to the delays. According to the California Secretary of State’s website, the election night results are semi-official and primarily consist of in-person ballots cast on Election Day, early voting ballots, and vote-by-mail ballots received and processed before Election Day. However, the full vote-counting process extends into a legally mandated 30-day canvass period.
During this canvass period, county election officials are required to count every valid ballot, including provisional ballots, ballots cast by voters registering on the same day, and vote-by-mail ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days. Officials also perform a public 1 percent manual tally to verify the accuracy of automated counting systems. Furthermore, they cross-check voter signatures to ensure ballot validity. If discrepancies arise, voters are contacted and given an opportunity to verify their signatures up to two days before certification.

Title: Texas approves curriculum allowing Bible teachings in elementary schools
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:57:26 +0000
Content: The Texas State Board of Education, representing the second-largest U.S. state, approved a new curriculum on Friday permitting Bible teachings in elementary schools statewide.
The lessons, which are optional for schools to adopt, could be implemented as early as the next school year. Districts adopting the state-approved materials may receive at least $40 per student, according to local legislation cited in media reports.
Advocates argue that the Bible is a cornerstone of U.S. history and that its teachings will enhance students’ understanding of pivotal historical events, art, literature, and community. However, critics, including parents and teachers, warn that the curriculum risks alienating students from diverse faith backgrounds and could potentially violate the First Amendment.
“The materials will also allow our students to better understand the connection of history, art, community, literature, and religion to pivotal events like the signing of the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Movement, and the American Revolution,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a staunch Republican, said in support of the curriculum in a statement in May.
If implemented, Texas would be the first state to introduce Bible teachings in this manner, Xinhua news agency reported, citing an AP report and Matthew Patrick Shaw, an assistant professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University.
Texas is not alone in this approach. Several Republican-controlled states, including Oklahoma and Louisiana, have also advocated for Christian-based school requirements, such as incorporating the Bible, the Ten Commandments, and other religious doctrines into public education.
The Texas State Board of Education, composed of 11 Republicans and four Democrats, oversees the education of over five million public school students across the state.

Title: Ajit Pawar outsmarts estranged uncle Sharad Pawar
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:42:53 +0000
Content: Ajit Pawar has finally outsmarted his estranged uncle, Sharad Pawar, not only by proving that the NCP faction led by him is the ‘real’ NCP but also by winning more seats in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.
After breaking away from Sharad Pawar in July 2023 and joining the MahaYuti alliance, Ajit Pawar worked tirelessly to consolidate his faction’s presence across the state, despite personal challenges, including the loss of his wife, Sunetra Pawar, to his cousin and NCP-SP nominee Supriya Sule in the general elections from Baramati.
Ajit’s strategic outreach, particularly his efforts to expand the party’s appeal, played a crucial role in his faction’s success. His promotion of the Ladki Bahin Yojana, aimed at empowering women voters, struck a chord. He pledged to not only continue the scheme but also enhance its financial assistance if MahaYuti returned to power. This promise won him overwhelming support from women voters.
Of the 59 seats contested by Ajit Pawar’s faction, they faced the Sharad Pawar group in 40 constituencies. Ajit’s faction emerged victorious in 30 of these direct contests, while the remaining seats were claimed by the NCP-SP alliance, BJP, and an independent candidate.
Ajit’s victory in the Baramati Assembly seat against Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew, Yugendra Pawar, was particularly symbolic. Despite Sharad’s focused efforts on this constituency, Ajit triumphed, further solidifying his dominance.
Notable wins for Ajit’s faction include key constituencies such as Yeola, Ambegaon, Dindori, Kagal, Parli, and Udgir, where his candidates defeated NCP-SP nominees. Prominent leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal, Dilip Walse-Patil, Hasan Mushrif, and Dhananjay Munde retained their strongholds.
However, there were notable defeats as well. NCP nominees Sunil Tingre (Vadgaon Sheri), Yogesh Kshirsagar (Beed), and Nishikant Patil (Islampur) lost to NCP-SP rivals. Independent candidates and BJP nominees also secured wins in some key constituencies.
This election marks a turning point for Ajit Pawar, as his faction not only established itself as a dominant force within the NCP but also increased his bargaining power with MahaYuti allies. Ajit has vowed to further strengthen his control in the cooperative sector and prepare for upcoming local and civic elections, setting the stage for a prolonged battle against Sharad Pawar.

PM Modi is scheduled to address the gathering at approximately 5:30 p.m. during the event.
Odisha Parba is the flagship event of Odia Samaj, a Delhi-based trust dedicated to preserving and promoting Odia heritage, according to a statement.
“This year, Odisha Parba is being held from November 22 to 24, continuing its tradition of showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Odisha.

Title: BJP’s rise as Maharashtra’s main political pole: The electoral triumph
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 16:43:57 +0000
Content: With the current assembly election outcome in Maharashtra, the BJP has cemented its position as the main political pole of the state. Going by the trends and results available so far, based on the Election Commission of India dataset, the party has won 125 assembly seats and is leading on 7. That means a 132-seat count or 46% seat share in a 288-member state assembly.

The BJP-led alliance Mahayuti is expected to win 234 seats, crossing comfortably the majority mark of 145 and thus retaining the government. Alliance partner and Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena has won 55 seats and is leading on two more, while Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar-led NCP has got 41 seats. Other smaller parties in the alliance have won four seats. The combined vote share of the three main parties comes out to be 48.16%. With other smaller parties of the alliance, the Mahayuti is expected to cross the 50% vote share mark.
THE MAHARASHTRA JOURNEY 
The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the state in the 2014 assembly election, maintained it in 2019, and looks to better its performance this time. In 2014, the party won 122 assembly seats with a strike rate of 47%. With the counting trends available so far, the party looks to settle down with 132 seats, ten more than its 2014 tally, and a stupendous strike rate of 88.59%. This means the BJP is winning almost nine of every ten contested seats.

The party started its journey in Maharashtra in 1980, the year of its formation as a political party in India. That year, it won 14 seats with a 9.38% vote share. Since then, the party has seen consistent electoral progress in the state. It won 16 seats in the 1985 assembly election, which increased to 42 in 1990, with the BJP forming an alliance with the Bal Thackeray-led Shiv Sena in 1989.
The party won 65 seats in the 1995 assembly election when the BJP-Shiv Sena combine formed the government in the state. The party’s seat tally remained in the range of 50 seats per election until 2009, with the Congress-NCP coalition government ruling the state from 1999 to 2014.

The BJP’s increasing footprint can be seen in its growing vote share in the state. It shows a steady increase election after election, from sub-10% levels to over 25% vote share now.
2014: THE NARENDRA MODI FACTOR AND THE CENTURY MARK
The electoral dominance created by the “Modi Wave,” with India’s current Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the campaign that year, led to unprecedented success for the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. For the first time since 1984, a single party achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha election. The Maharashtra assembly election later the same year became another success story.
No political party had touched the 100-seat mark in Maharashtra since the 1990 state assembly election. The BJP, riding the Narendra Modi wave, shattered that trend, winning 122 seats and emerging as the largest party in the state.
Since then, the party has won over 100 seats in each assembly election: it won 105 seats in 2019 and is winning or leading in 132 seats in the 2024 election so far. The party’s continued success in Maharashtra is yet another testimony to the PM Narendra Modi factor in electoral politics in the country.
TWICE AS LARGE AS OTHER PARTIES IN THE STATE
The electoral performance of the BJP has made it almost twice as large as other parties in the state, be it its allies like the Shiv Sena or the NCP, or rivals like the Congress, the Shiv Sena (UBT), or the NCP (SP), a trend continuing since the 2014 assembly election.

Its vote share was 8 to 10% higher than other political parties in the last two assembly polls. This year, it is over 13% higher than its ally, the Shiv Sena, so far. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly election, the average vote share of the other three large parties in the state, other than the BJP (the Congress, the Shiv Sena, and the NCP), was 16.33% against the BJP’s 25.75%.
In 2014, it was 18.18% against the BJP’s 28.81%. The current assembly election has seen their average vote share drop to 15%. Other than the BJP, the state has four other main political parties contesting this time: Shiv Sena and Shiv Sena (UBT), and NCP and NCP (SP). Their average vote share is 11% against the BJP’s 26%.
When it comes to the number of seats, the BJP has performed spectacularly. Going by the trends available so far for the current election, the party has gained 75 more seats than the second-largest party in the state, or 18 seats more than double the number of seats of Shiv Sena, its alliance partner. In the 2019 and 2014 assembly elections, the BJP’s seat count was almost double what other parties got.

Title: India’s bilateral trade with ASEAN sees 5.2% growth at $73 billion in April-Oct
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 16:02:26 +0000
Content: India’s bilateral trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grew by 5.2% to reach $73 billion during the April-October period of this fiscal year, the government informed on Saturday.
ASEAN is one of India’s major trade partners, accounting for about 11% of India’s global trade. Bilateral trade in FY2023-24 was valued at $121 billion, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
The sixth ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) Joint Committee meeting and related discussions on the review of the AITIGA took place from November 15-22 in New Delhi.
Leaders and delegates from all 10 ASEAN countries—Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam—participated in the meeting.
During their visit, ASEAN delegates also attended bilateral meetings with representatives from Thailand and Indonesia to discuss trade issues between the countries.
The Indian and ASEAN chief negotiators also held a separate meeting to discuss key issues and outline a way forward.
“The review of AITIGA will be a step forward in enhancing trade with the ASEAN region in a sustainable manner. The next meeting of the AITIGA Joint Committee is scheduled for February 2025 in Jakarta, Indonesia,” the Ministry said in a statement.
The AITIGA Joint Committee consists of eight sub-committees addressing areas such as market access, rules of origin, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, standards and technical regulations, customs procedures, economic and technical cooperation, trade remedies, and legal and institutional provisions.
SPS measures are biosecurity protocols designed to protect human, animal, and plant life or health from pests, diseases, and contaminants in food and feed.

Title: Pakistan: 18 killed, 30 injured in sectarian bloodshed after massacre of 45 shia muslims
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 15:41:36 +0000
Content: At least 18 people have been killed and over 30 others injured in armed clashes between two groups in Pakistan’s northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, officials said on Saturday.
The clashes erupted in Kurram district of the province, where armed men killed dozens of people and torched shops, houses, and government property, according to official sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The sources added that the latest violence in Kurram district was linked to Thursday’s attack, in which unidentified gunmen ambushed a convoy of passenger coaches carrying Shia Muslims, killing 45 people and injuring at least 16 others.
In response to the ongoing violence, the local administration has imposed a curfew in the area, closed educational institutions and businesses, and suspended cellular services.
Kurram Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud told the media that efforts were being made to restore peace in the area, stating that an emergency meeting had been held to prevent further violence, as reported by Xinhua news agency.
Kurram district has a history of sectarian violence. In September, at least 60 people from both sects were killed in separate incidents, according to Provincial Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
The situation had remained extremely tense in the region since Thursday as the Iran-backed Zainebiyoun Brigade vowed to avenge the killing of 45 Shia Muslims by unidentified gunmen.
The Shia-dominated Parachinar area, which has seen bloody confrontational clashes with the surrounding areas of the Sunni majority in the past, saw police vehicles and security checkpoints being set ablaze as roads were blocked with stones and burning tires.
Protesters in Parachinar also demanded the immediate opening of the border with Afghanistan amid a worsening situation, a shortage of food, medicines, fuel, and oxygen.
A Shia organization and political party, Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen (MWM), has put forward demands to the government, including the activation of the Parachinar airport due to unsafe roads and the establishment of a free shuttle service between Parachinar and Peshawar via PIA or Air Force planes.
MWM has also called for the replacement of federal forces with the local Kurram militia.
The protesters have warned that if their demands are ignored by the provincial and federal governments, they will be forced to seek international help from human rights organizations and even the United Nations.

Title: Floor leaders of political parties meet ahead of Parliament winter session

Content: Ahead of the upcoming Winter session of Parliament, Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, convened a meeting with the floor leaders of political parties on Sunday morning. The all-party meeting, which began at 11 am, was held in the Main Committee Room at Parliament House Annexe in the national capital and was presided over by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Rijiju had previously announced the meeting, scheduled for today, on November 19. Key leaders present at the meeting included Congress MPs Jairam Ramesh, Pramod Tiwari, K. Suresh, along with JD(U) MP Upendra Kushwaha. Also in attendance were PV Midhun Reddy and V Vijaysai Reddy from YSRCP, Sasmit Patra from BJD, Vaiko from MDMK, Ramgopal Yadav from SP, and Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu from TDP, among others.
According to sources, the Congress party is expected to raise key issues such as the ongoing situation in Manipur, concerns over the Adani group, and border security at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
The Winter session of Parliament will begin on November 25 and continue until December 20. One of the primary legislative goals for the session is the passage of the Waqf Amendment Bill, which is currently under review by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. The government is also likely to introduce the ‘One Nation, One Election’ bill during the session, a proposal that has been a point of contention.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a strong advocate for the ‘One Nation, One Election’ initiative, aiming to synchronize Lok Sabha and state assembly elections to improve governance and resource efficiency. He recently emphasized that the move would strengthen India’s democracy and contribute to the country’s development goals.
However, Congress has expressed opposition to the plan, insisting that the Prime Minister must build consensus across all parties in Parliament before moving forward with the proposal.
Meanwhile, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Waqf Amendment Bill, which has been meeting with various stakeholders across states, is expected to submit its report in the first week of the session.
The Winter session will also observe a break on November 26, 2024, to commemorate “Constitution Day,” with no sittings of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.

Title: Survey team at Shahi Jama Masjid in UP’s Sambhal targeted by stone-pelters; police use tear gas to restore order
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:46:27 +0000
Content: A survey team conducting an inspection of the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal district was met with stone pelting from unidentified “anti-social elements” on Sunday morning. The incident prompted a heavy police response, with tear gas deployed to control the escalating situation, authorities said.
According to Director General of Police (DGP) Uttar Pradesh, Prashant Kumar, the situation has since been brought under control. “The survey is being conducted in Sambhal under court orders. Some anti-social elements threw stones. Police and senior officials are on the ground, and the situation is under control. We will identify the stone pelters and take appropriate legal action,” he said.
The survey forms part of a legal process initiated following a petition by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain, who has raised claims that the Shahi Jama Masjid was originally a temple. A similar survey had taken place on November 19, under the supervision of local police and the mosque’s management committee.

Title: M-Pox remains public health emergency: WHO
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:08:10 +0000
Content: The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed that M-Pox will continue to be classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) amid a sharp rise in cases and the virus’s expanding geographic spread.
The high-alert status, initially declared in August, was extended following a meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee. The decision reflects the escalating concerns over the outbreak, particularly the spread of the clade Ib variant, which has moved beyond its origin in the Democratic Republic of Congo to affect neighboring African nations, Europe, and Asia.
“Rising case numbers, the continuing geographic spread, and the need for a cohesive response have made it essential to maintain this emergency status,” the WHO said in its statement.
The clade Ib variant has been confirmed in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and India, emphasizing the global nature of the outbreak. M-Pox, a viral disease spread through close contact, typically causes flu-like symptoms and lesions. While often mild, it can be fatal, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare. This year alone, over 46,000 suspected cases have been reported in Africa, with more than 1,000 suspected deaths, most of them in Congo.
The WHO’s renewed emergency declaration highlights the threat posed by the clade Ib variant and builds on earlier alerts issued during the 2022-2023 outbreak involving a separate strain.
In response to the growing crisis, the WHO has expanded vaccine authorizations. Bavarian Nordic’s M-Pox vaccine received approval earlier this year, and Japan’s KM Biologics’ vaccine was added to the emergency-use list in September. However, the organization has faced criticism for delays in vaccine distribution. WHO officials defended their efforts, emphasizing that vaccination remains central to combating the outbreak.
“The emergency status underscores the urgency to mount a unified global response,” a WHO spokesperson said. The organization urged countries and health partners to intensify vaccination campaigns and boost public awareness to curb the virus’s spread.

The discussions emphasized the critical role of resilient infrastructure in mitigating risks and driving sustainable development. CDRI’s initiatives, such as the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), were spotlighted as instrumental in supporting nations with technical expertise and tools for resilience building.
India also co-hosted the LeadIT Member Meet with Sweden, focusing on advancing industrial decarbonization. Key challenges and opportunities were discussed, including CO2 capture and hydrogen-based solutions, with industry leaders such as Tata Motors and SAIL emphasizing the importance of collaboration for low-carbon transitions. The India-Sweden Industry Transition Partnership (ITP) side event further reviewed progress ahead of CoP30, highlighting its links with the Brazil-UK Industry Decarbonisation initiative.
Another critical event addressed the unique vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The session underlined the need to unlock adaptation finance and strengthen disaster-resilient infrastructure. The IRIS initiative was presented as a pathway for SIDS to access finance and technical support for sustainable development.
India’s leadership in promoting solar energy for the Global South was a major highlight, with sessions co-organized by the International Solar Alliance (ISA). These discussions explored the transformative role of solar energy in bridging developmental gaps, ensuring energy security, and mitigating emissions. The need for a 20-fold increase in solar adoption by 2050 was emphasized as a key goal.
Women-led climate action was also showcased during an event that highlighted innovative models of clean energy solutions at the grassroots level. This session underscored the importance of integrating gender-balanced approaches in climate policies and emphasized the role of women in enhancing community adaptive capacities.
The CoP29 concluded with the LeadIT Summit, marking five years of the Leadership Group for Industry Transition. Representatives from various nations and industries reaffirmed their commitment to decarbonizing heavy industries, aligning with the Paris Agreement.

Title: World agrees on USD 300 billion climate aid for developing nations
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 05:18:52 +0000
Content: COP29 in Baku concluded with wealthy nations committing $300 billion annually by 2035 to help developing countries combat the escalating climate crisis. The agreement, reached after over two weeks of contentious talks, was hailed as a step forward but criticized as inadequate by vulnerable nations facing the brunt of climate disasters.
The negotiations were fraught with disagreements, boycotts, and protests. Talks nearly collapsed on Saturday when representatives of small island states and least-developed nations staged a walkout. After 30 hours of extended deliberations, a fragile consensus was reached early Sunday morning.
Simon Stiell, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, described the agreement as “an insurance policy for humanity” while acknowledging the difficult path to its finalization. “It has been a challenging journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” he said. The funding is intended to help poorer nations manage devastating climate impacts and transition to clean energy.
However, the $300 billion pledge falls significantly short of the $1.3 trillion economists estimate is required annually to address the climate crisis in developing countries. India’s representative, Chandni Raina, condemned the sum as “a paltry amount,” calling the deal “nothing more than an optical illusion.” Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege also criticized the agreement, stating it provided only “a small portion” of what vulnerable nations urgently need.
Stege further accused fossil fuel interests of undermining negotiations, claiming they “blocked progress” toward ambitious climate goals. Over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists attended COP29, outnumbering many national delegations, prompting sharp criticism from climate groups accusing them of derailing meaningful progress.
The agreement commits developed nations, including the US and European countries, to provide $300 billion annually by 2035, with aspirations to scale up to $1.3 trillion over time. Developing nations, however, pushed for a larger share of grants rather than loans to avoid debt burdens. The G77 group had initially demanded $500 billion annually, but wealthier nations deemed this financially unfeasible under current economic conditions.
Efforts to involve emerging economies like China and Saudi Arabia in mandatory contributions failed, with the agreement only “encouraging” such nations to make voluntary pledges.
Avinash Persaud, special advisor to the President of the Inter-American Development Bank, acknowledged the compromise, calling it “the boundary between what is politically achievable today and what is necessary for developing nations.”
The negotiations took place amid record-breaking climate disasters and a politically charged backdrop. Saudi Arabia, a major oil exporter, rejected the inclusion of fossil fuels in the agreement, while concerns over a potential return of Donald Trump to the US presidency loomed large, raising doubts about future global climate commitments.
Climate activists and developing nations sharply criticized the outcome. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, described COP29 as “another shady, oil-stained COP,” while Tasneem Essop of Climate Action Network accused wealthy nations of betraying the Global South. “This was meant to be the finance COP, but the Global North turned up with a plan to betray us,” she said.
Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative called the agreement “false hope,” stressing the need for greater financial commitments and accountability. “We must persist in our fight,” he said, urging a significant increase in climate financing.

Title: EAM Jaishankar to visit Italy for G7 outreach session and MED Mediterranean dialogue
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 04:36:47 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar will embark on a three-day official visit to Italy from November 24 to 26, 2024. During the visit, he will participate in key international events, including the Outreach Session of the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiuggi, where India has been invited as a guest country.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, “EAM S. Jaishankar will undertake an official visit to Italy from November 24 to 26, 2024.” He will engage in G7-related activities and hold bilateral discussions with his Italian and other international counterparts.
Jaishankar is also slated to attend the 10th edition of the MED Mediterranean Dialogue in Rome. Organized by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in collaboration with the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), the MED Dialogues aim to address security and socio-economic challenges in the Mediterranean region and promote a “positive agenda” for regional development. The conference will take place from November 25 to 27.
Adding to the itinerary, Jaishankar will inaugurate the new premises of the Indian Embassy in Rome, reflecting the growing ties between India and Italy.
This marks Jaishankar’s second visit to Italy in recent years. During his previous bilateral visit from November 2-3, 2023, he and his Italian counterpart, Antonio Tajani, reviewed the Strategic Partnership, signing agreements on Migration and Mobility Partnership and Cultural Cooperation for 2023-27.
India has been a regular participant in G7 Outreach Sessions. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the G7 Summit in Italy’s Apulia region, meeting world leaders including Pope Francis, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. These interactions underscored India’s expanding role on the global stage.

Title: India counted 640 mln votes in one day: Elon Musk on “tragic” delay in California results
Publication Date: Sun, 24 Nov 2024 04:03:03 +0000
Content: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has expressed dissatisfaction with the prolonged vote-counting process in California following the 2024 US presidential election. Drawing a sharp contrast, Musk praised India’s efficient electoral process, highlighting how the country counted 640 million votes in a single day.
Sharing his thoughts on X, the social media platform he owns, Musk wrote, “India counted 640 million votes in 1 day. California is still counting votes,” accompanied by a facepalm emoji to underscore his frustration. His remarks came as California, which has over 22 million registered voters, has yet to announce its final results more than two weeks after the election.
Musk’s comments were made in response to a meme posted by an X user, in which he described the delay as “tragic.” His criticism of California’s slow vote-counting process comes amid Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race. Trump, securing 295 electoral votes, defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who garnered 226 votes, earning him a second term in the White House. The President-elect has already begun assembling his foreign policy and national security teams ahead of his January 2025 inauguration.
California, known for its complex voting system and large voter base, adheres to meticulous legal protocols that contribute to the delays. According to the California Secretary of State’s website, the election night results are semi-official and primarily consist of in-person ballots cast on Election Day, early voting ballots, and vote-by-mail ballots received and processed before Election Day. However, the full vote-counting process extends into a legally mandated 30-day canvass period.
During this canvass period, county election officials are required to count every valid ballot, including provisional ballots, ballots cast by voters registering on the same day, and vote-by-mail ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days. Officials also perform a public 1 percent manual tally to verify the accuracy of automated counting systems. Furthermore, they cross-check voter signatures to ensure ballot validity. If discrepancies arise, voters are contacted and given an opportunity to verify their signatures up to two days before certification.

Title: Texas approves curriculum allowing Bible teachings in elementary schools
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:57:26 +0000
Content: The Texas State Board of Education, representing the second-largest U.S. state, approved a new curriculum on Friday permitting Bible teachings in elementary schools statewide.
The lessons, which are optional for schools to adopt, could be implemented as early as the next school year. Districts adopting the state-approved materials may receive at least $40 per student, according to local legislation cited in media reports.
Advocates argue that the Bible is a cornerstone of U.S. history and that its teachings will enhance students’ understanding of pivotal historical events, art, literature, and community. However, critics, including parents and teachers, warn that the curriculum risks alienating students from diverse faith backgrounds and could potentially violate the First Amendment.
“The materials will also allow our students to better understand the connection of history, art, community, literature, and religion to pivotal events like the signing of the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Movement, and the American Revolution,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a staunch Republican, said in support of the curriculum in a statement in May.
If implemented, Texas would be the first state to introduce Bible teachings in this manner, Xinhua news agency reported, citing an AP report and Matthew Patrick Shaw, an assistant professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University.
Texas is not alone in this approach. Several Republican-controlled states, including Oklahoma and Louisiana, have also advocated for Christian-based school requirements, such as incorporating the Bible, the Ten Commandments, and other religious doctrines into public education.
The Texas State Board of Education, composed of 11 Republicans and four Democrats, oversees the education of over five million public school students across the state.

Title: Ajit Pawar outsmarts estranged uncle Sharad Pawar
Publication Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2024 20:42:53 +0000
Content: Ajit Pawar has finally outsmarted his estranged uncle, Sharad Pawar, not only by proving that the NCP faction led by him is the ‘real’ NCP but also by winning more seats in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.
After breaking away from Sharad Pawar in July 2023 and joining the MahaYuti alliance, Ajit Pawar worked tirelessly to consolidate his faction’s presence across the state, despite personal challenges, including the loss of his wife, Sunetra Pawar, to his cousin and NCP-SP nominee Supriya Sule in the general elections from Baramati.
Ajit’s strategic outreach, particularly his efforts to expand the party’s appeal, played a crucial role in his faction’s success. His promotion of the Ladki Bahin Yojana, aimed at empowering women voters, struck a chord. He pledged to not only continue the scheme but also enhance its financial assistance if MahaYuti returned to power. This promise won him overwhelming support from women voters.
Of the 59 seats contested by Ajit Pawar’s faction, they faced the Sharad Pawar group in 40 constituencies. Ajit’s faction emerged victorious in 30 of these direct contests, while the remaining seats were claimed by the NCP-SP alliance, BJP, and an independent candidate.
Ajit’s victory in the Baramati Assembly seat against Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew, Yugendra Pawar, was particularly symbolic. Despite Sharad’s focused efforts on this constituency, Ajit triumphed, further solidifying his dominance.
Notable wins for Ajit’s faction include key constituencies such as Yeola, Ambegaon, Dindori, Kagal, Parli, and Udgir, where his candidates defeated NCP-SP nominees. Prominent leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal, Dilip Walse-Patil, Hasan Mushrif, and Dhananjay Munde retained their strongholds.
However, there were notable defeats as well. NCP nominees Sunil Tingre (Vadgaon Sheri), Yogesh Kshirsagar (Beed), and Nishikant Patil (Islampur) lost to NCP-SP rivals. Independent candidates and BJP nominees also secured wins in some key constituencies.
This election marks a turning point for Ajit Pawar, as his faction not only established itself as a dominant force within the NCP but also increased his bargaining power with MahaYuti allies. Ajit has vowed to further strengthen his control in the cooperative sector and prepare for upcoming local and civic elections, setting the stage for a prolonged battle against Sharad Pawar.
